This film taught me a lot about human nature, and about having such ardent hope amid such dire conditions. The protagonist/narrator Cassandra played excellently by Ramola Garai turns in a tour-de-force performance as a sometime gawky & awkward teen who despite her naivet√© is so wise behind her years when dealing with people and affairs of the heart.<br /><br />The movie made me laugh, cry and gave me hope that no matter how bad things can get, life will somehow work itself out if you have faith, a good head on your shoulders and believe in those close to you.<br /><br />I'm glad I recorded this on TiVo. This is one movie I don't think I'll ever delete. I highly recommend this movie for its simple lessons and its picturesque scenery.
