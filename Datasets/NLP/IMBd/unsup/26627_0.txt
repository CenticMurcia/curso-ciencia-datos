Ignore the fact that Cher is a leading character, because people either love or hate her as an actress - there's almost no gray area. She works in her role. Deal with it.<br /><br />No matter how much you might want to dislike the movie or thinks it's ridiculous, you can't. It hits right to the soul and tugs at every heart string and tear duct. I cannot listen to the last line of the movie without submitting to a fit of sobs. Never has a closing line captured the emotion of a completely movie as well as the last line of this movie:<br /><br />"Things I dig....the sun shining on my face....things that are a drag....the sun shining on my face."<br /><br />Crap, I'm getting choked up again.
