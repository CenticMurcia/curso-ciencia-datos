I love Isabelle Huppert, she is fearless and great, but my god, what a disaster, not an interesting one, but simply embarrassing. There have been parodies about bad french sex movies for years based on decades of really bad french sex movies. So not sure what the point of this movie is/was, it sure wasn't funny so strike the parody and it wasn't in the least interesting, or even very shocking. The mother's death at the end was a bore, left me cold, and the boy trying to masturbate in front of her mother's corpse was already done very badly by Philipp Roth in Sabbath's Theater. I suppose the deep story here is that if your parents are incredibly warped, indolent and irresponsible, weird things will happen. The US death row is filled with people who were destroyed by their upbringing. These stories have potential, not the vapid musings and bored actions of wealthy euro-trash who do not have enough sense not to s**t where they eat.
