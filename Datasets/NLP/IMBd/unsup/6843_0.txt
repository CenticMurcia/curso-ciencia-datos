The plot is totally SUPER BOGUS. The action is so awful you'll sleep throuhg it. It's G.I. JOE, fire a 100 shots and still no one's hit. The acting is not even plastic, it's hysterical and pathetic.<br /><br />The cast made me watch it. BUT 1)Eric Roberts's is a career wasted and the film does'nt add much to it. It even makes you wanna swear you won't watch his movie ever again.<br /><br />2)ICE T falls asleep in the first half hour and does'nt get up. (Maybe he ran away.)<br /><br />3)Micheal Madsen looks like he shot for the movie while going for a walk and did it just for the goggles.<br /><br />Rest of the crew is the hotel staff 9I'm not kidding.)<br /><br />Save yourselves from it.<br /><br />I COULD'NT.
