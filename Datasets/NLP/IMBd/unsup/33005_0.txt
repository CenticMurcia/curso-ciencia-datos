"Impact" starts off boldly with a voice-over definition from the dictionary of the word "impact"; as two lives colliding for good or for evil. While this may seem like a cheesy introduction to the film, I was willing to give it a shot.<br /><br />The first half of the film is feverish, and weaves us into a plot involving a wife who sets up her husband to get murder so she can elope with her lover. The film adequately succeeds in laying the groundwork for a promising and clever finish (after a simple plot twist in the middle of the film).<br /><br />Sadly, any energy or suspense in the first half of the film dissolves into a slow-paced, lethargic love story that distracts greatly from livelier main plot. By the end, the director is left juggling too many themes and I simply became disinterested.<br /><br />Also, there were several nagging questions left to be answered as one watched the film (one of the large ones being how could the police not explore all motives or situations surrounding the murder? how come no one reads newspapers in small towns?).<br /><br />"Impact" hardly delivers the punch it promises and deflates slowly but surely.
