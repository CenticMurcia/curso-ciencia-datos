Very bad script, production, direction, and acting. Hillary Swank was the only reason I rented this, she is actually not bad but I feel sorry for her to be in this obviously released direct-to-video piece of raw garbage. It is like a bad 80s flick so imagine my surprise to discover it was actually made in the mid- to late-90s.<br /><br />All of the characters were unrealistic, one-dimensional, and weakly developed. This was John Asher's debut as a director when his previous most memorable role was as Gary on the "Weird Science" TV series. He should not have strayed from in front of the camera. I wish someone would put warning labels on movies like this so that you do not waste your money or more importantly--your time.
