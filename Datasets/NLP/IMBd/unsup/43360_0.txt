I find it hard to understand how viewers could be positive about this film, as I found it appalling. Film-makers should give up on Phillip Roth adaptations unless they can give them the necessary energy; and biting, incisive and vulgar insights that are so much a part of Roth's work. In stead in this film, like most of the other Roth adaptations, we get pretentious literary performances that mostly bore and frustrate.<br /><br />I couldn't even make it through to the end, and I have a bookshelf of Phillip Roth books - and rate him as my favorite living American author. <br /><br />Ultimately, I found this film a big disappointment and suggest you read the book rather than endure the film.
