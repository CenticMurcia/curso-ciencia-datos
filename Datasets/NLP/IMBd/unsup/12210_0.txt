Maybe it was the beautifully redone Beatles songs, or the fact that the film had to do with adoption (which I myself am adopted) Or maybe it had to do with the fact that I could relate to Michelle Pfeiffer's character so much---drinking diet drinks, using that voice activated cell phone or driving and LIVING too fast, but the film hit me...and hit me hard.<br /><br />I think Sam had a very valuable lesson to teach Michelle Pfeiffer's character Rita...and teach us all.<br /><br />All you DO need is love. <br /><br />Whose child had the better existence? Sam's daughter? Or his lawyer Rita's son?<br /><br />I think I'd rather be with a retarded father than parents who were never home and didn't give a sh^#t.<br /><br />This movie made me take a hard look at how I act and live and how maybe if we just have a little more love for ourselves and others that perhaps things will be better.....<br /><br />Great film , score, soundtrack, actors, words, script.<br /><br />I don't care what the critics say or this bs about it being so easy to play a retarded man with "limited emotions"<br /><br />Since when do mentally handicapped people have limited EMOTIONS?<br /><br />I can't believe a leading critic said that.<br /><br />Whatever.<br /><br />He's the one with the limited emotions.<br /><br />I am Sam slightly changed my life and I will never see things quite the same again ;))<br /><br />I give this film a 10 ...something I don't do too often.<br /><br />
