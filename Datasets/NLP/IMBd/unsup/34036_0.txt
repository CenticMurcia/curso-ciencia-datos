Based on a book by Bret Easton Ellis, this film deals with exactly what one word expect from Ellis: the 'decadent' 1980's. We follow various members of the (mostly) upper-crest socialite establishment as they engage in (unprotected) sex, drugs & rock and roll. On the other side of the spectrum is Peter, a low-life hit-man (Mickey Rourke, fresh from his award winning turn in "The Wrestler")<br /><br />The biggest flaw is the film's trying (in vain) to make the movie adaptation (somewhat) cohesive when the book was anything but. It doesn't help matters that none of the characters are sympathetic or even relatable in any way, shape or form. They're are pretty much empty vessels, which I guess is the point, but the film just comes off as a bland retread of similarly narcissistic vacant slice-of-(decedent)life fare. It's all style and no real substance to speak of (except of those taken by the various characters obviously)<br /><br />Eye Candy: Amber Heard & Valentina Garcia bothshow T&A (Amber multiple times); an extra shows T&A and a quick shot of muff <br /><br />Eye Candy for the ladies:Austin Nichols bares his bottom; Mel Raido shows his ass & goes full frontal as does Jon Foster; and a couple extras show ass<br /><br />My Grade: D<br /><br />DVD Extras: Director & cast commentary; 'Human Intersections: Making the Informers' featurette; an ad for Blu-Ray; and trailers for Assassination of a High School President, Dark Country, Blood and Bone, Fire flies in the Garden, The Maiden Heist, Fragments, Dark Streets, The Human Contract, What Goes Up, Tyson, Rudo Y Cursi, Adoration, and Season Sets for Rescue Me & The Shield
