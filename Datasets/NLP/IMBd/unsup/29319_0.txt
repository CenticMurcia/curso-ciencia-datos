This film makes us realize what a powerful genre is the western. It is so powerful that it left its American roots and became universal. I understand why the actors in this movie speak English, you can't accept any other language. Even the Leones and Corbuccis are dubbed in English. It comes to my mind a famous Brazilian composer who sings about playing cowboys as a child, and his horse would only speak English. There are references in the film about TGTBTU, Django, Fistful, Once Upon a Time in the West,My Darling Clementine(Shakespeare) but the one that touched me the most was about "Duel in the Sun", a film that tends to be neglected nowadays. Apparently making fun of the westerns Sukiyaki has a lot of tragedy as it tells the story of the rival clans, in a time and place where there is not much value in human life. There are great tragic comic scenes like when a man tries to catch a sword that is going through his head, or when an enormous hole is made on a man. Tarantino is very funny with his Japanese fake accent. The shootouts are absolutely great.
