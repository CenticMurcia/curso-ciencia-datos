I saw this movie after running into the director at a bar during a film festival (and going to a strip club with him). I had no idea what I was in for. This movie raises all the important life questions you will ever have, such as "Will my friends kill for me?"; "How do I get rid of a boss I hate?"; "How do I get the girl I like?" and "Is it ethical to lie to my professor to get a better mark?" I would recommend contacting the director about buying DVDs as I don't know that they are in stores. I have a copy but I can't loan it to you as I lose too many DVDs that way. <br /><br />Check out http://www.fivecentproductions.com/ for more info.
