I was morbidly fascinated by this film and only watched it to the end to see how much worse it could get. By the culmination, I could definitely understand why the parents of rich kids are wary of having their erstwhile whelps discuss their wealth. It's probably got a lot to do with not wanting anyone to see what sleeze they've raised. Overwhelmingly unattractive, obnoxious, and virtually illiterate (because why go to class when there are handbags to be bought and hangovers to be overcome), the majority of these kids have absolutely NOTHING going for them but their riches. I'm not surprised to hear that they worry about losing their money- they know that they've cultivated little else of worth in their pitiable existences.<br /><br />P.S. It's also mildly intriguing to watch them and know that richness does not protect you from acne, bizarre speech impediments, herpes or yellow tooth syndrome but it does seem to give one the impression that one is immensely attractive and shaggable despite these disgusting attributes.
