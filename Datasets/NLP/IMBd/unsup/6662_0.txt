The director is a stupid nerd who wants to make art films so he can meet cool chick , there are so many good movies to watch please stay away from this garbage, the only good thing is the blow job scene but any porn film had a better one , this guy just show his racism against Indian Mexican people like all the Rich people from third world countries does the bad guy is Indian and the victim is white , stupid movie I want my money back. I m so sad to see film footage waist in a horrible movie like batalla en el cielo I don't understand how people can see what this movie is about , is racism, and is also very poor make. I just see anything good about this stupid movie.
