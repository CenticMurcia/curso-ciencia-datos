This is definitely one of the scariest movies ever and also belongs to my top ten horror films! However, not everybody seems to like this movie as much as I do.<br /><br />Candyman is almost flawless. Among all the horror movie villains Candyman is one of the most frightening and fascinating. Tony Todd does a terrific job. There is no point in the film where Candyman gets ridiculous. Luckily there were no scream-until-even-the-killer-himself-is-deaf teens. Instead we get Virginia Madsen who adds a psychological component to her role.<br /><br />The plot is very solid too. The idea of a killer coming when you call him is very interesting because it is different from what we have seen before. Although the story of Candyman is somewhat surreal there is a solid motive for what he is doing. That's a point that many other films of the genre lack.<br /><br />Another element that adds to the very moody atmosphere is the directing. There are some amazingly exciting shots, especially the aerial views of Chicago which are unique. The mood makes the film somehow disturbing and fascinating at the same time and that's why there isn't any other film like this one. There are some pretty gory scenes but the brutality here is never used to entertain. The soundtrack which is one of the best in horror films also helps to create the atmosphere mentioned above.<br /><br />Candyman gets a lot of bad reviews although it is one of the best in the genre. Give it a try!<br /><br />My rating: 9/10
