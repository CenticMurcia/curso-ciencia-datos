I really liked the performances by the actors who portrayed Charles and Camilla, & also the actress they chose to portray Diana was very convincing in that role as well, so casting was very good. I don't know how accurate the film was, as I don't keep up with celebrity gossip and haven't read any of the biographies on Prince Charles or the Charles/Diana/Camilla situation, but I enjoyed this film. I look forward to seeing more films featuring actor Lawrence Fox. I recognized him as the actor who portrayed a German pilot in the BBC series "Island at War." He really humanizes Prince Charles in this film, I think overall it is a very flattering portrayal, although I don't really like how he and Camilla took advantage of Diana's innocence and youth, they really ruined her life. I gave the film 8 stars instead of 10, because I generally don't like these tell-all types of stories based on celebrity dirty laundry, but it was a good film with good acting; enjoyable overall.
