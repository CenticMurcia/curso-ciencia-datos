***SPOILERS*** You at first don't exactly know what your watching in "the Last of the Dogmen" it that it has nothing at all to do with the 19th century American West but the hunt for a trio of escaped convicts in the wilds of modern Montana.<br /><br />Being sent out to captured the dangerous fugitives, who had killed a prison guard in their escape attempt, is the grizzled and fatalistic bounty hunter Lewis Gates, Tom Berenger, and his faithful companion, and only friend in the world, his tracking dog Zip.<br /><br />Tracking the three fugitives into the impassable Oxbow Quadrangle Gates finds what's left of them with a broken Indian arrow as the only clue to what exactly did them in. It's back in town that Gates' curiosity gets the best of him as he tries to get to the bottom of what happened to the three convicts! It's there that Gates contacts anthropologist Prof. Diane Sloan, Barbara Hershey, who's conducting an archaeological dig in the area. The findings from that one broken Cheyenne arrow will lead both Gate's and Diane into a world that was lost for some 130 years. A world that had the survivors of the brutal 1864 US Calvary "Sand Creek Massacre" go into hiding for over a century. It also had them protect their unexplored and pristine land with the bravery and ferocity of the then, back in the 1860's, Cheyenne Dogmen whom these now modern Indians are the descendants of.<br /><br />Gates who had shut himself off from the world since his wife the daughter of the town's Sheriff Deegan, Kurtwood Smith, was accidentally drowned-when she fell off her horse-would in fact find a new reason for living in the dangerous world beyond the "Wolf Valley" in the Oxbow. It was there that the remaining Dogmen Cheyenne tribe settled and lived in peace from the hated "white man" for over 100 years.<br /><br />It took a long time for Gates with the help of the fluently Cheyenne speaking Diane to win over the suspicious Dogman Indians but in the end it proved dividends to both in each taking turns saving each others lives. In fact it was Gates who lead sheriff Deegan and a posse of local citizens to the Dogmen's camp but only in his attempt to save the chief's son's, who was earlier shot by one of the escaped convicts, life. Gates did that by riding into town and robbing the local pharmacy to get life-saving penicillin! The final moments of the movie "Last of the Dogman" is about the most feel-good, without being too schmaltzy, ending I've even seen in that Gates together with Diane and Zip, who was almost killed by a Cheyenne arrow, ended up being together in Dogman Country. A place where time stands still and where life, and the environment, isn't corrupted.<br /><br />P.S The movie besides its uplifting storyline and powerful acting by Tom Berenger Barbara Hershey and the Dogman's Indian Chief Yellow Wolf played by Steve Reevis is also beautifully narrated by actor and former rodeo clown, who's job is to distracts a wild 2,000 pound bull from goring a fallen rider, Wilford Brimley.
