I was completely taken aback by watching this movie. A film like this comes once in a blue moon. This film explores the convoluted politics and conflicts between Hindus and Muslims, who are like puppets being "handled" by the corrupt national government. For the first time, I am seeing a movie whose subtext doesn't label each character as good or bad. All shades of gray are present in almost every character and in each event. Most of each character's decisions are partially justified and partly immoral, yet they all increase tensions and further flare up the fighting. Misunderstandings pile up on one another and result in absolute chaos. With each subsequent effort comes near certainty of death and destruction and a hint of optimism as the characters struggle for justice. Amongst so much violence and anarchy, I found it very interesting that the fighting's strength lied not in the muscle. Rather, the true valiant heroes were the city's women who stood up for their rights. Govind Nilhani did an excellent job directing. All the artists performed extraordinarily. Pointless songs were not forced into the movie, and the few short ones that were there further enrichened the movie. The aftermath/"ending" in this film is very realistic. It is not clear or definite by any means, but it does not need to be. Amitabh, one of the best speakers ever, gives a beautiful monologue that displays the theme of the movie: It does not matter whether we win or lose. We must be true to ourselves and not give up our struggle for the pursuit of justice.
