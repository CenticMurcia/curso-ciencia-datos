One of the MANY movies that mistakes profanity for powerful dialogue. Like horror movies that use gore to supplant suspense, these movies use profanity as a crutch. This was Nick Gomez's first film and it shows, from the "artistic", read too shaky, hand-held camera-work to the script which I imagine was two pages long, the rest of the film being improvised (I have a hard time believing anyone can write that kind of dialogue). The film starred Peter Greene (doomed to be forever known as Zed from "Pulp Fiction")and a cast of future Soprano actors. As for the story, it involves some old friends that are no longer friends coming back to the neighborhood, how original. See "Mean Streets" if you want a slice of life from the seedy section of town.
