Okay, so it's kind of a stock movie story with stock characters but what really makes it a view-more-than-once flick are the characters, especially Benicio Del Torro who puts in another stellar performance. Del Torro's character, Vincent, was the only non-stock character in the film and I'm convinced that Del Torro made Vincent all that he was -- no matter how good the writing & directing. I never get tired of Christopher Walken and his Christopher-Walkenisms so I found him bonus in the flick. And who is this superb gangster Nicholas Turturro (Stick)? Again, a so totally stereotypical character, but Turturro's seamless, peerless delivery made me perk up in anticipation of how he would deliver his next line every time he showed up in a scene.<br /><br />Something else I loved about this film were the "tight" images. I think the quality of the air in coastal Washington(?) gave the film a solid, high resolution look. But things like the car storage facilities not being your ordinary chop shop garages contributed to that "tight" imaging. Even having the cars covered in plastic was a "tight" consideration. As much as I'm not a big Alicia Silverstone fan, her face extrapolated this tightness.<br /><br />A serious detriment to the movie was the terrible weakness & implausibility of everything to do with the police -- their acting, their entire investigation activities, the chase scene, their placid acceptance of "Uncle Ray" at the final abduction site. So strike that stuff from your memory and focus on Del Torro's acting. Thankfully, the cops don't impinge much on the story.<br /><br />Overall, I found this to be a very enjoyable film that I will *definitely* watch again.
