great film, very tense and at times you don't want to look! very good characters and very well acted. It is really entertaining and is fairly surprising in its intensity towards the end. The way it unashamedly runs the action alongside an old fashioned love story is refreshing, and reminiscent of classic suburban thrillers of the 80s and 90s. The script is also very good and it is not just the fear of the antagonist that creates tension, as the social tension and atmosphere between the two main characters also at times has you cringing. I would recommend going to see this film. It wont change your life but Its great fun, a good ride and will be an hour and a half well spent.
