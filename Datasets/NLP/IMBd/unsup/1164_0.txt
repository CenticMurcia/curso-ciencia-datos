I just watched "The Book of Caleb", and boy was I impressed! The cinematography was beautiful, the acting superb, and the story lines were well thought out, wonderfully written and executed. It makes you laugh, it makes you think, it makes you reminisce. It's a coming of age story, centering on three childhood friends: Caleb (Jeremy Luno), Montag (Michael Hampton), and Swank (Nikitas Manikatos). They're at different points of their lives, yet trying to find their common ground. They even have an arch-nemesis, Scar (Jeff Berg), who is pretty much your uber bad guy...the guy you love to hate. And there's a love story involving a girl Caleb meets named Cole, played by the beautiful and hugely talented Mackenzie Firgins. <br /><br />I don't want to give too much away, so just go see the film. You can buy the DVD at www.thebookofcaleb.com. It's totally worth it...and you'll find a new favorite movie in the process.
