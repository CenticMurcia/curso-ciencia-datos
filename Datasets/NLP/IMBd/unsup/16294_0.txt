Victor Frankl's words in Man's Search For Meaning are evident in this motion picture. There are choices we all make to ensure our self-preservation, but there also comes a time when even amongst the worst of what humanity can wrought upon itself, there is hope. This movie is up there with Schindler's List in my opinion as to the testimony of the human condition. This movie is riveting. The textured performances of the leads make it an ensemble piece that will be long remembered as one of the forerunners to articulate the human suffering of the holocaust. No film could ever capture this time in history accurately, but this film, like Schindler's List and even to some degree, Divided We Fall. This has probably one of the more powerful endings of any movie I'd ever seen.
