Few movies have moved me enough to write reviews on IMDb. This has been one of them. I have to voice my opinion about how terrible this movie is. I watched the movie because Ciaran Hinds was in it, and I normally LOVE his work. But just through his portrayal of Mr. Rochester in this adaptation of Jane Eyre, he has undermined my love for his acting. If I were him, I would refuse to play Rochester in the manner he has done in this movie.<br /><br />There are far too many things deviant and completely improbable in this movie. Mr. Rochester pointing towards Jane Eyre's breasts?!!!!! Mr. Rochester displaying affection openly for Adele????? Mr. Rochester acts too much like a lovesick schoolboy and Jane is far too cheeky.<br /><br />The more adaptations of Jane Eyre I watch, the more I realize that the only truly beautiful version is the Timothy Dalton - Zelah Clarke version. The beauty of that adaptation is beyond description. The story is faithful to the book, and so are the characters and their behavior. The dialogue is not frivolous or superficial or stupid, but follows the book almost exactly.<br /><br />I wish now that I had never seen the Hinds-Morton version. Please, even if you do watch this movie, do not deprive yourself of the pleasure of watching the Dalton-Clarke version.
