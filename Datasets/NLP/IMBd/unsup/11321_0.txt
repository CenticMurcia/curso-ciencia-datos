I remember the actress Do-yeon Jeon who plays Eun-ha here from a subsequent film, the uncompromising, depressing "Secret Sunshine". She was amazing in that film and is just as good here, as a waitress/hostess. Jeong-min Hwang plays the fairly naive bumpkin like Suk-jung, who falls for her. It takes a long time for her to warm up to the idea of him as a boyfriend, but she does. Then, it is found out she has HIV. He vows to search for her, to always take care of her. This is the kind of film that only works as a film. I suppose the message is to follow your heart. Many people will be turned off by this film and not only for moral reasons. They may feel it is manipulative. However, the film is never boring and Do-yeon Jeon is a terrific actress. I'm going to see if she has done comedy because she was the lead in two very dramatic, soul searching but sad roles. If you can get past the storyline, the film is well made. Does love conquer all? Thats what this film tries to answer for you.
