This is a good example of why script rewrites are done up until the last minute. When not done right, the jokes just fall flat. I don't think I laughed a single time while watching this movie. The ending was obvious a few minutes in, and the way it all came about was so predictable. But, the thing that amazed me the most was the fact that whoever made this movie thought for a second that it sounded like a good idea. There are some actors that just shouldn't pick their own roles, and some movies that shouldn't have been made. This movie is definitely a good example of what happens when you let those things take place.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs.
