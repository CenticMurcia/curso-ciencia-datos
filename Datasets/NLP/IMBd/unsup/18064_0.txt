Yes, I have seen all the bad reviews and all the film critics and "experts" have ripped it to shreds, but who cares! Of course they would because it is based on the slapstick, pottymouth humor of the Farrelly Brothers. Basically if you like this kind of humor and can appreciate the depth of the movie, it might be the best movie you've ever seen. It really is amazing though how much effort must have gone into the writing of the lines for this movie. While the story is not going to win an Academy Award, every line that is spoken in this movie is part of a joke, NO FILLER! This means there are few parts where it slows down enough to let your stomach rest from laughing. Some of the jokes I am still figuring out or hearing after seeing it multiple times (I bet she'll invite us in for some tea and strumpets (prostitutes). I am both a movie fan and a fan of this type of comedy so I can appreciate it from both angles and I love it. No matter how many times I watch this movie, it is still funny. And if you aren't a fan of this type of comedy, then why are you reading this anyways?
