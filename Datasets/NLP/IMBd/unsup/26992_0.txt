Wow, never thought I'd review a talk show but.. Jay Leno isn't that great, guys. If you've watched Jay Leno instead of David Letterman, watch David Letterman. He's just the best talk show ever. He's funny, smart, and brings great guests onto the show. Almost all of them I like and know.<br /><br />I heard that he was fired from his other show because Jay Leno took over so he started this show because he was angry at Leno and wanted to compete. Well, hes competing and winning. I don't really know much what to say because this is just a talk show so.. Yeah.<br /><br />I don't David Letterman ever takes a break. He has done the show since 1993 and is still keeping the spirit of doing talk shows and entertaining everyone. What I think was my favorite guest he did was probably Madonna when she was cussing. Although, It was probably in his other show but that was just funny. What I thought was the worst was the one with Marilyn Manson. David Letterman looked so bored and stressed because Marilyn was just so uninteresting.
