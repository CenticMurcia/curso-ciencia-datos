This is the film where director John Waters returns to the more aggressive and violent universe of his earlier movies. After wimpy Cry Baby and feelgood Hairspray he gives us a movie about a housewife (brilliantly played by Kathleen Turner) so eager to protect her children, her marriage and the wildlife that she is forced to harass and kill neighbours, ex-boyfriends and schoolteachers. Never before has John Waters given his characters so much room in an environment so nice and cosy. I loved this movie. And donÂ´t miss what's under the spandex pants at the concert with the group Camel Lips.
