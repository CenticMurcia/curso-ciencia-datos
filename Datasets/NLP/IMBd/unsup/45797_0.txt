Alright it's not a great film, but compared to Highlander 2 this is Scorsese material! Adrian Paul is an actor who never lived up to his potential- Highlander The TV Series was a great contrast to the classic original film. But he became a straight to video kinda guy and some of the films he's churned out since have been unwatchable! Back to the film it's entertaining, if muddled. If you pretend it's not a Highlander film- you'll appreciate it more. The action and special effects are good. The villain looks ludicrous and he's no Kurgan by any means. But with an attractive woman in the mix and some so so swordplay, this is worth a good two beers/Doritos!
