John Saxon seems to be having all sorts of problems. One, he's having flashbacks to Vietnam, where he witnesses two of his men chowing down on somebody before biting him, and two: his teenage neighbour is coming on strong but all John has is an urge to bit her. Nevertheless, he trying to cope, until one of his buddies gets released from the loony bin and starts biting folk in a cinema.<br /><br />Cannibal Apocalypse, on the surface, appears to be your usual Italian gut muncher, what with all the gore and what not, but what is it I detect underneath? Could that be Social Commentary? The Vietnam vets in this film (well, the two who aren't complete raving lunatics) seem to drift through their world on a wave of indifference and hostility; John Saxon's character is misunderstood - his wife conspires behind his back with a love rival, and Giovanni Radice's Charlie can barely comprehend anything that's going on around him. Wouldn't we all just go a bit insane and go on a murderous rampage? The answer is: I watch too many of these films.<br /><br />Cannibal Apocalypse moves at a slightly slower pace than it's contemporaries, but Antonio ain't no fool. I've never seen a film by him that even approaches bad. Saxon and Radice both play their parts well, Saxon as an introverted, troubled man and Radice as a guy who is completely out of place in post Nam America. For those who just like to get drunk and watch blood fly, there's plenty of that here too. It's just that this time there's a little genuine drama in the mix too.
