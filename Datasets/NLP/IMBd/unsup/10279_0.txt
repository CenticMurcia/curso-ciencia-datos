Yoko Saito,who astute observers will remember from Takashi Mike's "White Collar Worker Kintaro", stars as the titular Scorpion, who goes to jail after circumstantial evidence convicts her of blowing up her hubby in her car. Of course she's innocent and survives jail long enough to break out and find the real culprits. This had to be the lamest women in prison flick I've ever seen and trust me in my hormonally charged youth I watched those type of films non-stop. Horribly acted, the nudity couldn't even save this one. Steer clear.<br /><br />My Grade: D- <br /><br />DVD Extras: Art Gallery; Theatrical Trailer; Trailers for "Terminatrix", "Weather Woman Returns", "Sunny gets Blue", "Beautiful Hunter", "Tokyo Mafia: Battle for Shinzu"; and a promo for the 2004 Big Apple Anime Fest <br /><br />Eye Candy: it's a WIP flick, so almost every girl has a moment of nudity, but it's also a jap flick she no bush BOO!! HISS!!
