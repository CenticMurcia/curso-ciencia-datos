This documentary was the stupid most disturbing thing I have ever seen in my life. Nick Broomfield is totally out of his mind when he tries to fight for Aileen. There is no point to it, she was an evil person who would kill again, so she's better off dead.<br /><br />Dawn Botkins is just as much insane as Aileen is. She wants to be loyal to a vicious serial killer. I'm glad Aileen got exactly what she deserved. I give this movie no stars at all. It is just absolutely stupid.<br /><br />Hey one question too, Whatever happened to Tyria Moore?<br /><br />She did the right thing by helping the prosecution sent Aileen to the lethal injection table.
