Beverly Hills Cop was a runaway hit despite being panned by the same established critics that gave Speed 2 and Anaconda 2 thumbs up. The second installment has Axel Foley trying to solve a case involving a criminal who goes by the name "The Alphabet Killer"(played by Jurgen Prochnow) after LT. Bogomil is shot by the Alphabet Killer's hench woman Sally, played by Brigitte Nielson. Later on Axel stumbles on a plot involving oil and a lot of guns. Beverly Hills Cop II is just as funny as the first one but is more visually pleasing. Whether it is the streets of Beverly Hills or an oil field out of town, the picture is sharp. Eddie Murphy and Judge Reinhold's character, Billy, provide most of the laughs. John Ashton's Taggert is okay on this one. Brigitte Nielson probably played her best role in here as The Alphabet Killer's partner in crime. The action scenes are pretty good but what made Beverly Hills Cop II interesting the most was the suspense. I mean Axel gets so involved in a case that he almost cost, Billy, Taggert and himself a job and he still succeeds. What a cop! Plus under the direction of Tony Scott this movie was bound to be a thrill. You cant do wrong with this sequel to Beverly Hills Cop, pay no mind to the snooty critics who panned it and stay away from Beverly Hills Cop III.
