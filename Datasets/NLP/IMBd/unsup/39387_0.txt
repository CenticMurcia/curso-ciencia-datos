I saw this movie at the NatFilm festival (Nightly Movies Festival) in Copenhagen, and it was a huge disappointment. I found the movie virtually void of a story and hopelessly over-stretched. The only reason I have not used profanity here are the IMDb guidelines, the movie is THAT bad.<br /><br />On a more cheerful note: Most of the cinema-goers that evening managed to sleep some time during the movie (myself included), so after the movie people were well rested. Considering the usual cinema-goers at that festival it is quite an achievement.<br /><br />I rate this a 1 out of 10. (Because it is impossible to cast a lower vote)
