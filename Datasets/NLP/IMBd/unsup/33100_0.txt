This movie isn't much of anything. It's not really smart, nor polished, nor good at all. Plus, Kristen Scott Thomas's character, Mary, was getting on my nerves. In some ways, it was a blend of art deco from the 1930's, with high priced aristrocratcy, and that cheesey 1980's thing. Not really creative at all in my opinion! Sorry! See "Purple Rain". It's not excellent either, but it's better than this!
