Well, this is BAD. Truly bad.<br /><br />Let's do a quick rundown: Suspense: NONE. Creepy atmosphere: Don't think so. Funny: Well, it tries to be but it fails miserably. Gore: Not really, but one star for trying (the scissors bit was admirably done). Nudity: One star in that department.<br /><br />Maybe we're not expecting first rate acting but a little competence would be nice. All involved are simply horrible and some seem to be in another movie altogether.<br /><br />On the trivia section for the flick you can see the film was shot in just 24 days. While that is indeed quite an accomplishment and all technical aspects are admirably handled the fact remains that this film is a complete and utter dud.
