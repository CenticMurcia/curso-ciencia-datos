Whatever you do, how intoxicated you might be, do not return to Salem's Lot! Even if you've been there in 1979, and somewhat liked it, you're going to be horribly disappointed if you return. If you want mainstream-horror, there's always Carrie (1976), Cannibal Holocaust (1979) and Cannibal ferox (1981), just to name a few. If you enjoy the acting of Michael Moriarty and the writing of Larry Cohen, you should check out Q (1982) instead.<br /><br />The only thing I liked about this movie (haven't read the book), was the unorthodox portrayal of the "vampire race". It's always enjoyable watching on-screen stereotypes being torn apart.
