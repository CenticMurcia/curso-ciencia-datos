After hearing nothing but praise I finally got to see the first season of Deadwood. <br /><br />What struck me again and again is the awfully affected performance by Molly Parker. While the rest of the cast speak in clear tones, Molly Parker speaks in studied whispers. Her transformation from addict does not change her self-conscious and unauthentic performance. She is simply unable to deliver a line or word without constant nervous affectation.<br /><br />She is also sexless, so the "blossoming" love affair has no spark. Why anyone would think that Parker is an actor of talent is beyond me. Her performance is at odds with the rest of the reliable cast.<br /><br />I find the use of the constant swearing distracting because it is anachronistic. The odd modern swear word would have impact but it is excessive and soon becomes tiresome.<br /><br />Basically, the show is not as good as it thinks it is.
