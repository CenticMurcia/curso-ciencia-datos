Lurid, titillating, and somewhat sadomasochistic abduction tale, most notable for its writer and producer credit. "The Fast and the Furious" boasts more star power than you might expect from an early Roger Corman effort, however. Dorothy Malone (as Connie) is the leggy Jaguar driver who likes to be roughed-up once in awhile. John Ireland (as Frank Webster) is the wrongly accused man on the lam, who prefers his carjacked Jag come with a blonde. Who wouldn't? <br /><br />Nonsensical fast car fifties time capsule, climaxing in the "bonded" couple's off-screen encounter in an abandoned love shack, where he has carried her "over the threshold"; later, she hilariously sets the place on fire. Cinematographer Floyd Crosby is the father of the similarly surnamed member of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. "The Fast and the Furious" is like a very old piece of candy you might find behind the couch - eat it cautiously. <br /><br />** The Fast and the Furious (2/15/55) Edward Sampson, John Ireland ~ John Ireland, Dorothy Malone
