Jason Lee is one of the wittiest, funniest actors...I just love watching him, and he was absolutely great in this movie. David Schwimmer was good, and Mili Avital was impressive(first time I had ever seen her!). I thought this was a great romantic comedy...to the extreme. VERY ROMANTIC, VERY COMEDIC!
