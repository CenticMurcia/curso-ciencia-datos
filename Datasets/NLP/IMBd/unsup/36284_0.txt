Something has gone horribly wrong. I'm not sure what Eli Roth and Quentin Tarentino were thinking when they put this crap together, but it's a laughable attempt at a shocking horror film. It wasn't as violent as Saw, it wasn't as tense as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, and it's filled with more ridiculous horror clich√©s than I could list in 1,000 words on IMDb. To have a preview that warns squeamish people with bad hearts to stay away from the theaters, there were a lot of people in my theater LAUGHING. Throughout the entire film. That pretty much sums things up about this one. A laughable attempt at being shocking. Just track down the original Japanese film instead. Or watch "Audition". Or "Ichi the Killer". You'll be better off. The other worst movie that I've seen in a theater? Wes Craven's THEY. And I'm not sure which of the two is worse.
