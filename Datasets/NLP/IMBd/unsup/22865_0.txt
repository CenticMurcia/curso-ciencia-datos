I saw this movie in 1974-75 and have never forgotten it, I would please please like to obtain a copy , so if anyone can help me it will really be appreciated. I have trawled through the internet over and over again, and this is one of the most promising sites. Please help or advise. Would anyone have a copy or know where I can buy one from. At the time I saw it I was in South Africa and it was shown in the Cinema. I have told my 2 daughters about this Movie an I am sure they would love it. I have tried E-bay , Amazon and Yahoo for help but have never uncovered this movie. One of the things I remember well is when she is dying, and her cat stays with her on the bed all day , she comments that the cat will stay until she is ready to die. This is what happens, the Cat disappears one day and you know, (I cried buckets) that the end was near. I now live in the United Kingdom and have search old Library files for information on this Movie. One of John Dvener's songs was included in the Sound Track. ( I think it was Sunshine on my Shoulder), and that song still brings tears to my eyes. I can see Was her name Jill as clearly as if I had watched this yesterday. Not 30 odd years ago <br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Margaret Macpherson
