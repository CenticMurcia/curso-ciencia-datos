I bought this movie on a pure whim of decent premise. The back eludes to neither pro or anti-bush, and even quotes how it's made for "thinkers". This is all garbage. <br /><br />Basically, you're gonna assume it'll start off with Bush getting picked off somehow by some dubious fellow, and move onto an intriguing "what-if" scenario. Questions riddled my head, "wonder what Chaney would do much different?", "how would the U.S. really respond?", "what would become of Bush's course of actions?", "what would happen in 2008? 2018? 2050?", "how would the rest of the world view this?". <br /><br />But forget all that, you're set on a journey of 30% anti-Bush protests news clips before death, 60% forensic "whodunit", 10% no freedom wagon.<br /><br />Firstly, this movie is overwhelmingly anti-Bush with the only pro-remarks coming from his speech writer (all mainly personal, not political). Second, this is NOT a political movie, it's a murder mystery you don't care about because it didn't happen. <br /><br />Even when it mentioned Chaney moving up to presidency I perked up for a moment, as if the opening credits ended and the movie were about to begin, but no, no, back to some fictional trial with a bunch of malarkey about evidence. It's fictional, make overwhelming evidence, make the assassin found dead, and give us a political yarn to unravel.<br /><br />This movie deserves to be protested, shot, then put on fictional trial before we all come together and whine about crappy movies.
