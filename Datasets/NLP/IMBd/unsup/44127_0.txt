I attend the series everyday Charmed through the channel Sony, but the some months I discovered through communities of the Orkut that won't film more. I was completely satiny in knowing that the series didn't have a good audience, unlike Brazil, where we loved. The last season left a taste of I want plus, since the end was half vague. If it was necessary would mobilize the Brazilians to do low signed for the three more charismatic sisters return the screens. Lament with the end of the series, and some of the new series are imitating and following the same style, but they will never be compared with the quality and charisma of Charmed.
