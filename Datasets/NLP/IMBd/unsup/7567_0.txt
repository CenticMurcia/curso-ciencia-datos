I'll give this a 10 out of 10 just to counterbalance the low voters a bit. It's worth at least 6 out of 10.<br /><br />Are those votes low because of the nudity? It's a soft-core porno movie, what did you expect? Same for anyone expecting an action movie or something like that. I wonder how many of the voters actually saw the movie.<br /><br />This movie is an extremely humorous Lord of the Rings spoof with nudity in it. Nothing more but also nothing less. The dialogs are better than a lot of regular comedies, let alone the average porno. Sure they did not have a huge special effects budget, but they used what they had the best they could, and they came up with a very entertaining script.
