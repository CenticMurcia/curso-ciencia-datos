The Adventures of Robin Hood holds up remarkably well, perhaps because it focuses on the story elements which have had universal appeal throughout the centuries. Unlike the regrettable Robin Hood, Prince of Thieves, which tried to give the hero a ponderous psychological complexity, the 1938 film offers a fast paced examination of what is essentially a man of action.<br /><br />The film is able to dispense with any lengthy exposition simply by portraying its characters in easily identifiable terms - either as valorous champion of liberty, or as hissable oppressor, with no room for grey shading. Although characterization is elementary, the purpose of the story is not; it was meant not only as a tonic for depression weary audiences, but as a warning to foreign despots who might try to disrupt the world stage.<br /><br />Several elements in the film stand out: the breathtaking colour photography, spirited if not historically authentic battle scenes, and Korngold's vibrant score. What stands out the most, however, are the performances of a flawless cast. Errol Flynn, here at his physical peak, displays both effortless panache and a winning sincerity. In contrast, Rathbone's vicious Guy of Gisbourne is defined not only by his own sneering persona but by the manifold suffering he inflicts on the peasants. Alan Hale, Eugene Palette, and Herbert Mundin provide sturdy performances and comic moments, but possibly the best performance belongs to Claude Rains. His effete Prince John is a villain for all seasons. The bold, often broad performances are in keeping with the straightforward narrative.<br /><br />The enchanting, storybook texture of the visuals, combined with vivid acting and action, is a welcome relief from some of today's jaded cinema.<br /><br />Trivia Note: During the forest banquet, Flynn blows one of his lines. When talking to Maid Marian, he says "kindness instead of riches." According to the screenplay, it should be "kindness instead of whips."
