A little extreme, huh? I think my nationality has rendered my some point of patriotism, that the war criminal could not just get away with this, of just like the blockbuster "Pearl Harbor", in the spitting of the people of China, plus the modest performance of Harley and Trevor, I would rather delete it from my PC.<br /><br />The acting and outline of a movie should be put to the very first, and I think the main problem with the movie will not be just an " old piece" but the attempt to be realistic and natural, and the whole thing just get mixed up, I think Harley will be another Sean, But not that luck under the atmosphere of destruction, and nothing to give him but to be yourself, not to be too real, After all you are acting, people rushing into that theater not to see your lives, but to see your understanding of the particular line of the story told by the diversity of all the human beings existing and living in the planet some E.T. will not get fully understand and be attached to.
