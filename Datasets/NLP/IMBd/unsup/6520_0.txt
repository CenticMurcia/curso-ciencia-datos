one of the best movies i seen. a different angle of love and and the effects of lack of trust and not being honest are portrayed very well. Simbhu is at his best in this movie. <br /><br />Wonderful music, all melodies, modern and folk are really good.<br /><br />i read few comments above which sounded like written by Simbhu haters. but i believe this movie is definitely watchable and worth spending money or time on it. after all, it is a Hit and most of the Tamil people like it.<br /><br />this movie made Simbhu really famous. He proved that he got skills. very nice direction. proper utilization of characters. no extras like unnecessary fights or unnecessary songs.
