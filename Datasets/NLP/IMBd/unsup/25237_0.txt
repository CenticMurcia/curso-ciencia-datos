This film should definitely lay to rest claims that Crawford could not play comedy--she is hilarious, cute, and laugh-out-loud funny throughout! In her first "talky," Crawford plays Bingo, a girl brought up in South America who inherits three million dollars when her dad dies. She moves to NYC by cruise ship, and meets a young man played by Robert Montgomery (in his first role as leading man!).<br /><br />Since both Crawford and Montgomery were very young when the film was made, it is a joy to watch. All the actors give spirited performances, Crawford and Montgomery are incredibly cute together, and are funnier than I have seen them in any other film! The theme song from the film, "Chant of the Jungle" (sung by Joan Crawford in the film) was a hit in 1929, when the film was made, and you'll be sure to get it stuck in your head even after the movie is over.<br /><br />The plot of the film was also quite good, surprisingly. Robert Montgomery and Crawford's characters love each other, but because she is rich and he has little money, he is afraid to marry her because of what people might think. Bingo's uncle Ben also discourages the relationship and offers Montgomery money to leave her! Of course, everything goes astray and uncle Ben's plans fall through in a hilarious fashion. The film offers a fairly intelligent view of such a situation, as well.<br /><br />Definitely a treat for classic film fans! This gem hopefully will continue to sparkle for a long time, with more airings on TCM and video release!
