I've seen this film at least a dozen times over the past half century and never tire of it. Fields is at his best, and the movie is hilarious. It ranks with You're Telling Me, It's A Gift, The Bank Dick, and My Little Chickadee. It seems incredible that this film gem has not appeared in either VHS or DVD. But such is the blockheadedness of the ruling powers in the media these days.
