I first saw this movie in first grade not long after it came out on home video, and so my teacher brought it in and our class decided to watch it. When we started to watch it, I thought that it was interesting, but after awhile, I really became focused into it, and so when it was over, I really was thrilled with it! This movie has got a lot of really great qualities, great music, great voices, great effects, and great animation! This is not one of the greatest animated movies that I have ever seen, and it is not one of my all time favorite animated movies that I have ever seen, but I can say that I enjoyed this movie all the way through! <br /><br />It is pointless complaining about the dinosaurs talking, because the totally marvelous animation makes up for it, the animation is so great that you will not mind the fact that the dinosaurs and animals have voices! If you really want to see a very enjoyable animated movie, then this is one that you really must see, it will get your desire for computer animation really going, this movie has got some of the best computer animation that I have ever seen! <br /><br />But overall, this movie is very great, I really recommend that you see this, you will really like it! <br /><br />9/10
