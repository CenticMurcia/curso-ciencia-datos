I ordered this movie from amazon.com and wasn't disappointed. It isn't wonderful, but it's thoroughly entertaining, pretty scary, and Adrian Brody's character was fascinating. He and Maura Tierney both did excellent jobs in this film, although Maura Tierney's character was slightly less developed. The plot is well crafted and the movie is engaging. I recommend this movie.
