I can't spoil this film by giving away the plot. There is none. This was the most inept film to come along in a while, and there are plenty to choose from. Not a movie for young girls, no role models here, only 4 young ladies with guns, violence, lesbians, smoking, inane dialog and so bad it must be seen to be believed. You can not connect with any of these ladies and one has to wonder how a film so bad could ever get made! On second thought, don't see it. You'd be wasting your time and money. Maybe if it pops up on cable or satellite take a look, if you can stand it. Of all the projects that are shelved each year in Hollywood why something like this was given the green light is beyond me. There are plenty of good stories waiting to be told, many good directors waiting for their chance. Even Roger Corman couldn't make a film this bad with a 3 day shooting schedule and $25,000 - or less.
