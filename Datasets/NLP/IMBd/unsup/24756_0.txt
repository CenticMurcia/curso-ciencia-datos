Not to be a party-pooper amongst these comments, but I just saw Panj Ã© asr, and I am not too impressed. In fact, I fell asleep somewhere in the desert, when the main characters of the movie were burning up their last belongings to provide heat for an already dead child.<br /><br />The movie points out the catastrophe of Afghanistan, the despair of the situation and its impact on the people. Unjust, tragic and undeserved. The movie portrays this well at times, and it is especially when western helicopters fly above that we get a feel of the contrast of our societies. This is the good part of the movie; it tries to tell us something.<br /><br />The bad part is its style. It has a documentary approach which works at first, but drags on so long, and so slow, that it turns tedious. There is never any background music, and conversation mainly only in the beginning of the movie. It is good to sleep while you're watching this movie, because you'll wake up and see that almost nothing has happened, so you can safely eat some popcorn and continue sleeping.<br /><br />If there had been an improved script to this movie, which dared to throw some serious blame along with some serious and though-provoking theme music, this movie would have been magical and revolutionary. Sadly, it's not. Two out of ten.
