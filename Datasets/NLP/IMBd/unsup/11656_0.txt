It is great to revisit the town of Korsbæk in 2007, approximately 25 years after it was first aired. The series is not only a truthful rendition of mid-century Denmark from 1929 to 1947, but also a documentation of Danish self-understanding in the 1980'es - at the time of Danmarks Radios broadcasting monopoly  and the series itself was, and still is, an integral part of the ongoing formation of the national self-understanding (of which we seem to have a LOT! &#61514;) Among many other things this series had a great impact on the understanding and self-understanding of gay men in Denmark. As it originally aired in the early eighties - the peak of the aids-epidemic - and connected themes such as solidarity in the face of oppression, helping those in need during the war, and the conflict between a relentlessly striving businessman and his gay son, the series undoubtedly raised both general awareness and the wider public support for the same-sex civil unions legislation, passed in 1987.
