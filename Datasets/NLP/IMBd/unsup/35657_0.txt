You know how after eating at a Chinese buffet, no matter how much you eat you never get full? That's how I felt after watching this movie. There should have been more.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I don't want the movie to be longer - I want more jokes. This was a comedy, right? I think jokes are an important part of comedy.<br /><br />I have seen episodes of Lost with more comedic relief than this movie.<br /><br />I've seen Youtube videos that were better than this.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that such a talented writer as Harold Ramis of Caddyshack and National Lampoon's Vacation could have hatched this bad egg out of his mindgrapes.<br /><br />This would have been a great movie in Fantasyland.
