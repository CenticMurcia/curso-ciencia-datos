I wanted so badly to like this because I love Emmy Rossum, but seeing her prancing around on a bed in her bra and underwear, swinging a sock with a lock in it at a man in his tightly-whities.... it just sort of ruined it for me. The song she sings is beautiful and she looks lovely as ever, but it was just too implausible a storyline and the script was fairly weak, but Ms. Rossum was a delight, even in the midst of such faults from the script and story.<br /><br />I also am a fan of Mary McDonnell's work from Dances With Wolves, but her smugness her seemed rather 1 dimensional; albeit not a great role to begin with.<br /><br />I watch movies on Lifetime with some regularity, and this was above-average I'd say, but I can't say I'd watch it again. It's too bad - with this cast it could've been much better.
