I just started watching NCIS & it's starting to grow on me. A lot of it has to do with the Ziva David character & plot line. The "Good Cop Bad Cop" episode was great & has earned NCIS another fan (me).<br /><br />I've become very slowly interested in this show because it is sometimes difficult for me to follow the plots. Dialogue can provide clues but the lines are sometimes mumbled so I have to watch my recordings of the show a couple of times to piece together what people are saying & what clues are presented. Otherwise, when I catch on to what is happening I realize I've enjoyed figuring out the threads & in the end the stories are pretty good.<br /><br />Again, I like the Ziva David character a lot. I've spent many years watching shows that really lacked a strong female character and I'm tired of getting frustrated when they are supposed to be strong but end up missing every target they shoot at & the male lead comes in and "rescues" them at the end. <br /><br />Not so here & I want whoever is responsible to know I appreciate it - keep up the good work & thank you for continuing to include Ziva in the show - I just hope you keep her character responsible & true - she has the potential to be a pretty good female role model (like Benson in Law & Order SVU). <br /><br />BTW, IMO a romance with DiNozzo would not be a good idea right now. Teasers are okay but I think the only time that could/should potentially happen is if they decided to finish off the series....which I hope doesn't happen for quite a while.
