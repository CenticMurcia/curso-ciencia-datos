When I started watching it... I hated it for the first 30 minutes.. I paused the movie and thought about it.. Any movie that makes us think must be a great achievement! Pure cinema - It at least leaves me with so much hatred. I resumed the movie with a fresh view - expecting more hatred. I was totally disappointed as the movie proceeded - From a good start, the movie tumbled down to sleaze in my book. If a movie intends to be bold - I would like seeing it make a statement till the end. It is absolutely fine with me even if the theme of the movie disturbs me, but trying to convince me that there is goodness in this world after letting me see the worst of it - doesn't work. Four Stars!
