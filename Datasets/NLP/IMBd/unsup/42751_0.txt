I am second guessing myself over my "1" rating because I usually reserve 1 for extremely bad movies but I couldn't give this higher than a 1.5. The actors and actresses were all very unattractive which sucked because there was a lot of sexual situations. The actual acting was horrendous. You were always aware that it's just a movie. You never get lost into it like you do a great movie. The special FX were hit and miss but overall OK for a small budget picture. Not quite enough of it to earn the "strong violence/gore" moniker though. The ending was so predictable that it secured a "1" vote. Had the ending been good it would have gotten a "2". Another thing that bugged me was that the premise of the movie was this group of people stuck in a house (which may or may not be haunted) all the while being recorded and streamed on a website. The group had to solve certain clues so it was like a scavenger hunt. It made no sense because it was just a 2 story house. They acted like it was a huge compound. Another huge plot hole was the fact that every time some action happened it was never picked up on the web cam. If the whole premise of the project was to video these people, it seems like they would go to great lengths to ensure that there would be no "blind spots".<br /><br />Hey don't take my word for it though. Pick up a copy and decide for yourself. Make sure to come back here and review it because it's pretty likely that as soon as I post this, we'll get a few positive ghost reviews by people that worked on it. <br /><br />Sorry guys, I didn't mean to rag your movie but it wasn't any good.
