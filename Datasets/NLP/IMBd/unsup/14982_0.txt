I wasn't too sure when I picked up this movie. The first few minutes were actually kinda nauseating the way the picture shot. But after used to it, I found it to be more real. The story doesn't flow like normal, rather it drips on you like leaking faucet. Telling you bits of the character as it goes. The acting of the main actor Rodolphe Marconi is very promising. His eyes tells a lot more than anything else. Somehow I keep comparing him to Jake Gylenhaal, maybe just the look. Overall great effort from an all rounder producer/actor/writer. I highly recommend this study of human's emotion. When feelings are too strong to be contained. Like the character said "have you ever been lost, and you are aware that you are lost, but you can not do anything about it?"
