Pretentious plot. Okay acting. Shallow characters The verdict? So-so.<br /><br />What first turned me off was Calista, or Cindy, or whatever her name is, the character had about the same IQ as your average eggplant. She changed her name to Calista because it sounded "hot" like a porn star name? It just shows why the rest of the world hate America, ha. And as the story progresses, some cute basketball player moves into the trailer park that both Audrey and "Calista" were drooling over, but you know, since Calista was dying and everything, Audrey as her best friend backed off of the guy (not spoiling anything, it's made fairly obvious what's going on from the beginning). And the two start dating and whatever while Audrey watches from the side and she realizes that she's in love with him or something. Ha, ha, little girls, we'll talk when you can tell the difference between love and infatuation. It's just stupid teenage melodramatic bull, aren't you supposed to go through that stuff when you're like 14? Okay enough ranting, now for the good parts of the film, the cinematography, absolutely gorgeous, I cannot even imagine how many hours and days someone would have to film at that same spot to get those stunning shots of the sky. Conclusion? The plot and the characters aren't so great but it is quite something to look at.
