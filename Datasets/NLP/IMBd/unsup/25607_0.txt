There is a strong critical view of "A day without a Mexican" easily because it defends illegals and mocks Americans. Now, I love the fact that they are making fun of those piggy Americans and there selfish ways without giving a chance to let the Mexicans in for a change. Though one may be expecting a large amount of fantasy and bizarre weirdness-"A day without a Mexican" although has some good messages such as 'where your heart lies' and 'give peace a chance' there is no excuse to poor quality. I was expecting the film to be funnier, a black comedy when really you see the melodramatic overtones of human drama and a positive film. The plot is way to political, most viewers don't even why the Mexicans disappeared in the first place. The message is hard to understand and in order to truly like the film you pretty much have to BE an illegal. The poor quality of the film shows everyone individual in America as a sick, spoiled bastard. This may be true but how it's portrayed is so poorly done. If the film is also very slow and dramatic, the slowness of the film goes on so much that one wonders "is this still the film?" The plot, I admit, is interesting but only good enough for a short film; not an entire movie.
