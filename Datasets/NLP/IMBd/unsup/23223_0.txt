This was a solid Royal Rumble PPV to begin with just like last year's Rumble as well.<br /><br />WWE Cruiserweight Invitational Match for the WWE Cruiserweight Championship Gregory Helms vs. Funaki vs. Kid Kash vs. Paul London vs. Jamie Noble vs. Nunzio 6/10: Good match of course with the cruiser-weight all in the ring battling it out, you'll know that it is a good match. Gregory Helms wins after pinning Funaki to capture his first WWE Cruiserweight Championship.<br /><br />Mickie James vs. Ashley Special guest referee: Trish Stratus 3/10: Most Diva matches are boring like this one. Mickie James wins after getting Ashley in a roll-up & using the ropes for leverage.<br /><br />JBL vs. Boogeyman 4/10: Pretty boring & sloppy, but it had enough effort for a match. Boogeyman wins after a Pump-Handle like slam finisher.<br /><br />Royal Rumble match 8/10: This is the match of the night which featured new wrestlers as well participated in the Rumble. Mysterio wins after eliminating Orton last.<br /><br />WWE Championship Edge vs. John Cena 7/10: Good match, probably the second best match of the night, great to see John Cena win after making Edge tap out to the STFU to capture his WWE Championship back.<br /><br />World Heavyweight Championship Kurt Angle vs. Mark Henry 3/10: The worst match of the night & the worst main event ever. Angle wins after a chairshot on the head of Mark Henry then an Angle Slam.<br /><br />Overall: Good PPV just like last year's, i'll give it 8/10 & B passable.
