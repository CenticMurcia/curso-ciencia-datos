This is another Great Batman cartoon and for all the same reasons the storyline is good it has lots of action in it the cartoon effects are good the voice over actors are good such as Kevin Conroy as Batman, Efrem Zimbalist Jr. as Alfred, Loren Lester as Richard "Dick" Grayson etc. The villain is good Michael ansara as Mr. Freeze. So i am sure you will not be disappointed with Batman and Mr. Freeze Subzero because it is a really good movie. So make sure that you rent or buy Batman and Mr. Freeze subzero because it is a great movie.<br /><br />Overall score: ******** out of ********** <br /><br />***1/2 out of *****
