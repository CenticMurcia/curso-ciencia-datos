I enjoyed The Next Generation (though it was a lot more fantasy than I was expecting from science fiction), and I do like Enterprise (despite its often cheesy writing); I've even liked the few Babylon 5 episodes I've seen. I enjoy the original series, and despite a few TOS-cast failures, I love the Star Trek movies (even the mediocre ones).<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was unable to get through more than four episodes of Voyager. I really wanted to like it; however, the immense amounts of pseudoscience immediately grated on my nerves. Warp particles? The event horizon is an 'energy field?' I am a huge believer in suspension of disbelief -- horror, science fiction and fantasy are my favorite genres, largely for this reason -- but the other series generally skirt known physics or make an attempt to reconcile their plots with currently accepted theories. Voyager doesn't do this at all; the show employs painful leaps of 'science' and 'logic' that will leave anyone with a background in either cringing.<br /><br />The acting varies from decent to very, very poor, from one scene to the next. The character dynamics change similarly, to the point where it's so inconsistent that the show just can't build tension. The show does have its moments, but they come in neither quantity nor quality.<br /><br />I can't in good conscience recommend this to anyone, especially Star Trek fans.
