Anthony Hopkins once again plays a killer who is playing games with the authorities - not dissimilar to his role in Silnce of the lambs except he doesn't eat people in this film.<br /><br />Ted Crawford knows his wife is having an affair with a policeman and so he shoots her through the head! Trouble is this killer is clever and despite acting ignorant in court knows how to play the system. He is up against Willy Beecham an eager young DA.<br /><br />While the film wasn't sleep inducing it was hardly thriller of the year stuff, the storyline was slow (painfully at times), There was no suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat, no gripping storyline, and no action.<br /><br />OK if you have nothing else to watch but not one to highly recommend
