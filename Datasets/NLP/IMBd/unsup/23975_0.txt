Okay, Okay, this is a shocker, especially considering who the producer was, but Drive is a wonderfully entertaining film. The action set pieces are great, the pacing is tight (well, with two small exceptions), and the special effects aren't asked to do too much. The plot is thin, the characters thinly written, and the end seems a little rushed. BUT, that's okay. Dacascos and Hardison do a great job of fleshing out their characters and adding zip to the dialog. Pyper-Ferguson transcends the limitations of his role and Tracey Walter is, well, as quirky as ever. Also surprisingly good was Brittany Murphy as Deliverance, the nutty hotel clerk.<br /><br />While no awards will ever be sent its way, it is well worth a rental and, maybe, a re-viewing.
