Just saw the film, and it had its ups and downs...It was a very predictable, but extremely cute film. There were some technical problems, but overall the film moved nicely. If you like feel good movies about the elderly, then I would recommend this film. The supporting cast was hands down the best part of the film, all of the older actors really pulled out the audience's emotion...Pat Hingle really did an amazing job portraying the feisty old man in the nursing home who kept trying to escape. The topic of corrupt nursing homes is one that should be touched upon more in contemporary media and film making. Overall, I enjoyed the film for what it was: a low to medium budget independent film with a nice heartwarming story that the film makers seem to have cared greatly about.
