A mulligan stew, inherently of low expectations: throbbing music; lots and lots of different locations, sometimes interesting but fleeting; abundant gun play; a plethora of characters (more than indicated by IMDB); wild camera angles, till they tire of them; deceit and treachery all over, with vaporizing loyalties; super high-tech weapons; and something about intelligence agencies, computers, encrypted passwords, and critical databases doctored by the good (???) guys for sale by the bad guys to unseen other bad guys of murky pedigree. At the end, the only true good guys stand alone.<br /><br />Teri Hatcher has the lion's share of acting duty. Sorry girls, there's not as much of Rob Lowe as you'd expect from his star status: just enough to preserve his star billing but not enough to break the budget or really exercise his talent.<br /><br />Fine production values and good acting. BUT: why, oh why, can't they spend less on frills and more of the budget on a decent, respectable script; shouldn't that ALWAYS be the first priority?<br /><br />By the way, we never learn how Jane Doe (Teri Hatcher) came by her legal name, nor what that has to do with anything.
