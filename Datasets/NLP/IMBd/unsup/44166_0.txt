**spoilers**<br /><br />There obviously must be something wrong with me since everyone is saying this is the best comic book movie ever but I just didn't like it. It started off well but then it went all wrong for me. I don't think this Doc Ock guy was interesting enough as a villain. Spidey giving up his spideyness has been done before and better in Superman II when he gave up his powers for Lois. And there were a lot of similarities to the Superman movies that made this seem like I'd already been through it. I also don't understand how the writers thought it was okay for so many people to know who Spider-Man's alter ego is. Oh yeah, they won't tell, I forgot. Sheesh. I started to get aggravated with this movie because of the constant reminders of how difficult Peter's life is, especially the scenes with Aunt May. Was he late all the time and penniless? I'm not too sure. They only pointed that out a million times. Where it completely lost me was after Peter and Ock left the cafe. But the actors were okay for the most part and there was one very good scene in an elevator. <br /><br />I was expecting the best comic book movie of all time because of the hype, but it turned out to be worse than the first one, which I didn't think was that great either. It's too bad because I usually enjoy comic book movies. It gets a 4/10 from me. I'll stick with the X-men.
