This movie does not have a great original story, excellent acting or a great cast. What it does have is the incredibly attractive Rochelle Swanson. I have to say when I first saw this actress I thought she looked truly amazing. He physical attributes are stunning along with her gorgeous dark raven coloured hair and amazing eyes. Her acting is also not bad for this genre, I could actually imagine her playing a femme fatale type in a forties or fifties set thriller with ease. The overall movie is not really that great, but the nude scenes with Rochelle Swanson, in fact any scenes with her in are watchable. Woody Brown is fairly convincing as the obsessive guy but when he goes crazy he becomes a little less convincing. May Karasun is also quite attractive but looks bored at times and the actor playing the husband is not great either. Still, I don't think anyone will be watching this for the acting. So if you are looking for a bit of late night romance or nudity with great looking women this should suit your needs just fine.
