The movie is mediocre at best. Definitely not worth the hype. The movie is plagued by a weak storyline and editing.Old Bollywood plot being used for past 60 years used for this movie. The movie show signs of weak editing. The movie has been stretched around Amitabh and lacks character development of other actors in the movie. One can understand he is a main selling point, but actors like Sanjay, Jackie suffer. Hardly any time is devoted to their character development. Information has been repeated in several scenes. For a short running movie this is definitely a sign of weakness. I suppose the pre-production was not well thought.Information is repeated several times. Scenes are pro-longed unnecessarily. This makes the movie boring between the middle run. I would say the movie is technically and directorial weak. Seems like a dry soap opera at best.
