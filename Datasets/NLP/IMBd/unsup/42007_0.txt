I am not sure what that Dane fellow was talking about, but he obviously is not a family man. I rented this movie for my two children. My daughter (Four years of age) and my son (8 years old). Neither of them could sit still during this movie. My son actually left the movie to do his homework! The only positive outcome of this movie was that now I know how to make my son do this homework, just tell his only other choice is watching Ronald McDonald's Wacky Adventures. My daughter, threw her Beany Baby at the TV! She not only wanted me to shut the movie off, but she said that she never wants to get a happy meal for McDonald's again! Let me just say, that this movie was a HUGE downer. I recently saw the movie Dude Where's My Car? and I can honestly say that it was more entertaining. If that doesn't tell you something, nothing will.
