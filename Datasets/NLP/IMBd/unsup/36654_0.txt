For the first half of the film, as it actually attempts to make some sort of a story involving the theft of the Pink Panther, this movie almost works. However, when there are no more outtakes, or even scenes to steal, from the other films, the movie fades quickly as the entire story shifts to a memoir of Clouseau's life.<br /><br />Some have noted that they found Richard Mulligan to be hysterical. I thought the role was boring and very unfunny. Joanna Lumley, on the other hand, was a treat. She did not have much to work with, but made the best of it. <br /><br />I saw this film after I saw 'Curse', and I was shocked at the number of scenes played out in 'Curse' that were in this film. In some ways, 'Curse' is almost the same film as this one, with Ted Wass playing the Joanna Lumley character.<br /><br />Again, if you need to see the whole series, then watch the film, but it is nowhere near any of its predecessors.
