In the beginning of the film, the bad acting from the two old people shows you what kind of movie watching experience your in for. Right after that, we go to a charming funeral scene where a daughter slaps her father and that is hilarious, really the only entertaining second of the film.<br /><br />The blond lead role chick looks like one of the dumb sluts from the "The Hills" show (whatever the hell that show is about, I still don't know, or care).<br /><br />Oh, and driving while smoking and listening to your iPod is a winning combination. But at least that particular scene leads to our first kill, which is pretty good, its distribuingly inventive.<br /><br />Right after the 1st kill, we get to the requisite unnecessary sex & nudity, but during sex scene this ridiclious music with over the top soaring strings is playing, its stupid.<br /><br />At least the production value is OK, but the scenes of dialogue are really useless, and really awful horribly done. Whoever wrote that dialogue really sucks and hopefully will never work again and be killed. The attempts of a "deep" story are really lame. The rock music used is really lame LAME ass San Diago sissy pop punk KRAP! And they continue to play the damn lame ass weak pop punk over whole scenes of dialogue, it really makes no sense at all.<br /><br />At least the Tanya character is really hot, but ALL these people need to die. And what the hell kind of lake is this? Did they just dig a big hole and fill it with water and neatly put rocks around it? People that make these movies are idiots with the way they do stuff like that, they just suppose that they audience can't tell how awful and stupid their sets look.<br /><br />The hot nudity that takes place is really excellent at least. Where are the girls that act like that? I want to find a girl that says "Lets see if you have the wood to light my fire" What??? A girl that hot is going to have sex with a guy in the woods an hour after meeting him and say that???? Yea...<br /><br />The death scenes are pretty excellent and effective, all the actors do a much better job dead than alive. And its nice to hear an original score, but its really just highly derivative of other horror scores, especially Friday the 13th, John Carpenter, and Stravinsky.<br /><br />Ohh, anyone reading this review MUST BE WARNED!! I have seen hell and it is when the sheriff kisses the old woman!!! Phuking nasty!! So nasty makes me want to hurl, literally made me gag, and is making me gag thinking about it right now.<br /><br />But overall decent gore and good shooting of the old woman in the head.
