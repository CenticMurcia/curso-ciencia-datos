This is probably the worst adaptation of any Sherlock Holmes story I have ever seen. Though the setting and characters are the same, the plot doesn't even resemble the original story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. If you know anything of Doyle's works and Sherlock Holmes, you will be sorely disappointed. If you don't, you won't learn it from watching this story.
