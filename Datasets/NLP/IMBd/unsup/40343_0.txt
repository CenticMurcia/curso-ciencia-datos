I've never felt the need to come to IMDb and actually write as to how horrible a movie is, but in this case I believe this to be necessary. This movie will be forever ingrained in my memory as "THE" worse movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />The acting was awful, the directing was atrocious, the cinematography was uninspired and the score gave me a headache (people please stop playing heavy-metal music every time someone gets into a fight...it's boring).<br /><br />What it basically is, is a major cringe-fest. I couldn't even listen to it with the director or the production comments, cause there was nothing that could possibly redeem it (not even the end credits).<br /><br />So...I give this movie a 1, because IMDb doesn't have a 0.
