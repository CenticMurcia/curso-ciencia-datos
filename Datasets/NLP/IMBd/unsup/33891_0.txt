Being a fan of good well made Aussie films, I thought I'd check this film out. Heard it won a few awards so I thought "it must be good". What a let down this film is. The acting is terrible. Gary Sweet was a good actor once, not anymore I'm afraid. Or maybe I'm being too harsh on him and he was just very badly mis-cast. I did manage to sit through the whole film though, but kept asking myself "what message is this film trying to say". I never figured it out. Archie Roach sings too much on the soundtrack. If I want to hear him sing, I'll buy one of his cd's. Another dud Australian film, which proves to me , that the quality of Australian films has declined since the good old 1970's & 80's when all the classics were made.
