For me, the most disturbing thing about this film was the zombie-like family at its centre. Isabelle Huppert's deadpan performance is matched by the two children, who react to their father's murder with no more concern than if their car had broken down.<br /><br />Although a number of scenessuch as extended shots of the three walking and walking and walkingare slow and seemingly pointless, the film nonetheless jerks erratically from one scene to another as if footage has been accidentally lost. Plot twists are ridiculously contrived, as when the son disappears in the middle of a pitch-black night for no reason, and the daughter then does likewise, simply to allow an untended fire to get out of control.<br /><br />Given a better script, a more competent director, and characters capable of enlisting the viewer's sympathy, this might have been worth watching.
