I wanted to like this, really. But Robin Williams' character is just TOO unlikeable and completely over-the-top. Sometimes this works for characters but it just doesn't work here. (I'm not religious, but I felt uncomfortable with the Reverend Frank character's antics...what with the healing the bloody nose business and rules and such. I know this is a movie and thus not a real depiction of any reverend, but still...it was very discerning to watch. ) I absolutely adore Mandy Moore, John Krasinski, and Robin Williams but this - I don't know who's to blame- script? director? - is just horrid. I couldn't finish watching this movie. And what was with the choir boy? Very very creepy to make a "mini-me" of an already unlikeable character. I just think it's a shame because I feel all the actors could do so much better work....Two stars go to Mandy and John because they did an okay job in this movie. But everything else just drops flat. Too over-the-top.
