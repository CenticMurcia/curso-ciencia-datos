The series are mediocre. Director's work is just invisible - good actors play well and not-so-good actors play not-so-well. Camera is static, special effects are cheap. The Cat Behemot is just a joke. Rimsky is not supposed to be a clown as shown. New character played by Gaft is added for a very obvious reason - to educate new generations who cannot read between lines in the book. But what is more important - the series are missing Bulgakov's spirit and sour sense of humor. Only scenes that are supposed to be serious and sad look attractive. Clearly the series are made for people who have never read the book. I agree with the previous reviewer - very disappointing.
