Vincent Price plays James Addison Reavis, a government clerk in a land office in Arizona, who tries to swindle his way to owning the entire territory through forged documents and an elaborate plan that the film does a good job in bringing to life. He sets up his plan by establishing a false identity for young Sofia (who becomes beautiful Ellen Drew) which makes her essentially the heiress to the whole Arizona Territory. Price pulls off the part with great talent, playing a womanizing opportunistic scoundrel with great smoothness. The story is pretty good when Reavis returns to the Arizona Territory with false documents in hand and starts to implement his plan to become the Baron of the whole territory after marrying Ellen Drew, the so-called Baroness de Peralta. It's her love and devotion to him that ultimately undermine his plans, though the government was starting to get on to his forgery. The film tells a great story and Price is at his best in this role, trying to reestablish the Spanish Empire in the Wild West.
