I have to say that this is the worst video game I have ever played right next to Eragon. It is repetitive, slow, and the graphics hurt your eyes. Never play this if you are a major Spiderman fan who is looking to play a great game for it is NOT! Get Ultimate Spiderman or get Spiderman 2 if you haven't already. I thought the movie was bad enough, they didn't have to ruin the game.<br /><br />Graphics: Crap. It is horrible and it hurts your eyes. Watching Spidey swing through the city is probably the worst graphic problem this game has. This is coming from someone who doesn't really care about graphics anyways. 1/10<br /><br />Story: Ehhhhh... It has it's ups and downs but mostly downs. Repeating gang missions is really annoying and Sandman doesn't come in way into the story. Venom is as bad as the movie, maybe worse. It is short and extremely easy. 3/10<br /><br />City: I've seen better. The city is definitely not as great as Spiderman 2 or Ultimate Spiderman's. It really needs improving here and there and WHY can't I die when I jump off the Empire State Building. That was really fun in 2.<br /><br />Overall: It sucks. 2/10
