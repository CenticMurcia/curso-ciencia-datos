I saw the film at a packed out cinema during the Sydney Film Festival. I have nothing good to say about this film. The characters were very low quality animation, hideous to watch for nearly 2 hours but I stayed. Luckily I am a huge fan of Altman as somehow his film 'Short Cuts' 1993, is mentioned in the promo for this film and my immediate thought after seeing the film was 'can I ever watch Short Cuts again without thinking of this crappy film.' Simply a vehicle for weak and meaningless cracks at religion with a pitiful gratuitous sex scene thrown in and it evoked very little of the ordinary life in the characters which was my expectation from its advertised linking of Short Cuts. Maybe they meant bacon short cuts at the supermarket as that was a huge porky. I unfortunately wasted more than $9.99 on this film.
