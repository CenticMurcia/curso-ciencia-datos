Marlon Brando explains as an Indian guru the title of this highly weird and boring movie, the girl who is named candy stands for C and Y, you get it!? The problem is that Brando not really explains what the c and the y stands for. The girl who seems to come out of space makes a journey through the United States from her high-school in New Jersey to New York and all the way to California from where she takes into space again. What i really tried to figure out when i was watching this movie is why do all these stars show up in this movie, the only explanations i can think of is that they lost a bet or the cast was blowing their heads off during filming. Fact that it was made during the sixties makes you suspect the last option!
