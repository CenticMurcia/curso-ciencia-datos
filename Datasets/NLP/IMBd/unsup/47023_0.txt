it doesn't age well.<br /><br />No real plot--Bing Cosby and Bob Hope fall into "hilarious" misadventures with princess Dorothy Lamour. <br /><br />Now this IS colorful and fast moving...but it just isn't good. The jokes are bad and VERY dated ("Sadie Thompson slept here"????) and not even remotely funny. It's also chock full of incredible sexism (some of the lines had me cringing and EVERY woman was falling for Cosby and Hope--who were in their 50s) and pointless song and dances. Cosby + Hope's opening number shows us why vaudeville died and poor Lamour is introduced singing a terrible number with ridiculous moves (and half nude dancing girls there for no reason whatsoever). Crosby DOES have one good romantic song and the three of them have a fairly humorous song but that's it. Everything else is lame and tired.<br /><br />Hope and Cosby were great in their time but it's long since passed. Cosby did have a beautiful voice and some great songs--Hope also had his songs and some very funny comedy but none are evident in this movie. Lamour is just there for the men to ogle. The only amusing parts here were a few asides to the audience but I really didn't laugh once.<br /><br />Tired, dull, sexist and unfunny. Sadly I have to give this a 1.
