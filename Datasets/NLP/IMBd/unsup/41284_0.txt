This movie was not the greatest movie I have ever seen. This movie was below average, it had its lame acting moments and random scenes that didn't make the movie flow. The acting I think could have been a lot better, I mean one of the main characters, Dr. Landis, couldn't even cry she looked as though she was in pain with a two tears. The flow of the movie was pretty good, however; it had some random parts. The storyline I thought was believable. I only hope that someone doesn't take the movie's idea. The ending of the movie was OK, but it was predicable in my opinion of Dr. Landis and President Howard. Overall the movie was decent however it isn't a number one blockbuster. The actors and all who were involved did a very good job making this movie.
