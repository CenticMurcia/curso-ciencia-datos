The other reviewers are right. Horrible acting, horrible direction, and a half-witted story line make this one of the worst movies I ever rented. The movie is amateurish at best, and you're sure to find better films on youtube.com. They must've had like a 1,000 dollar budget. And it all went to Cobbs. I thought that little picture on the cover was for some independent film award, but it's obviously recognition for longest home video. It's not scary, nor suspenseful. It's actually an embarrassment to all movies that don't suck this much. My only question is this: Who is that idiot that gave it a good review? He must be blind, deaf AND stupid.
