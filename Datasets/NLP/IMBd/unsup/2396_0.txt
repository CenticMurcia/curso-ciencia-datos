It's very rarely that I get a chance to see an action film that has depth and introspect. Rarer still, is the film that has a prophetic nuance to it that touches the heart and drives home a powerful message. 16 Blocks is such a film. The touted star of the film is Bruce Willis, who plays Jack Mosely, a drunkard of a cop on a self-destructive path to oblivion, saved by the least likely of people - Eddie Bunker, the habitual thief with a heart of gold. Mos Def plays Bunker, in a driven performance that brings tears to the eyes as he tries to survive 16 Blocks of mayhem on the way to testify against crooked NYPD detectives. The quirky Bunker is really annoying at first, but his honesty and gentleness shows depth that should win Mos Def an Oscar, or at the very least, an Oscar Nomination.
