It follows the first book in the trilogy very faithfully. Many scenes were actually just as I had imagined them while reading the books.<br /><br />The photography is breathtaking and the sets amazing. According to scholars of fourteenth century Norway, the attention to detail in depicting every day life and customs is very authentic.<br /><br />The costumes are beautiful and the actors, without exception, perfect for the parts. We were riveted!<br /><br />Buy the DVD with the uncut version and extras. Definitely worthwhile watching more than once... or twice... or thrice....!!!<br /><br />I hope Liv Ullmann will film the other two books as well. And soon!<br /><br />Don't miss this remarkable movie.
