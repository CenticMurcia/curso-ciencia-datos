I actually liked the film. I see that it isn't quite popular around here but for me it was fresh, hilariously Irish and darn entertaining. The taxi driver was my absolute hero with this horrible accent and honest, stupid face. I loved the merry soundtrack, the muddy scenery and all the nice ladies dying in a mockingly nasty way. Not to mention the 'thanks' waving of the crippled zombie or the furry cocker-spaniel hand-made shoes of the warrior. There wasn't much of an explanation why these Bronze Age bodies resurrect but I didn't need such: they do, that's all. Meet the consequences. As a matter of fact, the not-so-dead primitive warrior looked a little bit like the Bulgarian Prime Minister, so I really enjoyed the movie in the company of two beers. It gets ten out of ten from me. Sheer amusement. Of course, the movie isn't as good as, say, 'Event Horizon' but it's still good enough.
