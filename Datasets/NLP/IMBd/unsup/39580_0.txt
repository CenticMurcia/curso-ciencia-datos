This movie is a great Fictional creation (just like, let's say stories made up like in Star Wars or Star Trek) although it lacks in the whole story, characters are clumsy and so on - the movie is OK (3/10). The main subject makes you think about this whole suspended imagination and alteration of reality, for example if the Chinese won't dance the way we intend them to dance, we'll paint them a few movies that will change people's reality regarding the Chinese; great no more wars!... too bad it's just fiction in the end.
