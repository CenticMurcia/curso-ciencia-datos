Golgo 13 is one of the most interesting anime movies, if you can get past the first half hour. That part of the movie is just to set up that Golgo is the ultimate assassine but the film makers already did that with the first look at Golgo. But once it gets rolling, get ready. It goes full throttle and never lets up. This movie contains one of the coolest shots ever, tracking a bullet Golgo fires through a building. The animation is a mix of hand drawn, comic book frames, and computer animation making it one of the most interesting movies to look at. This is a must see anime, along with Akira and Ninja Scroll. 10/10
