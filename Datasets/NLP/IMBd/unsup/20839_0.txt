This was on the other night on SBS really late (for those not in Australia this is the foreign channel). Being a big fan of Japanese horror films I waited up to watch it. Its really not bad! The film opens with a particularly gruesome death scene - which got my attention straight away - and it is suggested it was caused by these people using voodoo dolls. We are then introduced to a high school and a new girl at the school. Lots of strange things happen at this school, perverted teachers, mysterious deaths, suicides and the like. It seems that the new girl is in fact a witch and is investigating all the evil occurrences until one night when 13 students are locked in the school and they have to escape or die trying from those trying to summon the devil. Nothing is really explained, some character depth , but very little. Being Japanese Horror there is of course a fair level of unnecessary sexual scenes (girl on girl). Being female I found this quite amusing, but if you don't approve of completely unnecessary sex scenes I'd give it a miss. So all in all good horror, no plot connecting, sex and violence - ingredients of a good B grade horror and all the better because it is Japanese B grade horror, which is always much classier than our B Grade horror! 4/10 Don't rush out and buy it but if you come across it it is worth a peek.
