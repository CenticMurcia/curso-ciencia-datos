For fans of Adam Sandler such as myself, this film epitomises his comic acting abilities. Having seen most of Sandler's titles, this is by far my favourite in terms of down-right hilarious moments and entertainment from start to finish.<br /><br />With a cast of comedic characters providing the viewer with memorable quotes which will keep you laughing for hours afterwards, this film is without a doubt one of the funniest films I have seen to date.<br /><br />An interest in Golf is not at all essential to the enjoyment of this film, as its humour and light-hearted storyline are at the essence. With witty one-liners and slapstick violence, this film will have you crying with laughter.<br /><br />All in all, this film is great family entertainment with side-splitting humour and a subtle moral underline throughout.
