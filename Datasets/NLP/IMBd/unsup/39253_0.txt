The truth is that I am a big Van Damme fan. Yes I said it. I do not think that he is a good actor but movies like Blood Sport and lion Heart were entertaining no matter how cheesy they may have seemed. But Double Team is completely different on all levels.<br /><br />Forget the fact that like any Van Damme movie, all character and plot development are non-existent, this movie still finds a way to suck to a new level. It is nothing more than a desperate attempt by Rodman and an aging Van Damme to try and be hip and cool and show us that people can work together no matter how different they are. Garbage! This is the only Van Damme movie that i had to stop in my life. It was so boring that i got depressed for about an hour afterwards.<br /><br />There is nothing good about it. I actually recommended it to my best friend at the time because i told him that it was the worst movie ever made. I have watched countless cheesy action movies and suspense movies but this is truly the worst. Imagine watching dust collect for an hour and a half and then you get the exact idea of what it was like watching this movie.
