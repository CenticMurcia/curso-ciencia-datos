A creepy Victorian house surrounded by fog. Things that go bump in the night (and at other times). Creepy servants, scared children. A twist you can see coming a mile off (unless you've never seen a film at all like this before). Well made, solidly but unspectacularly made, and technically perfectly competent, but with a story and an ambience that is nothing new. Anyone who has seen 'The Woman in Black' (on stage or TV) or any of a score of British ghost flicks of the 1960s or 70s will find everything here amazingly familiar. That 'The Others' is being touted as a possible 'best film' for 2001 is a extraordinary (unlike the film).
