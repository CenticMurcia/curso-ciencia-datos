When I watch something that is listed as a comedy, I want it to be good and funny. What's this? It's not good. It's not funny. So what is it Fez? What is this thing you call a television program? Hey Fez guess what: YOU SUCK! And That 70's Show have lots of really bad episodes too. So as far as I am concerned, you are retarded and dumb! Go kill yourself now. Nah don't do that, but seriously, your show blows chunks man. "Yo momma so fat she really fat!!!" OK you see stupid bullcrap like that is what's ruining America. Unless you wanna be responsible for ruining the Americas, then please stop with gay shows like Your Mother.
