I consider Lorenzo Lamas to be one of the top 10 douche bags in Hollywood and I STILL felt sorry for the guy being in this horrible flick. It's one of those typical God awful movies they play on Sci-Fi channel when it's "Dinosaur Week." Terrible on all aspects- script, acting, CGI effects (on par with the Xena or Hercules TV shows from a decade before). Just all around BAD. The next time it's on TV you may want to watch a few parts just for a laugh but trust me, you will quickly be flipping the dial to the Home Shopping Network or some such dribble. Probably best just to stay away from this one... Seriously, anyone giving this film more than a 2 (and that's just for the unintended comedic elements) needs to see a shrink fast!
