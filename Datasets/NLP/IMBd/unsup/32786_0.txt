This is among the top three most terrible films I have ever witnessed. I kept waiting for it to have some kind of theme or point. There is absolutely none. Its not even worth my typing these words except for the idea that I might spare someone the curiosity. Don't be fooled, this movie doesn't have anything to do with the synopsis on the back. There's no manifestation of "the seven deadly sins", there is nothing remotely interesting in this movie. It never wraps itself up into a remotely understandable, sensible package. Its just drug use after abusive situation after drug use all twisted up in a largely boring cafe. Unless you're looking to see Heather Graham at her worst, don't see it.
