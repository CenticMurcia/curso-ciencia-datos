Being a golfer and a fan of the sport for many years, I was very interested in seeing this, which I did when the VHS first came out. Later, I saw it again because of the same reason plus I usually find Glenn Ford's films entertaining.<br /><br />Well, the story moves well, it didn't bore me, but I did have problems with the accuracy of it and the general theme of the film, telling us that Hogan really was a nice guy who cared lot about what the public thought. From every account I have read, and from a couple of people who met him or knew him, that was not true. The fact is that he was a mean SOB and remained that way most of his life. This movie looks like it was made by his press agent. It's ridiculous and ruins what otherwise is an inspiring story.<br /><br />No one can deny Hogan's achievements on the links and his incredible desire to win against all odds. The fact he could come back and play after a near-fatal auto accident was amazing....but I would not watch this again because it was too subjective and just not the truth.
