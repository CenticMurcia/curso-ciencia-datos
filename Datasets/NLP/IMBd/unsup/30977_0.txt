William Keane is a man living in agony.<br /><br />Our first encounter with him is at the New York Port Authority Bus Terminal. He is desperately trying to locate his six-year-old daughter, abducted some months earlier from the terminal. There is no help or support as he returns daily searching for clues to her disappearance.<br /><br />As William recklessly walks into traffic, does a line of cocaine, drains a beer in one gulp and accosts a man he believes may be the perpetrator we begin to question his sanity.<br /><br />Does he have a daughter? If so, has she been abducted? Suspense builds as William begins a friendship with a young woman and her seven-year-old daughter. The woman entrusts Keane with the care of her daughter when she leaves to sort out her marital problems in another city. This turn of events, coupled with William's erratic behavior introduces more questions.<br /><br />Will he hurt this little girl? Leave her unattended? Confuse her with his own daughter? Director, Lodge Kerrigan could have presented Keane as a one-dimensional character living on the fringes of society, lonely, unstable and isolated. Fortunately he has given us much more to think about in this complex and deeply humane film. The intensity of the plot was sustained by a riveting and unforgettable performance by Damian Lewis (best known for his role in Band of Brothers).<br /><br />Keane is a powerful character study of a man grappling with profound despair brought on by loss. Mr. Kerrigan obviously has great sympathy for his subject.<br /><br />I left the theater knowing how easy it would be to inhabit Keane's nightmarish world of insanity if my own daughter disappeared.
