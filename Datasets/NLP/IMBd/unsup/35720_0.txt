I rented this film on accident; I thought I was renting The Hills Have Eyes part 1. That didn't turn out to matter though, because nearly the entire contents of the first film have been conveniently spliced in to this flick. A double feature? More like ninth circle of flashback hell.<br /><br />Now, film-hounds will tell you that the flashback is a weak cinematic technique but that a skilled director can sometimes pull it off. These people assumed the dreamer was bipedal. When a DOG starts having flashbacks... My God. I was so young.<br /><br />My rating: 2/10. A documentary, perhaps, on how a horror films can go wrong, akin to the "Teenagers: Don't Drink and Drive" flicks shown at some high schools. Avoid.<br /><br />
