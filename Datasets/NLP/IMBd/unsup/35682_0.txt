This movie really sucked. From the police response to the bitter end, it was really bad. I can't believe I wasted two hours. How many lines to say it was bad. Yasmine was bad. The villain was good. The police were totally unbelievable. The husband was bad. This must have been a Junior High Project. I can't believe Lifetime showed this. The daughter was bad. The grandmother was bad. Mostly, everything was bad. OK, it looks like I've got six more lines to type. I don't usually care about writing comments about a movie, but I feel so strongly about this being a bad movie that I'm here trying to create drivel about how bad this movie was. The police were so totally unbelievable, ya wanted to gag. Why does it take a restraining order the whole movie to invoke?
