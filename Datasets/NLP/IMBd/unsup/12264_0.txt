This classic all-black adaptation of Marc Connelly's play attempted to break some ground for the role of blacks in film, but it comes through today in a mixed mode. There are some touching moments in the simplicity of faith. But my agnostic feelings interfered with the total enjoyment of the film. Also, most of the cast perpetuate the stereotyping at the time - that of blacks being simpleminded human beings. Still, there is much to enjoy, especially if you are religious minded.
