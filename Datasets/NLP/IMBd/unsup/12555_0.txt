This movie was super cute! CATS RULE! I love the idea of cats trying to take over the world and dogs trying to stop it. Just cute! Although, when the dog was taken in the beginning, shouldn't it have been dog-napped? Oh well. Still it's a cute, warm movie. Especially if you're in a silly mood or have young children!
