anyone who played the wing commander series from start to finish will recognise the characters in the film, especially wing commander:prophecy. The plot itself is simple yet easy to follow. Matthew Lillard is up to his usual standard, and is perfectly cast as "maniac". Anyone who watches bbc's Holby city may recognise a few members of the crew also. all in all it could have been better, but then it could have been a lot worse.
