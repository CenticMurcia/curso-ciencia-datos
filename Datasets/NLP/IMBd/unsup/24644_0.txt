Contrary to popular opinion.....this series was the scariest, next to Boris Karloff's.."Thriller"! The accompanying music along with John Newlands' melodramatic "matter-of-fact" voice, made for the some of the most "frightening" television watching for kids (like myself) growing up in the 50s & 60s. So much so, I slept with my parents after watching a few episodes. Rod Serlings' Twilight Zone was good...but not "scary"..even some episodes were down-right "funny" !!! Not one of "One Step Beyond's" had a humorous episode! And I suppose, that's why they don't show any re-runs today, because most people are "wimps" and can't handle the "real" scary stuff...like.. "Aliens", "The Thing", "Predator", The Hidden, Nite-Flyer and "PitchBlack" just to name a few.....I sure wish I could get my hands on that series.!!!!
