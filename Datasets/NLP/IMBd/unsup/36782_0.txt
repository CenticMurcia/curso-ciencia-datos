When you see a film with such great actors, and fantastic scenes, real masterpieces, you ask yourself what went wrong , that the sum of it all is very unsatisfactory. In my opinion, when people go to the movies, they want to enjoy themselves. They do not mind seeing a depressing film, if there is an idea behind it that will stimulate them intellectually. This film has no great idea behind it, it is just depression for depressionÂ´s sake. I think I saw the most cruel scenes I could ever think of and what for? The happy moments of this film, like when Val kisses Bridget Fonda on the balloon, or when he is making love in his office are just great. Vince Vaughn is quite impressive as the bad guy, and Dwight Yoakam is a convincing Val. It is a shame that Peter Fonda and Billy Bob Thornton have such small parts. The westerns of the fifties had a certain cheerfulness in them, even when the story was sad, and that is what is lacking in this film.
