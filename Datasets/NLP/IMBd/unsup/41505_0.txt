This movie. . . is one of the movies I will never sell. To watch this entire movie is a feat indeed. The acting is horrible, the camera shots are just as bad. . . but I always have a good time watching it, because it is just so fun to notice everything that is wrong in this film. As a marine I do get a little sick when I hear the big red neck guy use his chucks and scream out "thats the Marine corps boy!" The best way to describe this movie, is a student film with a rich father budget. You get a real good kick when the "villains" chase down there targets in . . .PT Cruisers, than after they throw there prey to the ground, they simultaneously, and inexplicably turn there backs and look at a wall for no reason. Watch this movie with friends and have a good time. If you have a sense of humor, you'll have a good time.
