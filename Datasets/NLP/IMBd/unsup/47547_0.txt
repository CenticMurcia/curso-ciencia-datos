ONE OF THEM is not so much a devil-worshiping movie; it is rather an evil demon-worshiping movie.<br /><br />Whilst no one should expect anything novel in a straight-to-DVD movie, few will be prepared to face the torture of being subjected to more than 90 minutes of the garbage contained within this movie. Even if I can successfully warn just one person to stay away from it, I will be able to sleep more peacefully at night.<br /><br />The low rating coupled with comments made by some other reviewers may fool some fans of straight-to-DVD movies into thinking this is one of those so-bad-its-good movies in the vain of TROLL 2 or CHOPPING MALL. Well, I am sorry to disappoint but it is NOT.<br /><br />The beginning of the movie actually starts out quite promising. A young woman is walking around a busy city late at night. Many things suggest something is wrong, she is being followed and some strange people are around. Some suspense is created straight away.<br /><br />The young woman travels to a graveyard and is killed not long after by a figure dressed in a monk cloak.<br /><br />The story shifts to a group of youngsters travelling down a dark road. A swarm of insects is summoned up out of nowhere and a car wreck ensues. The movie continues to be interesting up to this point.<br /><br />But, the story takes a turn for the worse soon after.<br /><br />The remainder of the movie takes place in some stone built academy and the grounds surrounding it. The academy is totally out of place in this movie, and looks more like something from South West England rather than the United States! I kept expecting Christopher Lee or some druids to show up, but alas it never happened.<br /><br />What takes place in this academy is little more than youngsters sat around dining tables or sat on rocks outside babbling nonsense and there are a few interactions with the creepy people who work there. All of these youngsters are the stereotypical brainless morons who are hardly adverts to become the next Einstein! According to others who have reviewed this movie, the people at the "academy" are dead students. It goes to show how confusing the plot was because I completely missed that element! Anyway, it is revealed later in the movie the dead students worship evil demons that in return give them eternal life. Naturally, the demons want them to kill before granting them their wish. Because none of the mystical demon-worshiping elements suggested by the plot outline are focused on in an interesting way, the movie descends into nothing more than a very sub-par slasher.<br /><br />The pacing of the middle section is very slow. You never get the sense any of the characters are in danger and all attempts to build up suspense are completely wasted. A few worthless flashy images are placed but provide no meaning to what is happening elsewhere. The villains in the movie do not seem the slightest bit scary. All the young male characters behave like total sissies. And the acting is as bad as one would expect for this type of movie. One guy is attacked with a knife and just lies down on the floor like a complete sissy saying "f*** you" to his killer. The guy playing the teenage brother of one of the main female characters looks as though he'd rather be somewhere else. In every scene he's in, he has this expression on his face that says "what the". I know how he feels! There are a few sporadic killings done in a variety of different ways but even these killing scenes are very lame and forgettable. One or two funny moments are to be had (such as the guy sucked into the wood chipper), but that's it. The killings are also confusing  sometimes a person killed is seen again later in the movie without explanation as to whether the killing was real or imagined. One character slits her own throat for no apparent reason! As is the case with this type of movie, the youngsters very quickly forget about their comrades after they've been killed.<br /><br />Just when it feels as though we are going to learn something, the plot becomes more confusing. And there is not even an attempt at a decent twist ending. See the ending for yourself to find out what I mean.<br /><br />In short, this movie is bad, and not in the good way either. Aside from the interesting 10 minutes at the beginning, it has no redeeming features. The characters are generally annoying or boring, there is absolutely no suspense after the beginning, and the movie is not even funny in the so-bad-its-good way either.<br /><br />Many of the other reviews here criticise the straight-to-DVD market as being full of trash. I agree with that. But, amongst all such movies, you will find minor classics or examples of the so-bad-its-good calibre (BACHELOR PARTY MASSACRE for example). ONE OF THEM is neither  it is just a worthless piece of nonsense that has probably already been forgotten by everyone involved in its production.
