I'm extremely critical when it comes to television and there aren't many shows around that I DON'T pan. Survivor happens to be one of them. I can't get enough of this show! For me, it's really more of a game show with a mix of reality, drama and characterisation thrown in. The best part is that fact that these are real everyday people and not actors, who are thrown into a fantasy situation and left to their own devices (most of the time). I also enjoy the way certain characters grow on you and others are repulsed as each season draws closer and closer to the end. For some strange reason I particularly find the contestants more attractive when they're in their natural state and in their element than when they're back in the studio, all "glammed up" and civilised. I wonder if I'm alone in this...<br /><br />Survivor Cook Islands happens to be my all time favourite at the moment. I don't understand the controversy surrounding the division of teams by racial background. I'm of Asian decent and I loved it! People will always judge and stereotype others by the way they look and this was a perfect means of showing the world how race alone is an unreliable measure of an individual's character. Americans seem to be so sensitive about these issues sometimes. Political-correctness is so ho-hum in this day and age.
