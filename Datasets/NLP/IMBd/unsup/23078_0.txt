This is another outing for Speedy Gonzales, the fastest mouse in all of Mexico, however in this cartoon most of the laughs come from Pablo and Fernando, two of his friends who have had too much tequila in the taverna. As the stagger home they decide to pick a fight with an alley cat. Luckily for them Speedy is at hand to rescue them, although as soon as they get rescued they are back trying to fight the cat again meaning speedy has his work cut out for him.<br /><br />The combination of English and Spanish is well done, even if like me you don't speak Spanish it is easy to figure out the gist of what they are saying. Some people might not like the suggestion that Mexicans like their tequila a bit too much but as it is done in a funny way and didn't suggest that they were all like that, just those two I didn't think it was offensive. Definitely worth watching for a laugh.
