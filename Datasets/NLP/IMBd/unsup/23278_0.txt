'The Amazing Race 5' is the BEST of all six complete seasons to date. If you've never seen the show, I recommend this season over all others. Why? Season 5 had a combination of interesting and amiable teams as well as original locations, only 2 of which had already been visited in previous seasons. The 'Bowling Moms', Linda and Karen, added a lot of fun to the show - they were almost always lively and seeing them go so far on the race (to 4th place) was a highlight. Although I liked Colin and Christie, seeing Chip and Kim win was great - it was unexpected - and this is what added to this season's success. What I particularly liked about the locations visited was that producers for the most part avoided Europe (save for Russia, which was interesting) and visited other places, more interesting places, like South America and the Middle East. I'm just hoping that CBS releases the seasons on DVD - if they do, choose this one! 5 Star Entertainment - so much more refreshing than Seasons 6 and 7.
