"A mysterious mansion holds secrets and terror for the owner and visitors alike in this thriller, based upon a classic stage play. Cornelia Van Gorder has taken up residence in an old mansion that was the scene of some mysterious deaths years ago. The recent owner of the mansion was a banker who had embezzled money and had hidden it somewhere in the mansion but, he was killed before he was able to retrieve it. Now it appears that someone is stalking the mansionÂ…" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />This lesser re-make is most appealing in that it stars enjoyable Agnes Moorehead (as Cornelia Van Gorder) and features fine support from Vincent Price (as Malcolm Wells) and Lenita Lane (as Lizzie Allen). Ms. Lane is an exceptional employee, you'll have to agree; she also served as director Crane Wilbur's wife. Lane and ex-"Our Gang" member Darla Hood (as Judy Hollander) ended their feature film careers with "The Bat". Little mystery, some suspense.<br /><br />**** The Bat (8/9/59) Crane Wilbur ~ Agnes Moorehead, Vincent Price, Gavin Gordon
