Sometimes one must wonder how some pieces of cinema could be allowed to see the light of day. The person responsible for this film should have tossed the original into the nearest wood-chipper. The film quality was terrible, the sound quality was worse, the plot was dull and the acting was shockingly terrible.In fact, the movie was so bad that it is worth a rent! Despite my vote (which this movie truly does deserve) I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. The effects aren't too shabby, and the lack of talent makes this movie laughable. After all, it isn't entirely the actors' faults that the writing was so terrible. The movie is so abominably lacking that it makes for a fun 93 minutes. My advise is to grab your friends, sit down in front of the television and prepare to laugh.
