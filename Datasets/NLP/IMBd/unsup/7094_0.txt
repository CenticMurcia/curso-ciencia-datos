When I first watched this show, I was little disappointed but after watching it again. I could see this is a fine show about two real life actors like Dame Judi Dench and Michael Williams (who did receive a papal knighthood) playing two odd characters like a linguist and a landscaper. Judi plays Laura, the intellectual linguist, and Michael plays Mike, the quiet shy landscaper. At first, this is an unlikely pairing but you know if you know anything about the great Dame Judi Dench (even though she prefer you call her just Judi, no Dame Judi or Ms. Dench). This is their romance. While Dame Judi receives a lot of attention, Michael is the wind beneath her wings. I paid a lot more attention to his role in this show. I can see why she fell in love with him. When Judi asked about her longtime marriage to Michael, she responded that "they just enjoyed being in the same room together." Now that is a sign of a fine romance and an excellent relationship. Michael never did receive the fame or accolades as his wife but I know he was proud of her even now as she earns one of Britain's top honor, Companion of Honor, only 65 living people at a time can receive this honor. When Dame Judi earned her O.B.E. (Officer of the British Empire) in 1970, Michael was not there in her life. When she became Dame Judi, Mike and her daughter, Finty was there at the palace. Now, she has her grandson, Sam, and Finty for this special occasion. I will say the writing of this show could be better. The humor is much dryer than normal, it is very cerebral and intellectual. Susan Penhaligon and Richard Warwick are just fine as Laura's sister Helen and brother-in-law Phil. It really is the story of Mike and Judi's great relationship. I bet you that Judi loved doing this show with Mike. It gave them a chance for both of them to shine.
