The film is a documentary, but it has so much drama and passion it felt like a feature film. I loved the juxtaposition of the various characters presented. It gave it a real 'cliffhanger' feel, and I also felt like I was there in the middle of the action.<br /><br />The execution of this film is formidable. With a complex subject such as this, it could have been boiler plate predictable. But instead, it brought so much heart into the mix I felt compelled to participate in the debate from my theater seat. And, humor and love play a big part in the denouement. It's just impeccable.<br /><br />This film is a moving, authentic look at an issue that should not even be an issue. I'm hoping more people have the opportunity to experience this film and understand the importance of participating in our democracy.<br /><br />Joanne Fish
