This is one of the first Bud Abbott and Lou Costello movies that I had ever seen in my life. I wanted to see this back all of those years ago because I had heard that it was funny. So I decided to watch it when it came in. When I saw it, I thought that it was really funny! This is not one of Abbott and Costello's best movies that they ever made, but it is totally worth watching, especially for fans of Abbott and Costello! Well maybe another reason that it is very hysterical is the fact that it was made in 1944, which was during their very popular years. Bud Abbott and Lou Costello are the greatest comedy duo of them all! <br /><br />They had some very funny routines in this movie, some of their funniest in fact, I have not seen one Abbott and Costello routine yet that I did not think was funny. I think that all of their routines that I have seen are hysterical! Good old Bud and Lou are the kings of laughter, I don't know where I would be without them, I think that if I was without Abbott and Costello, the world would be a whole lot different, especially without Who's On First.<br /><br />If you really want to see Bud Abbott and Lou Costello in one of their funniest movies of their early 1940's years, then I really recommend that you see this funny movie, you will be laughing as Abbott and Costello getting into a lot of trouble, but then again, that is just typical for Abbott and Costello, everywhere they go, they always manage to get into trouble! <br /><br />9/10
