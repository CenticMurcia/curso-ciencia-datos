I thought that the newer movies must have recycled all the jokes from old comedies like these and made these movies insignificant. But the charm that is present in this movie isn't present in most of the newer comedies. The plot itself is very good, and the direction sees to it that the movie doesn't get too serious or unfunny. I especially liked the fact that the movie was short.<br /><br />Cary Grant is excellent in his role.His acting is so funny, especially his dialog delivery and his facial expressions. He done't overdo it and fits his role perfectly. In fact, he should have received an Oscar nomination at least for best actor. Then there is a charming actress by the name of Irene who too is cast perfectly. The two share a wonderful chemistry that is one of the best that I have seen in movies. The supporting cast is great, especially the neighbor and the old lady. <br /><br />The direction is great. I especially loved the movie because I was not expecting such a movie in the thirties. It looks much newer, mainly because of the jokes. The ending is great and this movie is too good. 10 out of 10.
