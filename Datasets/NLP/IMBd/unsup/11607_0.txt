This is simply a masterpiece. There is a fantastic story line, there is just enough of the whole one dimensional character aspect to so many of the baddies here, but wonderful explorations of De Niro's and Grodin's characters. Truly, the film explores right and wrong and comes up on the side of the Angels. Angels with dirty faces maybe, but Angels nonetheless. No commentary on this film could be complete without remarking upon De Niro's incredible comic role. I haven't been moved by any of his comic turns since... indeed upon reflection, could it not be suggested that Raging Bull was in essence, high class comedy? Never mind... a piece of magic.
