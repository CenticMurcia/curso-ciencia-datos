This show is kind of like the Mexican version of The Sopranos. I would say this show is more like the Mexican version of The Godfather movies though. The main character is exactly like Al Pacino's character in The Godfather movies, Michael Corleone. Like Michael Corleone, the main character Miguel Cadena is patient, violent when he needs to be and donates money to the Catholic church. This is a extraordinary mini series. If you like Mafia movies or the hit televison series "The Sopranos" that airs on HBO, you'll love "Kingpin". The show is about a Mexican mobster, Miguel Cadena (Yancey Arias) who takes over the family business after he has the acting boss (Jacob Vargas - Traffic) shot up beyond recognition by guys with Uzis, and the original boss who was on the run, shot twice in the forehead by a .50 Desert Eagle automatic. The show also stars Sheryl Lee (John Carpenter's Vampires, Twin Peaks) as Miguel's coke-addict wife who aside from being his wife is also his and his other associate's lawyer. The mini-series also has the story from the D.E.A.'s point of view, including a young female D.E.A. agent who was severely wounded by a bullet she got from a crooked Mexican cop working for Miguel's old boss. This show is really entertaining, and really plays like an HBO series. Watch all six episodes on NBC which show on Sundays and Tuesdays at 9:00, untill February 18. Grade: A
