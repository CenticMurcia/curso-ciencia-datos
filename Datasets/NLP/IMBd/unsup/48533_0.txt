Sure, it's a fine melodrama, but I expected more comedy. I know that this movie really deals more with morals, but we already got the message halfway through the film. Now don't get me wrong, all the performances by Adam Sandler, Kate Bekinsale, Christopher Walkin, David Hasselhoff, et al are wonderful, but this movie just wasn't what I expected it all to be. I was hoping that Adam's character's journey would be more of a funny try to pull everything together. There was too much sadness in this movie, and even you get confused as to what had happened in the fast-forwarded time. Early on, the comedy was right on key, but after that, drama took over, and very limited humor occurred from there on out. Overall, "Click," while it is a very nice piece of work, just doesn't click for me.
