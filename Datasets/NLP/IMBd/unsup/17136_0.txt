Will we be talking about a "rockumentary" film twenty or thirty years from now featuring performances by "N'Synch", Britney Spears and Red Hot Chili Peppers? I would think probably not. <br /><br />BUT... HERE is a film, though made more than thirty years ago, with performances by some of the greatest artists of their time, many of which are STILL performing today! This film was as close to a religious experience as it could be. I, too, would buy this film, should it become available.<br /><br />And, I, too, ask the question regarding the soundtrack album: WHERE the bloody #$*@&( ~! is CHUCK BERRY?????????
