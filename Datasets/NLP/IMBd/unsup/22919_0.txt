Interesting film having four stories running parallel with lot of emotions and twist. Mumbai at September 2001, really nicely pictured. The stories are about:<br /><br />A young doctor Rahul who has got an admission into a US University, but has some personal reasons (that u can see in movie) and is in dilemma. Besides this how will he manage his expenses is a question. But he has a rich friend Khusboo(Ayesha Takia) who has more than soft corner for him. Tillotamma Das(Konkona Sen Sharma) who is married (newly wed) to a software engineer Hemant(Jimmy Shergill) settled in USA after an internet romance. Nicely pictured scenes as Hemant has to leave for USA and Tillotamma has to be in India with her in-laws(with her mother in law, father in law and sister in law, who makes her crazy except her father-in-law. She wants to be with her husband anyhow, how she does that and reaches America. A stockbroker, Salim (Irfan Khan) who has got green card and who has a very nice brother Javed. But Salim has his own personal thing (attachment with Namrata a older woman). But she do not love him as much. When this is disclosed he find him in a strange situation and thinks like cheated. He also goes to America. He tries to forget her but can't and this scene is very nicely pictured when he is America, with title song. Fourth character is Paresh Rawal, playing role of Rajabhai who takes money from people to send to America as part of dancing troupe. He met his old love Tara who asks him to send her daughter to America. Anyhow he decide to do that though he was very practical in Business, and leaves for America<br /><br />How and What happens is the basic concept of story and the title song "Yun Hota.." is very melodious(to me) and is nicely presented. The scene when Irfan is standing in tower and sees airplane is also good. The acting by all is very good, the newcomer who played the role of doctor has also given a very natural acting too. Well i recommend to see this movie
