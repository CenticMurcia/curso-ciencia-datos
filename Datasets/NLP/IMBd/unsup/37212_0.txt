***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** i gave it one star because this is supposed to be a true story. it was not. it was a one sided tale of a "dangerous hacker" and the trouble he caused. not only am i mad the "true story" was wrong on details, i'm equally pi**ed about the amount of "hacker fluff" that is presented. ok spoilers follow.. the fbi agent goes home to find his water, gas and utitlities have been turned off.. ok, that could happen.. sure. or the bit about the super virus... what crap. oh, the biggest piece of crap was the part where shimomura goes to his cash machine and instead of getting money it flashes "free kevin" at him instead. what utter crap. i hated this movie as it was neither fair to kevin, nor hackers in general.. it does nothing but foster public fear of hackers and what hollywood says they are and can do. never once did they mention that kevin was held without even so much as a bail hearing for nearly 5 years. no charges were profered, nothing.. only after over 4 years of being locked in prison, sometimes in solitary confinement because they thought he was so dangerous, was he offered the plea bargain. of course he took it.. after 4 years of prison without bail, without even a bail hearing, i think anyone would take it.
