first off , why isn't this on DVD? it really should be, especially if you consider he fact that joysticks is now available on DVD. this movie really is an instant party as well as a non-pharmacutical cure for groans etc. i first saw this flick on hbo, when i was eight, didn't see it again till i was 15 and found it in a video store, i rented it over a hundred times and eventually wore their copy out. i now own 3 copies on VHS, with no vcr. this should tell you something about me and the movie. basically we're both insane. the movie is full of great 80's players, and really great music, everything from oingo-boingo to the stray cats to the circle jerks. if your starting up a DVD company, or you already have one do yourself & the rest of the cinephile community a favor & release this film! if you've never seen this film by all means check it out, you'll never fully recover.the only other truly 80's lost on DVD classic i can compare my love for this film to is student bodies. now repeat after me -- "buzz is the cola that we drink, we must have it, come and get it-buzz!"-- quit reading and watch the movie!- f.c.
