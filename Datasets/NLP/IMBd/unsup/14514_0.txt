Every girl alive can relate to this movie. If you were a young woman in the 1970's even more so but it holds up beautifully as well because it rings so TRUE. Denise Miller was amazing in her role and just bang on with the feelings and reactions of girls the world over and Rex Smith was just yummy and perfectly cast as well. I didn't particularly LIKE the actors playing her parents but I even really liked them in these roles, very much so. Everybody did a great job. It's so true, so funny and cute and just a great movie I can watch it again and again and the sound track is GREAT too. I was a young woman taking guitar lessons in the mid-1970s constantly madly in love with the long-haired guitar playing boy of the week - so I can really relate to this movie but I think all girls can just as easily. It's a very warm and sincere movie that always gets to me. The cake-eating scene is done with such raw truth, I'm just in awe of the job that Denise did in so many scenes, I couldn't possibly name them all.<br /><br />10 out of 10 for the TRUTH that it portrays so beautifully throughout.
