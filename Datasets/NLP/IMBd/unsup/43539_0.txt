This is an OK film as long as you aren't expecting much, definitely leave your brain at the door.<br /><br />The plot is nothing new, no original thought here. The acting is actually quite good although it's sometimes hard to judge the acting when the dialogue is this bad.<br /><br />The main problem is that all the "surprises" are obvious, you won't be surprised by anything in this film, the plot twists can be see long before they arrive and they have all been used elsewhere. <br /><br />The plot is also a bit nonsensical with characters behaviour, the villains in particular, not being believable.<br /><br />The directing is terrible with annoying visual effects thrown in for no real reason.<br /><br />All that said this is watchable trash if you are looking to kill a bit of time.
