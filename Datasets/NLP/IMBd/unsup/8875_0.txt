I saw this movie many years ago,and it was plenty scary,especially,the part,where the mother wouldn't let her daughter in the house,unless she brought food,so she went to get food and on the way back,she saw white eyes looking at her,and she started to run,she got to her mothers house,but it was to late,she gets attacked by a leopard and her mother sees blood coming from under the door,when she opens the door she sees her daughter laying dead,that is about all i remember about the movie and often wonder if it will ever be released on video. i really would love to see this movie again.i would like to see if the movie is as scary as when i first saw it.
