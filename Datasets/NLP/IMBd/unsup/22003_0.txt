I bought this film for nothing in a Chinese market and sat down to watch it. The only thing on the cover in English was the title. For the first ten minutes I was trying to decide whether this film had been made by some kind of movie school in the UK or not, but to my growing joy I was proved wrong. <br /><br />Set in some town in New Zealand(Aukland maybe), the film is basically about a day in the life of a bunch of 'hard men/wise boys' out to get back something stolen from their leader in a mugging. The story has obvious flaws - but tell me one that doesn't.<br /><br />The dialogue is absolutely spot on. This is how we really speak. At least the gentlemen I know speak like this "you're a knob jockey" being a fine example that comes to mind.<br /><br />Upon close of the film I found I had come across a great bunch of characters and all in their own way likable and recognisable from my own experiences. The lead duo I thought were superb, and you can tell while watching the film they were enjoying themselves. It's all done with a great sense of fun and lust for life. <br /><br />If you are interested in watching a well made film, full action, great dialogue, magic characters, funny as hell - and without the biblical references, social pap, bare knuckle fighting and blood (although Mr Richie does this well) political correctness, etc. etc. - then here it be. Marvelous work! Lets have another one.
