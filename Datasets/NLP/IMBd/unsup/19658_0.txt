The Pros<br /><br />To me, the premise is hilarious - Stalin's love child.<br /><br />I'm always happy to spend two hours watching Judy Davis. I think she's just great.<br /><br />I saw this movie just before I got sick of seeing Sam Neil everywhere and I remember thinking he was neat.<br /><br />The world of Stalin is absolutely hilarious. F. Murray Abraham pulls off a number of macabre gags with great presence.<br /><br />Also, it's a wry look at political activism and some of the poses that resemble it.<br /><br />The Cons<br /><br />Gets boring after the first half and the premise doesn't add up to much.<br /><br />Worth seeing just for the courtship of Stalin alone.
