Severely flawed sequel to an amusing and beautiful original. The CGI dragon is very well animated but the lighting is all wrong and the voice acting is pitiful (not to mention the regular acting). The original film relied heavily on the charisma of Sir Sean Connery's voice(!), so it is no wonder that this film lacks the charm of its predecessor. The film seems aimed towards kids and possibly young teenagers who tend to be somewhat underdeveloped in the intellectual department. The whole production has the feel of a 'Young Hercules' episode (especially the campy martial arts sequences), which is not a compliment...<br /><br />NeofreemaN out.<br /><br />
