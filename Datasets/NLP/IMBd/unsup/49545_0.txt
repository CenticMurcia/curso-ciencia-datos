"Haunted Forest" failed as far as originality and the general storyline was completely ubiquitous and inconsequential, but while actually keeping me JUST interested enough with it's very unusual look. The majority of this movie takes place in broad daylight, under clear skies, in a forest full of roads... Sure, not the best setting in which to derive "scares", yet there are some excellently perpetrated scenes involving ominous and jolting ghost encounters in a genuinely - and dare I say - refreshing way! Many shameless and creepy split-second moments, plus a decently strange ending kept the movie "alive" throughout it's runtime, though it is difficult to ignore the shlocky and convoluted premise and over-used, rambling explanation including dead Native Americans, a soul inhabited tree, and a crazy hunter with some kind of "curse" upon him... This was all weak and pretentious drivel that I couldn't have found less affective. My biggest gripe over "Haunted Forest", aside from the previously mentioned and the lack of gore, would definitely be the ungodly horrible acting. Was there even any dialog in this movie? There might as well have been none... Such boring characters and just the sight of them, at times, tempted me to cease my viewing of the film. Also, the ghost began looking more and more like that of "The Ring", and those close-ups of the eye and the draping, black hair annoyed me. Overall, it has it's mildly enjoyable features, though nothing of any great necessity for horror fans...
