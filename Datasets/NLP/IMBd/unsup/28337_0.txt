Laughably melodramatic would-be erotica, a far cry even from the only other 2 Luna titles I've watched (which were themselves lower-tier efforts)! To begin with, Anita Ekberg (who appears briefly as the title character's larger-than-life drunken termagant mother, named Greta Gustafsson!) delivers a scenery-chewing performance; likewise, Jorge Perrugoria as the loutish egomaniac who drools over the girl all through the film is surely one of the most obnoxious characters I've ever had to suffer! While Italian sex symbol Valeria Marini tries, she's hampered by her babyish voice - not to mention the exaggerated moans during the love-making and the fact that the couple's relationship never convinces for a second (if it's supposed to evoke "l'amour fou", it's a pathetic attempt)! The subplot involving Marini's gay brother's desperation over unrequited love for an imprisoned stud (which is all magically settled by the end) is merely boring. Really, the only attention-grabbing element - apart from Marini herself, that is - is the score; the pet goats are cute, too. Actually, the version I watched may have been cut as the "Stracult" book mentions an unforgettable sex scene involving eels - but, here, this is over before it has even begun as we're rushed to its messy aftermath!!
