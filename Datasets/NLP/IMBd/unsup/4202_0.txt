In the lawless town of Dodge City, Errol Flynn stands up to murderous cattle boss Bruce Cabot and refuses to sell him his livestock. Soon he's the new sheriff and dead set on cleaning up the town, including Cabot and his cronies.<br /><br />One's degree of enjoyment is entirely dependent on how much the viewer buys the casting of Flynn as a rough and tumble western hero. In my opinion, he was certainly handsome and charismatic but not entirely credible. I spent the whole movie trying to figure out what accent he was using! Still, I enjoyed the movie enough to recommend it.<br /><br />Alan Hale and Guinn "Big Boy" Williams were great and stole nearly every scene they were in. The best part of the movie was the much ballyhoo'd saloon scene where Big Boy pretty much incites a riot!
