I was watching this movie, and at first, I was enjoying it and finding it somewhat powerful. The dance sequences were undoubtedly remarkable and as were the performances. I began to enjoy watching it, but about two- thirds of the way through, I began to get tired of the sappy bonds between Baryshikov's and Hines's characters. Also, the escape scenes give the movie an unneeded "Hurry up, GO GO!" feel to it. It is frustrating to know how good this film could have been with how remarkable the performers are and with its powerful storyline.
