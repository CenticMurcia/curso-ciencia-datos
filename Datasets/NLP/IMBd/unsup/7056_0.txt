It's obvious that the person with the negative view either expects a 'kung fu' film and didn't get it, or more likely never saw MR VAMPIRE...<br /><br />In order to enjoy this film I should think a little background on both Chinese mysticism and Hopping Zombie films are in order. <br /><br />I won't do either of the honors, but instead refer you to the Illuminated Lantern website where you can get at least a primer on both. <br /><br />AFA the film goes, I gave it a 7 out of 10 as it's a little disjointed, and lacks the flow of any really good Hopping Zombie film. But hey, at least someone whipped one of these out in the 00's, ten years after the genre died out. Kudos to Tsui Hark for that!
