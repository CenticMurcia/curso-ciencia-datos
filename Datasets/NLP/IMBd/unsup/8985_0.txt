This was a great film, superbly crafted. The two stories were not given equal time in the film, as they should not have. Although Selma Blair delivers, what I believe to be, her best performance to date, her "story" pales in comparison to the "Nonfiction" part of the movie, which gives a much more real and brutal account of Mark Webbers character, Scooby.<br /><br />I would rather not give a plot summary nor deliberate on inconsequential details of the movie, but suffice to say this is a must see! While it may not be as eloquent as American Beauty, Storytelling provides a wonderful snapshot into the psyche of high school and college life wrapped in some extraordinary circumstances. This film is a testament to despair, self loathing and personal struggle.<br /><br />The ending is, perhaps, the crown jewel of this film. It made my jaw drop and, in fact, I sat in front of the TV for a number of minutes before I regained my senses. Side note: I had to watch "Fiction" twice, as I failed to see its correlation to "Nonfiction" when I watched it the first time.<br /><br />My vote: 8 out of 10
