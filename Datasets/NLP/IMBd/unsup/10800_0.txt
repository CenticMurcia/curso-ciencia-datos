A bunch of horny teens having a hot weekend at an isolated cabin get viciously attacked by a werewolf. The group wussy and his mechanic gal-pal soon learn that finding the identity of the beastly perp may lead to answers that hit a little too close for comfort. Meh. I know this one has its fans, but I couldn't get into it. I felt like I was watching a mash-up of a bad "Sci-Fi Original" with The OC or some such wretched teen show. There's loads of ridiculous dialogue ("Shut up and put your clothes on!" being a highlight), incredibly bad CGI, and a villain that spews one-liners like Freddy Kreuger (but less funny.) I thought it was borderline unwatchable.
