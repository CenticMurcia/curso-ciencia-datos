Urgh. I got to watch this on the basis that Eric Schweig was in it. Let me tell you first that you see him for maybe 3 and a half minutes, so this is blatant false advertising.<br /><br />I am kind of fond of bad cheesy horror, but this is not a funny bad movie. It's unfunny painful and boring. It's unfunny silly. It's unfunny badly acted. The beast sucks. I didn't even laugh.<br /><br />Stay well clear, please! There are much better bad horrors out there, many many many more. Don't get conned by the fact that Eric Schweig is listed ....you'll barely see him (thankfully in a way).<br /><br />3/10, because 1 and 2 star are reserved for real low-rated gems. This is too insignificant to deserve such.
