So many holes in this film, so many. I have no idea what it was trying to be, if its intentions were to be artistically driven metaphors etc, or if it was just a bad idea. If i were either Dorff, Rea or Mcelhone i would be embarrassed with the result. It is as if they lost pages of the script during the production, or they wrote it while they were making it. The characters had no depth at all, and it didn't make sense why Mcelhones character as a health department investigator hung around trying to solve a case that had nothing to do with the skills she had. It was like she became a police officer for a while. Also, Rea's character was a strange parody of a delusional madman, trying to be meaningful and purposeful with his depraved acts. And what website was he broadcasting to? Fear dot com wasn't his website, and the relevance of the girl, his first victim was unclear. How\why was she the only victim that wanted revenge? Why did she kill people who didn't find her body? It must have been her website. Why did Dorffs character flake out and become useless as soon as he viewed the website, leaving Mcelhone to do everything? Yet he then became well enough to go and finish... blah blah blah. It is not worth writing about anymore, I assure you that this is one of the worst horror films, no, one of the worst films ever made.
