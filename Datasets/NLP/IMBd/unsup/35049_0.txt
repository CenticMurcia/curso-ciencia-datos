This movie is deliciously dated.<br /><br />The dialogue is outrageous - especially the scene in the classroom when one of the male students talks about Christopher Columbus going to that "deep pool" of the Alantic Ocean with his "non-stop studs" - which now, out of context, sounds more like a line from a gay porno flick instead of a 1950s b-movie (!).<br /><br />Like many teen romps of the late 50s, the sound track is way cool, with Jerry Lee Lewis doing the opening theme song.<br /><br />Lots of fun. Mamie Van Doren as always, is a treat. The cast includes a lot of people who were in a bunch of 50s flicks together - Jackie Coogan, Russ Tamblyn, Jan "Female on the Beach" Sterling, etc.<br /><br />If you like this film, you'll also like Mamie in "Girls Town".<br /><br />
