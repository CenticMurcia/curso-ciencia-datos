Sorry if anyone actually liked this, but no. Just no. This is such a pathetic excuse of an action-packed cartoon. It also felt out of place (Meaning, the shouldn't have ever aired on Nick). Even if this was aired somewhere else, this would still be a pretty mediocre show. 3 Martians come to earth and become friends with ugly-looking corny kids. The other cast members are also so bland and boring. Whenever the martians go into their "BKM Mode", they just get suits, which aren't very creative.<br /><br />I consider this piece of trash a pathetic combination of Invader Zim (Martians sent to take over the world) and Jimmy Neutron (It's computer generated and the martians have a Goddard rip-off.)It seems as though this show was scraped together after Invader Zim was released and when Jimmy Neutron was in production back in 2001.<br /><br />At least Nick is still smart enough to know when they need to cancel shows. And thank God this show only lasted one season. But, as other reviews say, this should never have been aired on Nickelodeon, or probably on any other TV Channel.<br /><br />So, PLEASE, never watch this show if you do happen to find it on TV or if you see a DVD for sale in stores. Nickelodeon fans saw this, and suffered through it when it aired. If Nickelodeon actually makes more shows like this, then they are screwing up the minds of the next-generation of kids. Nickelodeon used to have great shows most of the time (mostly during the 90's), but then all that changed with Butt Ugly Martians appeared. Stay away from this lame and stupid show.
