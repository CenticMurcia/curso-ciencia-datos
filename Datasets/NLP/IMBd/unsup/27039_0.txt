True Vengeance delivers lots of hardcore action for all you martial arts fans, but the plot had some room for improvement. Being the action buff that I am; I loved this movie. David Bernhardt is going to be the next "Van Damme". If you liked the way he handled himself in True Vengeance then you definitely need to check him out in Bloodsport 2 & 3. This movie is definitely action packed.
