I had SO much hope and hype over this film. Watching it finally nearly drove me to suicide. What in the name of the planets is this? I thought they were playing some kind of 80 minutes episode of a parody of Hercules. The plot of the film is absurd. Some unknown barbarian who hails from Atlantis (yes, Atlantis of all places) tries to join a noblemen's army, gets rejected and humiliated, and ends up being their King because the dying King thinks its comical that a barbarian should take a crack at it? We get to see the real Kull now after he gets the crown. The typical and oh so unoriginal hero who has no flaws, treats women with respect, thinks there should be no slavery and he makes it a point, and gives an occassional grunt to remind he is after all under all that heroic visage, a barbarian. Gimmie a break. The dialogue is hilarious when the movie builds. Some good moments when Herc.. I mean Kull insists there is no Island of whatever the frozen wastelands is and Ascalante with a quick retort, "yes there is!" Or, the excitement and the adrenaline building up in your body watching Kull clumsily trying to escape from the guards and mouthing the infamous word, "S**t." Needless to say, when any of the characters begins to talk, it kills them right there.
