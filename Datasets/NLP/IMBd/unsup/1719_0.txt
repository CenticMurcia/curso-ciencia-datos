This movie reminds me of a painting. The opening shot of the film is one of the best i've ever seen, and the emotion this film creates throughout if you open yourself, is something few movies can do. The story wasn't anything great, but the storytelling, WOW! The director manages to get the right amount of energy and tone from his actors without it becoming boring or melodramatic. Instead I believed what I was watching. The closest surreal experience I can compare this to is with something like the "Exorcist" or "Being There" or some aspects of "Wonder Boys." In other words the director/film makes you feel cold and confused at times, but never really loses you or me.
