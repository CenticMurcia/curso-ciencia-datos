CURTAIN UP is a routine British comedy which fails to raise anything more than the slightest titter. I dread to think what the movie would be like without the considerable talents of Margaret Rutherford and Robert Morley in the leading roles, and even with them it's pretty dire 'entertainment'. The plot quickly becomes tiresome, a weekly repertory company is rehearsing a dreadfully written play, "Tarnished Gold". The producer, played with gusto by Robert Morley, quickly falls out with the play's authoress, the marvellously eccentric Margaret Rutherford, and after the first rehearsal he rips out 27 pages of the 30 page script. Adding to the 'fun' are the problems, tantrums and behind-the-scenes squabbles of the play's cast, which seriously hinder the rehearsals (and also the film). One of England's greatest post war character actors, Sam Kydd, makes a fleeting appearance at the finale, as an ambulance man. The only genuinely funny moment in 80 minutes is Morley's facial expression when Margaret Rutherford turns up and says "I've come to sit at your feet while my child is being born!"
