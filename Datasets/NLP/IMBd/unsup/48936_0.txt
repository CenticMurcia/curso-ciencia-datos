I don't want to vote for this movie but I find it very low from the Americans to remake an Asian movie and to get (or will get)a bigger success then the original movie.I want to criticize the American movie industry because they are not original. It is better to search for original ideas then to play the role of the copycat in our society.<br /><br />I wanted to say my opinion to those who appreciate the American movie industry so much.(and surely this movie)<br /><br />good examples of remaked movies are : the ring , the grudge , the seven samurai, Godzilla , (masked rider) and more (they planned also to make an American version of Battle royale)<br /><br />Even if they remake it well they will never win my respect and i will consider it like fake.<br /><br />thank you
