This movie was by far one of the top worst comedy's I've ever seen. There was nothing good about this movie. It was horrible in the beginning and it was even worse at the end.<br /><br />While watching this movie I just became frustrated with it. I wanted to see a comedy. I knew the movie wasn't going to be a great comedy but I at least expected a few good laughs, but instead I got nothing. That just really sucked.<br /><br />If you want to see a comedy, well then, you should rethink wasting your time, and just wait until something better comes out.<br /><br />Don't Waste Your Time
