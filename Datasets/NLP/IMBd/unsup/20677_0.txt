If you like a sexy psycho drama in historic context, with big European star power, this film is for you. The lives of three people tragically clash in this story of oppression, forbidden passion, betrayal and revenge, all this in the face of death. This is an unusually good exploration of the human condition under duress. It also offers us the opportunity to see three of Europe's super stars being and looking 10 years younger. This includes a teenage looking Julie Delpy, and a sexy Hanna Schygulla in her last role as a seductress (albeit as the older woman of the threesome, about forty years old). Available in NTSC English subtitled video, at least in Canada. Check it out.
