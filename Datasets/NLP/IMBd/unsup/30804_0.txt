<br /><br />A lovely movie. Forget comments about the (apparently) "overt" love/sex scenes. If this was a movie featuring straight/heterosexual love scenes, such comments would not be made.<br /><br />An interesting symmetry with the original . . . Anne Heche appeared (as actress) in the third story of "If These Walls Could Talk", and here directs and writes the third story of "ITWCT 2".<br /><br />Michelle Williams (so very different than in "Dawson's Creek"!), Chloe Sevigny (always excellent), Sharon Stone, Ellen Degeneres, and (most importantly) Vanessa Redgrave give excellent performances.<br /><br />A lovely, lyrical examination of lesbian love - and indeed love and life in general - throughout three very different decades.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />You'll laugh . . . you'll cry . . . you'll love this movie.
