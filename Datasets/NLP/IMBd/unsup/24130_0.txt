I saw this movie in December of 1968 when it was first released in the US. I was in High School, had just turned 16. This movie was rated "X" (noone admitted under the age of 16). I remember it being somewhat disjointed. When I think about it, I can't help comparing it (loosly) to the "Austin Powers" type of film, except much racier! By todays standards quite tame. It seems so campy now, but what a cast!! I'm glad it's on DVD now; I'll watch it again. I started being a movie buff when I was very young. My uncle owned the "63rd Street Drive-In Theatre" in Kansas City, Mo. from the late 50's to 1998. So I'm quite well-versed in cinema history.
