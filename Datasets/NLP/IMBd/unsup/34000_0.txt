I wonder... What could have made Linda Blair accept this stupid role in this sucky film? Did she want to mock at the original Exorcist? Really, this movie is so bad it makes you angry! We never get to realize why Regan is in danger, the priest's aim during the whole film is rather incomprehensible and all the "synchronizer" scenes with the light bulbs going rapidly in and out are so annoying! In fact, this film should be called "Exorcist II:The synchronizer"! On top of this, there are some of the stupidest lines that could ever be heard in a thriller and a feeling that the director wanted to fit in any wacky idea that came to his head in order to "scare" us.<br /><br />However, we have to acknowledge a couple of good scenes, especially the last one, the beautiful Africa shots and (although inappropriate at times) Morricone's soundtrack.<br /><br />4
