It wasn't horrible in the horrible kind of way. I actually think I Know Who Killed Me was a pretty good movie, aside from what most people think. Of course there was plenty of bad acting and definitely scenes that had no sense in them at all, but I am a sucker for a very SMALL amount of bad movies, and while this movie is kind of bad, I liked it. Lindsay Lohan makes her characters somewhat... likable even, and while the plot isn't the best, it is decent. It did not deserve all the razzies it got. Some of the material is just flat out stupid and raw, yet it entertains, and if blue is your favorite color, which it is mine, I'm sure you won't find the over-use of it annoying, haha. Well, this movie is supposively supposed to be one of the worst films ever, but I have a really big soft spot for it and found myself not being disappointed with it at all.
