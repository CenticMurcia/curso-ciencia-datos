Apart from being a terrible film with a bad script, bad acting and a bad storyline, this film had far too many errors.<br /><br />In the credits at the end of the movie it lists a Maarten Coatzee as the films Technical Adviser. Now the big question is, what exactly did he advise? The film had so many technical errors i felt like i was watching another amateur made Youtube movie!<br /><br />Now I've seen my share of bad Vietnam films, but this takes the cake!! M16-a2 and m655 carbine rifles being used by U.S soldiers, Woodland Cameo helmet covers, WW2 era uniforms, post Vietnam web gear, VC using Norinco Type 84S rifles instead of Ak-47s, VC soldiers with hairstyles like they just walked off the set of Tokyo drift, and to top it off, a military outpost built deep into the jungle with no perimeter wire, no field of fire, or guard tower to be seen. Its no wonder why they where over-run so easily. <br /><br />If you want to see a good story of Tunnel warfare in Nam, Watch the second episode of Tour of Duty titled "Notes from the Underground". For a TV show made 21 years ago, it sure does put this rubbish to shame. <br /><br />It really is sad that the Tunnel Rats of Cu Chi didn't get a better film. They sure deserve it.
