Okay first of all this is just like Dr. Strangelove and even more like Fail Safe. Both better than By Dawns Early Light. Several things would have never really happened. If space command ever detected missiles they would launch the bombers for survivability so they would have never been caught on the ground. The president would not have been allowed to stay at the white house for a minute. The Russian president would not have used the old teletype comunications system. They have a new computerized version. That's all I have to say. It was the worst movie I have ever seen.
