I liked this short movie. It seemed like a nod towards Shawshank while at the same time mocking Dilbert farms. They (prison and cube farms) are quite similar and I think this short film demonstrates this. The fact that they have Morgan Freeman's son playing his part was fun. The guy in Tim Robbins role was also a very close likeness. I ran across this movie on the Sundance Channel.<br /><br />I really liked the promotion hearings. It really felt like Shawshank in 30 minutes. You had to have seen Shawshank recently or more than a couple times to notice all the little things that this film copied so well. <br /><br />I only noticed a couple glitches or places that I didn't care for. The very ending scene while panning to see the sun I thought was a little overdone. But all in all I think they paid homage to The Shawshank Redemption quite well.
