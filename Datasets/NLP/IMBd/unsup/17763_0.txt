Other comments have already said it all. This film is superb and extremely forward-thinking... today, eight years later, all of the technology, themes, and allusions still make sense. This is Lawrence Lasker's last and greatest film as writer. For those of you who don't know, he wrote WarGames and Project X, two other great techno-thrillers. But neither of those Cold War films are relevant today, while SNEAKERS still is.<br /><br />Watch this movie again in the new millennium. You'll be amazed.
