I watched both the first and second pilots on youtube (go to youtube.com and type in Red Dwarf pilot). The first one was utter garbage, the only saving graces were the captain, Tau (played by a woman, she was very good). And, of course Holly. The actors playing Lister and Rimmer looked like they were choking on lines wrapped in painful barbed wire. The actor playing the Cat was utterly, unbelievably bad. And, poor Kryten (the original British actor), though good, looked bored with the whole affair. The sets looked OK, but the special effects were stock British Dwarf. Now on the other hand, the second pilot looked much better. My favorite there was Terry Farrel (later to play Dax on Star Trek Deep Space Nine) playing the Cat. She was fantastic. The actor playing Lister was pretty good in this one, guess he did a bit of practicing between pilots. But, the actor playing Rimmer was stumbling dreadfully on the character. Holly was very good in this one as well. American television has been guilty of stealing British sitcoms for decades. Three's Company, All in the Family, even Sanford and Son started out as British comedies, though translated well for American audiences. But, Red Dwarf is one of those shows that lose's everything it is in translation. This project was doomed from the start. It might have been promising if it was not translated, just imported. I give the first pilot a 1 out of 10. But,the second pilot I'll be nice and give a 4, if not just for Holly and The Cat.
