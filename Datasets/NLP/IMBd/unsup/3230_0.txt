It's hard to say with some Asian flicks whether they were made to be serious or if they were made as spoofs. If this one was made to be serious, it's also an excellent spoof. The story is not that much different from that of King Kong, except home base is Hong Kong & the Peking Man has been spotted in the Himilayas, so a heart-broken explorer and a team of men head off to find it. Our heart-broken explorer had just caught his fianc√©e in bed with a friend and therefore was ready for anything to get out of town, but maybe this...he finds the Mighty Peking Man but he also finds Ah Wei, a beautiful blonde who wears a ragged loincloth and top, who can communicate with Peking Man & also all the other animals in the jungle, except for perhaps a cobra, which bites her. Seems like she was in a plane crash with her parents years ago & they died but she lived with the animals. After bidding a tearful farewell to her favorite leopard (which is shown making choked-up faces when she walks away) she sets sail for Hong Kong with Mighty Peking Man chained to the deck of the ship, and from then out out it's more or less like "King Kong" only funnier. There's the obligatory shoot-out on a tall building at the end, and the usual treachery from those who don't understand. Strange that Ah Wei communicates with Kong in "native language" in the jungle but then in English towards the end, maybe he's as fast a learner as she is. Some of the earlier parts of this film are beautifully done, and somewhat fun and exhilarating, but it bogs down a bit toward the end with the seemingly endless shoot-out. There's some truly priceless bits in this, like someone getting their leg bitten off by a tiger near the beginning, and a gun battle with rear-projected elephants, and so on. A fun film, hopefully not meant to be taken seriously but if it was, you won't. 7 out of 10.
