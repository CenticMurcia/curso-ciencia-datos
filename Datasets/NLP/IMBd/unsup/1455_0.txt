I really loved this movie. It was such an enjoyable film due to the great chemistry between the two leads. I can't seem to understand why Sherilyn Fenn isn't a huge star. She brings so much emotional honesty and depth to her roles. Anyone looking for a fun movie with good acting and romance, this is it! Great supporting cast too!
