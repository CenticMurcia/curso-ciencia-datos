This is a fine movie - certainly the mst successful and wellknown og the new danish movies (that is within Denmark). I read that someone thought it to be racist... Hornestly that is just BS - and by the way DF only had about 15% of the votes at the last election and although many people want it to be racist it really isn't. It is just thinking more about the danish economy than humanlives (very typical for liberal and capitalistic parties). Racist has something to do with hate and in this movie there were no signs whatsoever of any kind of hate towards anyone.<br /><br />So many people always say that the danish actors are so good, but I really don't see it. Maybe it is because I speak the language and can much easier detect when something sounds a little quirky - whereas I am not as good at English and therefore might have trouble detecting their flaws.
