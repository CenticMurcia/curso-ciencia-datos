I read all of the premature reviews from the critics who just about all stated this was one of the best new shows of the season. I have never been a fan of The CW or WB/UPN for that matter and was extremely skeptical about tuning in. Man, glad I did. This show is so funny. I haven't laughed this hard watching TV in a long time. And I laugh a lot during The Office. Reaper is paced perfectly for the hour long format. I could never see this working as a sitcom. The interactions with the cast seems so real and natural. Sam and Socks chemistry is great as well as Sam and Satans. Everything clicks. Sure there might be some continuity issues but this show isn't made to be taken all that seriously. The plot all but says it shouldn't be taken seriously. This is a great show and is quickly climbing the ladder to become one of my all-time favorite shows. hopefully it can keep up it momentum. RECOMMEND THIS SHOW TO EVERYONE YOU KNOW. Let's help in its ratings. It'd be a shame to see this show disappear.
