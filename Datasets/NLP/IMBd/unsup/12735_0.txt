This story is charming and refreshingly uncontrived. Imaginative whimsy fills a tale that takes the viewer into a land overlaid by myth. The soundtrack is one of my personal favorites, filled with authentic Irish music. I highly recommend this for viewers interested in a movie that's a little different from the norm, but is still rich, innocent fun.
