Previous comment says comparing this to the '64 film should not be considered, and for good reason. It pales in comparison. The fact that it was live did not help me get interested in the least. I felt I was watching actors playing roles. Not that it was their fault that Henry Fonda was unavailable, but I never felt I was watching the President. I felt I was watching Richard Dreyfus playing the President. Why would Clooney remake this? Did he think he could do it better? Did he think the story needed to be retold? The Cold War ended 20 years ago and such a situation today seems completely implausible. Contrarily, the impeccable timeliness of the original kept you riveted. If the viewer, unlike me, is somehow able to remain seated throughout this whole production, there is little doubt they will ever sit through it a second time.
