This film is a little gem. Take two characters, down on their luck and of different ages, throw them together via sheer coincidence then add a series of spices in the form of insecure, nasty villains with just a taste of a road trip. We watch this film hoping anyone close to us will never experience the day to day life of the characters we meet. We are but onlookers, knowing that all that unfolds in front of us will not be terribly savory. But as the story unfolds we grow to like both the key characters because they have been forced into their predicament, and while they will be helpless for much of their plight their spirit will hold and eventually ring true. It is nice to be taken for a ride with a script that tells no lies and leaves us with hope. This simple little British tale is a gem. There is a lot to like about this gritty little film.
