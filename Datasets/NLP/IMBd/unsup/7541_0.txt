Just saw this movie at NYU with interview with director following the screening. He was as engaging and genuine as the film itself. This young man is a gifted director, mentored by Martin Scorcese, and what makes the film even more compelling is its basis in the true story of his own family's struggle to keep their lobster business "afloat." After the screening both the director and the director's father shared their emotions and anecdotes, and the audience could tell how much it meant to them to tell their story in this film. Aiello and Curtin signed on to do the film knowing that it would pay some $75 a day, so you know that the script was special and spoke to them on a deep, human level. I highly recommend this film and I hope everyone who can will go see it!
