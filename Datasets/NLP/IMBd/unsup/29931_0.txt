'Osama' is not this 'cute little foreign film'. <br /><br />It is, in the lack of better expression, an uproar. A cry for recognition of Asia's Poland, a country everybody has stomped on. A film that clearly shows that unjust people all to easy is allowed free play in too many places in the world. The only hope in this awful and tragic story is that it is actually told, that it's being told by the Afghans themselves, and that it's being promoted in the so influential West (only justice!). Leading actress 12-year old Marina Golbahari is the find of the year, director Siddiq Barmark is a genius. He presents this tale straightforwardly without falling into some sentimental pitfall, and for that he must be praised, 'cause it makes the story hit so much harder. <br /><br />Generally, Westerners don't see too many 'foreign' films. And that is a pitiful shame. There are not enough letters in the word 'masterpiece' to fully disclose the 'masterpieceness' of 'Osama' (which has no actual connection to the Arab maniac). It is one of the few films that will actually make a difference if this world is to become a better place at all.<br /><br />Recommends it strongly, but please, don't bring your sweetheart (either gender). Be prepared to be strong, for the end of this film hurts intensely deep into your heart if you have even the slightest sense of justice and compassion for your fellow human beings. <br /><br />An absolute must-see if one is at all fond of films. Or fond of other people, for that matter.
