What can I say about this movie?It's simply an utter garbage.The plot is completely idiotic(the killers roots on the loose)and the acting is lousy beyond belief.The special effects are laughable,the gore is non-existent.Very similar to "Seedpeople" but even worse.So if you are a fan of sheer stupidity rent this in pair with "Sorority Girls and the Creature From Hell".I am sure,that you'll laugh till it hurts with this turkey.Otherwise avoid it like a plague.
