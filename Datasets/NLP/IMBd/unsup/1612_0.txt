Crime Wave - Excellent 1952 crime thriller directed by Andre De Toth.This 73 minute movie moves at an excellent pace from beginning to end- with a superb cast of noir stalwarts - starring Sterling Hayden as the toothpick chewing homocide detective,Ted de Corsia,Ned Young(screenwriter of Decoy) & Charles Bronson as a trio of San Quinten escapees and the scenery chewing Timothy Carey providing the hideout for the thugs.Shot on location in Los Angeles this movie has so many great shots and the usage of light and shadow mixed with terse dialogue make this a movie worth owning.The DVD has a 5 minute featurette and a fun commentary by LA Confidential scribe James Ellroy and noir buff Eddie Muller.
