Quite literally, this movie was laughable. The acting is atrocious, my friends and I were busting up laughing in every single scene. It was fairly entertaining, actually, it is the sort of movie that will end up on Mystery Science Theatre 4000 in about 20 years. It looks like they blew all of their mid-level budget on the computer effects scenes, which are decent. The rest of the movie takes place in and out of various tents, and the Torus... which looks suspiciously like a laser tag arena that they rented for a few hours one afternoon. The plot is silly and obvious, the religious overtones are blatant to the point of being insulting. If you want to see a melodramatic cheesy sci-fi movie, this one delivers in spades.<br /><br />The hero looks like the Fat Elvis version of David Hasselhoff. Enough said.
