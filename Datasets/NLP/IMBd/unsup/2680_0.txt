I am not a huge Bunuel fan, and this isn't his best work. Nevertheless though this is great stuff, for some inexplicable reason we have two different actresses playing the lead role of Conchita. Why is that exactly? My theory is that Bunuel sat down and thought I wonder what would happen if I did this, so he did it.<br /><br />I won't go too thoroughly into the plot, but a man is basically tormented in different ways by a woman with shifting personalities (thus the two actresses).<br /><br />I liked this movie because it was so strange, the seventies were an interesting period.
