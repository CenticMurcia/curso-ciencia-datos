OK, hardly anyone can act. They try to put some energy into it though so that helps, but most of the people in here just have little to no acting skills whatsoever. The films has some sort of charm but it drags (I nodded off to sleep a time or two) and there really isn't much going for this film, but amazingly, I have still seen worse. There seems to be some sort of care put into this picture. The small cameo with David Carradine is OK, Carrie Chambers is well endowed, and then there is SNAKER. Snaker is one of the best thing about the film. I liked Snaker. "Snaker gonna make you pay!! Snaker gonna make EVERYBODY PAY!!!" With a little more effort, this film could have been in the category of the Italian post-apocalyptic knock offs like 2019 After The Fall Of New York, Bronx Warriors, etc. The film is worth a dollar and that's what I paid for it. I wouldn't want to have pay much more than that. Maybe two dollars. Maybe.
