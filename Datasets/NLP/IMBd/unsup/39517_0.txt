This has to be one of the worst movies ever made. I don't care if it was made for kids; it is excrement. Let's go through this travesty, shall we?<br /><br />1) Wow, I was not aware that apparently owls EAT such animals as cats and pigs! No, you've really seen it all when you see a pig scared of being eaten by an owl. Wouldn't it have made more sense if the villains had been hawks or vultures? Okay, then they wouldn't have hated the sun so much, but having owls wanting to eat pigs doesn't make any more sense!<br /><br />2) Story logic: Everyone believes Chanticleer makes the sun rise every morning, but then they see it come up without him, so they think he's a fraud. But then it turns out it DOESN'T rise without him. So what the hell? Why did the sun come up without him that one time? Is it able to come up by itself a single time, but then needs him to continuously do so? I saw this movie when I was 7, and was confused by that.<br /><br />3) Okay, so the sun can't come up and it's always night; why does that make it rain and flood as well?<br /><br />4) The live-action scenes are shot so terribly! Seriously, they look like a bad home movie.<br /><br />5) Edmond can't act, but if you think about it; his entire storyline is really unnecessary. You could just cut him out, cut out all the live-action stuff, told the whole movie as just a straight cartoon, and still have the same story.<br /><br />6) With all respect to Phil Harris and his long resume of animated voice work, I think he's one of the most annoying narrators in film history. "Well, shucks. Just imagine if one day the sun just didn't come up, but went back down." Then he just KEEPS ON TALKING, sometimes over very dramatic scenes.<br /><br />Patou: (narrating) If Edmond wanted to bring Chanticleer back to raise the sun, the Duke was going to have something to say about it. <br /><br />Grand Duke: Kittens are more digestible. <br /><br />Patou: (narrating) Young Edmond was about to have the most amazing adventure he'd ever dreamed of.<br /><br />Just SHUT UP! You don't need to tell us that the Duke is mad, we can see that. You don't need to tell us that Edmond is about to go on an adventure. Just let us enjoy the movie!!<br /><br />7) The climax: after going on this "amazing adventure," it all comes down to a stupid climax of convincing Chanticleer to crow, but he doesn't feel like it. So they chant his name over and over until he feels like it. Couldn't they have come up with something more dramatic than that?<br /><br />8) And what does his crowing do? Make the Duke shrink. I don't quite understand that logic.<br /><br />So in conclusion, the story is badly conceived, the execution is even worse, and the result is a mess of a movie.
