For anyone who hasn't seen the movie yet... Go see it! It will move you; not in the English sense, but the Hindi one... It will Hilao you! And it'll strengthen your will to stay on in this country despite all kinds of devilish plans! And you will learn why Govind Nihalani is one of our best directors.<br /><br />And even if this is stating the obvious, you will want to fall at Amitabh Bachchan's feet for being the actor he is. If it is possible to dwarf Om Puri, it's been done by Mr. Bachchan in this movie! In the Bandstand scene, he makes an actor of Om Puri's ability & stature look completely insignificant & pitiful. He's khaoed him!!!<br /><br />That's one point of view though. Another point of view is that Om Puri being the actor he is understood the Bandstand scene very well & enacted the scene in line with the story & the characters.<br /><br />Fardeen doesn't disappoint - he is as bad as he is in all his other movies. This is one actor who still hasn't learned to act, and probably never will.
