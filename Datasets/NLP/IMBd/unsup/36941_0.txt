"Jurm" is a film which is supposed to be a thriller, without actually being one. The film is very easy to predict, and lacks of suspense. Even though the film begins promising, it completely fails and falls in level afterwards. Vikram Bhatt is not able to maintain the suspense through out the film. The main problem with "Jurm" is that it has absolutely nothing new to offer. What you see has been seen several times before. On the top of that the chemistry between the actors is miserable as well. This is one of the few films where even Bobby Deol isn't able to play his part with conviction. Lara Dutta proves that being beautiful and sexy doesn't necessarily mean that you can act. Thank you! Gul Panag hasn't got much to do in the film. Milind Soman plays extremely artificially, and falls flat in front of Bobby Deol, in spite the fact that he is not playing well either. It is truly sad to see an actor of Ashish Vidyarthi's calibre to choose such a low level film, where he doesn't get the chance to play even 10% of what he is capable of.<br /><br />"Jurm" is a terrible film with terrible acting and has nothing new to offer. This one doesn't even qualify as being a time-pass movie.
