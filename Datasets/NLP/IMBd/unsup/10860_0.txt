Ignore those who suggest that this is nothing but retread for DePalma. On<br /><br />some levels, it surpasses his greatest films and is uniquely original. There isn't a performance in the film that's weak and the storytelling (both through script and camerawork) unfolds like a dream. Bloody where it needs to be and tragic in places you don't expect, "the Fury" is one of my all-time favorites. I saw it as a young kid in the theater and hope one day to see it again on the big screen.
