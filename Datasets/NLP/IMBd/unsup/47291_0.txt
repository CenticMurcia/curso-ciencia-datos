Aldo Sambrell plays Gato Nebo,a thousand year old Haitan priest who is decapitated along with his lover Kenya for adultery and murder.Then the film takes place during 70's and is set on a cruise ship to Port-Au-Prince,Haiti.After being awakened Gato Nebo starts decapitating various ship passengers with a sword.Add also a romance between reincarnated Kenya and her mummified lover and an absurd climax set in an ancient cavern in Kenya."Voodoo Black Exorcist" is an inept Spanish horror flick with fuzzy guitar score and phony looking beheadings.Outrageously silly script doesn't help either.Only for the discerning trash enthusiast.4 out of 10.
