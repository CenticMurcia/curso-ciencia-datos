The Final Patient (Released as 'One Step Closer' in the UK) is a truly engrossing film and you will find yourself mesmerised by the storyline. I've watched several films like this and have always worked out quite early on how the film will end, but surprisingly The Final Patient will have you confused throughout. The movie has only around 10 actors and most of it revolves around Dr. Daniel Green's house and it's inhabitants. The only let down in my opinion was the ending, I feel as if this was rushed and wasn't as good as I hoped it would be. But other than that, superb acting by Cobbs and I definitely suggest you rent this out.
