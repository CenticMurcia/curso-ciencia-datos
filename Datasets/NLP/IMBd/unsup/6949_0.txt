It distresses me that anyone who has watched this movie thought that it had any redeeming qualities. From the beginning, with totally unreadable credits, until the outrageous ending, it was a huge waste of great actors and expensive celluloid! If you know anything about film making, you know that entertainment is a larger priority than art. Although, most good films have one or the other. Great films combine both. Unfortunately this is neither entertaining nor is it art. I am disappointed that anyone thought this movie was good. I was especially angry by the good reviews especially the thumbs up. There is nothing remotely entertaining or artistic about this film, not even those adorable kiddos. To exploit those children for the sake of a film is unforgivable. No they did not shock me with any of their actions, they just made me sad. It also saddened me that any one those quality actors, involved in this film, actually allowed it to be released. I encourage anyone thinking about seeing it to pass it by.
