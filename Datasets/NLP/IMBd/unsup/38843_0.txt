So, I see a lot of other people have said good things about this movie, and I really have to wonder what they see in the movie that I missed.<br /><br />I see a lot of stories intertwined, marriage, fatherhood, religious references, survival attitudes, etc. But to me, it was just blah...<br /><br />If the intent of the movie is to make me feel what the characters are feeling, it is extremely well executed, I felt gray, lonely, cold, and like i wanted to kill myself rather than continue on to the end of the movie, but like them, i suffered through...<br /><br />I understand there is a time and a place for entertainment movies and a time and a place for "make a point" movies, but this one fit neither of those bills in my mind. I appreciate a good "life's a struggle" movie, but again, this wasn't it...<br /><br />The acting was OK, I wouldn't echo "great" like others have commented, but then I don't think it would take much to act out this movie... I found the cinematography to be pretty good, there were some very good shots, and the makeup was pretty impressive... but it all added up to a lot of parts without any real glue to hold me to the movie...<br /><br />Better luck next time to the cast and crew... if you had to ask me, I'd say skip this and move on...
