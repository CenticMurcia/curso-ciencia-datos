Sure, this is a great movie. It has never been arrived in Italy but thanksgiving a friend studying in Iceland (thanks Ivan!), I can see it. I have found somewhat reminiscent of the atmospheres of Sergio Leone's "spaghetti-western" in this viking's REAL-life based film. And the name of director is, actually, Hrafn... Raven, of course! He has tried to destroy the viking's stereotypes typical of Hollywood, and the result is admirable and remarkably beautiful. The duel scenes are memorable... you MUST see it!
