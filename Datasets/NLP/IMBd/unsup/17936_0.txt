I truthfully have a hard time believing that this is an independent film. The dialog is both witty and very original, Ron Lazeretti clearly has his own style of writing, i constantly find myself quoting this film! I'm still trying to find out what color my parachute is! A film Is nothing if you leave the screen and you cared nothing about what happened to the characters, but the opera lover is filled with people you grow to care about throughout the film, and thats not a very easy element to capture in truly good film making. Although this film lacked known actors, the Chicago cast really pulled it together. The chemistry between the bastounes brothers is hilarious. TOM! hey buddy I'm rooting for ya, what are you up too now? shed a few pounds and get out their man, you've got the look. As for Bebe, i've constantly seen her in commercials but i would love to see her in a main stream comedy. I like this group of Chicago guys, i hope you have something in the works.
