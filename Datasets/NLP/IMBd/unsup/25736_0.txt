I saw this film at VISION FEST'05 in New York. It is film worth watching. Well acted, great direction, surprising and unforgettable. Patrick also received an award at VISION FEST for acting. See it!!! Review: Max Bright's relationship with women are explosive and cruel, so he resolves to find his fantasy woman: demure, submissive, and obedient, and he buys a Chinese mail-order bride. When Mai Ling arrives, she attempts to awaken the peaceful "Buddha" on Max as he introduces her to American luxury, carnality, and freedom. Max's world spirals out of control when he is diagnosed with terminal cancer and Mai Ling becomes his foundation as his health deteriorates and she leads him in exploring the spiritual aspects of his life.
