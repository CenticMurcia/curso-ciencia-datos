This film is too bad to be even be considered 'schlock'. The main storyline shows promise and originality but is severely corrupted by long, boring and irrelevant sub-plots. Granted that this was the late '70's, but the special effects are childish at best - and keep in mind that this decade also produced Star Wars. The only saving grace is the 'message' - but sadly, its impact is overshadowed by a bad production. At the end of this film you will be at one of two opinions; "must buy the book because the plot is so original and they just ruined it by a bad film" -or- "I never did really understand the '70's!" Enjoy the very, very few good parts and forget the rest.
