My daughter asked me yesterday what my favorite or the best movie I ever saw was. I was torn among Citizen Kane, Lawrence of Arabia (Orrence, Orrence) and Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure (see - I'm not too highbrow!)<br /><br />She then asked about the worst movie, a question I had never thought about and Emanon came, no, leapt to mind. I only remember it because it's "No Name" backwards, and I have the strange habit of reading everything backwards and forwards, spoiling the movie from the outset. How corny. Worst back-word since I read a bad horror story about the mysterious Count Alucard - oh, brother!<br /><br />I don't know why I remembered this as the worst. I usually love the one-star stuff everyone hates, but this was so shockingly bad in every way, I remember feeling sorry for the kid actor who was in it. I jumped on IMDb just to see if anyone else had that same recall. <br /><br />Well - at least I remembered the title after 15 years... Sounds like a drug rehab center, though.
