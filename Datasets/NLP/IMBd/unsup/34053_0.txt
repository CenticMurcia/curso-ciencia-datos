Think of wanna be Silence of the Lambs, but with limited budget, a small cast and an appalling script. <br /><br />Main difference: This time, the serial murder is going after fat women. He kidnaps them and feeds them until they die.<br /><br />Poor acting, stereotype dialog, massively improbable behaviour, this movie lacks of nearly anything. It is supposed to be a thriller, eventually aesthetically it is just disgusting.<br /><br />You can tell every second they had very little money to spend, however, if a movie is to be expected that bad, one should simply not even start making the movie to begin with.<br /><br />This is the worst I have EVER seen, a true insult to intelligence, taste and conventional wisdom.
