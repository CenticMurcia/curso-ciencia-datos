this could have been an excellent film, but is missing key films in the history of queer cinema - first of all it skips all non-American films only paying mention to a few, but never covering them. secondly, some of the most important films, in terms of public and/or queer sentiment, are overlooked - some of those films are: THE CHILDREN'S HOUR, TEA AND SYMPATHY, REFLECTIONS IN A GOLDEN EYE, THE BOYS IN THE BAND, PINK NARCISSUS, A VERY NATURAL THING, DOG DAY AFTERNOON, CRUISING, LIQUID SKY, THE TIMES OF HARVEY MILK, LONGTIME COMPANION, JEFFREY, NITRATE KISSES, LOOKING FOR LANGSTON, URBANIA, CHUCK & BUCK, HOME AT THE END OF THE WORLD to name a few. also, very few of the films are even analyzed or even discussed in any depth.<br /><br />it's a good introduction to American films with queer sensibilities or subject matter. for that reason i gave it a 7.
