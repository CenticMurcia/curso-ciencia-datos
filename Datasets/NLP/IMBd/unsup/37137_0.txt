Being a huge fan of an anime and always desperate to watch as much of it as possible, I must say that this one was lame. I didn't like animation, didn't like the plot and didn't like the characters either.<br /><br />The plot is a one enormous hole: you can figure that something is definitely happening, but you cannot say what and for what reason. The characters are one-dimensional and have absolutely no development along the movie. The initial conflict is somewhat interesting and even intriguing (a huge corporation controlling 90 percent of the Earth and a bunch of free-thinking teenagers opposed to it - plus some mysterious Darkside planning some 'renewal'), but it leads to nowhere: the protagonists talk a lot, but in the end you get none explanation.<br /><br />So, I was left utterly confused and therefore irritated. They could at least have made some cool blues soundtrack (for which you could hope having read the title), but in fact the soundtrack was colourless and boring as well.<br /><br />I don't think that this one deserves to be called an anime. A really frustrating disappointment. If you want to watch something really exciting about some Utopian city and its dwellers made in an anime style, go for Necropolis.
