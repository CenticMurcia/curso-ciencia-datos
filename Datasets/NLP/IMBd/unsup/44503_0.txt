A dark and terrible secret lurks on the 13th floor of a plush city office block,where a supernatural curse has brought disaster to anyone who rents it.A mysterious 'presence' has driven business to ruin,made office machinery break down and created a deadly lifeforce of its own in the electrical system.The tortured soul of an innocent boy who was cruelly murdered many years before is lying in wait for the moment of revenge."The 13th Floor" is easily one of the worst horror films I have ever seen.The film is extremely boring and there is no gore nor suspense.The special effects are incredibly cheesy and the acting is horrible.Why such piece of crap is widely distributed and some Italian horror movies are completely unavailable is beyond me.1 out of 10.
