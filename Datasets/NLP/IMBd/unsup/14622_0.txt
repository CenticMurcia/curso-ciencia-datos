Indeed this movie is worth watching for the on screen chemistry Aamir & Kajol portrays!I never expected Kajol to look so gorgeous and as for Aamir, he was looking really good....Besides their good looks,their acting was spectacular and should be applauded by everyone.Moreover, the brilliance in acting depicted by the supporting casts complemented the movie fabulously.Although the storyline might be 'biasa' (meaning normal/common) among love stories,it was worth watching for the cinematography and the bitter sweetness it instills in the heart as the love between Kajol & Aamir unfolds.Besides the poignancy it renders in the end, i would say it's a must see for romance lovers!All in all, the cast & crew have done a remarkable job of the movie...! :@>---
