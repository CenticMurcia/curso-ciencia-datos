"The Gypsy Moths" is divided into a series of vignettes that explore a plethora of interesting characters. The slow-burn narrative allows a very good cast to shine. It's not a great movie, but it is well-directed and well-written, and it does present a variety of issues with honesty and taste. I was glad to see Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr together again (they starred in the 1953 classic "From Here To Eternity"). In fact, Lancaster and Kerr perform a steamy nude sex scene that is a bit more candid than their famous 'beach scene' from the 1953 - it is rare to see a mature couple do these kinds of scenes and I applaud all people involved for handling it in a tasteful manner. Gene Hackman appears in a supporting role. If you are a fan of any of these actors or you just want to see a good drama, I recommend you to give the film a chance.
