I am frankly appalled to see a total of 5 comments for a movie which, and I believe most people will agree, is deserving of much, much more attention and inspection. This film is like a light at the end of a long, boring tunnel that is the general doldrum of cookie cutter animated films released year round.<br /><br />At once unique, inspired, beautiful, hilarious, weird, touching, unforgettable, innovative among other words that won't do it justice: Mind Game is the definition of a GEM.<br /><br />The only other movie that I can think of in the same "category" is Waking Life, another animated excursion worthy of your time and attention. But even if you hated Waking Life, Mind Game is so different you might love it. Mind Game sort of takes Waking Life's "all over the place" style (cartoony one moment, then rotoscoped the next) then adds a story and characters and a LOT of humor.<br /><br />Seriously, you owe it to yourself to seek this one out. My new agenda will be to show this to as many people as I possibly can. Help spread the word: Mind Game is cool.
