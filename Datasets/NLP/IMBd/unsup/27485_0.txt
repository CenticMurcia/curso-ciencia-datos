Contrast, please, Midler's "The Rose" with Streisand's "A Star Is Born." That's really all I can say.<br /><br />But I have to say more, to post this.<br /><br />Okay.<br /><br />"The Rose" is raw and real. Features a truly astonishing acting and singing performance from Bette Midler.<br /><br />"A Star Is Born" is smooth and glossy. Phony, to be exact. Nothing "astonishing" in the acting department. Lovely songs. So what? In retrospect, Streisand's "Star is Born" ranks down there with Lucille Ball's "Mame," compared to "The Rose." Plus: ever see Midler's "Mama Rose" on TV in "Gypsy?" Miss Midler can act rings around Miss Streisand. And that's saying something! Of course, Streisand can outsing ANYBODY.<br /><br />Guess it all evens out.
