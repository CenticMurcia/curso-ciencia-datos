What Artisan has done here is try to recycle the film Juggernaut. In doing so, they fail miserably. The film is terrible and the acting is worse. The entire 'starring' cast should be banned from Hollywood for several years just for agreeing to perpetrate this piece of trash. Also, the director should be run out of town on a rail for ruining what was a perfectly good movie from the '70s.<br /><br />But most of all, the people at Artisan should be ashamed of themselves for agreeing to fund such a terrible project.
