I had read a number of negative reviews before renting this movie. I, too, had wondered why a movie with stars like these had not stayed in theaters for more than a blink. With all of that in mind, I sat down with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Liam Neesom plays an undercover cop with a failing digestive system after coming too close to death following his last assignment. He plays the part only moderately well, certainly not as well as would be expected when compared to some of his better movies, but nothing to complain about. Oliver Platt was wonderful; he played a loser killer, hopelessly desperate and hating himself. He was a mediocre bad guy, but he was supposed to be a mediocre bad guy. His posing "mean" expressions were hilarious and well matched for his character.<br /><br />Don't expect a lot. It has funny lines (such as Neeson describing the dirty details of his job to a mostly yuppie support group), and some visual humor. The plot is tight, but I will say that the love interest (Sandra Bullock, who he meets when he visits for an enema) could have been completely taken out of the movie and it would not have lost anything. She felt like almost an afterthought for how much she contributed to the development of the movie.<br /><br />The ending threw me off as being very far-fetched, but Hollywood will do that in order to get a "happily ever after" ending. It tied up the loose ends well but was just a little too hard to believe.<br /><br />Had I watched it in theaters, I might have been disappointed. Since I would have otherwise just played on the Internet, I enjoyed myself while watching this. I thought it was fun, and I'd recommend it to others.
