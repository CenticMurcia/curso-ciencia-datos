You know this movie had a great potential, could have been a major film for all the characters involved. But somewhere along it fails major. Doesn't really make you 'feel' for any character, they all seem like cardboard characters. Should have breathed life into them. Instead it just manages to take you 'around' aimlessly. It fails to surprise you, the bad guys remain bad, the good are good, the neutral are neutral nothing changes or happens. Whatever was supposed to happen happens. So what's the point of watching it? Some useless diversions which make no sense, probably a very personal film, fails at all levels. There is the classic whore with a heart of gold, the drifter, the two friends, but the chemistry is missing. The electricity just went out. They are all on high, so no lows!
