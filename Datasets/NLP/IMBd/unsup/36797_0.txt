Most of the first hour or so of this movie was dull, boring and unnecessary...if not for my wife asking me questions, I think I would have fallen asleep. I must admit that once we got to the point of the film where sheep are birthing their lambs that the film began to pique my interest, but by then, I really couldn't care less about the characters, and wanted it to end.<br /><br />Also the insistent, braying, bleating, etc. of the different animals was extremely annoying and irritating, as was the kids when they would be loudly singing off-key. I'm sure this was intentional, but irritating nonetheless.<br /><br />I know this film got superb reviews, which is why I rented it in the first place. But why? Because it showed a slice of life that few of us ever see? That's the only thing I can think of. And if so, make a documentary about it.
