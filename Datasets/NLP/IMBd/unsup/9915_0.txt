England's most notorious serial killer - the fictional Leo Rook - stalks castaways at a desolate lighthouse in this surprisingly eerie chiller from Britain. Very atmospheric and very gory, as the gaunt killer (Charles Adamson) hacks his way through the supporting cast, comprised of his former keepers and cellmates. Pretty scary stuff despite director Simon Hunter's formulaic "stalk 'n' slash" approach. Heads will roll (a total of six, I believe) before the explosive ending.<br /><br />Even a jaded horror fan like me found plenty of nerve-wracking sequences to enjoy -- especially the lighthouse toilet scene. So, by all means, grab your rowboats and head for the mainland before Leo Rook catches up with you.
