Don't be one of them. Don't be one of the stupid people. Don't rent or buy or watch this film. I suppose there are worse films, but very few spring to mind.<br /><br />The entire premise assumes you were born yesterday and remain ignorant of human behavior or common sense. I'd go on about the plot or the performances, but it's just one contrivance after another that leaves the viewer frustrated and angry at the characters (ALL of them) not to mention the director.<br /><br />By the end you don't care who lives or dies, as long as it ENDS.<br /><br />There are a lot of ways to spend your time. Don't waste it here!
