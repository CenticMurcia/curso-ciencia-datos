If you ever wanted to see a movie that portrayed what really makes a man, then you must see this movie.<br /><br />Forget Stalone. Forget Arnold. Forget Bond. Forget all those romantic comedy whimps. Bruce Willis never had to make this many life threatening decisions in Die Hard.<br /><br />Will Smith gives a better performance of toughness here than he did portraying Muhammed Ali. <br /><br />This movie is raw. This movie will force you to examine your manhood. See if you can look in the mirror after watching this film.<br /><br />Fathers, don't let the PG-13 rating fool you. This movie is not for kids. If you let your child see this movie you may regret it. Your child may never be able to look at you the same way again. Your child will wonder why you are not more like Chris Gardner.
