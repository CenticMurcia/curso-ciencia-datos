I give this 1 star out of 10.<br /><br />This is the second movie I have seen from Thailand and so far, it has been a mixed picture. The first movie from Thailand that I saw was Ong-Bak. That movie had terrible story and terrible acting but the action was so awesome that it overwhelmed the terrible acting and story. The action in this movie, however, could not compensate for the terrible story and terrible acting. Don't get me wrong, the action by itself, was good but definitely not enough to overwhelm the other deficiencies in this movie. I am just glad a friend of my loaned me his copy of this movie because if I had to pay money to see it, I would be really incensed.<br /><br />The story is about a drug kingpin who is captured by the main character, who is a police officer. Despondent over his partner's death during the capture, he accompanies a group athletes who go to some shanty village to distribute goods for the needy. However, as fate would have it, the followers of the kingpin storm into the village and take them as hostage for their leader's release. The villagers take as much as they can before they rise up and fight their occupiers.
