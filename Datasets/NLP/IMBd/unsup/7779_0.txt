I caught this brilliant short at Dragon Con last summer and then rediscovered it at AtomFilms.com. It only got better the second time around. Many great little bits lost in the huge con screening, were found on the online screening. Lou Diamond Phillips is a comic genius! This man needs to do more comedies. With kick-ass cameos by Scott Thompson(Kids in the Hall) and Ron Jeremy(the Hedgehog), this film rules cause it constantly flips your expectations of the porn world and It's just so damn funny! The guys behind this flick are ill... and I mean that in the best possible way!<br /><br />Grade: A+
