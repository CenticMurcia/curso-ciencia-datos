The plot of the film has our heroine shooting a man during a religious crusade. She hasn't been long out of prison and is thrown back on death row. While awaiting her date with destiny a minister arrives and she recounts her life. It is a life of pain and suffering that never quite goes right despite her best intentions.<br /><br />Have you ever watched a film that you thought was extremely well done but which you couldn't not relate to at all? For me this is one of the few films I found that is beyond my scope of experience. The life and pain of this black woman simply did not connect with this white man. Don't get me wrong, I liked the film, I just couldn't connect emotionally with events on the screen.<br /><br />That said this is very good movie. The acting is excellent. The story is compelling, even if I couldn't emotionally connect with it. This is a film to try if you run across it. You may not love it but you'll probably like it.<br /><br />7 out of 10
