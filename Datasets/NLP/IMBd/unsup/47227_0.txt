Probably one of the most predictable and boring movies of this year. The plot is so stupid that it is insulting to the viewer. It takes about 25 minutes of the movie to figure out how it is going to end. The ghost part of it contributes even more to the feeling that you really wasted your money this time. To find this movie scary you would have to be very young or have very little movie experience. The movie contains about 50 scenes where you know that in 2 seconds time, there will be a BOOOO effect and when it comes you do not get scared rather angry that you actually paid money to watch this rubbish.<br /><br />How Michelle Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford ever agreed to take part in this misery is a riddle to me, but I guess they were both paid good. Michelle Pfeiffer is to me one of the most beautiful women of the world - she almost gets better looking as she is getting older and her acting is very fine in this film, but it just is not enough. Avoid.
