A total bomb when it first hit in 1932, Rain today holds up rather well for today's audience to enjoy. Perhaps another example of a movie ahead of it's time. One can see why. Crawford's outfits and make up are rather bizarre, one part gypsy, one part hooker. Which I suppose is in keeping with the character of Sadie Thompson. The writing (from a story by W. Somerset Maugham) is not your typical 1930's fluff. There is nothing to like in this world. What I found enjoyable were the clothing and music from the early 1930's. The two "ladies," Mrs. Robert MacPhail and Mrs. Walter Davidson, are decked out from their shoes to their hats which were so stylish and sophisticated, and then comes Sadie. She is not a hooker with a heart of gold but more troubled than in need of salvation. What I found hard to believe was her sudden conversion to Christianity just by repeating the Lord's Prayer several times with Mr. Davidson, portrayed wonderfully by Walter Huston. Sadie's redemption is not to be, once again being taken advantage of by a man, this time by the very man who set out to "save" her. The sins of the flesh run through this movie with the rain perhaps symbolizing the washing away of past sins. Heady entertainment that works well for today with a fine performance by a young Joan Crawford.
