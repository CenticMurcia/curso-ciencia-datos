Wow am I tired after watching that snoozer of a movie. Neverwas stars Aaron Ekheart who is Zachery Small the little boy who is the hero of Neverwas in the book. Why is it many fantasy films are contained within books like The Nevereding Story which is ten times better of a movie. Brittany Murphy actually surprised me as being pretty good in this movie. And the dude from Lord Of The Rings loses his marbles as a mental patient who thinks he is the king of Neverwas. This film also stars Nick Nolte who is Zachery's father and the author of Neverwas. I thought this movie would get cool and Zachery would trip out halfway through the movie and have a crazy dream sequence. Nope... This movie sucked. And my co-worker at Blockbuster also thought it sucked. So if you like fantasy movies don't watch this film as it will be a very painful watch especially if your like me and wait to see if the movie will eventually pick-up. Not this time around and I wish this movie Neverwas made.
