....if you were a teenager in the 80's. But to be honest, it's pretty much an everyman story for anyone who has had a crush on a member of the opposite sex. "Gregory's Girl" is one of three (the others being 'This Is Spinal Tap' and 'The Italian Job') that I could recite from start to finish with all the voices and everything. Favourite bits - probably the little moments that you only spot after repeated viewings; when the teachers spot Gregory weaving across the empty playground when he's late for school - "does he think he's invisible?!", the banter with his pal Steve - "fud, fud, fud, is that all you think about, you're unnatural pal, you're a freak!", Andy & Charlie's doomed attempts to pick up girls, Chic Murray's delightful cameo as the headmaster - especially the piano playing scene, "off you go, you small boys" and watch out for the worst high jumper in the world. All I can say, if you watch this film with a prospective partner and they don't like it, dump them immediately, y'all hear me?
