"Un autre homme, une autre chance (1977)"<br /><br />"Another Man, Another Chance"<br /><br />This is one of the best films I have seen in years; hard to believe that it was written and directed almost 27 years ago. A lyrical, beautiful and moving film with a storyline so believable, it is as if I were with them, on the dusty roads and the rolling hills and plains, seeing the Great Southwest unfolding before my eyes.<br /><br />This film is even better if you know some French, but not necessary... The "true to life" historical film has so much meaning on a personal level; it is as if I were "let in" to read someone's private diary, with nothing held back. Such thoughts I wish I had...<br /><br />Thank you so much, to the director and writer, Claude LeLouch; and to the actors James Caan and Genevi√©ve Bujold. They are all excellent in every way. I wish I could have "been there" myself at this point in time, and after seeing this film I was able to "live in their painting" for just a little while. I actually watched it two times in a row, it was so beautiful in all ways.<br /><br />No "blockbuster" needed here; just the storyline of these people's lives. I can't wait to see what other films this fine French director has brought to the screen, as I had never heard of him before. Caan and Bujold are at their finest, as always. Thanks to both of them, as well.<br /><br />I think I read that this was a true story of the author's grandparents, or greatgrandparents, his grandmother who was French and this was their life. Most interesting of all. We are all immigrants seeking the Promised Land.<br /><br />With my sincerest and most heartfelt thanks, Catherine Todd
