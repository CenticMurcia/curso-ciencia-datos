What a god awful movie. I really wish I could swear on this, but alas, I cannot. I can't even believe that this is real. I watched it with a few friends in a basement, and just wow. WOW. What in hell were the creators of this monstrosity thinking? What did they think they could accomplish? If you are considering this movie, don't even think about it (if you're even brave enough to call it a movie.) My friends were bugging me to sign up on this to comment on here, so I finally broke down and registered. The camera work was done by a grade 2 child, and the acting was extremely painful, as you could obviously tell they were reading the script for every single line. The 6 montages (2 of which were partially re-used, by the way) were excruciating. Also, for the scenes where Robert Z'Dar was in the movie, I sat there in awe of his ungodly chin. It could swallow the sun. It could feed the entire continent of Africa for at least a month, probably more like 3 or 4. Hell, I even think it could probably kick the crap out of Chuck Norris. And that's saying something. Anyways, what I mean to say is that this movie is ridiculous. If you want some amazing laughs, acquire this "movie" some how and watch it with a couple friends. You will NOT be disappointed. Please, be intoxicated, otherwise you may hurt yourselves though.
