"Crocodile Dundee In Los Angeles" is the third installment in Paul Hogan's franchise. In this movie, Mick Dundee is a family man, but still every inch the Aussie bushwhacker. He travels with his best gal Sue and their son to Los Angeles, and finds himself in the heart of one of America's strangest cultures. Yet he still manages to get by with his outback skills and "no-worries" amiability. This is an enjoyable movie. The spoof of Hollywood culture is everywhere and has laugh potential. There's even celebrity cameos (the one with Mike Tyson seems even more ironic now than ever!). So, if you're a fan of Crocodile Dundee, you'll love his adventures in Los Angeles!
