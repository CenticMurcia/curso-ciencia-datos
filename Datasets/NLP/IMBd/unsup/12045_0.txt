Bob Clampett's 'Porky in Egypt' is among the strangest and most unsettling cartoons you'll see in your lifetime. While early Porky Pig shorts could sometimes tend toward the cutesy or pedestrian, Clampett's were usually crazy, frenetic balls of energy, the like of which only he could pull off. Released the same year as his much lauded classic 'Porky in Wackyland' and his lesser praised but no less classic 'Porky's Party' and 'Porky and Daffy', 'Porky in Egypt' is the nuttiest of the lot. As is often the case in these early Porky cartoons, Porky gets star billing but very much plays second fiddle to another character, in this case a camel named Humpty Bumpty! Venturing out into the desert alone, Porky is surprised when his camel is suddenly struck by sun-induced desert-madness. The insane antics of the camel then completely take over the picture, resulting in a bravura tour-de-force of jaw-droppingly mad animation in which Humpty Bumpty snaps from wild pose to wild pose, howling in paranoia one minute and playing some inexplicably produced bagpipes the next! Any early hint of a plot is forsaken in favour of sheer Clampett lunacy as the camel and Porky battle their own mental states in a barren, featureless landscape. Creepy, bizarre and funny in a stomach-twistingly unsettling way, 'Porky in Egypt' never ceases to amaze me. I remember the first time I saw it, I wasn't entirely sure that it had really just happened! But happen it did and I'm truly glad that's the case. I highly recommend this oddball cult classic. Whether you enjoy it or not, it's certainly a cartoon that you'll never forget not matter how hard you try.
