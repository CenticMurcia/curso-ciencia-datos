we snuck into this movie because it was the only thing playing that wasn't night at the museum. i should have just killed myself instead. this sucked. there was nothing good about this.<br /><br />i knew it was going to be cheesy from the previews but i wasn't prepared for how bad it was going to be. right away we see the main chick with a jacket on with nothing on under it while she was at work. yeah, okay i guess shes the office whore. then they goto Africa because there is a crocodile thats been killing people for like 60 years. and it has to be the same one, there's no way in hell it could have been multiple ones. anyway there's also a dictator who has the same name as the crocodile which also causes some problems. (i guess they realized they couldn't make a 'good movie' with just a crocodile so they needed more crap) then the crocodile kills a baby.<br /><br />one of my favorite scenes was when they meet the hunter and for like the next five minutes all his dialog was exposition. there was some good writing there way to develop. my other favorite was when they meet the shaw-man and hes like having a spasm. i couldn't stop laughing, it was so funny.<br /><br />anyway then they set up the trap that never works and of course it doesn't cuz the crocodile like knows to knock out the cameras and flip the cage. then we left cuz we couldn't take it anymore; the only reason why we stayed that long was because we thought the chick was going to get naked (i found out she didn't).<br /><br />everything is bad the direction, the story, the suspense, the characters, the acting, everything. it was clear that all the actors were doing this for the money. i was shocked to see orlando jones in this movie. i hope hes doing OK.
