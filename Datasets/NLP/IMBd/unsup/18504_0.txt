This movie not only combines the humor of a man who is mentally trapped in the 1920's, and a modern day society of the 1990's, but the movie itself is fashioned to portray a film made in the 1920's. Everything about it is completely unique, and the scenes come off as something someone in Johnny Twennies' day would concoct. I think this film is a milestone in the history of film-making. The directing was fantastic, and the cast and lines spoken, and feelings portrayed, all come together in a very clean, artistic, and magnificently made finished product. I highly recommend this film to anyone, and believe that even the least-likely candidate would appreciate it's glory.
