Contender for the worst film ever made!<br /><br />I saw this movie for the first time at the recommendation of a friend. He warned me it would be painful to watch, but I had no idea how painful it would turn out to be.<br /><br />This film (the English version I saw is entitled "Battle of the Last Panzer") is intended as a WWII epic depicting the struggle of a German tank crew, caught behind enemy lines, trying to get themselves and their vehicle back to German-held territory.<br /><br />Other than that, I will make no attempt to describe the insanely fragmented and incoherent plot - you simply have to see it for yourselves!<br /><br />Everything about this movie is just plain bad -- the plot, the dialog, the setting, the special effects, the equipment and uniforms, and the acting.<br /><br />The star of the show is the Lieutenant in command of the crew (capital letters indicate emphasis):<br /><br />"Any attempt at disobedience, or talk of desertion ... will be punished by DEATH!"<br /><br />"As the Fuehrer said ... Those who are not with us ... are AGAINST us!"<br /><br />"You have one minute, no more, to throw down your arms and get out of sight! After that minute, I'll advance -- RAPID FIRE!"<br /><br />The film is supposed to be set in France, after the D-Day invasion. But in place of the lush green fields of Normandy, the landscape is arid and looks like Sicily or the south of Spain.<br /><br />The uniforms are the best! "Americans" wearing Italian uniforms, complete with Italian rank and helmets. The weapons they are carrying are modern G3 assault rifles. The "Germans" are no better - they are carrying Italian-made Baretta submachineguns and pistols! Last but not least, their "Tiger" tank is an old US M-48 tank.<br /><br />Writing these comments is proving to be almost as painful as watching the film. However, it's a must see. If you want a real shock, watch it right after "Saving Private Ryan" or "Band of Brothers" and you'll find out just how bad bad can be!
