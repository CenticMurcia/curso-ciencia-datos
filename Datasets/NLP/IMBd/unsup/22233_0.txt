Well this is a movie from the classroom but still better than the other 1000 coming out of the same class room. Never knew Harvey was such a decent actor.The buddy scenes keep reminding me of some movies but cant recollect which ones.The actress Bethune puts up a marvelous performance. The character names are like hand picked (J.R,gaga,...) The guy who plays Joey looks a familiar character in the Italian American movies.Some tries to provide some comic relief ...... Overall a movie which can show the progress of a great director.... The DVD I bought had a documentary on how the movie was done and school projects during 1962,that was a bit interesting. Overall a 7/10.....
