I found a video of this film recently on E-bay and I must admit I really loved it. The relationship between Ron Moody and David Soul was about two losers, one of which (Ron Moody) lost a dog who turned up at the local pound and needed to use the other guy (David Soul) to get him out of the Pound by working as a double act and begging for money in local Bars. They are seen by a rich guy and is impressed by their act and invites them to a party to show off their act to his guests. Ron Moody, then has the money to free his dog from the Pound. When he turns up at the Pound the dog has been sold to a loving family. Upset and distress, he tell David Soul that he does not want to go into partnership with their double act and David Soul goes on his way! Then Ron Moody decides to go to the Pound to get the address of the new family who bought the dog. Thinking that this will be easy he comes across the attendant who calls the police. David Soul had followed Ron Moody and there is a fight involving the attendant and David Soul and the address is retrieved so they can both find the dog. The dog is then rescued by our two heros ! All I can say it is a very nice gentle film. I hope one day it will be out on DVD as it is one of my favourite films.
