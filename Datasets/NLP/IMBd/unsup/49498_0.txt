The summary say it all.<br /><br />This was the 2nd worst movie I have seen to date. #1 being I heart huckabees.<br /><br />This film has no redeeming qualities. The sex scenes are flaccid at best. The score overpowers the crappy dialog but not enough that you do not hear it.<br /><br />The "character development" was lame, and went on way too long.<br /><br />Felt caught between wanting to see a naked Nave and the desire to scratch my eyes out.<br /><br />Just like with Huckabees I kept waiting some the film to get better but alas it didn't.<br /><br />I have seen softcore porn with better plots, and at least most of them get you a little turned on by their sex scenes.<br /><br />Not worth the time even if the movie is for free, and someone else buys your popcorn, candy and drink.
