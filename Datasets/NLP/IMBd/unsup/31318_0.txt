This little short movie from the MTV Awards is a parody on 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers', especially the scene with the council of Elrond. Jack Black is Sam and Sarah Michelle Gellar is Arwen. The parts involving other actors like Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood and Hugo Weaving are parts taken from the real movie. I like most of the movies MTV makes and this one is pretty funny. If you can get it it is worth the 3 minutes it takes.
