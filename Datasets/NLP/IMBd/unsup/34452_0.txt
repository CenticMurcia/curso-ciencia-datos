Very rarely do so many people say so much praise to so terrible a movie like this one. <br /><br />It was so painful to sit through the movie simply because I don't understand it at all!! I was bored to tears so I left in the middle of this movie in protest. I have been watching movies for over 40 years, good ones and bad ones, but this one is a real dud ranking at the bottom of my "worst ever" category. What twisted plot is this? I think Tom Cruise and the other actors had a tough time trying to make the movie watchable but failed to do so. my time and money are totally wasted! <br /><br />Me buying a ticket to see the 2006 MI III? Well, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE!!!
