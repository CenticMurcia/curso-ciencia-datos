Surely this was filmed 100 years ago? It was certainly another world. The innocence and kindheartedness of nearly all the people in the film is what strikes this cynic the most.<br /><br />The promoters who accepted they were going to "take a big bath" when they realised they had to take down the fences and make it a free concert for safety reasons. <br /><br />The landowner who can't believe the amount of people who have come to his farm<br /><br />The locals cheerfully giving food and water to the kids and commenting about how respectful they are<br /><br />The kids going to a music festival but for some reason expecting and getting so much more - and then queuing to phone home and tell the parents they're okay! <br /><br />The performers who knew something special was happening and did their bit to make history. <br /><br />At more than 3 hours the film could have seemed too long but it doesn't as the performances and interviews with concert-goers mix perfectly. There are few interviews with the performers as the director recognises it was really all about the kids.<br /><br />It would be interesting to see present day interviews with people in the film to see their current day view on what happened at Woodstock but in the meantime we can only enjoy this living piece of history.
