This is undoubtedly one of the worst films I have ever seen! It's also one of very few that I actually walked out on before it ended. Very disappointing considering the cast and director, but the story is long and slow and the film seemed like it would never end. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this piece of crap!
