I truly appreciate Scarlett Johansson's work and lord knows that she tried her best here. Do please read the other reviews for the plot line as I just wish to say a few things ABOUT the reality of the plot. Wouldn't it be dandy if one videoed tirade could possibly change the life of someone? Just think of it...You're selfish or self absorbed or especially down-deep unhappy and one person comes along and reads you the riot act and POOF you're a different person...sorry but I couldn't buy it. Actors were fine, blah blah, or perhaps that I am being too critical but "No way can a personality alter overnight!" Bottom line...the movie left me shaking my head in total disbelief.
