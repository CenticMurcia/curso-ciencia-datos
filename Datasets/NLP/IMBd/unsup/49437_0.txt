This movie is not really anything like the title implies it is about. When I think rebel, I think bikers with leather jackets, or people who laugh in the face of the law. Here it is three losers looking for a break all for varying reasons. Well not all that varying as they all want money. One, is an unemployed actor who has a lovely wife and is apparently a bad actor. One, is a writer who is shopping around a book that is bad. The other guy is just trying to escape his mother's shadow or something...was not quite as sure about him. Well, a man who runs a rather crappy establishment has assembled these men to perform a robbery of an armored car. So that is about all there is to it. They take a train to Chicago, rob the armored car and get on the train and head on back home. Except, once on the train things begin to unravel as greed takes over one of the guys, another gets jumpy and then dead bodies begin to turn up. It is rather interesting to watch in places as it does move fairly quickly and the lead guy is likable enough as is his wife who stands by him. You also get to see the chief from Get Smart as the mastermind behind the heist. However, you also get to see a chase scene at the end that is to long and rather anti-climatic and the other guys in the heist are rather bad in how they are presented.
