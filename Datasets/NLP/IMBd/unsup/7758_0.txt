i'm not much on watching zombie movies but this movie in my opinion is one of the best zombie flicks i've ever seen. all of the effects were done for under 300 bucks and the effects were great and real looking. most of the people in this film were first time actors and they did a great job. the soundtrack to this movie was one of the best i've eve heard and to me a great soundtrack can also make a great movie. if you have the DVD it has a special feature where you can see a band called kitchen knife conspiracy preform one of there songs live. this live performance adds to the greatness of this movie.i'd recommend this film to any B horror movie lover like myself.
