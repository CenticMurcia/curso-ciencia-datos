Brian Lackey (Corbet), a bookish, shortsighted teenager, is still troubled by the strange hole in his memories. The summer he was eight, five hours of his life disappeared without a trace. He has become convinced that he was abducted by aliens. An encounter with a fellow abductee in his search for an explanation leads him to Neil, now a cocksure hustler with one thing on his mind, and gradually the pieces of the puzzle come together. But Neil's frozen in time, back in that summer when he was 'special'; his sexuality warped, he is compulsively searching for that same feeling, without realizing that search will destroy him.<br /><br />the snow-scene as it's written in the book: "I took Wendy's hand.
