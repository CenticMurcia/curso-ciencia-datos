this movie is terrible, do NOT watch this film, Til Schweiger is a pity, awful,playing for 5 minutes in the movie. This movie is stupid, stupid and stupid, more I can't say....no plot, no sense, never saw such a bad movie. There is no gag to laugh, no story, nothing is in this crappy piece of... And if you know the both comedians playing the long and short Dalton, they ma be good comedians, but not in this film.... PLZ miss this movie... more is not to say..;o) I don't know how to produce such a crap, it should be forbidden to show such movies in cinema to prevent the people in getting idiots.....we started with 90 people in the cinema, at the end of the movie there were 3 left, i think that says all....;o)
