I want my hour and a half back. Frankly, I think Frances had a pretty good life considering how little effort she put into it. Aging college dropout drifts between relationships while having kids she doesn't provide for. I got the feeling she's too dumb to make anything of herself and too proud to wait tables.<br /><br />It's hard to tell, though, what with the jumbled up way the story was presented.<br /><br />How about that "stop the car, kiss, and then start driving again" thing with Frances and Bob? What's with that? I expected it to go somewhere, but it just fizzled.<br /><br />And what's with the completely gratuitous Jimmy Dupree hook? I couldn't figure out if it's "I did yo mama, and now I'm gonna do you, too" or "Look, we must be sophisticated cause we're showing interracial relationships".<br /><br />I agree, this could have been a nice little film, but it looks like someone dropped the ball.
