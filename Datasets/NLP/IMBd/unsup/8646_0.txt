Meryl Streep as usual does a good job of characterization. She is a different person in each film she does. She was a Ellen Brokovich type. Too smart for the job she was in. The ending was pretty weak, tho'. Also as a non-smoker, all the constant smoking made me sick. But again, that was pretty realistic.
