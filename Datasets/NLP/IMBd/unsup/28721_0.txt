Contrary to another review, this show is suitable for anyone who might watch TV. Unlike the septic sludge of today the children are depicted in a reasonably innocent childhood. However, it should be noted that there is one element of unspeakable filth that must be addressed - the father's hobby is collecting . . . . T-O-I-L-E-T-S. Shhhhhh.<br /><br />So if you find such filthy hobbies offensive turn off your TV, pick it up, and throw it out the window because this program is as tame as it gets.<br /><br />This is an EXCELLENT Program for ALL ages. (I love this show - and I'm 51.) It is unfortunate that The Wayne Manifesto has not been made available to a larger audience and/or on DVD. With brilliant story lines, believable acting, real sets/locations there is little here to be improved and the overall package can appeal to all.<br /><br />A+ with double distinction.
