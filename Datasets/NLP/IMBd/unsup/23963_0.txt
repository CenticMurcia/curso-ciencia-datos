Why didn't this movie get released properly, after watching all the extras on the DVD, this is exactly what you feel.<br /><br />But probably the greatest injustice is the Studio's cut. 16 mins cut out, and that is the version which is showed on HBO and stuff, not just the 16 mins, but the soundtrack is different. Listening to the excellent commentary on the disc and watching the extras, you really can feel for Steve Wang, as well as everyone else who worked on the picture.<br /><br />But for them it seems they had a lot of fun making it, and it shows on the screen, it was such a FUN film, but it wasn't just amazing martial arts action, it had good characters, and the 'talking' bits don't drag the film down, the opposite in fact. This film has virtually everything you'd want from an action comedy, plus the Hong Kong influences, one shot fight sequences, etc... and the fights are amazing. Jackie Chan fans will love this movie, seeing as the crew site him as a major influence in their lives.<br /><br />This is also a funny movie, Kareem Hardison, follows in the steps of Eddie Murphy and Richard Pryor, a comedian/actor whose ad-libs are always fun to watch.<br /><br />This is definitely worth watching, i never got bored the whole way through, and if you like action comedies and love really good martial arts fighting, and if you are into DVDs then i urge you to buy the disc.<br /><br />AND PLEASE make sure you watch the Director's Cut, if at the start the main character is looking at a girl on a small video screen, then you are watching the right one. EXCELLENT
