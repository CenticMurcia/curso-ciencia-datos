This is class TV. This production and it's second part Cold Lazarus was paid for by the UK tax payer and co-produced by the BBC and (also publicly funded) Channel 4. Several attempts at trying to find out why these two screen plays haven't been re-shown have met with limp excuses about licensing and the two channels not being able to get their act together to cooperate on a re-release. However, I'm aware both have been shown on recently on other European channels in other countries. Work that one out. The good news is I've recently got a hold of (legally) recorded versions of these shows. That's after almost 10 years of looking. Phew.
