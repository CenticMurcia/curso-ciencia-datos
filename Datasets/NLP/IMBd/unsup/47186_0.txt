John Pinette, although larger than I have ever seen him was entertaining. I love Dane Cook, but if I were him, I would take this movie off my resume. Rodman should stick to basketball and the freak show, because he can not act. I won't say that this is the worst movie I have ever seen, because I have seen BloodSuckers (Michael Ironsides) and DogSoliders. But, like those movies, it is a train wreck, no matter how awful it gets you just can't stop watching it. The wire work was horrible. Rodman can't even pretend he knows martial arts, John Pinette's stunt double was more convincing than Rodman. One of my biggest pet peeves is poor movie editing. For instance, at the end of First Wives Club count how many different pairs of shoes Goldie Hawn is wearing in the last seen. I counted four different pairs. In this movie, can you count how many times Rodman's bike changes in a single scene. We counted four in the the first scene of the movie, an three in the scene where he is escaping the blast in the tunnel. Did anyone else notice that the "dad" in this was trying way to hard to look like Robert Redford? This movie isn't even good enough to become a cult classic.
