I was expecting so much from this movie! The trailers on TV were excellent and Bernie Mac is an great comedic actor but about half way thru I was getting so agitated and could not sit still. I rarely walk out of movies but I was close to this one. I think it was ASton Kutcher that made it as bad as it was. Yes, Bernie Mac was relentless in his bullying but Ashton rarely stood up for himself and when he did, he just spoke out of the side of his mouth ....mumbling. It was just painful to watch.<br /><br />The last 20 minutes of the movie were the best...but it just did not redeem the movie.<br /><br />I wondered why the theater was empty on a Saturday nite...the movies reviews must have killed it!
