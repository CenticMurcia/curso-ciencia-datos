I never would have believed it, that you could combine Spaceships and futuristic races with Norse Mythology...yet, here it is in one GREAT movie! I liked 13th Warrior...it was OK, I liked Predator, but this movie...it's like they took the BEST from both movies and put it into one really well acted, well scripted movie! I picked this up on sale at Blockbuster...WOW what a GREAT movie! I like action movies, I like Lore movies, like Lord of the Rings, I like Sci-fi movies, but this is like getting ALL those genres wrapped into one, and it's NOT hokey or fake-comical, it's all very believable and wonderfully acted by James Caviziel, and Sonia Myles, with John Hurt, and the guy who played Hell Boy...wow, it has sword fighting in it, great sets...I just really enjoyed this movie from the very beginning to the very end! If you like all the genres that I listed...then you MUST see this movie!
