Every once in awhile comes a movie as moronic, pointless and insulting as "Taxi" based on Luc Besson's French flick. This movie follows Det. Andy Washburn (Jimmy Fallon) who sucks majorly at driving and has to get a taxi to pursue a gang of hot foreign chicks that just robbed a bank... the taxi is driven by a street smart, jive-talking, Queen Latifah in the role of Belle. I don't recall a character being more annoying. Anyway, the film's story could be easily made up by a 7 year old and the script was just awful. But okay, nevermind that, there's a lot of movies that have idiotic plots that turn out to be freakin hilarious like one of my favorite comedies "Dumb and Dumber". But noooooo, this film wasn't hilarious... Fallon has a career because of playing retarded roles in Saturday Night Live. You can kinda tell he add libbed a lot of of the pathetically unfunny lines that he spits out constantly during the film's running time. Queen Latifah was just too freakin annoying. I gotta point out the things that I enjoyed: 1)Washbun's introduction where he is posing as a Cuban gangster was slightly funny. 2)Jennifer Esposito is hot<br /><br />That didn't even make me like the film a little bit. Skip this piece of trash.
