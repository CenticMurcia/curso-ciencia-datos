This movie is intriguing in that it actually presages some of the terrorism realized in the tragedy of 9/11.<br /><br />That said, the film is mortally flawed with stupid and ridiculous contrivances that make is more of a comic book yarn than having the sophistication of, say, a Tom Clancy novel.<br /><br />High on the "oh come on get real!" factor: <br /><br />1. Any White House PressSecretary would be far too astute to let a self-describe TV journalist on Air Force One (AF1). The very first thing they would do is check the reporter's credentials and publication/broadcast record.<br /><br />2. The spectacle of a 747 jumbo jet careering through an airport on an aborted landing is simply light-years beyond absurd.<br /><br />3. Why would AF1 have a stash of enough assault rifles to take over a small country? And, with all the gunplay in the passenger cabin there's not one bullet hole in the fuselage?<br /><br />4. I have it on good authority that Air Force One does have countermeasures, but putting the president in an escape pod  though fundamental to the plot  it just inane. That's the *last* thing you would do with the U.S. President at 30,000 ft.<br /><br />5. Equally ridiculous is the idea that AF1 conveniently has more parachutes onboard than the Titanic had life preservers. Just as silly is the image of Washington bureaucrats easily jumping off the plane at 15,000 ft.<br /><br />6. I've been inside an open, stripped-down 747 airframe, there isn't nearly as much room as shown on the cargo deck. There certainly isn't room for a cargo deck vending machine?! <br /><br />I could go on and on, but this film is another example of filmmakers believing that movies goers are gullible enough to swallow any tall tale for the sake of lots of action shots and melodrama. If you've gonna concoct an action drama tale like this, at least have one foot in reality and plausibility, or otherwise call it "science fiction."
