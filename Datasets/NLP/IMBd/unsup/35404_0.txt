'Exorcism' is not Jess Franco's best film, but it's certainly not the worst either - which doesn't say much for much of the rest of his oeuvre! From the title, I was expecting this to be a rip-off of The Exorcist, but it's more like Ken Russell's classic nunsploitation flick 'The Devils'. As usual with films like this, there is little plot and the thin plot we do get is rather difficult to follow as most of the film is taken up by sex and torture sequences. Basically, the plot focuses on a priest who takes it upon himself to exorcise demons from a group of people he believes to be possessed. The film starts with a torture sequence involving a couple of naked women, which is well filmed and lead me to believe that this might be a halfway decent flick. However, most of the film is really quite boring; there are plenty of scenes that see naked women strung up, getting tortured but the lack of any real point does get in the way. The film stars the beautiful Lina Romay which is always sure to increase the watchability of any film; and we've also got a surprisingly decent performance from the man himself Jess Franco (under yet another moniker). All that aside, Exorcism isn't a good film, and therefore I don't recommend seeing it!
