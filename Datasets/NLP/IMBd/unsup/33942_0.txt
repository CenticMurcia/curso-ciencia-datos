I caught this for the first time today on TCM. I was intrigued by this movie without even knowing any history about the adaptation of the book. The subject matter and how movies handle December-May relationships has always grabbed my attention.<br /><br />As a hardcore Romantic, I wanted something very real and special to come out of this. Though I found March a very captivating character, I have always found Novak to be a bit vapid and one-note. Neither of these actors convinced me that these people were anything but in dangerous denial and fooling themselves. Probably because they just didn't seem that much in love, but more in love with the idea of "maybe" being in love "somehow" ...because both of them wanted to be in love so badly. In his final proclamation about love, March's character goes on about passion and grand risks and living life. Great concepts but it fell flat the moment the two actors were together in scenes. The chemistry was just not there for this classic movie fan and in truth a bit painful to watch.<br /><br />The Love conquer all ending may appeal to the Romantic in me, but the reality of the *doorway* reunion was too much at odds with the realness portrayed by the other characters and I wouldn't give these two a snow ball's chance...well, you know. But, more power to them. That is the real lesson, even though it promises to be a sad one. Do we frantically grab at something we know deep inside is a tragedy just waiting to happen? Do we write off others who chose NOT to put themselves at risk of such potentially damaging emotions? Dunno.<br /><br />Grant and Balsam showed just why they are such stellar character actors. Novak's mother had a deliciously vibrant role.<br /><br />Just a side comment but the sexual stereotypes of that period came raging through in spite of some very serious attempts to portray genuine human, emotional suffering of both genders at all ages.<br /><br />skg
