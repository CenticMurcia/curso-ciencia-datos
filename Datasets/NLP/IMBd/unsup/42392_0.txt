I saw this movie when i was about 14 years old, and i thought Disney's "Cinderella" was more frightening. It was predictable, and to me it looked like a bad copy of "Scream" and "I Know What You Did Last Summer". At least, it's the first horror movie that made me cry...of laughter! So, if you want to see a good,Norwegian horror movie, this is not the one you want to see. see "Villmark"(Dark Woods) or "Fritt Vilt"(Cold Prey) instead.(But no-one of them scared me so much either...) The only horrible with this movie, it's the fact that it was ever made!!!<br /><br />DON'T BUY IT! DON'T RENT IT! DON'T SEE IT!
