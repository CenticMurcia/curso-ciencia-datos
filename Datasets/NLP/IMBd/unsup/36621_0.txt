This is a kind of "morality play," featuring a young albino man who has superhuman intellect and psychic powers ostensibly due to his mother having been killed by lightning while he was still in utero. With his ability to read the thoughts and feelings of others, he guages adult social relationships and situations with piercing accuracy, and he's certainly not autistic as he expresses emotions strongly and appropriately. Nevertheless, when confronted by other supposed adolescent boys (they all appeared about 25), he can't even figure out when it's in his best interest to keep his mouth shut. None of the characters, including his, is developed very much. Also, the soundtrack was too loud and too cloying, like something from a 1940's radio soap opera. I found nothing in particular to recommend this one.
