I knew who Charles Nelson Reilly was from the old game shows on TV when I was a kid. This movie is pretty much a film of his stage act (I didn't know he had one). The guy lived an incredible life and if he were to read this he would stress that he "STILL IS LIVING an incredible life." This is a great stage act brought to the screen and it has a real neat feel to it. The camera angles and editing add to this man's story telling. It is a very unique movie and I can't recommend it enough. I saw it down at the SWX film festival and everybody was raving about it. I think you walk into the movie with low expectations (who really wants to see an older man from cheesy game shows in a one-man stage show talk about his life?!) but the movie grabs you.
