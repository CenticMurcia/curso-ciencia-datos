*this comment may contain spoilers* <br /><br />Who wants to be a superhero is a reality show that seems to be far from reality. I saw a few ads for the show and was mildly interested but never actually got around to watch it. Then while being stuck and bored in my hotel I decided to give it a try. I loved it.<br /><br />I like superheroes so I was interested of course, but you don't have to to like the show. Stan challenges the type of person they are on the inside. Sometimes it can be very goofy and funny and other times you feel for the characters. It surprised me, and I couldn't stop talking about it. The eliminations are based off of what happens and not on appearance or popularity ,it's real, unlike many other reality shows. My mother watched one episode with me after I told her about it and now she can't wait for the new episode. It may look weird but it's a good show.
