The entire concept is great. This movie in no way is horrible, but its not actually a movie in the first place. Instead, it's more of a comedy. It follows along the lines of Snoop Dog entering a room, his adversary saying the clich√© of, "no! I'm sorry!," or, "Bones!" (shocked expression). I have got to say that Bones is first-rate comedy. It would be what Troll 2 would have been like if Busta Rhymes and Ice-T were cast.<br /><br />I ask you, however, what is greater than the concept of Evil Snoop Dogg coming back to earth to feast on human flesh, and wreak vengeance on those who betrayed him. Sure, it's been done in 50% of movies, but at least watch it for its absolute corniness.<br /><br />By the way, when Snoop was floating across the room with those eyes, I was rolling on the floor. I didn't see the ending, but it probably involves Snoop Dogg unleashing his rap zombies on the world, and feasting on the living, ending Civilization once and for all.
