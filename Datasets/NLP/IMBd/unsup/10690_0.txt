Well, first of all this is a great excellent documentary. The Story is great, the characters are so interesting, the edition, the photography and the music are just perfectly blended to the story. One of the things I like the most is that the plot thickens with every new chapter. When someone is shooting a documentary, you don't really know how it will end. Jean-Xavier was the one who bet everything in this particularly story. (To be able to "see through" people, stories, situations is a talent that few people have...) I think he spent 2 years and a half with the family. He got so close with the family that one is able to see everything from inside. That's one of the secrets of this film. I can't believe that after watching 6 hours straight, I was waiting for more!!! It's a great piece of artwork... Congratulations to everyone involved in this production... Thanks for inspiring me and so many people... Rating (1 to 10) Production:9 (the production spent E$1.5) Direction: 10 Photography: 9 Edition: 10 Music: 10 Story: 10
