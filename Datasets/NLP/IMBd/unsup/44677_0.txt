SPOILER ALERT!! This is on my worst- movies- of- all- time list. I usually don't like to comment negatively on IMDB, but I feel like this mistake of a film should not be committed again. You cannot tell your audience to take a suicide<br /><br />seriously if he tries to kill himself by drinking a bottle of her favorite shampoo-- I'm sorry, that's absurd. Having sex with Entimann's cake-- not cool. Pretending like these people go to Columbia University-- also not cool (although Julia Stiles actually does and she's very nice I hear, so I don't want to bad-mouth her, just her choice to play the part). The whole movie just pretty much sucked-- it didn't make sense, you didn't care about the characters, there were awful lines. It was an overly melodramatic love story coupled with what the writer probably thought was clever, original romantic, fun things, but in fact we were laughing at it-- not with it... Better luck next time guys!!
