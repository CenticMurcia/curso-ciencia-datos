Despite being centred around English characters and attitudes and comprising mainly British actors, this off-beat film is set and filmed in Denmark which gives it an intriguing air of quirkiness. The film maintains interest, even if the main character is too prone to making lengthy theatrical speeches. Ultimately though, the film does not satisfy because whatever message the film is putting across is too obscure.<br /><br />Technically the film is a bit disappointing. Scenes do not flow well and the dialogue sounds as if it was almost entirely post-dubbed (not surprising because the film was shot mainly on location in pouring rain). Other than interior scenes, the dialogue has an unpleasant "dead" studio sound.<br /><br />Roman Polanski's script has similarities with the dialogue contained in some of his other off-beat films such as Knife in the Water, Cul-de-sac but the direction, by Simon Hesera, lacks the sort of flair and style which Polanski always brings to his films.
