OK, this wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen, but it was far from one of the better ones. <br /><br />I did not emphazise with the lead character, or even the supporting characters - and kept asking myself why this exec guy McCallister and his wife got so much attention. What was the point? The only one I felt for to some degree was Alice, you could literally feel the stress she's under for having to negotiate between the writer and the network guys, always pretending it's not all that bad and everything is hunky-dory.<br /><br />The story line seemed to go nowhere. From the beginning I expected the things to happen that did happen, but I kept waiting for a twist, a punchline, SOMETHING. No need to say, it did not come.<br /><br />What really bugged me, though: I did not think that Mike's original material was all that good. It tried to be really deep, I guess, what with the brother's suicide, but from what I saw in the movie, it would have been just as lame. So I just couldn't feel any regret for the producer's walking all over the writer and the pilot. If at some point I would have seen something really good, I probably would have felt differently.<br /><br />If you want to spend time with an unoffensive so-called comedy that will not really surprise you or make you laugh, go see this movie. On the other hand, there are lots of funnier, more powerful movies out there...
