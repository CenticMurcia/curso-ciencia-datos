If you don't try to read too much meaning into some of the scenes in this film, you might find that it contains more truth about a 21st century society than anyone cares to admit. I saw this movie on it's original release and thought that it was just an exciting and hilarious ground breaking film ( I believe it had an X rating for a while ), and after seeing it again on DVD - I think it's a masterpiece.
