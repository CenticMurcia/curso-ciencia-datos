Fair film, directed by D.W. Griffith. Jim and John (Charles West and Joseph Graybill) are friends, and rivals for the attention of fetching Mary (Blanche Sweet). She picks John for her mate - and, soon, they are all aboard a Wagon Train crossing the dessert. Unfortunately, Ms. Sweet finds herself being physically abused by her drunken husband; probably, she picked the wrong rival. As if that wasn't enoughÂ… Indians attack! <br /><br />Relatively low excitement from Mr. Griffith and company. Big bad John eventually has an opportunity for atonement - will he give up his "Last Drop of Water" to save the life of his dying friend? <br /><br />**** The Last Drop of Water (7/27/11) D.W. Griffith ~ Blanche Sweet, Joseph Graybill, Charles West
