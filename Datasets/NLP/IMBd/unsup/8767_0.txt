Michael Wadleigh's Woodstock: 3 Days of Peace And Music to me, is more then just an ordinary run of the mill music documentary, it was a record of the hippie culture of 1969, the youth of America trying to make a difference, a spectacular experience of one of America's greatest rock festivals before the days of the original MTV (Music Television) & VH1 before they became sleezy reality TV networks. It was more about the kids, It marked the turning point careers of the future Academy Award Winning team of Director Martin Scorsese (Raging Bull, The Departed) & Editor Thelma Schoonmaker. It was definitely a challenge filming into a feature length film, real provocative documenting from beginning to end, with outstanding performances from Joan Baez, Janis Joplin, The Who, Joe Cocker & The Grease Band, Crosby, Stills & Nash, Sly And The Family Stone, Ten Years After, Sha Na Na, Canned Heat, Richie Havens, Jimi Hendrix, Country Joe McDonald & The Fish, John Sebastian, Arlo Guthrie, Jefferson Airplane, Santana and many others as well as interviews with Producer & Woodstock Founder Michael Lang, many of the locals in & out of the festival. The only music documentary of it's kind to win the 1971 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. There will never be a Woodstock like this again, Woodstock 1999 destroyed that tradition & to finally see this film on the 40th Anniversary Director's Cut DVD in all it's widescreen glory is a special treat. If you are into Classic Music or Music Documentaries, this is one of them, along with No Direction Home: Bob Dylan & Gimme Shelter.<br /><br />Woodstock: 3 Days Of Peace And Music is Rated R for Drug Content, Nudity & Language.
