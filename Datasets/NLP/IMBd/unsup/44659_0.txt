I'll keep this short and sweet: Anyone who found himself or herself crying at this film or felt that it paralleled his or her own experiences has taken part in the most shallow relationships possible, and should never be allowed to date. This is the most horrendously written piece of sappy drivel that I've seen in at least a few years. Most lines are predictable, and the story is absolutely worthless, not to mention that the constant narration that retells what we just saw makes the entire movie feel as though it's a prologue to a movie we really don't want to see. Keep your fantasies of these teen actors alive and go watch their 1999 movies instead.
