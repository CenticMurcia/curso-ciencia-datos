Indulgent MGM version of the life of "Marie Antoinette", as portrayed by Norma Shearer. The production is very beautiful looking, and well-performed. It is, however, excruciatingly long, and is without enough story embellishment to sustain interest; an even more fictionalized account might have been a wiser course of action. Ms. Shearer must be credited with crafting an vivid character; it's difficult, however, to feel much sympathy for her predicament, in this presentation. Robert Morley (as Louis XVI) elicits more sympathy, due to an almost oafish, but sensitive, portrayal; he is impressive, in his first feature film. John Barrymore (as Louis XV) and Gladys George (as du Barry) are among those delivering expert support. Particularly recommended for viewers with a longer life span than Marie Antoinette.<br /><br />******* Marie Antoinette (7/8/38) W.S. Van Dyke ~ Norma Shearer, Tyrone Power, Robert Morley
