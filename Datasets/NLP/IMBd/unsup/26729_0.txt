Well, what can I say about my favorite show? I don't know- I have been reading the reviews, and I've seen fans and anti-fans. Popular was an original show, I gotta admit it... it had everything, from those stupid jokes, to sarcasm laugher, tears and serious problems- that's what made this show unique. Life is not only tears, and it's not only laugher... life is a combination of suffering, pain and also love and happiness. Nothing is black or white; everything is gray- that's what the program used to show. Some people just don't get it; they misunderstand it and take it personally. I wanna see Popular again, but it's up to people I don't even know who they are. KEEP POPULAR ALIVE COZ' POPULAR IS SWEEEEEEEEEEET!!!!!!!
