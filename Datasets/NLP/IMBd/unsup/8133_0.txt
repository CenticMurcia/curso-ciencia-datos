Roger Moore takes a break from his more famous action character, James Bond, to play Rufus Excalibur ffolkes, an expert in underwater infiltration. He is approached to plan how to defeat anybody how attempted to seize an oil rig in the North Sea. Of course it isn't long before he has to put his ideas to the test as a group of criminals hijack a Norwegian supply vessel, plant bombs on two rigs then demand a ransom of twenty five million pounds within twenty four hours.<br /><br />ffolkes is a very different character to James Bond, he is somewhat eccentric and can't stand women but likes cats. The action also seems more realistic than most films, a no point do our heroes go in all guns blazing instead they negotiate with the criminals until they are ready to go in stealthily.<br /><br />The acting is solid enough especially from the stars Roger Moore, Anthony Perkins as the criminal leader and James Mason as the head of the navy. The only character I wasn't keen on was Perkin's deputy who would cackle like a pantomime villain at each of his boss's threats. While this isn't a great film, I'm sure it was never meant to be, it is good solid entertainment which doesn't contain excessive gore or bad language that so many films these days seen to contain.
