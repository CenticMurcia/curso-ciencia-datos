Ingmar Bergman certainly ranks among the elite of film directors, yet missteps with this, his first (of two) English language film. The Bergman regulars, Bibi Andersson and Max von Sydow star as an upscale Swedish married couple whose lives are altered by the seemingly mysterious appearance of American Elliot Gould. After a series of (not so) discreet passes, Andersson finds herself falling for the moody, unpredictable Gould.Sven Nykvist's cinematography and one surprisingly tender love scene nearly save this, but, the film is unable to overcome two glaring flaws: the awkwardness of the dialogue (written by Bergman) and the poor performance by Elliot Gould. Gould, I suppose, can be an engaging actor, but is way out of his league; this film is, ultimately, only for completists.
