Simply one of the most magnificent films ever made. Witty and intelligent underestimate the sheer craft and ingenuiety of Forsyth's finest work to date. Probably the finest he will ever. John Gordon Sinclair gives the role of Gregory like a dream as if it was written for him. Gregory is a very similar role to that played by Peter Capaldi in Forsyth's follow up Local Hero which is a sound piece of work. Dee Hepburn has a wonderful. Simply watch it as it will move you strangely.
