Few stars can claim as good a comic feature-film run as Michael J. From 1984 to 1991 he went with nary a dud (unless you count BTTF II). This film is pretty much the last in that streak. Michael plays a hotshot med school grad who wrecks a fence and his car on his way to a high-paying LA plastic surgery gig. Small town Southern judge holds Fox hostage and orders him to work off the damage by helping out the local doc, well-played by Hughes. Some of the rural stuff is laid on a bit too thick (and exactly WHERE is this town on the route to LA?) but the film is otherwise cute and enjoyable. Warner is rock solid as always and properly intriguing as the obligatory love interest.
