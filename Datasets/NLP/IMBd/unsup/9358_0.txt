I myself saw this film at around 12 years old and man the gore in this film was the only thing i wanted to see, I would invite all my friends round just to show a mans hand dissolved by fly vomit. But now as I watch the film 2 years later I realise its the emotional story between Seth and Veronica that drives it to the end.<br /><br />The moment he enters the pod with the fly I could just tell that the film would go from perfect to disastrous. The special effects in this film were highly impressive and the film full well deserved its best make up Oscar. But I believe that Jeff Goldblum deserved one also. When near the end of the film he is on the brink of his final transformation he rasps out a small but affectionate speech to Veronica, within moments he starts to talk slight nonsense but the fact that he can accept his fate really makes me sad. Then when he points the gun to his head and begs for death I suddenly realised the second time watching it the true pain both Physically and mentally he went through. I would have preferred to see Stathis the fly monster rather than Seth because for a man that sweet to change that badly, really gets me down.<br /><br />This is one of those films which you've heard of but never seen but it is a great film so watch it as soon as you can.
