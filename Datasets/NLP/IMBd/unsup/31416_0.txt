I too agree with the comments made by Casey-52. But I also saw the edited version. I just wanted to add the comment that if you happen to be a Rose McGowan fan or appreciate her looks this is a great film for that. She looks better than in some of her other films and even in the edited version you get to see her having sex at least maybe a dozen times - probably more - it's a LOT put it that way. So
