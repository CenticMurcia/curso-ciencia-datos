Amongst the other messages the film makers impart in their script - most of which seems to have been lifted off 'humourous' t-shirts. "I don't believe in God... Don't worry, he believes in you." that sort of thing - is the deeply nasty message that all disabled people are essentially evil. The first two people to fall under the spell of the Devil Messiah are the blind girl who has just been hanging around for no apparent reason and wheelchair bound superhacker who wrote the basic code for the evil program (and who by an amazing co incidence happens to be the half brother of the leader of the underground. Don't evil masterminds do ANY background checks on who they employ? - and why, if they are related, he has an American accent and she an English one is another mystery.) You can tell he has turned evil because he shoots his own cute little doggie. Bad cripple.<br /><br />Some other random jottings of how deeply stupid this movie is: <br /><br />What Time zone is this film set in? It's typical of American yahoo isolationism that it ignores the fact that the International Date Line is WEST of the USA. All of Asia, Europe and Australasia (ie most of the world) will have been in the Day of Wonders long before most people in the US would have had their breakfast.<br /><br />For the nerve centre of Satan's master plan the O.N.E. HQ was insanely understaffed. This is the Center of the New World Order for crying out loud! Surely there would be someone there undermining someone's liberty or taxing someone or telling the Black Helicopters where to go. In fact no one seemed to be there at all. Where are these 5,000 people who we are told go in and out of the building every day? Especially on this day of all days. The Biggy. Security consisted of one person on the front desk who, when as a ruse the "Most Wanted" person in the world is marched past him (and he recognises her), doesn't bat an eyelid. He just mutters "Oh good you've caught her." This is deeply stupid film making.<br /><br />I loved the head bad guy's over acting, every evil twitch scowl and grimace he could throw into his part he threw in. Good for him. I loved the bad lip syching of the voice they dubbed in over him. But I especially loved the scene where, amazingly, they DIDN'T dub the voice in and we heard him deliver his lines in a squeaky English accent. OK, squeaky is overdoing it, but it wasn't the deep mellow voice that was shoved in his mouth for the rest of the time.<br /><br />Right at the start of the film one of the happy clappies had smuggled a disc out of Evil HQ. Our bulletproof walk-through-walls baddie gets one of his sidekicks to blow up a school bus full of kids, then gets the police to follow the radio signal back to the happy clappy hide out with orders to kill everyone, while he waits about upstairs. Why didn't he go and get it himself? He seemed to have no compunction about killing anyone else he felt like for the flimsiest of reasons.<br /><br />I love bad movies. I really do. Most bad movies seem to be in the horror genre or science fiction, there seem to be something about those two fields that attracts incompetents with delusions of adequacy. Watching this deeply unpleasant piece of sh1t I have discovered a whole new area of crap to explore. The 'Christian' Science Fiction Horror movie.<br /><br />Let no one be in doubt, this is one deeply stupid, badly made, illogical piece of filth - and if you think I'm going to hell for saying that, I feel sorry for you.<br /><br />Best stupid line:<br /><br />Standing in a room full of computers.<br /><br />He: "We need to find another computer that's on the network!" (to replace the one their friend just shot).<br /><br />She: (points) "How about that one?"
