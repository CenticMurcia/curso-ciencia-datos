The concept of this film is one that hits on one of the secret concerns of people involved with robotic technology, will the machine take over from the human. Robin Williams portrayed the role in going from the machine to showing that there were feelings evolving, and brilliantly, I must say. Using a future time base was smart, removed, but still the possibility being there! A question is left - IS IT POSSIBLE??
