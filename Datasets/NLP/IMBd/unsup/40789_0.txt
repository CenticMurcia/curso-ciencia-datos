This could have been good, but it's too much a "Hound for Our Times". It obviously appeals to people who've never read the book or seen any of the other versions. Richard E Grant stands out of the morass as an excellent Stapleton - how about keeping him on and remaking the story? The "my wife's a medium" bit is not from the book but from the 40s Rathbone/Bruce version. If only film makers would stick to Conan Doyle's unerring Shakespearean prose! Nobody even says the words "Great Grympen Mire"! And we need the scene setting at the beginning where Holmes and Watson divine the character of Dr Mortimer from his walking stick, and then Mortimer's telling of the story. Footprints - a man's or a woman's? Mr Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound! Though Jeremy Brett was a great Holmes, his Baskerville completely muffed the suspense. The Peter Cushing TV version is the best I've ever seen. Little joke from the 40s version - whenever they go out onto the moor, you hear tropical frogs on the sound track. A final comment on this Nettles/Grant version (I've already forgotten who played H and W) - the most frightening moment was the embarrassing hey nonny no Christmas festivities scene. Time stood still, and not in a good way.
