For the first 2 minutes I thought that its a spoof on Karan Johar movies. Then I realized what I was in for! 3 long hours of pure crap. I went with very low expectations. But I was secretly praying that Fanaa would not be a simple love story. It would be something with a twist like 1947 - Earth.<br /><br />Kajol looked great though. But rest everything is so totally crappy. There are thousands of close-ups, obscene sentimental background score at every 2nd dialog. <br /><br />Amir was a big disappointment. He has proved the innocence of Shahrukh Khan - "If the director is adamant for sentimental crap, you can not do anything about it". I liked first 3-4 instances of Shayari. But after 10 minutes, it started giving me a headache. It was like the sound of a big metal trunk being dragged on the floor. Yes, his expressions are becoming repetitive and his tummy is getting bigger. I guess he is stressed because he is pregnant.<br /><br />Fanaa was worse than Kal Ho Na Ho and slightly better than Main Prem Ki Diwani Hoon.<br /><br />So bad, they chose this very cute kid to play young Rehan. Otherwise I would have hunted him down and given him the beating of his life. The child's character was so boring and irritating. Something like Amisha Patel; cute, but irritatingly stupid/retarded.<br /><br />The biggest itch in the balls : I can't find people who share my view. Especially girls are going crazy about this movie, as expected. Indian audience doesn't deserve good movies.
