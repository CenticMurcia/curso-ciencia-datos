Wilbur wants to kill himself is about a twenty something scotsman, whose main objective in life is to end it. Ironically, being extremely appealing to the opposite sex doesnt help much either.<br /><br />I went to see this film in my local cinema where it described the film as the 'blackest of black comedies'. It is understandable that that there are a few comical incidents regarding suicide, but to call it the 'blackest of black comedies' is an overstatement. I really enjoyed the film; the music was very fitting to the flow of it and the characters were very well developed. The setting also made it very enjoyable (the bookshop), possibly because one of my favourite characters (the kipling fanatic) only appeared in this location. The plot however i thought turned very sharply from one direction to another (wilburs suicidal tendencies to his relationship with his brothers wife, and then the end scene).<br /><br />Overall I thought the film had a very original idea and was very enjoyable, and i would definitely see it again. Just remember that if you decide to see it to keep an open mind.<br /><br />7 out of 10
