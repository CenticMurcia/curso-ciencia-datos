Liza/Z is great! Really good bonus features. The Toronto Film Fest alone, proves that Liza is still sharp as a whip! That said, she did forget that at the beginning of Son of A Preacher Man - Fosse was paying tribute to Ailey with those "Revelations" arms. And I'm still trying to find out the name of the male singer that starts Preacherman. <br /><br />As much as I'm thankful for the careful restoration of this major event, I still feel that an integral part of the show has been slighted: the dancers! I really wish someone had bothered to list the dancers in the credits. While a few names are mentioned, surely the overall group should be known as more than just "the kids". I understand that 1972 was a long time around, but surely someone remembers all of their names. In fact, I would have enjoyed seeing Liza in a room with the some of the dancers - sharing memories. (I know Candy Brown is still around)
