This may be the worst movie I've ever seen, but I'm sure there's worse out there, that's why I gave it a two out of ten.<br /><br />You can't blame the budget for how much this film sucks. The acting is horrible, I've seen movies on a smaller budget with better acting. The fighting sequences are lazy and the story is non existent. The first 20 minutes of this film is fighting, for absolutely no reason. There are a lot of sequences that just don't' make sense visually as you watch it, they are so absurd and badly choreographed most of you could do better yourselves. There is no plot for about 1/2 of the movie. You can't even play the artistic freedom card in this abomination of a film. I like bad movies too... but this one is hard to laugh at, it just angers you cause you know you could do better with $16,000.<br /><br />Final Thought: Don't watch this for action, don't watch it for acting, don't watch it for creativity, only watch it cause it overall worse than any movie you've ever seen.
