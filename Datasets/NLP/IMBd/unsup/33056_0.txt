Phoebe Cates and Willie Aames (was this guy ever really a respected actor?) embark on a goofy journey into the heart of the modern day vision of paradise. No jobs, no paychecks, no deadlines, no traffic, none of that. Just beautiful weather, stunning waterfalls, loincloths, and of course, angry Arabs intent on adding poor Sarah (Cates) to his collection of mistresses.<br /><br />David and Sarah had narrowly escaped from these menacing enemies, and found a peaceful place in paradise to spend their time. Luckily, they happen to have run across all of the modern conveniences; a nice little house, beds with perfect mattresses, pillows, tables, pots & pans, a bench swing, a wide variety of clothes and jewelry for Sarah, everything that logically should not be there. <br /><br />The story almost resembles something that could be a little interesting, but it falls apart because of bland direction and absolutely ridiculous acting (especially from Aames). And while the extensive nudity was not always unwelcome, the majority of it was clearly thrown in for no good reason. The romance that developed between David and Sarah (after she eventually pounded her amorous interests through his idiot skull) was believable enough I guess, but you really had to try hard to get past the idiotic acting and the pathetic dialogue.
