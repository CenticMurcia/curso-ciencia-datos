When Elvis filmed 'Speedway' in June of 1967 it was a time of change. He had been married just over a month, Priscilla was pregnant with Lisa-Marie and this film would be his biggest hit since 1965.<br /><br />Elvis looked great, had a leading lady of star quality but mostly he seemed to find joy in making movies again. The rapport with Bill Bixby (sadly lost on 'Clambake') is excellent and their banters and on screen one-up-manship make for some delightful exchanges.<br /><br />The title track is sung with gusto while 'Let Yourself Go' and 'Your Time Hasn't Come Yet Baby' are other stand-out tracks.<br /><br />A year later in the June of 1968 history would be made when Elvis once again entered a stage for the first time in 7 years to record his TV special for NBC now affectionately known as 'the Comeback'.<br /><br />Andy
