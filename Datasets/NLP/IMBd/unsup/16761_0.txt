I give this 7 out of 10. I love American movies made during the 1930's. They are smart but funny. The female roles are strong but vulnerable. Perhaps it is because of the Depression Era but whatever it is, the movies were made with certain something that made them special. I found this movie to be more realistic than I had anticipated. The outcome may or may not be satisfactory to some, including myself but it was still entertaining, although I certainly could see it going the other way. Whatever the case, I highly suggest renting or buying it and seeing it for yourself.<br /><br />In this story, Clark Gable plays a president of a publishing empire, who is in love with his wife, played by Myrna Lloyd.
