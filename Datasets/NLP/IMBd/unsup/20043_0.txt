I loved Kate and Allie. <br /><br />I haven't seen it for years but I remember it being funny and smart, and the first show that had divorced women just getting on with things.<br /><br />In '80s Britain if you were from a single parent household you were nothing but a criminal in the making! - this show was the tonic to all that stuff and nonsense, and I have very warm memories of settling down to my weekly slice of New York life.<br /><br />- IMDb has a silly rule about having to have 10 lines of text before they'll allow you to post a comment, so now I have to ramble on although I've already made my point. So here you go. Ramble, ramble, ramble, ramble -
