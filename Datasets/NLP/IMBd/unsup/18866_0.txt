A piece of pure schlock to say the very least. The basic "story", if you can call it that, is pretty much a ripoff from the far better and much more intense "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" from the 1970's. This Zombie (Rob) film is nothing more than a feeble attempt to shock you into numbness, as is shown with most of the victims in this story. Dr. Satan? He or "it" appears more as some kind of alien creature or maybe an actual demon from the underworld. And there is no real attempt to explain or define what the motivation for all this butchery is. It just happens, one after another. It also leaves nothing to your imagination so that you dredge up in your mind what's happening as in the original "Texas Chainsaw." In this flop everything is right out there in the open, distorted camera shots as they may be. A waste of time. Avoid it like the plague!
