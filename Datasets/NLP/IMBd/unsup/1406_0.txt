This movie is not only one of the best horror films of Hollywood's golden era, but it is also one of the most bizarre movies ever made. It is also of great historical importance because it is the first movie that paired Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff, the two most venerated iconic figures of the horror genre. Lugosi plays a man thirsty for revenge, and Karloff is the man Lugosi is after. In the midst of high art-deco glory, both men battle each other to death. It is an old-fashioned good vs. evil story, redressed with strange sensibilities. What is fascinating about the movie is the way the film's antagonists choose to play their deadly games against each other. There are no fist fights or scream contests in this movie (there is some of that near the end of the film, though); everything about the movie is hysterical, but strangely subdued. A contradiction that creates a very unique atmosphere. Also, it is truly unnerving to see that the film's hero (the one we are supposed to identify with) is probably as insane as the villain. Lugosi and Karloff are simply brilliant; I've never seen a better pairing of two actors. It's a match made in heaven/hell. Script, sets, costumes, cinematography; everything about the film is top notch. A masterpiece of the macabre, and one film that gets better and better with each viewing.
