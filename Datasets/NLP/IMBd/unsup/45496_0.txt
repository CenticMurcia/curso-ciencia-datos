I can always seem to tell how good a movie is going to be by the opening soundtrack music. This movie was no exception. I've heard better music on a Casio keyboard pre-programmmed. I watched this based the actors merit only. It was almost a complete waste of time. Only a movie with this thin of a plot could have as many holes. The funnest part of this movie was the word game played with the main character and his girlfriend. I've seen better. Too many to mention. I've seen worse. The only one that comes to mind is From Justin To Kelly. If you want to waste some time at 3 in the morning whilst madly drunk, be my guest. Otherwise, change the channel.
