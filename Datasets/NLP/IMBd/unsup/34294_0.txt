This movie is boring than I thought. Well I have to say the first one was great & the sound effects were superb comparing with this one. Boogeyman 2 has nothing to do with the first movie. no proper storyline, most of the cast are new. the first movie was with a real boogeyman, and this one a human trapped inside a mask trying to be boogeyman. funny to me. I don't know how other viewer think about this movie. it's up to them. Horror movies in the 80's & 90's are with real fear. Horror movies that are releasing now is only with gore, violence, sex & bloody scenes. A real horror movie is about special effects like evil dead, omen, exorcist, sleepy hollow. ghost ship, etc. I am afraid whether all other movies about to releas is just like Boogeyman 2!!!
