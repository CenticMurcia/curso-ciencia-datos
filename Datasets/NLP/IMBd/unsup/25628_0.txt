The idea behind this film is quite good, actually, but its execution leaves something to be desired. A mysterious fog surrounds the state of California and communication to the outside world is cut off. With that strange fog comes the disappearance of the entire Mexican population. Which, some actually think is great, until they realize the consequences. The idea that a group of people that are taken entirely for granted are suddenly gone is very good, as in no one realizes how good things were until they change drastically. All of a sudden, there's no fresh fruit or vegetables, crops are rotting because there's no one to pick them, and there are plenty of other jobs that there's no one left to do. Including missing school teaches, INS workers, etc. Just in case anyone thinks that they only jobs Mexicans can do is pick produce. The problem with this film is that in some ways it tries to come off as a goofy comedy but doesn't really succeed there. There are a few good lines and situations though, like the wife of a state Senator that says "Why does everyone think that a rich white man that votes against a minority is a racist?". Yeah, why? I lived in California for 23 years and having Mexican people around is a way of life, they're just other people, they have lives and feelings and YES they do a hell of a lot of the work, so I get the idea behind this film, very well, even though that a lot of the work that is portrayed is work that no one else will do. What's really funny is when welfare recipients and prisoners are brought in to pick oranges on one farmer's ranch, they're absolutely worthless. Like I mentioned, the idea behind the film and some of the "statistics" thrown out at the viewer are good, but the film isn't really strong enough to be awesome, it's merely only good. 7 out of 10.
