this is a tale of pre-aids post stone wall. gay in new york city (early village) this a very important film for many reasons including the 1973 NYC gay pride parade footage, the very ground breaking subject of that time men on men in long term relationships, also for its very butiful gay love seence. A truly butiful movie a decade before its time. thanx sky w.
