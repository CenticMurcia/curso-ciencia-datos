This shows has no plot line outside of a mad scientist who forces a home-made robotic chicken to watch random TV clips. It's all done in stop-motion animation and uses popular cartoon characters and toys from the late seventies and early eighties. The skits could be anything from a parody of a movie or TV show, a fake commercial, or just random events (presumably TV shows as the robot chicken is being forced to view a multitude of TV screens at the opening of every episode). The humor is often dark, dealing with subjects like psychosis, murder, terminal illness, abuse, rape, the awkwardness of adolescence, and violence in general, but the writers are not above making light of even that.<br /><br />One memorable skit involved the three possible endings to a story in which an abusive husband murders his wife as his son and the Tooth Fairy listen in from the child's bedroom, at the end of which a parade of characters comes into the boy's room with banners proclaiming and celebrating it as the darkest sketch in television history. While the humor is definitely not clean in nature, it's appealing to older adolescents and adults, particularly those who grew up with the toys and cartoons they most often utilize in the show (transformers, thundercats, rainbow bright, smurfs, scooby doo, gi joe, etc.).
