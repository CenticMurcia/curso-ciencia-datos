This is the worst movie I've seen this year so far. The story is about doctor Hirschfeld that struggled at the end of the 19th century for homo-sexuality and trans-sexuality. So far so good. The theme is allright, and the brave man deserves a good biography. Nevertheless, the way this biopic was made, was like the copywriter litterally copied some lines from the encyclopedia. The acting was done by a bunch of amateur playwright actors: you could see them thinking: there is an audience watching at me. And to top things, there was not a single scene that was either witty or exciting. Oh, well, just don't waste your time on this kitsch movie, especially if you are interested in the life in Hirschfeld.
