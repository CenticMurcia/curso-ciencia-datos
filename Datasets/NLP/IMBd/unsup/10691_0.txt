This film about a murder case, about the trial after it, is one of these American films, in fact a TV mini-series, on a real case that does not go in the normal direction, the direction of what we all should think not truth is but justice should be. There is such an enormous amount of doubt about the case, about the guilt and even about the murder itself that it is unbelievable that a unanimous verdict of guilt came out of the jury pool. Such cases are examples for us to question the system of justice we set up over the last four centuries. And the judge decided to impose life imprisonment but for first degree murder it could have been the death penalty. It is such cases that prove that jury justice is maybe good in many cases but there are a few cases where it is the worst possible system, and that is why the death penalty should be gotten rid of, and that's why we should make sure the defendants, now sentenced culprits, have access to all possibilities and opportunities to appeal the decision and to have the best councilors available. Jury justice in a world that is so deeply cut in small antagonistic pieces does not work in any sensitive delicate case because of any kind of un-namable bias having to do with race, wealth, age, sex, sexual orientation, and any other parameter you may think of. This case should be compared to other cases where the reverse decision was reached, but the model of such a case of failed justice was clearly written in a book and set to the screen a long time ago: "To Kill a Mocking Bird". Miscarriage of justice due to some kind of totally unmentionable prejudice. I am not sure though that the conclusion of "Romeo and Juliet" is the proper one here: "They are all Punished", because in Romeo and Juliet's case there was no trial, and especially no jury trial.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
