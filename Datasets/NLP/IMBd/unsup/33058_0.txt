Silly rehash of "The Blue Lagoon". The plot is pointless--this was just made to show Willie Aames and Phoebe Cates as nude as many times as an R rating would allow.<br /><br />Now I like "The Blue Lagoon". Yes it's stupid but Brooke Shields and Christopher Atkins had nice bodies and were actually not bad as actors. Beautiful cinematography too. As for this movie--Aames and Cates are young and have great bodies too--but they can't act. The nudity can only carry this movie so far. Without that you're left with a boring story and lousy actors. When I saw it at a theatre the audience was quiet--at first. After the first two nude scenes people started to walk out. Then people started giggling at the horrendous acting. By the end of the film most of the audience was in hysterics laughing out loud at this. I think the part that really set them off was when they showed the monkey miming what Aames did when he "pleasured" himself. That aside the characters were totally obnoxious. Aames comes across as a spoiled brat--Cates came across as not having a brain. Heck, this doesn't even have the beautiful shots that "Blue Lagoom" had! Unless you're desperate to see these two actors nude you can skip this.
