Woeful, and blatant, attempt to cash in on the "Breakdance" craze that swept the western world in the early to mid-eighties.<br /><br />The script (from Allen DeBevoise, Gerald Scaife and Charles Parker) is a terrible "Flashdance" clone with street dancers Adolfo Quinones and Michael Chambers trying to get their big break on the stage, and show the world what they can do, with the help of classically trained hoofer Lucinda Dickey. The only thing worth watching is the dancing itself, with some well choreographed pieces blending easily with the natural 'breakin' talent.<br /><br />There is absolutely no acting prowess on show, and director Joel Silberg would be well advised to stick to putting up the money for someone else to run things. For something a little more down to earth and closer to reality, try "Beat Street". Music was penned by Gary Remal and Michael Boyd.<br /><br />Sunday, August 18, 1996 - Video
