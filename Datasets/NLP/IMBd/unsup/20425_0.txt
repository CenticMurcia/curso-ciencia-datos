This is not a good Football movie (Yes I said Football because thats what its called, not soccer)Generally football movies aren't good because they truly fail to capture what is so great about the game. Also I watch the Cahmpions league and many of the games from the Spanish league and it doesn't work for me when you actually know what truly happened in those games, for example Madrid lost against Arsenal, and actually didn't get that far in champions that year. I agree with what many of you have said, the film is a HUGE Adidas commercial and the fact that when the movie came out, many of the players weren't in Real Madrid anymore. and Im sorry but Owen for Mu√±ez is not a plot twist, that actually happened, the difference is that Owen was bought by Newcastle not switched.<br /><br />The main problem with the movie is that if you are a true football fan you know that many of stunts pulled off in the movie could never be pulled off in real life and that is where the movie looses a lot of its credibility. The cameos of famous players were fantastic although I don't agree with the over exposure of Beckham but the other cameos are great. And trust me the third one is going to be bad the first one was not bad, the third one was bad and I truly hope the next one isn't worse than this one.
