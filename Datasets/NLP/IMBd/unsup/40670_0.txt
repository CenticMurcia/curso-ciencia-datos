A young prep school teen(Lukas Haas, quite good)gets involved with a mysterious young woman(Winona Ryder, who doesn't register or emote..not one of her better performances)who has a secret she is hiding. During the film snippets of a past acquaintance(Skeet Ulrich)may answer that very secret. Chris Cooper has a thankless, clich√©d role as profane, short-fused father of Haas. Jessica Harper has the thankless role as Haas' mother, the typical hush-hush-wife afraid of her hot-tempered husband. John C Reilly also has a minor role as a kindly officer trying to locate Ryder over the whereabouts of baseball star Ulrich.<br /><br />The oh-so-big mystery isn't anything to write home about and Ryder is merely a confused dame. The supposed fireworks between Haas and Ryder is non-existent & the film is really unfocused. We get a lot of story on Haas' life in a school for rich annoying kids and with little chemistry between the leads(not to mention a plot which doesn't provide us much in why either would prefer to have such a relationship), there is very little to get excited about. I'd say see the film for Haas' performance, because the rest of this mediocre effort isn't worth your time.
