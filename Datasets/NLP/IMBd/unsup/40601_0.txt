This is the worst drivel I've ever seen come to the screen. The so-called actors appeared to be reciting from scripts. The stereotypical teenagers were utterly unsympathetic - no, not unsympathetic, but just so cardboard that I could care less about any of them. (Spoiler Alert, if it's even feasible to 'spoil' a movie like this.) Then of course there's the little girl who looks up with her innocent praying eyes all but jumping up and down in front of the screen "I'm the Christ Figure!!! The sacrificial lamb, that's me!" Oh, but it gets worse. They've decided to throw in possibly the most cliched and outright groan-worthy pseudo plot-twist ever invented. The 'then she woke up twist' where you find none of it was really real. It was all in his head. Oh my gosh! How deep! Well that just makes the whole movie then! It just says so much about misunderstood teens in an oppressive adult society littered with sex, drugs, and violence. (dripping sarcasm, if you hadn't noticed). The only conceivable way to enjoy this movie is with a lot of alcohol, because really it's so ridiculous and bad it's just downright funny. You'll find yourself laughing so hard that tears will stream down your face as you contemplate that there were people that actually read this script and thought it was such a good movie they actually FUNDED it!
