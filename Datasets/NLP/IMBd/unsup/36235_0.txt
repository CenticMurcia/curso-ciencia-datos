Dan Haggerty has sure been in some fine movies. Elves, and this...and maybe some other equally fine movies. Grizzly Adams stuff, I reckon. I guess you could call this Nightmare on Elm Street meets Platoon, but that's an insult to Nightmare On Elm Street and I've never seen Platoon, but that's the first war movie that came to mind. Some Vietnam vets are having realistic dreams about their experiences during the war. They actually look rather young to have been there at all considering the war ended a good 16-17 years before this movie was made? I found this to be a very flat movie, little in the way of excitement or scares. It does have the "Nightmare on Elm St." thing going on though with trying to stay awake or having someone watch you so they can wake you up if the dream gets too bad. I could identify with the trying to stay awake part, I was having a lot of trouble with that myself. One absolutely ridiculous scene consists of two guys lying on a double bed in a suburban bedroom, dressed in their combat fatigues, firing their machine guns while asleep. What the hell? Anyway, I passed this one up time after time at the "used" store, but finally broke down and got it because I was intrigued. Nothing to be intrigued about, guess I should go with my gut feelings. Ptooey.
