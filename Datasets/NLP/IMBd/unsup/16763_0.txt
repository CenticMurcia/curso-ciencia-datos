"Wife vs. Secretary" is a warm and touching movie about the business world in 1936. It seems farfetched because many people were still struggling after the depression. It showed the public how some CEO's lived in luxurious apartments, have art deco offices, and visited mansions and exotic lands for business. <br /><br />What's nice is to see Jean Harlow as a regular person who is a secretary to the CEO, Clark Gable, who is married to Myra Loy. True is seems unbelievable these glamorous people could be part of the business world but this is Hollywood's version. And to top that, Harlow has a young James Stewart as a struggling boyfriend. What luck!<br /><br />It's a fun and thoughtful movie to watch - thanks to the director, Clarence Brown, and the screenwriters. It would have been a different movie without the Production Code of 1934 and not as good.
