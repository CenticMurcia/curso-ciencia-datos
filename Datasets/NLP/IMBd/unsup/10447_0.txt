I started watching this show in '04. I watched the pilot and loved it. I like Cassie because she is just a typical teen in school. Few friends, not part of a big crowd but she wants it a lot. When she discovers her powers, things get interesting. She can move things without touching them, set things alight with her mind etc. But, her powers are part of the cause of her mate Thelma dying. Cassie has a love hate relationship with Azazeal leader a group of fallen angels. As the show progresses , Cassie becomes pregnant with Azazeal's child. The child grows at a quick speed. Cassie tries to terminate the birth but Azazeal manages to stop it. I turns out Cassie only had a C-section and gave birth to an evil son (born on Christmas day). In season 2 Ella arrives to kill the child but Cassie's feelings get in the way and she sacrifices herself for the child. The child ages about 16-18 years in 6 months! He takes over a school and plans to destroy the world. A good show if you want drama, comedy, a little action and romance with a lot of horror. 10/10
