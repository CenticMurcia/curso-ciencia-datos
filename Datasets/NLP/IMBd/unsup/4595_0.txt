The movie is about a sixteen year old whose mother takes care of her baby. This sixteen year old had sex and gave birth but assumes no responsibility for the child. Jacey the sixteen year old lives at home with her mom and sister. Doesn't every teen mother wish they could have their parents raise their child. NOT!! I was angry, its not a good idea to have a movie that praises a sixteen year old to have a baby and just let MOM take care of it.. It is all MOMS idea also to move the family and not tell the father of the child that he made a baby. How nice!! And yes predictable..This movie is so predictable about the couple that can't have a baby, which oddly enough is Jaceys sex education teacher..I am like okay how long till we see Jaceys baby in the crib of this teacher. Just give her the baby already. This teacher is being portrayed as very jealous woman. A woman who is jealous of young sixteen year olds that can get pregnant. YEAH thats something to be jealous over being pregnant and sixteen. This movie is just not realistic!!
