This is the shortest Chaplin short I have ever watched. As a result, there is absolutely no time for the development of a story--something SUPER-important to good Chaplin films. In addition, this film is almost pure slapstick--with tons of pratfalls, slapping, hitting, etc. Because of this, the film has absolutely no depth or quality about it. It's just people getting hurt with little reason for this other than cheap laughs. So, I would NOT recommend this film to those who are not very familiar with Chaplin's work--they will get the wrong idea about him. They would incorrectly assume he wasn't that funny and his films were quickly slapped together. While this might be true of the very earliest films he made in 1914, by 1915 he was, aside from this film, doing better and more well-crafted work.
