I don't know what type of kool-aid everyone else has been drinking, but this movie was a total disappointment. Brilliant? Huh? Are we watching the same movie? Because the movie I saw had a fairly odious protagonist, a supporting cast that existed solely to be ridiculed, a series of 'crazy' events befalling our 'hapless' protagonist that exist nowhere on the reality continuum, and seemed to have been invented by a corp committee composed of former frat 'dudes' pitching ideas for 'worst night ever' that aren't funny and mostly don't even make sense. Most (all?) of the 'crazy' people whom whatever the guys name is meets in his 'romp' thru nyc are women, who proceed to beguile him with their alluring sex appeal (with the exception of poor Teri Garr, who for some reason is made out to be some pathetic spinster... or something...) only to send him running once they reveal their true 'scary' woman-personalities. Isn't that always the way of it?? This movie is sexist, stupid, unlikeable, unfunny and makes little to no sense. Madcap is one thing. This is more like nocap. I've always thought Scorcese was overrated, especially considering all of the movies he's made in the past ten years have sucked besides the Departed, and that honestly wasn't even that great. Don't even bother with the trailer for this one
