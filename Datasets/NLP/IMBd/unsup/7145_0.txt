All I would like to say is better job next time. This movie will probably act as a spring-board for all involved but honestly it is flawed in nearly every aspect.<br /><br />Not to write any spoilers, although talking over the flaws would give some of the story away. So I'll just write the 6 biggest flaws:<br /><br />1. Title sequence: this goes on for a very long time. Bored me to tears. 2. Sound: most if not all dialogue is inaudible. At times the music tends to totally obstruct everything. 3. Ghost Town: characters are totally unquestioning of their new setting, treating 18th century sheriffs as modern day police. 4. Romance: the two escaping heroes appear to be romantically connected but this is never pursued. 5. Ending: final ending making no sense. 6. Acting: Indian man laughing... if you watch this be prepared for irritation.<br /><br />The camera quality is very poor, but this is a low budget movie so that is be expected. Lot's of blurring or high frame-rates.<br /><br />Some of the gore is actually well done, however one scene shows blood coming from a gunshot wound to the foot, the blood is far too thin and even has a froth.<br /><br />In general avoid, but if you are into seeing others low budget work, certainly one for inspiration.
