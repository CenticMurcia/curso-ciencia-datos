Very good sequel to the original flop from 2000. For what seemed to be a lower budget movie being made for TV. Way better acting and cgi. I was a bit dismayed when I found that it was a sequel to that one due to its cheese factor.<br /><br />The only flub I noted was when the half elf wizardess teleported them into damadar's lair. She cast it with one hand and the other came out stuck in the wall upon landing and I assumed she was holding her staff in it so why was it not stuck in the wall too? When they ported back out she appeared holding the staff while the fighter/lord guy was carrying her. And truly they should have been physically touching for them to go along.<br /><br />Other then those small oversights the movie was a very well done. It made me glad to see that a Dungeons and Dragons movie could be made with a good story and not as cheesy as the movie that it was descended from.<br /><br />The cleric being wrongfully portrayed as wise and battle worn would not have been dumb enough to try to face down a white dragon like that alone. That was a novice move.
