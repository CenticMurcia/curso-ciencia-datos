Having seen the first three parts I must say I do like this show and I don't wanna miss the upcoming episodes. Somehow I never had a dull moment watching Lucy Liu, Bonnie Somerville and the other cougars.<br /><br />I think its a great mixture of glamor, betrayal, intrigues and tough business women. It is fast paced, it has good acting and it does have a plot you wanna follow from one episode to the next and you wanna know where these characters might end up.<br /><br />Even if it's not that realistic (or do you know a group of successful female executives looking that good?) I like being lifted up a little (reality bites) by a show that has the right heart beat. So I'm looking forward to seeing more of the Cashmere Mafia (must have been the Cartwrights in their former life) an I give them 7 out of 10 stars.
