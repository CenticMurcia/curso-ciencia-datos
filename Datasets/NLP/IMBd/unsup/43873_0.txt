Yet another disappointing installment in the "infamous" "Guinea Pig" series. To be quite honest, none of the films in the series are all that great, but this one REALLY sucks. Long story short - freaky dwarf guy tries to heal ailing sister through weird experimentation. The story is retarded, the "gore" scenes are laughable at best, the acting is non-existent...I honestly can't find a single redeeming quality in this mess. Unearthed does a great job with the transfer quality, but that doesn't save this piece of garbage. Not gory, not shocking...In my opinion "Flower of Flesh and Blood", "He Never Dies", and "Mermaid in a Manhole" are really the only "Guinea Pig" films worth looking at at all, and even those aren't masterpieces by any means. Leave this one alone... 1/10
