R. Kelly is a disgrace to all black people. Not only that, but he is also a disgrace to the entire human race. Go away, R. Kelly. You were 'THIS CLOSE' to being cool. But you just had ta pee on the b*tch, didn't ya? DIDN'T YA!? i hate you R. Kelly. I really, really hate you. I think you are this generation's Hitler. You suck. In case you don't get the idea, i'll give you some director's commentary: I hate you. I seriously do not like this movie. And the IMDb comment rules. And also, i hope the so called 'stars' of this 'feature' understand that they will never get an 'acting' job again. See you in porn, folks. I also feel bad about the people who worked with him on this 'project' did they, like, know he was a joke? I don't understand how this even exists.
