I just want to say something real quick before we begin. This movie shouldn't exist. If I could go back in time I would go back to the beginning of Conrad John's lineage and smite his ancestors so that he may never make a movie such that is this. I cannot even begin to describe how this movie fails on all accounts. The director makes a comment about how most of the dialogue is ad-libbed. I think most of his career is ad-libbed. And by ad-libbed I mean suck. Conrad feels the need to emphasize various aspects of the movie by showing his characters doing the same damn thing over and over again in long drawn out shots. One thing I do have to give him credit for though is that he doesn't pussyfoot around showing boobs. He just comes right out and says "lol it pretty much has to be done so we're gonna do it." Aside from that, and the awesome soundtrack, this movie has absolutely nothing going for it. It's not even cheesy, it's just over an hour of mindless whatever that will make you cry and say "What did I just watch? What is this? Where am I and why am I typing a review for it?"
