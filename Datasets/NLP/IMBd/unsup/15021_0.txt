Actors were good considering what they had to work with.If you are going to write disparaging remarks,they should be directed at the editor.They all had to start somewhere.Good movie.James Clayton did an excellent job trying to make something out of the script.I've seen his work in other movies that were written far better and the editor didn't butcher the work.He has a lot of talent.I'll bet money that if he ever gets involved with a dynamic script that allows him to show what he can do,he will be a force to be reckoned with.Don't forget,this is Canada.It is a heck of a struggle just to get started and then even harder to find a project that will do a good actor justice.
