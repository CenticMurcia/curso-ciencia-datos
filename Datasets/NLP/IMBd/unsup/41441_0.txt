If more people had seen this movie, I'm sure it would have a high (or low) place on the IMDb's 100 lowest rated films. It's a worthy companion to Ed Wood's flicks or anything you might see on MST3K.<br /><br />This very low-budget production was inspired by a real life event in rural Polk County, Georgia. Some long-forgotten state legislator thought it was intriguing enough to have a movie made about it (it wasn't). So he got some minimal financing and hired a cast and crew which apparently was mostly amateurs and made this great embarrassment of an action film. It may be cruel to make fun of such obviously handicapped folks (in terms of their moviemaking talents) but it's impossible not to laugh at the sheer ineptitude of this effort. Every element of this movie is hilariously bad- the acting, the screenwriting, the "production design" and "special effects"- even the film's title theme song will have you in stitches.<br /><br />I realize that no one will hardly ever have a chance to see this movie. It came and went with barely a trace, probably even in Polk County. I saw it myself on a brief run as the opener at a local drive-in. Incredibly, though, I saw it one night on television, on some kind of syndicated "action theatre" network. It was shown under a different name, which I can't recall. But there's no doubt you'd know it if you saw it.
