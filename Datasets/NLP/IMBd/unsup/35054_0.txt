The plot ...??? what plot? Discussing it after its screening last night, my friends and I decided that there was no plot, just some weak sub-plots. They are all over the shop. The race issue is brushed upon but it is not dealt with in any depth. As is said above, I don't mind a film about nothing if at least it is entertaining, but unfortunately this one fails at that too. There seems to just be little incidents with random dialogue in between. It just isn't consistent. Many things are hinted at but most are not fully expressed. I didn't care about what happened to the characters, there was never enough detail for any of them. In the end I felt I'd have enjoyed watching a party I'd filmed on my phone instead. Come on Gael, we know you can do better than that! :)
