Out of all, the story was somewhat alright, what I did not like was the acting, nor most of the lines. The acting in my opinion lacked feeling and character. Most of the events in the film could be expected. The lines were dumb especially when Ociee Nash met the president and fell down when nobody moved out of her way, then saying a little later to the president her opinion of "hurrying slowly" which the president and everybody there found to be a great idea. The only part I liked was when Ociee Nash did something heroic and "unladylike" which also pleased people later in the film. The film itself was kind of interesting though.
