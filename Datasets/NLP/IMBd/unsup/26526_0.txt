***Possible Spoiler Attached*** * * *<br /><br />At first glance this film is just another sci-fi flick with a mediocre plot and sometimes dull dramatics. The pundits have been less than generous with their praise, of a movie that fails to deliver what the trailers promise. Fortunately it has a few redeeming features.<br /><br />The premise of a society with boundaries on conception is not a new one, infact at the time when this film was released, China was very much in the news for limiting couples to one child only. But while trying to deal with a very real scenario, albeit in the 'global' future, the film crew and management had their own brush with Australian authorities regarding the use of 'local' talent preferentially on the Aussie set. Despite the associated delays and bad press, the film was completed, much to the delight of sci-fi aficionados.<br /><br />Christophe Lambert portrays an ex-marine John Brennick who's wife Karen (played ably by Loryn Locklin) is expecting her second child. Their first child died and during an attempt to cross the border into Mexico, the land of the free(sic), they are taken prisoner. Transported to an underground prison, they fight technology, hard labour (no pun intended) and a prison warden called Poe (believably evil and portrayed by Kurtwood Smith). It would seem that Poe has been reading too many of his namesake's books, leading to a rather deviant bent, a lust for married women and psychedelic dreams, plus (due to genetic enhancement) the inability to hold his drink.<br /><br />Once Brennick decides he's had enough, he attempts a breakout, with his cell-mates in tow. One by one they are eliminated by various cyborgs, until there is just the Brennicks and Nino (Clifton Gonzalez Gonzalez) heading for the border in the truck that brought them all to the prison. The ending is a little bland, with one version showing the Brennicks and baby, while the other shows Nino being terminated by the truck. Does this all sound a little implausible? Tough....it's sci-fi.... what else do you expect?<br /><br />Actually, once you get past the bad acting by some of the Aussies and some very plastic props, the film isn't that bad. It deals with complex social issues; those of overpopulation (which generally means first world values foisted on third world countries), incarceration in prisons run by private companies (a concept currently being adopted world-wide), and the love of a man for his wife and child.<br /><br />Christophe and Kurtwood are both capable of creating stylised characters, something they succeed in doing (shame that Kurtwood later lost the plot in That 70's Show). If you are into sci-fi, future-world or true kick-arse action, then watch it.
