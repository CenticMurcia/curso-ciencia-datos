Saw Out On a Limb yesterday on a non-sell through DVD copy and thoroughly enjoyed it. There are not enough strong British comedy films getting through, but this one really deserves a look.Low budget does not have to mean low rent and this film shows that, stylish and confident, making good use of clearly small funding. Also there is often a danger in self referential stories, (the industry does the industry) but Out On A Limb manages to make its take on the entertainment industry really work. Knowing how hard it is to get a film off the ground then even harder to get it out to an audience, I find it ever more frustrating that our choices are limited by distribution cartels. Good British movies like this need a better chance
