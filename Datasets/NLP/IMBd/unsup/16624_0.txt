OK, so you watch this movie which was made in 2002 and think the comments by some here are correct. Specifically I mean that this injustice is Bush's fault.<br /><br />Well sorry it shouldn't be a political issue, but in fact it is. These Drug War laws were initiated by a Democratic Congress, not actually Republican.<br /><br />Yes I'm a Democrat by need to set the record straight.<br /><br />OK so Susan Walker, who basically was tried, convicted and sentenced to 20 years just because her boyfriend was dealing drugs. This type of sentencing was very regular during the 1990s. Both Bush Sr. and Clinton didn't do to much about. Under Bush some 23 wives received the same sentence and under Clinton the # is over 120. Mr. Clinton also did nothing.<br /><br />In 2000, George W. Bush actually had all these cases reviewed and 95 of these cases were over turned.<br /><br />This story takes you through one of the cases, but is actually true events from 3 different women. Susan obviously is the focus of this film but the personality is from a GA women (Daniel in the film) who also was released. Her character is played by Rachel McAdams. The 3rd women, whose name was never released is still in jail.<br /><br />Its a wonderfully intense film to watch. For a TV production they did a great job with the time-line. Again understand the events are not all that of Susan Walker.<br /><br />For more information you can find the full Susan Walker story on-line.<br /><br />Enjoy this film.
