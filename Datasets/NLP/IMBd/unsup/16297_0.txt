Like so many movies I see this one just popped up on one of the many cable movie channels in which I subscribe. And in a way that is a very good way to watch a movie. So I wasn't prepared for this one. All I can say is that it grabbed me in a way very few movies do. Definitely one of the best of the Holocaust movies of all time. <br /><br />Trying to describe this movie would be like trying to describe a sunset to a blind person. It is simply an experience that will touch you deeply. It touches the very core of our human existence in a brutal and tragic way. It touches emotions and feelings in us that very few movies ever do. So it is a must see movie for those who simply love this art form of telling a story. <br /><br />My only other comment is that the production value is top-notch Â… great acting all around. And the movie set here is very convincing. This is simply an excellent example of how this art form can touch our human souls.
