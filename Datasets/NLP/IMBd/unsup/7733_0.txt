The Wraith is one of the few movies growing up in the Eighties that l found truly captivating from numerous reasons.Most enduring as a young male at the time of its release were the unique cars,race sequences and a mysterious plot.<br /><br />In my opinion the key elements which make it in every part a "sci fi classic" is it still remains the one movie l can continually watch over and over again.If you allow yourself not to scrutinize certain predictable outcomes and appreciate the legacy of what essential was a low budget film,it has in my opinion more than delivered a satisfactory movie.<br /><br />The movie coupled with the fantastic soundtrack,meant that in years gone by it was always first amongst the movies on video night.Two movies which l feel a similar and most definitely be appreciated by fans of The Wraith, are two Australian films made slightly prior to The Wraith.The obvious movie being Mad Max,however the second less obvious is the movie "Running on Empty",similar plots lines,identifiable characters and outback,desert type settings are all evident.<br /><br />In summary a truly enjoyable movie,where you strap yourself along for the ride.Win the race,Win the Girls heart and get the second chance everyone so desperately wishes for.
