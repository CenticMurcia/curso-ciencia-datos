A nice film to look at but otherwise a real piece of trash which I avoided up till now. The characters all seem to be from different cultures & from different eras which really is jarring, particularly in the 1960s - 1970s laid-back style of Carradine. The Stein/Toklas salon is a one-dimensional embarrassment. The Hemingway portrayal is a disaster on every level. The principals on this film must have really hated him. Only John Lone & Linda Fiorentino give the film any tension or dimension. Even Genevieve Bujold, an otherwise fascinating actress, is totally wasted in this pathetically boorish Rudolph effort.
