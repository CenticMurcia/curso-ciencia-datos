Tremors 3: Back to Perfection starts in El Chaco in Argentina where Graboid expert & war nut Burt Gummer (Michal Gross) has been hired to wipe out an infestation of Shriekers. Upon his return to to Perfection Valley in Nevada where he lives Burt finds things have changed, Jack Sawyer (Shawn Christian) is running Graboid tours & a greedy property developer is trying to buy all the land in Perfection to build ranches. Then suddenly a new wave of Graboids appear, Burt warns the town & convinces them to help him kill them before they turn into Shriekers. However Federal Agents step in & forbid the killing of any Graboids due to the endangered species act which gives them the opportunity to become Shriekers & then after that stage they transform into yet another different type of creature which Burt has to deal with...<br /><br />Directed by Brent Maddock this was the second sequel to the excellent & likable 90's monster flick Tremors (1990) which is generally considered a bit of a classic, the sequels however thus far are a long way from classic status & while Tremors II: Aftershocks (1996) was decent enough Tremors 3: Back to Perfection continues the downward spiral of diminishing returns. The script follows Tremors II: Aftershocks quite closely with the initial Graboid reappearance & then about half way through just as in Tremors II: Aftershocks a new different type of creature is revealed & I don't quite know what to make of them to be honest. They look silly for a start & their ability to light their own farts to take off & fly is even more ridiculous in practice than in theory, the sight of them launching themselves off the ground using lighted farts is just as lowbrow & juvenile as it comes. I am not sure it if was done for comic effect or not but that's the impression that comes across & even calling them Ass Blasters says a lot about the mentality of the script & concept. As with Tremors II: Aftershocks things get out of hand & a bunch of survivors have to fight for their lives against the odds, you know the score. The chemistry between Kevin Bacon & Fred Ward was vital to the success of the original & while Ward came back for Tremors II: Aftershocks even he is missing form this & it's up to minor character Burt Gummer to step up to the plate & carry the film, to be fair he is quite amusing at times & at least his sidekick Jack Sawyer is quite likable & not some silly comic relief buffoon. There's nothing here we haven't seen before, the Shriekers are not seen at all apart from the opening sequence & at almost 100 minutes long it does drag at times & the constant silly humour & one liners does get tiresome & repetitive quite quickly.<br /><br />The lessening of the budget means that Tremors 3: Back to Prediction uses footage from the original Tremors & the CGI computer work isn't the worst around but it does look a bit shoddy at times especially when the main monster looks so silly. Apparently this was made as a way to sell the subsequent Tremors (2003) TV series which ran for thirteen episodes. A few character's from the original Tremors return here for a bit of novelty value, Nancy, Miguel & Melvin all reprise their roles. With the PG rating don't expect any gore & there's a low body count too.<br /><br />The production values are alright & it's well made, imagine a polished Sci-Fi Channel 'Creature Feature' & your not far off. The acting is OK, Michael Gross is amusing & has his character nailed down while the minor character's are all ably played.<br /><br />Tremors 3: Back to Perfection is alright for what it is, it's another creature feature with an especially silly creature, there are a few trademark Tremors moments & character's but you can see the series is getting a little bit tired. Followed by the TV series & Tremors 4: The Legend Begins (2004) while Tremors V: The Thunder from Down Under (2010) is listed as in production.
