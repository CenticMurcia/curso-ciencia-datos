Pilot feels huge in every respect, from the big stars pulled in for small cameos to the massive sets that look like CGI, but are 100% real. Daniel Sackheim's direction is so beautiful and convincing that you could be forgiven for thinking it's Rob Bowman behind the camera and Chris Carter produces a script so tight and pacey that there isn't a single word, gesture or glance wasted. Scott Bairstow and D.B. Sweeney are electric together and Terry O'Quinn radiates the kind of raw power that no drama school can teach, it's there or it isn't. Sarah-Jane Redmond has so much charisma she threatens to reduce your television to ash every time the camera picks her up and Samantha Mathis gives a remarkable girl-next-door performance as Sophie Green. A powerful and romantic start to a powerful and romantic series.
