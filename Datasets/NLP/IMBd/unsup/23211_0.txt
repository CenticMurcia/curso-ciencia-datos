Being a big fan of the original Ski School film I was very disappointed in this follow up. Many of the key elements that made the orginal successful are missing in this. These include the wonderfull supporting cast of section 8 that dwelled at the resort, particularly Ed and Fitz, that Dave led. This has therefore resulted in a lack of on-screen chemistry with the new line up and as such the laughs have been very infrequent. In addition Dave is matched with a poor "baddie" and again adds to the downbeat theme of the film.<br /><br />If you want a really good laugh then watch the original Ski School.
