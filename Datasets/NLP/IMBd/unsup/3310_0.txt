I just return from watching this movie at SXSW Festival here in Austin and I just gotta say that this is a perfect example of what you can accomplish just by having a good idea and lots of creativity to take it to the next level.<br /><br />Besides from being filmed entirely in digital video, the camera work (no steady-cam, just primitive hand-held) allows you to experience the whole movie in a way that you almost feel part of it. It's like you're the one controlling the main character.<br /><br />To summarize the story, I can tell you that Adam (who lives in San Diego) is not having the best time of his life. His girlfriend is breaking up with him while his father dies back home in Philippines. So he go back there but realizes that the situation has been terribly complicated. His mother and sister has been kidnapped so now, Adam is forced to face the reality that he choose to forget: the hard reality of his poverty stricken nation.<br /><br />Will he risk everything to save the lives of his remaining family? For every fellow aspiring filmmaker, this is the kind of movie that should inspire you to pursue your dream. If you don't find it that great at all, at least you'll feel inspire to go out and start shooting.
