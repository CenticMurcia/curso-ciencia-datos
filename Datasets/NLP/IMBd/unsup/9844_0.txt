Students at a Canadian college campus are beginning to disappear, only to be found dead, their bodies frozen stiff from the inside. Luke & Roger, two students at the campus, come across two new female students. But Luke discovers that they are in fact aliens who have arrived in order to breed so that they can save their race from extinction.<br /><br />You can imagine what the executives at the Sci-Fi channel were thinking when the pitch for this film was given. "Hey, let's make a teenage version of SPECIES, set it in a college & throw in some American PIE." And sure enough, they delivered it.<br /><br />"Decoys" is exactly what you would think it is; a cross between SPECIES & American PIE, only it takes the main plot points of both films; alien chicks & horny students; & throws them in a blender. The film's intentions are clear from the outset  the way the camera lingers on female college students as it passes them, shows that the film is purely for adolescent males who want to see sex, booze & cheap CGI effects.<br /><br />That said, the film does have a number of glaring problems. The acting is not too bad, with Richard Burgi & Nicole Eggert playing their part as the two cops better than the actors playing the co-eds. The plot has some massive plot holes  why did the aliens pick that particular college to mate with? Also there's the fact that the director / screenwriter does not know who the real villains are (the aliens are shown as evil at first, but later come across as being sympathetic). The makeup effects used to portray the frozen victims are quite good but the CGI aliens are very cheesy.
