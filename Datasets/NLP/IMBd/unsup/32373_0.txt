this show is absolutely dreadful, although Brooke burns is a nice looking lady, she does not have what it takes to present this show. it amazes me how stupid people can actually get. each test is either impossible or really easy, which makes it really stupid to watch. the game doesn't work at all. each contestant has to vote the person who they think is least likely to complete the test. when this is done, a contestant is asked why they choose the person. this is a very unfair process since this person will always get out, if the contestant succeeds. another stupid thing about the show is that not everyone has to do as much, a person can win the whole thing without having to say a word. i conclusion, this is a show that deserves to be cancelled.
