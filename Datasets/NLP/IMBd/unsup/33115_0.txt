I expected so much more from Mick Malloy and Glen Robbins. This movie was definitely a 'cringer'. The plot was thin, the humor was weak, immature and unchecked - like little boys laughing at their own jokes. As a woman I was offended, not so much by the lyrics themselves, but by the concept that women in general would be entertained by such rubbish. On the more positive side, I felt that 1980's style film clips were effective and realistic. I quite enjoyed the contemporary BoyTown film clips and would have appreciated lyrics with intelligent humor. The acting was good, filming effective. I would definitely not put this in the same class as The Dish, The Castle or Crackerjack.
