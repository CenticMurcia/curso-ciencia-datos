In viewing TBS's newest attempt at infusing their comedic stature into an original series, "10 Items or Less" shows that perhaps Mr. Turner should stick with acquiring sitcoms and cartoons as the foundation for the network's motto of being 'Very Funny'. That is if the sting of "Daisy Does America" hasn't worn off....<br /><br />"10 Items or Less" establishes all the same clich√©s of being a grocery clerk that any common customer could see while wrangling this menagerie of failed auditions for Mad TV under the frayed control of manager Leslie, who assumes ownership of the family store after his father dies in a supposedly comedic fashion (a heart attack that knocks over a display stand, with the nearby employee fixing the stand first before helping the fallen owner). While actually showing this act of apathetic drudgery might've seemed more funny, instead the story is relayed by Leslie himself with less than dramatic results.<br /><br />This is just one of the many examples of failed attempts at achieving a punchline, and instead resorting to a fast quip... just not fast enough. What remains is an almost painful experience for every actor present, shown in their faces in almost every scene yet simultaneously used as "the pain" of working in a grocery store to give them character. Irony.<br /><br />As with any new show, 5 episodes have already been printed. Hopefully "10 Items or Less" will remain 10 episodes or less....
