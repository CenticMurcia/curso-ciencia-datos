I just finished watching this movie and immediately went online to see just how terrible the reviews were only to see it has a 97% on rotten tomatoes upwards of 7 out of 10 on IMDb. Shocked by this I filled out the required information just to write this one review. This film struck me as borderline unwatchable. The child acting is on par The Phantom Menace. The little girl is cute, but good lord it was just embarrassing to watch. I kept telling myself it had to be intended as a children's movie and I was being unfair to assess it as harshly as I was until the movie had been playing for about an hour and NOTHING HAD HAPPENED! The only event that had occurred, excluding the painfully boring exposition, was the little girl chasing the naked kid for 40 seconds or so only to lose him in his little boat. I kept holding on hoping something, anything, would happen, but it never really did. This is literally how the movie ends: The little girl's family , for no reason, starts believing her about the little boy so they go out in the storm to find him. They walk outside their newly repaired house and the girl yells "Look!" We then see the kid on the shore and when he sees his sister he tries to flee, perhaps horrified at his sister's acting ability. When he tries to get in his little boat some seals, bear with me, come onto the shore. One seal chases him away from his boat and the others push the boat into the water. The family captures him and that's the happy ending? Does that not seem, at best, extremely dumb to anyone else? I can maybe buy someone liking the cultural overtones of the movie or even the occasional whimsy, but who in their right mind could truly say that they were ENTERTAINED by this film? Maybe this movie just went over my head, but in order for me to enjoy a movie i would need a few events to occur and maybe a plot or something.
