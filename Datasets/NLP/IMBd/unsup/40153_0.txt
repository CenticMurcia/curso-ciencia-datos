Kraken is an interesting film about a giant squid that links the monster's murderous rampage to a Greek myth. This provides for a rather solid story/background, despite the common problems the movie shares with other made-for-TV flicks. I had three main problems with the movie. First was how Ray seemed too easily accepted as part of Nicole's crew. Second was the pig-like squealing of the squid. The last point has to do with the end and might ruin the story; but Ray's shooting is what's in question. The CGI of the squid alone was pretty good, except for some scenes. Mix the squid with live-action and it gets fairly cheesy, but it's not bad for made-for-TV. All-in-all, an okay movie if the premise interests you.
