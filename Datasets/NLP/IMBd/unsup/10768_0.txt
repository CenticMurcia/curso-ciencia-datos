Kay The Master of Disguise was funny the first time I saw it because I can take kiddish humor. The second time I saw it, it went into so-so territory. Third time, there was only one part that was funny (my name is gammy, gammy numb-numbs)that lasts about 50 seconds which isn't worth the ordeal it puts us through.<br /><br />The plot revolves around Pistachio, a thirty year old waiter who puts his underwear on his head and puts on a shaving cream beard, gets a cane and thinks hes a Shepperd. If that not a sign of a bad movie I don't know what is. Anyway his father is kidnapped and his grandfather enters in Exorcist fashion and tell him that he is in a family of people who can change their personalities to fight crime and Pistachio must find his inner master of disguise to save his parents.<br /><br />I wonder if this looked good on paper because that cherry pie man was a little childish even for this movie, not to mention stupid. I have friends who are my age and love this movie and I can't believe it because it's so stupid but they adore it and think I'm crazy for not liking it. But you no everyone is entitled to their opinion.<br /><br />Bottom line: Sucks except for a drag part that is pretty funny. I still can't believe i spent 10 bucks to buy this crap. And on a brighter note this movie single handedly ruin Dana Carveys career and my one friend who likes this and Wayne's World can't believed that happened.<br /><br />Grade: */****
