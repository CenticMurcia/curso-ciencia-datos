Spoilers* Terrible terrible! Horrible piece of Crap! (And I'm not a by any means a picky guy, there are only a handful of movies i don't like, or don't appreciate in some way). Not only is the thing poorly written, it is just a bad idea! Its supposed to take a real spin on the whole superhero concept, but fails miserably. It has some whiny junkie capturing Batman then proceeding to beat him, inject him with drugs, and rape him. Then the guy who captures batman reveals that the Bat sent him to prison wrongfully cause his car broke down in front of some drug bust. Junkie shoots himself, Batman breaks and kills himself by intentionally O.D. ing on heroine. Forget all that just take into account that batman is stun gunned in the groin by the junkie and thats how he's captured. Interesting that batman is stunned through a rubber suit huh? Considering electricity runs through rubber so well. Further batman plays with the guy by beating him up, oops cause thats how batman always operated, by feeding his ego and beating up some worthless junkie while the Joker is on the loose. Terrible waste of time, and a crappy waste of money for the writer director that i wont even bother learning the name of. For great comic shorts particularly pertaining to Batman. Check out Batman:Dead End, or Grayson. Any fan, or someone with sense at all will avoid this trash P.S. Don';t let the open minded bull-crap fool you. This movie was just a bad idea. Nothing open-minded about it, It only guilts people into saying its good so that they feel smart of have an open mind, at least thats the only reason i can think of for someone to like this crap.
