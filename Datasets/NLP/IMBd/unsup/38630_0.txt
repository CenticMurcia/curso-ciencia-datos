My one line summary pretty much said it all for this movie. It is a pretty typical horror anthology, where college students sit around in their a**hole professor's house and tell "the scariest story they know". All of the stories were original (well, I've heard them as urban legends before, but I never saw them done in a movie before) but this doesn't mean they are enjoyable. In fact, after about 5 minutes into each of them you just want them to end and hope the next one is better.<br /><br />The only really worthwhile things in the film are the special effects, including a creepy skeleton and a talking severed head, and the ending was, I have to admit, really rewarding, like something in a TWILIGHT ZONE episode. So if you find yourself watching this for whatever reason, just keep telling yourself to stick around, because the ending really pays off.
