I can't help but wonder if everyone connected with this 1993 film isn't trying to forget they were ever involved with this mess.<br /><br />It's awhile before we even know that Mexico is the foreign country where the characters are.<br /><br />It starts out somewhat promising with an young American man, Alex Walker (Kevin Anderson)coming into a Mexican bar where he encounters an overly friendly drunk named Felix Crawley (Robert Harper), also an American.<br /><br />Like most of this film's characters, we never really know what motivates Felix to chatting up Alex and even setting him up with a woman in the bar, that I assume was a hooker.<br /><br />Alex goes off with the hooker, but a weird circumstance in her room, which is never explained and which made no sense, causes him to change his mind and he decides to leave. That's when Alex discovers his wallet is missing and realizes Felix is undoubtedly the guilty party.<br /><br />Alex, whom we later learn is a sailor who jumped ship, because of some trouble he is already in back in the states, hunts up Felix.<br /><br />Felix is not in a good way, having already ran into someone who decided to kill him.<br /><br />Alex flees. The police think Alex has murdered Felix. In avoiding the police, Alex literally falls inside the car of what turns out to be an American couple - Phillip and Missy Mills. Philip played by John Lithgow is Missy's somewhat older husband. Shortly after this the film bogs down and begins to drag.<br /><br />I don't know if Rosanna Arquette has any acting range or not, since I've never seen her play anything but slightly nutty, silly sluts - which is what she's stuck with again in this film.<br /><br />Despite the fact that it becomes evident very early on, that Missy is quite attracted to Alex, and that he likewise is attracted to her - Phillip never tells Alex to get lost. Instead, Alex keeps traveling with them - car, bus - whatever the transportation mode might be. In fact, Phillip even pays Alex's way some of the time. Phillip also pushes Missy and Alex together and then acts as if he is jealous when they act on it.<br /><br />Phillip's behavior never makes any real sense. He declares that he wants to keep Missy, although he complains about her and insults her quite a lot, but he never dumps Alex - that's what made zero sense.<br /><br />There's dialog as this threesome travels along, but they never really say anything. Phillip and Missy are constantly contradicting themselves, they're hot and cold in their relationship with each other and in their relationship with Alex.<br /><br />The ending is not particularly unexpected.<br /><br />2 stars for this lack luster offering.
