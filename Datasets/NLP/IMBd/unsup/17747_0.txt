Featuring a quite talented cast, this entertains and keeps you interested throughout. The plot is fairly easy to follow. The acting is good for all the parts(in spite of Kingsley's inexplicable and seemingly random occasional change of accent) and the characters are good(Aykroyd amuses with his portrayal of a conspiracy nut, though he's never over the top). The main characters make an effective team, and each member contributes, just about equally, too. The editing and cinematography don't go anywhere you don't expect them to, but they don't really need to. The comedy is never forced, just clever and well-delivered. The pacing is great, the movie neither stands still nor rushes through. It's a fun ride through the entire thing, not to be taken too seriously(and it never claims to be more than that). Yes, the political agenda is impossible to miss(and the very end is almost insulting), but that is not surprising, given Redford's involvement. The film works well as a light spy film(without becoming farcical), delivering, as the title suggests, sneaking, as well as conspiracies. As my fianc√©e pointed out while we watched it, fans of J.J. Abrams' hit series Alias will appreciate the elaborate planning and execution of the "sneaks"(though it is not as stylized), and there is some gadgetry. Enjoyable from start to finish. I recommend this to any fan of spy flicks(though I'm not sure people expecting action or mystery in this will find themselves satisfied... and as a thriller, it's light at best). 7/10
