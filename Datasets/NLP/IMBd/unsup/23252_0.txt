I hadn't seen Robert Duvall in anything worthwhile for some time and needed to see him ply his trade. The fact that he wrote and directed this was a bonus for me remembering The Apostle as a solid performance for him under his own gaze and like a singer/songwriter, he knows how to say his own words. This, even if a somewhat gentler flow (the violence notwithstanding), was no different. Considering the amount of land fill being created as entertainment around the world if Robert Duvall made one of these a year, which isn't likely, I'd order the tickets in advance. If you like Robert in anything you'll love him in this.
