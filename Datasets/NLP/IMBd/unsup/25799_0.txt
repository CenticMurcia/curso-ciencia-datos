I can tell you nothing about Miracle Mile. Except that it is a love story set against a tragic background, and that it is a beautiful piece of filmmaking showing the best work of several involved. This movie was destroyed by its own practical nature--which renders it unpromotable--but it exists somewhere. Find it.
