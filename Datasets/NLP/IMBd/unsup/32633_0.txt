I went to Adam Resurrected expecting a holocaust movie, but what I got was a sick, weird, perverted film. This film had almost nothing to do with the holocaust. It followed a circus clown who, during the holocaust, was forced to act like a dog to avoid going to the camps. While this showed how brutal Nazis could be, I'm pretty sure this didn't even happen to ANYONE during the holocaust. This film is not art. Some have been saying the dog was "symbolism", but I don't care. This film was a piece of crap. Between his line (while having doggy style sex with his nurse...) "less like a schnauzer more like a wolf" and his line to the OTHER boy who thinks he's a dog (what are the chances of this?) "it's you and me against the world,", this dog themed holocaust movie was horrible. Should Jeff Goldblum get an Oscar? No. Unless they create a new category for "best human portraying a dog".
