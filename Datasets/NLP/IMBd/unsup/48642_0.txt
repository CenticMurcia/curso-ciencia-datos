This movie is terrible. One of the most important qualities that makes a movie good or not is whether the story, characters and plots are believable and realistic based upon what we know of the story.<br /><br />Christian Bale and Russell Crowe are two phenomenal actors and I'm surprised they signed on for such a pathetic script.<br /><br />How many times did Russell Crowe almost get away? They just kept giving him chance after chance after chance. These guys were not idiots. He was cold blooded killer. The way to transport him is to tie him up, gag him, and lead his horse for him. Not give him every chance to escape that they could.<br /><br />And CB sitting RC at his dinner table to eat dinner with him family!!! C'mon, how cheesy is that. The guy can't be trusted and he knows it. Has he got rocks in his head. Sit him in a corner or in another room, with a gun to his head and then give him food.<br /><br />All throughout the movie they treat him like he's their buddy, not their prisoner. It's poorly done. Letting him sit in the window of the hotel in Yuma and talk to his gang! That's ridiculous! This movie is poorly, poorly done and I was very disappointed in paying money to see it.
