Started out to seem like one of those exploitation fliks lots of naked ladies, dodgy doctors, even dodgier prison warders, yes this is what happens in the first half hour or so, but actually it turns out to have a fairly good ,if not basic, story line. No surprises,obvious out-come, but ok acting bearing in mind it must have been made for about Â£250. Goes on to have a moral deciding theme, do you go by the rules or do you break them? Give this film a go, if you are male you will probably love it, if you are female....I'm not so sure.
