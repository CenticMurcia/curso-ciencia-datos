i would have given this "0" stars if i had been given the option here. this was absolutely terrible. virtually everything was different and not one character looked or acted the way they should have. dimitri is Greek but has a British accent, lennie is initially portrayed as telling off colour type bad jokes - which is totally inaccurate, olympia was short/small/brunette and small chested. if you know this character at all you will know that her looks (blonde/voluptous/and pretty) had a lot to do with how she floated through life from man to man. one of my favourite parts was lucky & olympia in the south of France, this several week jaunt took up less than 3 minutes on the screen. warris charters does not exist and most confusingly of all lucky and dario do not hate each other later in life when they should. if you are a fan of the books you will probably hate this miniseries as much as i did! i hope none of this info is considered a spoiler but i was trying to illustrate just how far off it was. hope it helps!
