<br /><br />Yes, I am one of those users who see a bad film and go out and complain about it, never saying GOOD things about the films we LIKE... so I decided to rectify.<br /><br />The Wizard of Speed and Time is a great movie. It puts a big, fat Libertarian smile on this Libertarian face of mine. It makes me want to go out and be a filmmaker. It makes me want to go out and land a helicopter on "That Big Green Plastic Rock".<br /><br />It makes me want to follow my dreams and follow my heart., (thanks to a good amount of brainwashing, courtesy of the green man himself, the wonderful Mike Jittlov)<br /><br />So see the movie, "You'll see dancing, romancing, financing, fencing, crowd scenes.. chase scenes... this is the motion picture with EVERYTHING.... it's even got the kitchen sink! It's the kind of movie YOU would make, if you didn't have anything better to do!"<br /><br />**grin** Thanks
