A Navy pilot, Tuck Pendelton, (Dennis Quaid) has been chosen for a secret experiment to operate a pod-like craft that is miniturized smaller than a grain of salt to be injected into a laboratory rabbit. However, the experiment goes haywire, and a bad batch of dudes want to take over the Miniturization all together. After stealing a microchip that is required for the process, one of the scientists injects the pod into the hypochondriac Safeway employee, Jack Putter. (Martin Short)<br /><br />Unfortunately, the one chip they've taken is useless without the other, which is inside the pod--which is inside Jack Putter!<br /><br />Now Pendelton, his beautiful ex-girlfriend, Lydia, (Meg Ryan) and Putter, have to work together to get the other chip back, and re-enlarge the pod before Tuck runs out of oxygen.<br /><br />This is one of my absolute favorite movies!<br /><br />I love all of the comedy that fits perfectly with the plot, the stunning special effects of all the close-up views of the human body, and romantic twists that suits the movie as well.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film for science-fiction, comedy, action, and romance movie fans....So this movie will most likely suit anyone!<br /><br />If you haven't seen this, it's a MUST to rent or buy. Very exciting, delighting, and fun!<br /><br />You wont regret watching it! :)
