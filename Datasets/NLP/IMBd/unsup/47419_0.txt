There are two things going for this movie and two things against this movie - Paul Newman and William Holden and Paul Newman and William Holden. They make one hesitate to walk out on this atrocious Irwin Allen tripe. However, their inexcusable presence - they didn't need the money that bad, did they? - is constantly distracting, constantly outraging you at the waste of talent. There are also the usual "all star cast" regulars, like Ernie Borgnine and Red Buttons, who only help make this a disaster film clich√©, as well as a disaster film disaster. There's even a featured player whose day job has to be Shelley "Poseidon Adventure" Winters' stand-in.<br /><br />Where to begin? Inane plot. "The Day the World Ended" and "Earth's Final Fury" are alternate titles, and both are fraudulent, since the story is about a volcanic island which threatens to overwhelm a Fantasy Island resort, not Planet Earth. Special effects? Yes, they are special: they are special as the cheapest special effects ever seen in a disaster film since "Plan 9 From Outer Space". Crappy sound, footage expended on stupid reaction shots . . .<br /><br />Arrrrrgh! Why am I wasting time reviewing this garbage??? Don't make the same mistake by watching it. It might be suitable for a Saturday night beer and reefer silly party, but other than that, don't you dare!
