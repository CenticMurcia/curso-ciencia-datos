Little Britain is perhaps the biggest British comedy of the past five years, and rightfully so. The hilarious writing, tremendous variety of characters, talented actors and memorable catchphrases elevate this from a fun night in to a must see comedy show. Little Britain Series 1 was great, Series 2 was also great, but the usual comedy formula that third series screw the whole thing up (as it did to "The Fast Show") works on Little Britain, and we were let down by a rather disappointing Series 3 last year. The peeing lady (Mrs Emery) was about as welcome to the show as an assassin, and about as effective as a catflap in an elephant house. Neighbourhood Watch Leader Sid Pegg was just forgettable, and Desiree DeVere's (Bubbles' new rival) fat suit looked generally fake. However, there were some hilarious sketches, and Desiree was probably the best new character of Series 3. However, the third series will never be as loved by all as either of the others, but was better than The Fast Show's Series 3 by a long shot.<br /><br />On the whole, Little Britain is a great comedy, and should be seen by all as a taste of how comedy should be. No series or even episode is completely bad, and beats Catherine Tate hands down. A must see! 10/10
