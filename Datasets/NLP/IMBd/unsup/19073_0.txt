From the get-go, this film winds the viewer up in a double-helix plot line that takes no prisoners and leaves the faint-witted and slow-to-snap behind. This director understands layering -- a multiple-level approach to scene-building that juxtaposes high tech gadgetry like mind-probes and radioactive oxygen memory tracers and erasers with the gritty underbelly of Parisian catacombs. The seemingly innocuous beginning -- a woman with neurological problems - quickly develops triple layers of menace as her visions begin to intertwine with the horrible series of mutilation murders. The pace starts fast, stays that way, and this director is not afraid to give us a taste of anti-climax before sending us over the edge to the finale. A very slick, visually-stimulating thriller with a satisfying conclusion.
