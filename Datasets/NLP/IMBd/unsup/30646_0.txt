i paid 4.95 to rent this movie. after the first five minutes i considered throwing it into the fire and paying the fine just so nobody else would ever have to go through what i just did.<br /><br />for a start, it's meant to feature teenagers, not a bunch of plain, emotionless mid-twenties huffing and puffing their way past some trees. The camera work is not impressive. the scenery is dull.<br /><br />hide and seek. i'm sorry but tell me who among you of this age has a bunch of friends who all go out and play hide and seek together? just coz they run fast doesn't mean it's a hardcore game. it's hide and seek. it's the hardcore version of peek-a-boo. it doesn't get any higher than that.<br /><br />i did watch this to the end, while i was watching another movie at the same time on my laptop. i looked up every time somebody spoke. which was what like about three times. other times i accidentally looked up i saw running.<br /><br />I could write a lot more on how unbelievably horrible this 'movie' was. but i won't. some people like to watch running. if you enjoy ugly people, running, and trees, then you've found your cult classic. I will say though, movies like these are terribly necessary because without them we'd never appreciate good films.<br /><br />My advice: get every single copy you see, snap the disc in half then put it in a box. then put that box inside another box. then post it to yourself. and when it arrives, smash it with a hammer.
