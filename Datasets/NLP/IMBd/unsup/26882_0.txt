Wait a second. Who is it that likes this movie? I rented it for a movie night with friends because I was intrigued by the teens shooting lazers out of their eyes in the picture. I also liked the description of the zitheads terrorizing the area. There were no lazer beams anywhere. And the teens didn't terrorize anyone, they more or less bumbled around like they were lost with no plan. The acting was horrific and I have seen second grade productions that had better acting in them. The plot was weird and hard to follow because it didn't make coherent sense. Characters were not developed, there were only 7 or so zitheads when it said that they turn many into zitheads (7 is not many. An entire high school would have been many) Oh, and they didn't even try to make-up over their skull caps, so it was ridiculously obvious that it was fake. In general, the movie was lame. So, save your money and time and get a decent movie.
