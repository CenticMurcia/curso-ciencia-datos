An outrageously funny film that captured the spirit of the times with a musical score to match. An all star cast with a sense of humor about their own stardom. I'm guessing that this film is so hard to find anywhere because some of the stars that appeared in it lost their sense of humor as they got older. Nothing is sacred, except Marlon's bird.
