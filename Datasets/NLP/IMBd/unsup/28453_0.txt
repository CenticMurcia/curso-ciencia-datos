The Asylum has released yet another winner, and by winner I mean a piece of crap that should have never seen the light of day unless it were featured on an episode of Mystery Science Theatre 3,000. This movie was so painful that I had to watch it in four separate sittings and still suffered all the way through it. Don't see it.<br /><br />The poorly placed music in this film alone was enough to completely ruin it but horrible acting, a terrible storyline and no scares all had pivotal roles as well. The only things about this movie that make me not give it a 1 are the okay effects and the bad guy looks decent, but they did show him way too much. I really wish The Asylum would stop making movies.<br /><br />If you like well done, well written horror film, resist with every inch of your being. You'll be thankful that you did.
