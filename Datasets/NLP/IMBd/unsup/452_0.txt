"Swimmers" is an endearing movie. You can sympathize with the characters and understand their pain. I thought that it would be a "regional" movie but it really speaks to people everywhere. The lighting and sound are amazing. I didn't want the movie to end...I wanted to follow the family and their story. Even the dad who definitely had his faults, was a person you could relate to. I hope that this movie goes worldwide as everyone should see it and enjoy it! Doug has written a powerful story about love and anguish in a family and how they deal with their emotions. I'd like to see a sequel involving the "troubled" teen.
