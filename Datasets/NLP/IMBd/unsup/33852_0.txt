This film was soooo painful to watch that I almost had to smash the T.V. and flush the pieces down the toilet. I have been a horror fan all my life and consider myself very open-minded to student film projects, B-Films, etc. However, this piece of crap still sits steaming away in the *beep* pile (like crap does). What were they thinking? Still photos used as cut-away shots....horrible. An abandoned house with a porch light lit(very realistic). Take my advice...DO Not rent this film. After the first few minutes you will want to slash your own throat. I've seen wedding videos scarier than this. Please DO NOT contribute to the fattening of these people's wallets...please do not rent "Haunted House".
