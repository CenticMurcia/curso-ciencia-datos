This is a low budget English film, it was made for Â£900,000 and yes it does show. But I for one am sick of gloss and special effects and actors who command nine-digit fees. If you want to see a decent independent English film with a mature sense of humour then this is for you. It is a well written, darkly comic take on the entertainment industry. Worth going to see for the opening montage alone which sequences the main character, a celebrity chef's, career through the decades. Very, very funny. If you liked lost in translation, heathers, or anything by the coen brothers, then maybe you'll like this too. One caution though - see the film on a full stomach cause it will make you hungry.
