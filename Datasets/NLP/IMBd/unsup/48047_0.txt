I guess I should not be voting because I haven't seen the whole movie. But thats just what made me vote. I just couldn't watch it. I always watch the whole movie if I start watching one and I think I have only once before had to stop.<br /><br />This wouldn't be so bad alone. It's just a really bad movie and I figured it out and stopped watching. BUT...<br /><br />Then I go to IMDb and find out that the makers of the movie (I assume that the people that gave this movie 10 have to be the people behind this crap) are trying to boost their own exceptionally bad movie. There is no justice in world if this movie gets 10 out of 10. This was my first comment in IMDb but I just had to do my part to make sure that anybody doesn't spend any money on this crap.<br /><br />Could be that the whole movie wasn't as bad but hopefully I'll never know.
