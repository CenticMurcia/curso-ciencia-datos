This film is an embarrassment to watch. Seeing poor Mae West, who was near 80, trying to act sexy is pathetic. The script is terrible and everyone in it should have known better. Paramount Studios, where it was filmed, refused to release it. It was finally picked up by an independent releasing company and released (or should I say escaped) and quickly died. If you are a fan of Mae West, DO NOT SEE THIS FILM! It will break your heart.
