Wow, where does one start with a movie like Extreme Honor? I caught it on TV a few days ago and I can tell you that I now have an answer for the next person who asks me what's the worst movie I've ever seen.<br /><br />Yes it's that bad! Everything in this movie is bad. The acting is comical, the action is awkward, the screenplay is badly written et cetera. The lead man, Dan Andersen, is about as charming as an old toothbrush and he obviously has no experience or talent for acting. While watching this movie I kept asking myself, was there no one in the process of making this that realized how poor this movie is?<br /><br />I couldn't find a trailer for this movie anywhere but I suggest looking up "Extreme honor Scene 5" on youtube for a preview.<br /><br />The only reason one should watch this pathetic excuse for a movie is for a good laugh at the awkwardness that this movie is.
