Marilyn, never more beautiful, outstages a stiff Olivier in this fairytalish comedy. The lessons at the Actor´s Studio (NY) really did pay off! An absolute delight and probably my favorite Monroe movie after ´The Misfits´. Don´t watch this one for the complex storylines or the explosive action, watch this one for the genius of Marilyn Monroe.
