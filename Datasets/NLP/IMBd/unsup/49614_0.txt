Derick Martini's direction here is adequate and the actors pour their hearts in some of the roles but the story the Martini brothers came up with fails to compel. As a result, this is just yet another bland indie entry mixing social criticism and coming of age stories. <br /><br />The story is down to earth but lacks visceral qualities and is rather forgettable. Character development is nowhere to be seen. It's even worse as far as the story is concerned. This one brings nothing new despite being well-made. <br /><br />One would be better off picking an old classic such as The Ice Storm in this case.
