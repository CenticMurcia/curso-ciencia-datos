Well this time around the filmmakers got it right. 'Ringu 2' (1999) is now the true sequel to the 1998 original, forget 'Rasen' (1998). This time around we see Mai Takano and the powers that be go of to look for the answers to the cursed video and to find Reiko and Yoichi only to find that Yoichi has developed Sadako's telekinetic powers and is in-fact becoming the demonic girl. This is the way they should have went in the first pace. 'Ringu 2' blows 'Rasen' out of the water and runs rings around 'Ringu'. T liked the original but found the suspense lacking and the film-making a nit bland, in this film however Hideo Nakata (who also helmed the original) gives the visuals a much needed kick and the atmosphere so much needed zing. The story is a lot more interesting and the acting gives the film a bit of a haunting feel.
