I love Clerks. I love how whiny Dante is, and I love how Randal cares about no one and nothing. This is the introduction to the world of Kevin Smith. Clerks is the first movie of five (the other four go in order: Mallrats, Chasing Amy, Dogma, and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) and fixates itself around Quick Stop store clerk Dante having to go in on his day off. This proves to be one of the worst days of his life. Things start off with a cigarette revolt and don't get any better from there. I like how Kevin Smith makes the movie around one big line repeated by Dante: "I'm not even supposed to be here today!" It's just cool to see how one persons life can be ripped to pieces when: your boss lies to you, your ex-girlfriend is "getting married" your best friend shows up late for work as usual, and you have to come in on your day off, among an array of other things I don't want to spoil. Clerks is filled with witty humor and memorable characters and great dialouge. If you like this movie you're bound to become a fan of Kevin Smith's work. Especially Jay and Silent Bob.
