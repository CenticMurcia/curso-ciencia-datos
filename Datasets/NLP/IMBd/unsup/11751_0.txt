After box office hit Jalla!Jalla!, Josef Fares comes with another comedy, which is a total gas.<br /><br />It's about some policemen in small-town Sweden who, crime being absent, spend most of their time, and they've got a lot of it, eating hot dogs at the local snack bar. Their biggest problem is a cow occasionally running in the street. Suddenly, they find out the police station is gonna shut down since there are no criminals around. At this point, the four protagonists(including Jalla-veterans Fares Fares and Torkel Peterson) decide to "raise the statistic". The results are hilarious...<br /><br />The movie is really funny and the characters are nice and believable, with the exception of Benny(Torkel Peterson), a complete moron who thinks he's Neo, Rambo and John McClane in one person. Nevertheless, Peterson is actually the main reason I kept laughing while watching the film.<br /><br />The only problem, if I can call it a problem, is the fact that some gags are a little bit too, you know, Swedish. For example, when the "kopps" accidentally blow up the previously mentioned snack bar, Benny's first reaction is "Oh sh*t! Where the hell are we gonna have lunch now?".<br /><br />Aside from that, there's no reason people shouldn't watch, and enjoy, this amusing film.<br /><br />8,5/10
