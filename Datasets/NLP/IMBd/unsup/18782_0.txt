In his biography of Clint Eastwood, Richard Schickel refers to a largely improvised scene between Clint and Tyne Daly, in a bar, where they compare notes and get drunk. Schickel calls it the best scene in the movie, and a first for any Eastwood film. They rolled camera and the actors just cut loose. At one point, Tyne even gets up to go to the restroom and, according to Schickel, it was so good it was left in the release print. Director James Fargo then shot some extra pickup footage, extra coverage, then edited the whole thing together. Again, he called it the best scene in the film; one that really cemented the close relationship between the two characters. So I'm watching the film last night. Both Clint and Tyne spar with each other, talking about getting a beer. Then we cut to a two shot, on a wharf pier, at a juice stand. Eastwood says "All they had was apple juice." The actors start walking and drinking... the dolly movies... and they do a brief "walk & talk." No bar, no improvisation, etc. And not much of a scene. Was this picture edited for video? Is this a replacement scene for TV? Very strange.
