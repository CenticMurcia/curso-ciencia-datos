Having just got home from a HotDocs screening, I haven't had a whole lot of time to process all the information this doc throws at you, but my god was it interesting. I won't begin to tell you about the ideas, opinions, and facts that this film brings to the screen, because you should see it for yourself.<br /><br />My criticism of the film would be in its editing - some places seemed choppy, I'm certain a few of the interviewees were cut-off in the middle of their last word (in the edit, not by the interviewer) but this nitpicking is insignificant when you think about what these people are telling you.<br /><br />We need more people to see this documentary. But more than that: more people to start talking about the subject to which it is trying to alarm us, and beyond that, to actually take action. Immediately.
