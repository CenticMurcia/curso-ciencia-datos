What can I say about this movie. It's got everything...drama, comedy, action, romance, and even a little grossness to it's plot. Where else can you see one man break up with his girlfriend, go to the mall, help destroy a friend's ex girlfriend's father's television game show, stinkpalm a couple people, find a couple hooligans to help you along the way and have time to have sex in an elevator? NOWHERE...that's why this movie has it all. Character development is a big big part of movies and this one has development of 2 memorable characters who we would see in a later film..."Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back". Kevin Smith excels as director (and actor as Silent Bob). This movie also launched the career of Jason Lee who played the comic loving, video game playing, mallrat of a crazy fool Brodie Bruce. Lee has gone on to star in such films in Stealing Harvard, A Guy Thing, Dogma, and Almost Famous. The movie makes you laugh uncontrollably in parts where you KNOW something funny is going to happen yet still laugh because it's outrageous. I highly reccomend this flick to all who are looking for a great comedy that's got it all.
