I'm very disappointed from this work of the Italian director Sergio Martino.We can't call this as a movie Also the Italian thrilling specialist writer Ernesto Gastaldi is hardy recognizable and it would be better for him to forget this text. Elvire Audray is a nice girl but not an actress and also Wandisa Guida only sexy and not so much. Better forget the music. But only the appearance of the Italian famous dramatic actress ANITA SAGNOTTI LAURENZI illuminate with her wonderful characterization and suggestion the scene.Her wonderful and deep voice remember the sweet time in Viterbo , were she is born , as she accepted the first declaration of love in old Greek. The characterization of Anita Sagnotti is short but unforgettable. Anita Sagnotti , daughter of a Carabinieri General ,is appreciated in many other better appearances by the Italian Radio-Television and remain unforgettable in my hearth.
