Jack Bender directs a battle of wits between Ben Linus and John Locke. Yep, you guessed it: a great LOST episode. Michael Emerson and Terry O'Quinn are arguably the two best actors in the series, and they have a way of elevating the already well-written dialogue even higher through their intonations and facial expressions. Add the revealing Locke-centered flashbacks, which begin with a brilliant misdirection about his "disability" and contain the biggest shock since the bus scene from "Not In Portland", and you have the best of the first 13 Season 3 episodes, along with "Flashes Before Your Eyes". And I haven't even mentioned the look on Jack's face when he finds out why Locke was "sorry", or the look on Alex's face when Sayid tells her that she looks like her mother. ***1/2 out of 4.
