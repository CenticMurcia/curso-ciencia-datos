No surprise that some nice white boy decided to cash-in on the bollywood phenom and what a trite mess he makes of it. Enough saccharine to make your teeth peel and enough sub-standard filmmaking to make you reach for your movie mantra and pray forgiveness for those who know not what they do. Pretty girl with nice song does not a movie make. Story? Let see... Boy meets girl. Girl from strict asian background. Boy not. It must be love. Everybody dance. Annoying & ludicrous twaddle.<br /><br />The only solace is I didnt pay to watch this. I give my deepest sympathy to those who did and were conned by a fancy poster and promise of magic realism.
