And I guess it will be me... This is a plodding film of dysfunctional characters that bored me with their dull, pathetic lives. Every part of this film is at fault here, from the endless anachronisms for 1979 (houses with vinyl siding not available until the 1990s, references to the Falkland war in 1982, Princess Diana style puffed sleeved party dresses from 1981...) to the Alec Baldwin Long Islander bad dad character he has pulled out of his hat on several B movie occasions. This film does not have the depth or pathos of American Beauty nor the intelligence or humour of Juno - two films it is commonly held up to. I have no idea why there seems to be a small but enthusiastic following for this film as I only felt relief when it was finally over. I gave it 2, only because there weren't more Caulkins in it.
