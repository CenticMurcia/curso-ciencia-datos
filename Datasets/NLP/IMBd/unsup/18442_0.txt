Just watched this last night. Finished by wanting to buy every other NY video. Superb performance. Highlight was Philadelphia. Atmosphere, mood & interaction with the audience was just right. I think Neil is at his best on this sort of set (check out unplugged), as he produces clear undiluted music filled with emotion & feeling.
