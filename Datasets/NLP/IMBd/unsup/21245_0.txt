The cheapness of this cartoon is evident from the beginning. Much of the animation is clearly recycled. Some of Bugs Bunny's jokes fall flat too but there's still plenty of zany, wackiness surrounding him to make up for it.<br /><br />The story is this. Bug's baseball team (made up of very old men) is losing to a bunch of brutish, thug-types. He makes them a bet he can beat them all on his own. And, as usual, it's Bugs' wits and brain against the stupid, easily manipulated opponents. <br /><br />This is also an earlier cartoon too. So Bugs' personality is not as honed and developed as later outings and the design of the character is a bit off. Still funny with lots of laughs tho.
