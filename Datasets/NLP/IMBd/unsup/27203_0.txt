A fine movie about a suicide-minded pilot fighting in Burma during World War II. The Gregory Peck character lost his bride during the German bombing of London, needs to find a purpose for living. He'll soon find it, as there's much need for able men not only in the hero department but also pretty girls need attention -- even in the Burma jungle.<br /><br />The themes of duty, courage, purpose, tenacity and redemption ride deep, and there's enough patriotism and faith to make any godless liberals in the audience cringe like Dracula facing a Crucifix. The Burma locations add a lot, as do the high production standards. They knew how to make good movies 50 years ago -- unlike today.<br /><br />This film has real heroes. Today's cocaine-soaked film industry only knows about comic book-style Super Heroes, who fight make-believe enemies using only the weapon of computer animation. They offer nothing to the younger generation save for inspiration fire up the PlayStation. Moral bankruptcy for the Bevis and Butthead audience; grown-ups (12 and older) are the forgotten audience.<br /><br />Gregory Peck made lots of excellent films prior to his dreadful (but Oscar winning) role of Aticus Finch. The Purple Plain is a fine example of his acting and star quality. Sadly, Peck just went to the dogs the last years of his career.<br /><br />Not only were movies better in 1954, but watching them was better. I saw The Purple Plain at Loew's Capitol Theatre -- the most deluxe theater that ever existed in Washington, DC. With its giant screen (largest ever), stereo sound and 3645 seats, you could sit in an atmosphere that would make the Emperor of China green with envy.
