I thought this movie was excellent, entertaining and very informing of people like Connie Volkos. She is a despicable thief, a nut and definitely personality disordered and sociopathic. She is not concerned with ruining other people's lives and is oblivious to the devastation she causes. She takes no responsibility for her actions and thinks she can just get away with things. It all started when Michelle Brown (the victim) walks into the loan office were Connie worked, with a skirt on that Connie liked. When her credit card is declined at the store she steals Michelle's credit card and information and dishonestly has the luxuries life, she wants. In the end all I can say to her is that, "Hey when you've layed around your whole life, you don't just get to say one day, "Oh I think I want what everybody else has worked so hard for their whole life". It does not work that way".
