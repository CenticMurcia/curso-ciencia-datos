Khamosh Pani is really beautifully made movie. It's most important part is it's such a real shooting locations and perfect story line. It brings up the important issues associated with Indo-Pak partition. It's beauty is enhanced by it's wonderful and soul touching music. Most beautiful being the nawaaz when saleem is sitting on the roof of some sort of fort. As you watch the movie you go through some questions related to general conceptions of religion, human existence and some events related to partition. This thing makes the movie worth watching as many times you want to see it. <br /><br />Over all the best movie I have ever seen.
