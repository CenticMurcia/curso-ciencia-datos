First of all, has Daryl Hannah ever had a good hair day? Having her play the head of the president's secret service was a stroke of very poor casting. Her acting was good but she was not believable in the role. The other femme fatale, Brandy Ledford was not even good eye candy. Her acting was not passable. This is a TV movie relegated to the likes of runs on Saturday morning on TBS cable. Once you've seen this drivel you'll know why. The assassination plot is so clich√© ridden it's a wonder anyone claimed writing credits. The action, what little there was, was poorly shot. This was obviously a low budget Canadian-based movie. How it ever got funded is beyond me.
