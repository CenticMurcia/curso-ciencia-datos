Well, I guess they like it in India. If this is the elite standard of Indian cinema, it doesn't surprise me that Indian movies never really make it to western theaters. Evolutionary this is lightyears behind western films. Both technically and storywise. When this premiered at the International Filmfestival Rotterdam, the 750 seats theater was fully packed by an "intellectual" audience, who didn't know what they were about to watch. When the movie was finished, half the theater was empty, and not a single positive comment was heard among the 300-something die hards who'd struggled their way through the whole thing. This is no way of captivating an audience. If you can speak of a story here at all, it is told in the worst possible way, it's too slow, incoherent and random. The acting is terrible and technically the film is below a professional level. It's very, very amateurish. Just because something is captured on celluloid, put together and provided with some (dubbed only) sound doesn't make it a movie. It's no surprise that, this way, a country can produce more 'films' than the US. Indian filmmakers, it's time you grow up.
