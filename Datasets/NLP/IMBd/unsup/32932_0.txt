I am a Japanese. It can be fun for me to see how Japanese still are portrayed stereotypically in the movies from the west. Because it's like gazing at a mirror which people living in a insular country like Japan lack and no matter how exaggerated or bad or untrue the stereotype may seem for the first glance, there is still something that holds true in it, something that reminds of part of self that we've been succeeding at hiding from ourselves.<br /><br />Yes. That did until I came across the death scene in this movie.<br /><br />I watched this movie in Sydney with my Japanese roommate. At this death scene we laughed our guts out. I almost cried. It's definitely the funniest death scene I've ever seen.<br /><br />And then the corpse remains on the screen for about 20 minutes. Or it just felt so. Superb acting.<br /><br />This movie had to resort to death of the main character and presented it quite unconvincingly. That's it. Piece of crap.
