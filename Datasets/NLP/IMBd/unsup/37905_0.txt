After i couldn't get a ticket for Clerks2 or Silent hill because of the age problem( i am still not 15, not long to go though) so instead i bought a ticket for this film since all the other movies looked quite stupid. So i went in and the movie started. It was good for like the first 15-20 minutes than the nightmare began.<br /><br />Affleck was horrible and i mean just horrible in this movie, the jokes he told were supposed to be funny but were not and were rather lame, The scenes which were supposed to be touching and emotional were just plain re***ded. This was the third movie of him that i have seen(the first and second being GWH and DD) and its probably the last one of his movies that i am gonna see.<br /><br />The scenes where Affleck goes to that writer dude's house and makes that help me help you speech was a limp rip off of Tom cruise's Jerry Maguire speech.<br /><br />The supporting cast was also horrible except for the guy who played the teacher and a one or two others.<br /><br />That's not the only thing that makes me hate this movie, i mean i sometimes like a movie with bad acting but good story and i thought the story was going to get better at the end but guess what? it stayed the same during the whole movie and the plot was just full of holes.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie but half way through the movie i stopped trying to find good points in the movie mainly because there weren't many so overall it's a disappointing movie and i wouldn't recommend anybody to watch it.<br /><br />3/10
