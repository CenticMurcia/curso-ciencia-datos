Phobic is not a big-budget studio production, or even a mid-budget indie production. That should be apparent from the credits on the video box, although the extremely negative posts about this film seem to have missed that fact. While consumers of mainly studio fare should probably skip this title, those who take an interest in the passion-fueled world of low-budget film-making may be surprised by the story. There's smart writing, some nice character interaction, and humor as well. I will fault the distributor, though, for marketing this title as a horror film; rather, it is a psychological thriller that relies more on the slow building of suspense than on blood or gore. Its weakest point is the poor lighting, but that is more a reflection of the budget than the story itself. If you see this film, keep these points in mind and you may appreciate what the cast and crew, largely on sweat and tears, managed to accomplish.
