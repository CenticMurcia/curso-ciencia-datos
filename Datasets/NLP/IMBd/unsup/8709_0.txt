For starters, this movie is more than it seems. It is more than just an epic following the history of a certain violin. It is more than a poetic journey through time. It is the last true masterpiece of the 90's. It is a beautiful grouping of cinematography, characters, music, and most of all, heart. The makes of this film saw more to everything than just a red violin with various owners. They saw an opportunity to tell a story that rivals the Old Testament. If only the Academy could recognize such beautiful work, then they'd not be condemned.<br /><br />If you've not seen this movie, see it now. Rent it, rent it again, rent it again, and then buy it. Buy it on VHS. Buy it on DVD. Buy the soundtrack 7 times so it never wears out.
