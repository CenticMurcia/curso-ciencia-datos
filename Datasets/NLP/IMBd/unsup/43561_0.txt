I was kind of looking forward to this, and I'm sad to say that it's not very funny.<br /><br />Ben Stiller is once again Ben Stiller, and Owen Wilson has his usual red-eyed-I may have been smoking before they yelled action- delivery that can make some dumb lines kind of funny, but other than that there's not much there there.<br /><br />Snoop Doggy is actually the scene stealer here. Vince Vaugn seems miscast.<br /><br />I liked the car a lot, but as I was waiting for it to end I kept thinking that this is what they mean by the January/February movie doldrums.<br /><br />I'd give it four stars.
