First of all, I'd like to say, my favorite type of movies are cheap horror flicks. I love them! The cheesier the better! But this one, this one was so stupid. I contribute it mainly to the "killer". The title says he has an Axe. He never uses the Axe but maybe once. And the hair? Its just a wig pulled over his face! They couldn't have come up with anything better, even cheesier? At least put a damn mask on the guy! This movie sucked. I liked the barn idea though, the unusually big barn with several parts. Acting was terrible, I like bad acting but this wasn't even interesting. It felt like a project movie for a class. But the main problem for this crap fest was the deaths.<br /><br />The first death, cheesy, gory, I like it but how is he gonna die from his arm being "grated". He just lays down and dies after his hand gets cut off. Not even realistic. <br /><br />The second death, guy gets stabbed. Kind of lame and slow, not even very "serial killer'-esquire. Whatever, I'll take it. <br /><br />But then, the rest of the movie is the two girls running from the killer wildly, but then entering rooms and leaving their backs to doors and spots where the killer was. Who would do that? I would be scared shitt-less looking around me. Nope, they couldn't even add a little realistic emotion. Then the rest of the movie is also the girls getting knocked out by little punches the killer gives them. It just turns into a boxing match, with the killer getting back up every time from things hitting him and knocking him out. Finally the girls shoots him with something. I don't really know what it was because I was fast forwarding, but the movie ends. No brutal Axe deaths or chainsaw stuff. Just a bunch of dumb plot and dumb boxing. No wonder it was free on demand.<br /><br />Oh and the "bloopers" Not funny at all. Very basic "oh noes i messed up a line!! Lol" Boo. Overall this movie gets a 1 out of 10, and I'm not harsh critic.
