This movie is a typical example of something I see a lot in anime; a succession of fights strung together by some vague story. Some of the fights are pretty entertaining, what with the various characters interesting powers, but I saw it two days ago and I can barely even remember what happened, because the plot was so dull. No indication of any sort of intelligence or depth behind the really silly story, but more or less watchable.
