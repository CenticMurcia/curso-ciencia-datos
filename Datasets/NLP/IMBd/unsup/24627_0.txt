Is it what it seems? The war I mean. Wherever we live, the information which reaches us is gathered by human beings, who are influenced day in and out. And what reaches us depends on the few people who are on the field, gathering the data, and writing conclusions. And it gets real difficult for them, when they're influenced by enemy and allies, who all try to get advantage. In recent times, we've had the possibility to learn the difference in what is told in the US, and what is told in Europe, not to mention the North-African region. At times, you'd wonder if those reports handle about the same war! Or should we refrain from using the term report and say Stories instead... War stories handles just about that. Ben Dansmore (Jeff Goldblum) is a war-zone reporter, who recently lost his regular photographer, and "gets saddled up" with a rookie, Nora Stone (Lake Bell). They, due to a series of actions get a different scope on a bombing, which opens a few doors on the other side of the trenches. Someone once said:" In war and love, anything is allowed" so expect everything, when they pursue their quest for "their truth", because there is no simple truth, except : "any war is dirty, even the clean ones". Some people get the feeling that the US government is held responsible, but seem to forget that the movie CLEARLY shows the dirty ways from the other side too , and above all, what is questioned most: "The War Stories"
