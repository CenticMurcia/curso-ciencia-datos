Average family style drama suited only for liberal minded people.This movie could have been good if it had better cinematography and script/screenplay.Still,if you are a liberal and a fan of family comedies and like any of the lead actors here,you will probably ignore this movie's limitations and be quite entertained by it's feel good fantasy.......
