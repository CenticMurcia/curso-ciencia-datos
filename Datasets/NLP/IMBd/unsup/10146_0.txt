A really great movie with beautiful scenery, reminding one of the natural splendor of early North America. Black Robe is the story of a journey up a river in canoes with an impending winter in wilderness Canada. A French Jesuit priest is transported far up river by Algonquin Indians. The movie uses the journey to contrast the cultures of the French, the Algonquin, and the Iroquois. The movie is not judgmental with any of these cultures. Excellent performances, especially by the young man playing the Jesuit priest. This movie is very touching and is very successful at making you care about the characters. Finally, Black Robe is a good adventure movie, with graphic violence and brutality. All in all a tremendous movie that should not be missed.
