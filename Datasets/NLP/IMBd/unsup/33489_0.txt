I watched this movie years ago, force to by my ex-girlfriend, and I can tell you this: this movie sucked! Chick flick movies suck! Is that the only thing Hollywood makes nowadays? Anyway did I say this movie really sucked? I'd rather work in godless Texas again, than watch this ugh! movie.<br /><br />1 (I wish a 0) out of 10. By the way did I say this movie exceptionally sucked?
