This is a first class musical. Several of the songs have become standards and continue to turn up in Gershwin orchestral compilations and in the repertoires of top cabaret artists. Ira Gershwin's lyrics for this show were among his wittiest ever.<br /><br />Betty Grable and Dick Haymes are in great voice. separately and in duet.<br /><br />The scenes in the boarding house peopled by eccentrics were highly original and very funny.<br /><br />It is inconceivable that this film has not been released on VHS or DVD, and that there is no CD of the soundtrack.<br /><br />It is my hope that some connoisseur of show tunes in the music business, like Michael Feinstein, will press for its release in some form.
