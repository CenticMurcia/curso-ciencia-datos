John Lithgow as Don Quixote is probably one of the best matchings that the film industry has ever had (ranks right up there with Jack Nicholson as The Joker). That, the scenery of La Mancha, and keeping things close to "true-to-story" are the only good things of the movie. Bob Hoskins did a decent job as Sancho, but his British accent ruined the effect. Also doing a decent job with her role was Vanessa Williams as Dulcinea, but again they should have found someone with more Castillian looks and accent. The Duke and Duchess wore clothing that did not fit the time to which the story took place. Don Quixote's adventures were well done and the special effects didn't ruin the movie as I had feared, but several well-known adventures, such as a fight with a caged lion, were noticeably missing. This makes me wish the movie was a two-part four-hour mini series. It is worth watching, but as with any story, the book is better.
