I would give it 10/10 for cinematography and soundtrack, and 1/10 for the script. <br /><br />I can buy the student-teacher story, but the rest of it is virtually unbelievable to me. The plot is so poorly brought together it hurts. The movie could have been much better! <br /><br />Why are they trying to persuade us it's a *love story* i don't understand. Love supposes some future and support, and what future could these two live together? So we better call it a movie about two girls craving to have sex, one of them eager and open for it, and the other trying to make fences all over and finally yielding. This stuff I can wholly buy and this sounds reasonable. <br /><br />BTW bloopers and alternate ending appeared to be best of all about it
