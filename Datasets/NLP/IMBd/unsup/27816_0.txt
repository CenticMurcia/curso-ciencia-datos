You should not take this movie serious. The time has run away from this movie indeed but forget that when you see this. All I can say is that this is John Carpenter's best movie. And Kurt Russel coolest role. I think that Kurt has done only two cool guys in all of his movies. As Snake Plissken in Escape from New York and as MacReady in The Thing. And the music keeps haunting me forever. It's so great! I love it! I can't express myself how good the music is. Overall: If you haven't seen this so what are you waiting for? Go see it! And buy the soundtrack too!
