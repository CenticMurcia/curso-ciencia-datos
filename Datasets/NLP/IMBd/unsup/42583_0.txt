To retell the stories of the Bible is too difficult to do on a low budget. The series "Anno Domini" shows this perfectly. In addition is is filled with presumptions that are not historically correct: Like for instance, that Peter went to Rome. It is a historical fact that Peters grave was discovered merely forty years ago in Jerusalem, by catholic archaeologists, but that the Vatican tried to cover it up. They didn't make it.
