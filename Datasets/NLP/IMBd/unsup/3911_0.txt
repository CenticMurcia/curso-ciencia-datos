This is what started the trend of reality TV shows. And that it was an original as you didn't know what to expect at all. As sixteen, later eighteen or twenty castaways are stranded on an deserted island. And these strangers must learn to work together and put their brains and brawns to the test. Or be voted out if they lose. Borneo was the original one. But the best ones were Australia, Pearl Island, All-Stars, Paulu, and Guatemala. Worst ones were Vanuatu, Fiji, and Thailand, due to less likable cast mates. Host Jeff Probst(Access Hollywood) is a master as host. Being both a friend, "drill sergeant, moderator, big brother" all rolled up into one. Nineteen seasons later, with two seasons a piece per year since 2000. And still strong though not as water-cooler talk as it used to be. But still goes strong placing in the top ten of TV ratings about each and every year!
