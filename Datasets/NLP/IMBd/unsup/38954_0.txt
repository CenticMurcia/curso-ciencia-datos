This movie should never have been made. I love the shows, the cartoon movies, lots of "Scooby" stuff, but this just sucks. They made Fred and Daphne self absorbed idiots, Scrappy a total pain in the butt and Velma a Mega-geek. The only things they did right were (beside the fact that it's under 90 minutes long) Scooby and Shaggy, knowing that they could make a fortune off of screwing up the other four and not Scoob and Shag (knowing whoever wrote the script, that would have made the movie better[note the sarcasm]). I would give this stinker a no-star rating, but I had to give it at least one.<br /><br />* out of *****.
