Seriously, the Trivia for this film says that the writers/producers/whatever had their names removed from the credits 'after' they saw the result??? What about paying attention 'during' the filming...I cannot understand how 'anyone' could have needed to wait until 'after'the filming was complete to realize that this was a turd on the face of humanity. I don't know what that means exactly, but it sounds bad and that's the point.<br /><br />I needed a random inoculation after seeing this film, not to mention the days, no 'weeks; of grovelling to my friends who I convinced to watch it with me.<br /><br />Picture this....the lights are down, the popcorn is out, I've built the mood by describing the trailer I saw on another Video...the film starts....and within about 5 minutes I notice the sound of popcorn being chewed has stopped. Silence has filled the lounge room....<br /><br />Of course, in hindsight I should have turned the video off, but like a train crash where the driver of the train turns out to be the conductor's pet poodle rather than a qualified individual, a certain fascination took place. Sure, I felt sorry for all of us knowing we would never be the same, but we were all unable to look away...yet no words were spoken. Stunner perhaps? It's possible, but 13 years on I still have flashbacks to the ridiculous sheep-like noise which echoed through the room every time the main character had a personality change...<br /><br />Who can forget the looks on the faces of my fellow movie watchers who moved straight past blaming the film itself for being so bad to blaming me for renting it. I can still feel the stabbing pain of their dagger laden looks....the "Well...I'm going home" which was 'overlooked', simply for a swift and silent exit from my house. The empty feeling I was left with in a house full of sleeping parents in one room, sleeping brother in another, and me...alone in front of the television watching the credits (sans Writers/Producers mind you) roll up the screen, my thoughts bypassing the obvious "what were you people thinking!!" and moving straight onto "What the hell just happened!?"...<br /><br />My life was never the same...(until of course I saw Jaws 4 when in fact it was 'exactly' the same as when watching this!) So, I highly UNrecommend this film.<br /><br />Check out my 'other' UNrecommended films cos I sure can pick 'em!
