I worked on this film for nine weeks as Elliott's stand-in. It was the first and last job i had in the film industry. <br /><br />Even though I got to know all the actors and crew - Even though I worked up to 16 hours a day for nine weeks- Even though my name appears in the credits as a PA Even though I expected to have a biased opinion-<br /><br />-I can't even watch the whole thing, this film truly sucks, and not in the good way - you know, films that are so bad, their good. Not this one - this is a truly awful piece of crap. It never made it to theaters, TV or rental. I found it on Amazon, bought it for $4, watched about 1 hour of it, checked the credits for my name and stuck it up on the shelf (forever)<br /><br />The idiot that gave this 10 stars really skewed the rating which, without that vote would be a 1.5 at best. They should have a 0 star rating for films like this.
