Honestly I gave this film a chance, watching all 2h 40m of it. Maybe when this movie was released it had some significance, but it is not worth the rental unless you want to see how bad film-making can be.<br /><br />If anything this movie is about how a guy with a camera can get a woman's attention, and sleep with them. They are first pulled in under the guise that he is making a documentary about "Sherman". Then once they are on camera, they do stupid things and tell their life stories which are not even interesting. All the while the author, who himself has the personality of a stone and wallows in his own self pity, tries to sleep with them.<br /><br />He also seems to go out of his way to reinforce the typical "Southern" stereotypes. I will not go into unnecessary detail here.<br /><br />Overall the movie has a quality that two kids with a VHS camcorder could duplicate, and zero plot. This is nothing more than a movie about a self obsessed person driving around looking for woman to try to sleep with.<br /><br />It is pretty clear to me after watching the movie that Ross had never intended on making a movie about Sherman, but rather was the inventor of the modern day self absorbed BLOG.<br /><br />TERRIBLE - POINTLESS - BAD FILM
