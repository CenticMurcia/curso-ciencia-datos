I found this movie today for a whopping $3 Australian (About a dollar fifty American), and I must say, it was well worth it.<br /><br />Sure, the story sucks.. The acting sucks.. The dialoge sucks.. The blood and other effects suck.. And almost everything else sucks.. But my friend and I thoroughly enjoyed it, mostly due to the laughter at the movies expense.<br /><br />It is always good to go out with a quote, so I will quote the killer from this top-grade horror movie... "I'M NOT TRYING TO WIN AN OSCAR!!!" That's good; you've got no chance.<br /><br />-keeperman42
