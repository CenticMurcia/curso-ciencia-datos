Having seen this film, I have to say, I look for it on TV... EVERY holiday season. It is an excellent story, about a woman, who has a life that is going nowhere fast, and has little prospect of so. She reminds me of myself a bit, and another family member. She lives for romance, yet picks the man who won't give it to her.<br /><br />However, while there are fairy godmothers, she gets a series of "Christmas Elves" to help out... so to speak. Many magical things happen to her, that improve her life, these all come from a list she HERSELF has written. and One by one, she realizes they are happening, and being "Checked Off". Each time one is fulfilled, she sees the fulfiller as a "christmas elf".<br /><br />It is child like enough to satisfy your child, AND the inner-child in grown ups.<br /><br />She stands up to her Anal boyfriend... who tries to run her life... thinking he knows best, and she does it in a way that lets him know straight out she is fed up.<br /><br />I would say, I will have to remember this for my anal boyfriends...LOL All in all... this one is a keeper...<br /><br />There is a comment below from a "Karen" about the music... and she is right! I wish I could find the soundtrack, or at least the title song (and don't think I haven't looked!) Stella Stevens, is STELLA-R as the mother... and brings a homey, but quirky feel to the movie that WORKS! The son Danny (portrayed by Bill Switzer) is cool, and not "childlike". He is indicative of many "old souled" children we have known in our lives.<br /><br />See this one... it is a classic watch every year in my house!
