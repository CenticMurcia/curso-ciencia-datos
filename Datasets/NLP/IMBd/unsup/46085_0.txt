Were it not for the antics and comedy of the Mystery Science Theater 3000 crew, this movie would be a waste of the film it's printed on! The acting is crap, the music is crap, the sets are crap, the direction is crap, and the camera angles (all three of them) are crap! I think that pretty much sums it up.
