Hilariously entertaining tale of a man with double amnesia: a dull penny pincher on one hand, a thieving con artist on the other. After being conked on the noggin he revives to find he has spent the last nine years as someone he isn't and reverts to his former tricky self. His apple cart is upset when he discovers he is falling for the wife he picked up during the nine year blackout. A plan to bilk some of the locals over a phony oil deal doesn't appear so rosy once his thorny heart is pricked by love, which puts him in danger from a mean tempered associate intent on becoming rich. Fast paced and very funny film, well worth watching, especially Powell's zany character.
