I was so excited to see this movie, but when it ended, I was at a whole new level of angry. The film threw so much pointless junk at you, that it was hard to follow the movie. The film is supposed to be about the death of Elizebeth Shore. Unfortunately, they actually focus very little on that topic.<br /><br />There are about 100 other things happening during the film, and 99 of them are irrelevant. I mean, the writing is terrible. This is another one of those films where third party, completely random characters become the culprits, and defeat the purpose of getting to know the main characters in the first place.<br /><br />The positive things that I can say is that they do sort of tie some things together at the end (although the results will only serve to tick most people off). Hartnett does do a good job, and the film is visually fun to watch.<br /><br />Aside from those things, it was bad. Don't see it. Save your money for Hollywoodland.
