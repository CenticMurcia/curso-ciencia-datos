I was very disappointed by this film, perhaps in part because it is South Korean and I've enjoyed Joon-Ho Bong's work a great deal, as well as some others. I could see some similarities too in the rapid clash and shift in emotions in "Time," and found the final third fairly compelling. Unfortunately the film already had been undermined for me by that point. The movie struck me as being very ham-fisted -- over-the-top acting, repetitive situations, telegraphed twists. I also was frustrated by the way the main characters are presented to the audience, already bickering and irrational. Failing to show the audience the couple's relationship when it was good before showing its collapse and the shallowness and incomprehensible decisions of both of them left me with no one to root for, nothing left to do but ask, repeatedly, "what the hell is wrong with these people?" There's the kernel of a good movie here, but you have to dig -- and wait -- to get to it.
