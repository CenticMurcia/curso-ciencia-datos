Although the self-absorbed undergraduates with their pseudo-intellectual babble will sniff about how "the masses" won't be able to "connect" or "appreciate" this movie, the reasonably intelligent movie-renter will recognize this film for what it is: a piece of crap. First, it is a road movie that rips off Kerouac and thinks that somehow gives it legitimacy. Second, it invokes Kurt Cobain, another transparent attempt to pass this off as a Gen X film by linking it to the over-commercialized and overpraised rock star. And third, it is just plain BAD. Inexplicable and pointless flashbacks of the two main characters as kids (yeah, we get it, they are buddies) are one problem, but the real weakness is the constant ripoff of Tarantino - an annoying drug dealer who engages in a monologue that exists only to waste the viewer's time, thugs who chase the "hero" for screwing a gangster's wife, we've all variations of this before. I rented this because of Jake Gyllenhall, a fine actor (go see Brokeback Mountain and Donnie Darko if you don't believe me), but his character exists in a drug-addled haze to Leto's brain-dead pool boy, who isn't high and has no excuse for his imbecility. Jake must have needed the money (it is supposed to have a $14 million budget, but clearly not in the cinematography department), for this stinker does nothing to enhance his indie-movie icon status. For a much better movie from 2002 that showcases his acting ability, check out "The Good Girl."
