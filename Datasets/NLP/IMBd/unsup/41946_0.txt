The only thing that I could tolerate in this movie was Gavin. After he was converted I stopped caring. I didn't really care about "steve". I will not forget his name since every character said it about 20 times. The worst part was the use of the soundtrack. It would blare out of nowhere and then abruptly stop. By the end I was hoping to see the two get converted. Then they had to go break free and then get saved by the "retarded janitor"?? Poor science and poor fiction make for hollywood grist in the MST3K mill. 2/10
