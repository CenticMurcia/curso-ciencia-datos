I'm a fan of Yuzna, but this movie sucked. It was boring. That's all I can really say. I didn't even see the ending. I had to pause the movie and upon coming back decided it wasn't worth another 15 minutes of my life. I kept expecting it would get good. I kept expecting something profound or neat to happen. But nope. Just some of the worst zombies I've ever seen and some dark satanic figure with bad lines. And a lot of pointless dialogue that almost put me to sleep. Yuzna should stick to Lovecraft adaptions. He is much more inspired when dealing with them. A movie like this should get more interesting as the plot advances, not less so. I never read the book, but I have to imagine it's better than this movie turned out. It seemed to me more poorly carried out than poorly plotted.
