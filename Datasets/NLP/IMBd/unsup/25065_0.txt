"Kisses and Caroms" is the debut feature film by indie up'n'comer Vince Rocca. According to the back of the DVD, a girl arranges a threesome to show her ex-boyfriend she is his dream girl, but blinded by his penis, he believes their relationship is best left alone. Through the antics of offbeat characters at a billiard pro shop, he realizes all his fantasies in her, but is it too late? The film comes with high praise from film-maker Kevin Smith: "Kisses and Caroms is as assured a first film as I've ever seen. Crackling with strong performances, this sexy little day-in-the-lifer is worth your time." Seeming a cross between "Clerks" and "American Pie", at 81 minutes this indie comedy looks highly amusing, and very good things could well be coming to Vince Rocca.
