Two kid are in love with each other and like any relationship you have to go through the ups and downs just like everyone else. But the moral of the story is True Love and thats what you see in this movie so everyone stop making such a big deal jeez. I thought Verney mac treated everyone the same he was rude. It was wrong when her grandfather talked about his grandma like that cause i wouldn't let no one talk about my granny i would have to cut them. but anyway i love Ashton hes so funny. and Verney i love him too but since Ashton is more in my age range i like him more he attractive too uh oh i think i have a crush anyway they say i have to write ten line so I'm just killing words. but my point was true love has no shade.
