I do not say these words lightly.<br /><br />I saw Breakfast of Aliens in a pre-release screening at Boston's 24-hour science fiction movie marathon. Let's just say it's a crowd that appreciates the occasional schlock B-movie, and that (lack of) quality is no object to enjoyment. Ed Wood, rubber suit monsters? Prime marathon material.<br /><br />Breakfast, is not. As the credits rolled, the crowd began to chant "THAT SUCKED! THAT SUCKED! THAT SUCKED!" and could not be hushed for several minutes.<br /><br />Breakfast is un-funny, dreary, and just a mess from start to finish. There is no joy mixed with the pain in this one. It's gross, it's unpleasant, and it's not the bad you can love to hate. It's just the bad you hate.<br /><br />Luckily for you, I don't think it was ever released, never mind released on video. Potential distributors out there? Just Say No.
