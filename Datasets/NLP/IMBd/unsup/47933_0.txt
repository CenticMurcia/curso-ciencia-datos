I can't explain how disappointed i was after watching this "thing". Keanu Reeves (one of the best actors in present, and nearly always acting in great movies). And the great story, who was filmed so awesome in the fifty's. But what was that at least? I must had know, that this can't be a good movie from the director, who makes a horror classic like "Hellraiser" to a joke. He really missed every moment to make a good movie. No association with the characters. How bad the scene was as Klaatu decides to rescue the humankind... I feel nothing! And that's because of this "16-year-old-talking-and-behavior" child. Why? He showed us in "The Pursuit of Happiness" that you can feel with him. And this "invasion"...awful! The whole meaning gets lost... He could have been showing such impressive pictures of our planet to get a feeling for the complex of problems, who are so real in our days. But nothing! The spheres landing in the jungle, you only see it coming down to the ground...and that's it. The only animals you see are little snakes , frogs and other little creatures. No lion, no elephant, no animal you get impressed for, but that could have been so important to get a feeling for the movie. But maybe exactly this points who makes me sick are the special interpretation of Mr. Scott Derrickson. I unusual seen such a unmotivated and boring movie...
