William Powell was a charming actor but he had some bombs between the Thin Man series and "Life With Father." This surely is one of them. Hedy Lamarr was gorgeous. And the supporting cast is excellent: Felix Bressart actually imbues a cardboard character with some life. So, in a smaller role, does Margaret Wycherly. Claire Trevor does well with what she's given. Basil Rathbone, though, is stuck with the worst role and he can't bring it to life.<br /><br />It has a paint-by-numbers feel. It bears no relationship to any sort of reality. The characters are not well drawn and the plot is risible.<br /><br />Can you imagine William Powell as a French diplomat? Can you imagine William Powell as a murderer? If so, you may like this. Possibly.
