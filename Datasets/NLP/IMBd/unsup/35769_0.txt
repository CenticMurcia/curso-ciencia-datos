I didn't like it but it's a good kids movie and you can buy it for like a 1.50 (VHS) off ebay, so it'd be worth it. It has some pretty cool people in it: Neve Campbell, Matthew Broderick, and Andy Dick. So anyway, Simba and Nala kind of take over from their parents and Simba's really proud. The same basic characters as in the first one are in it, like Timon and Pumpa. There's still lots of conflict like Simba's daughter gets into trouble and stuff. It's all much better to watch when you're a kid, though. I think it's worth 1.50 and no more but I'm kids and some other people would actually like it. It's just that I love the first one so much that this one just doesn't compare at all. It also doesn't have the same emotional feel that the first had (with the father dying and such). The first one always made me cry even when I was older plus the music and visuals were cool so it made it a really good film but this one isn't. I just wish they hadn't made a sequel. There are so many movies out there that really shouldn't have had sequels, cause they were bad, same case as Aladdin.
