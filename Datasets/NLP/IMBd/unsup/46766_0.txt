Onto movie number 11 on the Chilling Classics DVD set. Jiminy Jesus. If there's one thing i've learned about the 1970's it's this. most of their movies are god awful. There are several reasons for this. Since this was the dawn of the age of the slasher film, they didn't quite get the formula down yet. By the 80's they had the formula of it down, but back in the 70's they were still working it out and a lot of them failed. This is one of them.<br /><br />The second thing i've noticed is that while some films used a lot of day for night shots where they attempt to convince you that it's nighttime when it's obviously daylight, and that's pretty stupid. But at least you can see what's going on. For some reason they feel that it's better to show absolute pitch blackness to show that it's night. But at that point you can't see anything of what's going on at all and there is officially no point. And this movie had A LOT of that.<br /><br />The last thing i noticed about 70's horror movies is that they try to be artsy about it by putting substories and reasonings and all that art-house crap. And in a horror movie, nobody cares. But anyway, onto the film.<br /><br />Some guy is an artist and is trying to make this one painting which is apparently going to be his best painting ever. We then have 45 minutes of pointlessness such as a band moving in, the main characters talking about how they need money, and the guy complaining about noise and how his girlfriend won't shut up about when is the painting going to be done. And then he starts to kill hobos with a power drill. Why? I have absolutely no idea. Then the art dealer tells him his painting is crap, and so he gets angry, and starts killing people that live in HOUSES! what a twist! seriously, according to my DVD sleeve, he goes crazy AFTER the guy tells him his painting is bad. So apparently killing hobos isn't crazy, but killing people in HOUSES is VERY crazy! that's very random.<br /><br />And at the end, i don't know if this was a glitch of somekind like a bad transfer or something, but after he kills his ex girlfriend's new boyfriend, she begins to call for him because she doesn't know he's dead, and then the screen turns red for about 3 minutes and you can't see a damn thing. And then it cuts to the credits. i don't know what happened, if they got a really bad VHS source from Jimmy Dean's trunk or something, but.... yeah... somebody please tell me if i missed the real ending or that's actually how it ends. because that confused the crap outta me.<br /><br />While being incredibly boring, broken up with hobo killings, this movie isn't the WORST slasher movie ever, but it is a very boring 1970's one and therefore gets 3 drills to the temple out of 10.
