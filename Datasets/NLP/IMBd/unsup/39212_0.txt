This is, frankly, the most disgusting film I've ever seen - and I've seen a lot. So I'm amazed, and a little frightened, that so many people have rated it highly. Joe Spinnel (now deceased), Caroline Munro, Tom Savini, all ought to be ashamed of their participation in this immoral dungheap of a film.<br /><br />I hope none of you who rated it higher than 2 ever find out where I live.
