Gay or straight, this film illuminates the emotional undercurrent of the gay marriage issue on many levels. Beyond the political talking points (which are engaging and amusing in and of themselves), the film points to what it means to have the allowance of marriage as a "goal" or "purpose" in a relationship at all ... and how that resonates in a person's life. The film is incredibly well made, beautifully shot, tightly edited/structured ... and just flat out blew me away as a shining example of what intelligent and evocative film-making can be. Everyone should see this film. Especially those who are so vehemently opposed to the issue. Everything is quite fairly laid out ... not overly condemning one way or the other. A wide exposure of this film would create a more productive and human conversation on the topic so we could collectively move forward as a society without such judgment and fear. And this is all coming from a very private, non-politically vocal individual. Congrats to all involved!
