I don't even remember when or where I picked up this turkey, couldn't have been more than a buck. Thank goodness for that, because this finally beat Godzilla 1985 as my pick for the worst movie of ALL TIME ! Not only is it incredibly not funny, the plot is incredibly idiotic, and had to be made in one day tops. I don't know who wrote the material for this stench bomb, but it couldn't have made a 5 year old laugh, although I wouldn't dare subject any 5 year old to this. Jim Carrey is portrayed on the box as the star, but oh no, he is in it maybe 10 minutes of the 40, only to fake a throat ailment so it would force the worst actress of ALL TIME to get up and do some stand up. I am not sure if my life will ever be the same again. I can't even give this thing away, I might as well toss it in the trash.
