Seeing BIG NIGHT for the 2nd time, I am struck that this movie is essentially a film to showcase the actors. Many of the scenes appear to be improvised, almost acting-class exercises. And the acting is indeed a joy to watch, particularly the great Tony Shalhoub, who is so often under-used. Plotwise, the film is a bit slow and visually not particularly striking. The acting's the thing!<br /><br />P.S. I disagree with another poster's assertion that Minnie Driver was cast for her "star power"; at the time of this film she was mostly known for CIRCLE OF FRIENDS and (somewhat) for GOLDENEYE, and was still part of that indy-film group of actors that included Scott, Tucci, etc.
