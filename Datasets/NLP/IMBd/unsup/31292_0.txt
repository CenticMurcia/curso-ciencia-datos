Yes, folks, I'm sick of reading the comments "more violence from Bronson". This in my opinion is a minor masterpiece of a film. It creates an atmosphere; that of '60s Europa. Those who can't get into this film can't get into the '60s. I can see how Jim Morrison based Riders on the Storm on this. Marlene Jobert is great as the naive woman who stumbles into Bronsonian intrigue. The film itself directed by Clement is a success in expressing artistic vision in the guise of a "typical Bronson film". The comedic interplay between Bronson and Jobert make the film. It's basically an esoteric love story with that '60s feel that only us Jim Morrisons can appreciate.<br /><br />Aside from this film I think Bronson is a great, cool, and at times brilliant actor. His great underrated films include: Death Wish (I hate every Death Wish sequel), Evil that Men Do, Mechanic, Once upon a Time in the West, and all his '60s and '70s stuff. His '80s stuff is the throwaway stuff.
