NO!! I Don't WANT TO WATCH MORE!!!!This film it's piece of crap! Really, far, far, far away from the first "Starship Troopers". Don't say to me that is a good sequel, because its not, its a fucklng shlt!!<br /><br />And the fact that the director are always insisting on the network news and propaganda : "would you like to know more?"...give me a break, it is simply a terrible rip off from the first "Starship Troopers".<br /><br />But the worst thing in the movie, its definitely Casper Van Dien, trying to do a though character...but he fail 100%..<br /><br />Im a Starship Trooper first flick fan, sincerely, this Starship 3: Marauder in my opinion is a bad movie. If you like this one, i recommend: "Starship Troopers 2: Hero of the Federation" (its even worst than the third one).
