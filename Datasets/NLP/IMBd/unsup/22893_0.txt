I watched this show on Sky in the UK and was instantly hooked! I'd previously enjoyed watching CHIPS, T J Hooker and COPS. High Incident was like a godsend, as it was like watching COPS but with awesome actors and story lines (something the average cop show always seems to be in desperate need of!). It was unlike any other cop show I'd ever seen, in that it captured not just the exciting car chases and gunfights, tense moments and drama, but also the average day-to-day calls that a police officer might receive.<br /><br />There was humour as well as drama and I think the viewers posts here speak for themselves, this show should NOT have been CANCELLED so soon! As I saw in a post earlier, this is the kind of cop show that cops watch! And that really says a lot! If this ever is released in some form on DVD, I'm sure I'll be spending insane amounts of money to get hold of it!
