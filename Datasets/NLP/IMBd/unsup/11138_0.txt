I can't help but love this movie, its just so entertaining.Lindsey Lohan is so cute, and fun in this movie.Even Tyra Banks is good in this as Eve the doll that magically came back to life.Also this film is so sweet and somewhat depressing at times, in a sweet way.Also since its very entertaining at times and you can't help but like it.However I will say that it was cheesy at times, and at other times it was a little predictable, or at least to out there, in a way you almost can't take it to literal.Overall this film is good, its by all means no masterpiece but its very entertaining and good.<br /><br />8.3 out of 10 stars
