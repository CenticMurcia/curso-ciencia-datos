"The Best Man" has one of the most visually attractive female casts that I've seen in recent years. Not only are they eye-candy, but also strong female roles played by excellent actresses. Often hard to find is a film that presents both so well. Equally impressive was the bond between the main four male characters who, while different, are all intellectual and successful men. The combination of the two gave me the real feeling of quality characters.<br /><br />As a big fan of Sanaa Lathan and Nia Long, I heavily looked forward to seeing them together in a film, but I was surprised by many other outstanding actors and actresses who really gave the film its boost. Morris Chesnut was excellent as the groom-to-be, Monica Calhoun excellent as the bride-to-be, and Taye Diggs did a very nice job with a softer and more reserved character than many of his other roles.<br /><br />A very interesting script, a quality soundtrack, and well played roles made this film a winner for me. In some ways I was almost disappointed by parts of the ending of the film, but it did not really affect my overall enjoyment. Great movie - 8/10
