Well I've played almost all the Evil Dead games and have to say this one has a great action level,(love the combos with the Chainsaw) but I didn't really care for the other weapons, they really should of added more weapons. although very short the storyline was good, didn't really like the fact that it is a "What If?" game but I got over it. Sam was especially fun to play as. although it got really repetitive, also they could of gave Sam more weapons. Ash was funny but he couldn't speak on command like in the other two games. so every new addition adds but takes away as well. I did not like the ending (AT ALL!) but everything else was awesome!...If your an Evil Dead fan you will enjoy this game. Oh yeah the end level is a fresh idea they added to the series. so over all good game could of been better.
