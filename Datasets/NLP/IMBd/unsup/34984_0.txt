please please do not watch this film , it doesn't deserve it !!!! its without doubt the worst , unfunniest film ever and Christopher walken should seriously reconsider his career after it !!! i didn't laugh once during the whole thing and saw every single "joke" a good 10 seconds before it happened !!! it tries to get us cheering for the underdog like in great films like major league , dodgeball etc but i ended up actually totally disliking the main character whose main claim to greatness seemed to be sticking his chewing gum under the flipping ping pong table !!!!!!!! please listen to me and give it a miss , in fact when its on terrestrial TV (in about 4 weeks i'd say) just go out for a picnic or something ... anything to get away from it !! im just mad that the lowest vote i could give it was 1 !
