***** out of ***** After starring in the highly entertaining Lethal Weapon 4 and the gravity defying Romeo Must Die, Jet Li has now got 3 excellent hollywood flicks under his belt. Kiss Of The Dragon takes Jet to Paris where he does battle with every gang member and corrupt cop he can get his hands on. Obviously Jet is well known for his immaculate martial arts expertise, so its no surprise that KOD contains a load full of fight sequences that are choreographed to its highest standard by the masterful Corey Yuen.<br /><br />Jet stars as Beijing cop Liu Jian who travels to Paris to assist Inspector Richard (Tcheky Karyo) in arresting one of the most powerful drug lords in Asia. When Richard murders the drug lord, Liu finds himself framed for the crime and running from Richard and his gang of thugs. But do not think Liu will give up without a fight!!!! He meets a prostitute named Jessica (Bridget Fonda) who was a witness to the murder. Liu and Jessica team up together to clear Liu's name, get Jessica out of prostitution and to rescue Jessica's daughter from the clutches of the evil Richard (sounds like they'll have their hands full).<br /><br />The story is very easy to follow and gives out a small message, and the entire cast give memorable performances, which makes KOD very different to every other kung fu flick. The martial arts sequences are extremely enjoyable with plenty of blood and bone crunching involved, and it is always a pleasure to watch Jet Li kick the ass of every bad guy in this movie. Certainly not for the faint - hearted (or the children), but Kiss Of The Dragon makes for an excellent action movie with a pace that'll have your pulses racing until you collapse.
