The movie focuses about US President protected by Secret Service(Willis Bouchey as Chief agent) who passes through small and peaceable town called Suddenly where only the sheriff(Sterling Hayden)execute the law. One house inhabited by a grandfather(James Gleason),a widow(Nancy Gates) and son is ideal place for a criminal scheme by means of an ambush, designed and pulled off by ominous murderers commanded by an ruthless psycho assassin(Frank Sinatra).<br /><br />The film has emotion,strain,suspense,thriller and although is majority developed on interior scenarios ,it doesn't make bored neither tired. Release was withdrawn from circulation for the Dallas magnicide(1963) because the events are pretty similar.Frank Sinatra(JFK's friend) as producer ordered the retaining copies and the movie was forgotten,however long time after was issued in video market and obtained many success. Frank Sinatra interpretation is top notch as the cruel and brutal killer,his acting is magnificent,he's the best.Attractive Nancy Gates is the pacifist widow who hates the guns and embittered for husband's death during WWII.Sterling Hayden interprets properly a kind and valiant police believer of the American way of life.James Gleason as stiff and rigid veteran is very fine.Atmospheric cinematography and agreeable music by David Raksin(author of Laura's score film).The motion picture is accurately directed by Lewis Allen(director of a some cinema noir's classics).Rating : Interesting ,worthwhile seeing and it will like to Frank Sinatra fans.
