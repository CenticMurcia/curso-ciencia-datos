I happened to watch this movie on TV recently (January 2010) and it made me sick. It seems like a very immature fantasy of a very appalling and dull woman. The moral of the movie: A pregnant woman is ALWAYS right and should be obeyed no matter what. If the man she trapped doesn't want a child and certainly DOES NOT WANT TO GET RID OF HIS BELOVED 16 YEAR OLD CAT, then he is made out to be the prince of darkness or a pathetic fool. I am grateful that the majority of reviews are negative. But only one review mentions the cat. Is it really American lifestyle to dispose of your pets if you are expecting a child? I find it cruel and evil. This movie is the worst and most stupid I've ever watched.
