**SPOILERS** Garishly photographed in intense blue and red colors the movie "I Know Who Killed Me" gives us a clue to what's about to happen within the very first few minutes of the film. This all has to do with honor student and future concert pianist Aubrey Fleming, Lindsay Lohan. Aubrey is torn between following her music teachers Douglas Norquist, Thomas Tofel, advice in putting all her efforts into a musical, playing the piano, career or Aubery's real love in becoming world famous mystery writer.<br /><br />During the opening sequences of the movie there's a search for this missing girl, Jennifer Toland, who's eventually found murdered with her right hand and lower part of her right leg amputated. Jennifer will play a major part later in the film to not only bring out what the motives of her murderer was but how they connected her to both Aubrey and what later turned out to be her identical twin Dakota Moss also played by Miss. Lohan.<br /><br />Attending a New Salem high school football game to see her boyfriend the teams star running back Jerrod Pointer, Brian Geraghty,in action Aubery is later kidnapped by this Man in Blue who holds her hostage for some two weeks. Aubery is brutally tortured by her abductor and left for dead on the side of a road outside of town. Found with the exact same injuries as the late Jennifer Toland, an amputated right hand and foot, it's believed by the local police that Aubrey's abductor and Jennifer's murderer are one and the same person.<br /><br />The big surprise comes later when Aubrey regains conciseness and insists that she's not Aubrey Fleming at all! She's a stripper who works out of the Strip Nightclub in the red light district of town called Dokata Moss!<br /><br />The film has a difficult time getting the ball rolling in what exactly Dakota's state of mind really is. Is she really who she says that she is and if true were does that leave Aubery Fleming? The unseen killer, or kidnapper, had somehow overlooked the fact that he had two, Aubery & Dakota, victims whom he kidnapped and brutally tortured were in fact related related to each other! One of them, Dakota, not only wasn't whom he wanted to do a job on, by torturing and leaving her to die, but that in the end she would be the one who does a job on him!<br /><br />Far too confusing to really follow "I Know Who Killed Me" leaves so many loose ends that you feel in trying to understand it's storyline that you'll slip and fall on your head like you would if you forgot to tie your shoelaces when you got dressed in the morning.<br /><br />Lindsey Lohan in what may be, I'm not really sure, her first adult acting part is surprising good as both Aubrey Fleming and Dakota Moss. I never expected Miss Lohan to be that believable in her two parts in the movie with all the bad publicity that she's gotten over the last two years as an out of control drug and alcohol abuser. The really big surprise in the film is not that both Aubrey and Dakota are really identical twins it's that their mother as well as father isn't Audrey's and Dakota's real parents Susan, Julia Osmond, and Daniel, Neal McDonough, Fleming! Thats' what fooled everybody in the movie and most of all the Man in Blue who's both Aubery and Dakota kidnapper and torturer as well as Jennifer Toland's murderer! That major mistake on his part in the end was what not only tripped The Man in Blue up but caused the confused psycho to expose himself where he ended up getting run through by a hysterical and wildcat-like Dakota Moss!
