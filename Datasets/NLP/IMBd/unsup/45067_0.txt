For a hard of hearing french, watching an American movie without subtitle is "mission impossible". I don't understand what people say, so it's like everybody is mute. So, have laughs: here's my debriefing of what I have understood: <br /><br />Mr Brooks is a famous director (or writer?) who gets fired by a studio! Why? I don't know. Desperate, he believes to have an appointment with Spielberg but meets another one. Hopefully, the real Bridges gives him help with the address of his muse. If this muse brings inspiration, she needs a lot of things and attention. He works about of script about fish but it's her wife that benefits much, becoming a successful cookie maker. What does the muse says exactly: I don't know.<br /><br />If the dialogs were hard to follow, the music wasn't and for a Elton John composition, it is really surprising good. But it is used to fill the walks or car errands! <br /><br />Finally, it's a pity to understand so little because it seems to be a good comedy about Hollywood. The cameos are funny even if I think that making a movie about movie lacks of inspiration! Where is the muse?
