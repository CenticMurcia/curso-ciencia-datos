I really like that Aamir Khan. He was mostly the strong, silent hero in Lagaan, but here he's a goofy funny guy. The scene at the opera where he comes to many realizations is spectacular (if a little reminiscent of Moonstruck).<br /><br />I really liked this movie, and I probably would've really loved it if I spoke a word of Hindi (or if it had been subtitled).<br /><br />
