The Girls Next Door is inappropriate by Playboy like they should of made it rated TV-18 or R for nude blurring, sex, Kendra's inappropriate laugh and beep words on this show. I have seen a couple episodes that are funny. Kendra is the worst star on this show to be in this calendar shoot. Hugh Hefner is excellent on The Girls Next Door. I saw a clip from The Soup about Potty Humor on E!.com and that part was inappropriate about what Holly says about something comes out of a toilet and wipe something off her crouch thats bad. Also on this clip is when Bridget dresses up a black little dog for a costume just then the black dog lays down and does not like that costume. Then last there was a inappropriate laugh of Kendras laugh. This is inappropriate for everybody this show will make you stupid and so does Playboy shoots.
