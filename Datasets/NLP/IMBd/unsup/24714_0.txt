I enjoy watching these a lot. It includes humor, (sit boy!) romance, action, fantasy, and other genres. The endings keep you hanging. But being at almost 150 episodes in a matter of days, I have to wonder how people could watch this seemingly never ending story repeatedly for years.<br /><br />The only thing that bugs me at this point is Kikyo wrecking Kagome and Inuyasha's relationship. (hello, get over her, Inuyasha. She's DEAD!!!)<br /><br />Naraku was so disgusting; he really made me mad. Why can't he just stay put and DIE???<br /><br />Jaken is so pathetic sometimes he's funny. When he was supposedly dying of the poison, I found it hard to keep from laughing.<br /><br />Overall, this is a really good show. I give it a 10 out of 10.
