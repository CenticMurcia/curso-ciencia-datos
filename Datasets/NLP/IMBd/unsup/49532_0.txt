A real obnoxious guy (Wally White) decides to leave his job in NY and spend the summer in Provincetown MA and find Mr. Right.<br /><br />OK--this is LOUSY. For starters--every gay stereotype is trotted out to go through its motions. Second, there's no plot. Third, ALL the characters are obnoxious. Fourth, I've been to PTown--this was obviously shot off season and it REALLY shows. Fifth, almost no one can act. Sixth, did I mention the main character is really obnoxious? Seven, all the "comedy" is lousy. A particularly bad sequence is White picking out dancers from square states (don't ask).<br /><br />The ONLY bright spot here is Randy Becker. He turns in the sole good performance and is VERY hot (to put it mildly)! But he also plays a real jerk.<br /><br />Basically one of the worst gay films ever--maybe THE worst! I wish I could give it a 0--it's not good enough for a 1!
