I have foolishly viewed far too many of these "8 films to die for" DVD's, from both the first go-round & the second. I think that perhaps "Lake Dead" is the nail in the coffin of my interest in these films. There were a few goodies in among the crap, like "Reincarnation", "The Abandoned", and "Frontiers", but as for the rest, well, utterly forgettable with little in the way of any redeeming values.<br /><br />Three girls inherit a hotel from their grandfather that they didn't know was alive. Their father may well be a drunken fool, but he at least tried to protect them from the knowledge of grandpa's existence. Why? Well, because there were some unsavory family ties that he didn't want his daughter involved in.<br /><br />And how unsavory were these ties? Well, grandpa gets it at the very beginning of the film, when he decides enough is enough, apparently, although a little late, I'd say. The girls, of course, head off to view their inheritance in a big RV that belongs to an old frat buddy of one of the daughter's boyfriends. Also along for the ride is a friend of one of the daughters, of the female persuasion. There is a bit of dismay expressed by the RV owner's girlfriend, since her boyfriend has cheated on her numerous times, and he's not done yet, you can bet.<br /><br />When they reach the hotel they're greeted by the shriveled manager, a sweet old lady who really isn't all that sweet. And after tangling with some deformed looking locals they're picked up by the nice sheriff, who really isn't so nice. And then it's sort of revealed that the girls may have a few family ties with these folks and they're due to keep the family line going.<br /><br />I guess there's not a lot of good things that I can say about a movie where the highlight is a guy giving his mom some tongue...I won't say who it is but if anything in this movie was scary, that was it.<br /><br />An abysmal piece of work, not to be bothered with. 2 out of 10.
