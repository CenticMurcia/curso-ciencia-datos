Two of my friends and i watched this last night at my house. We dubbed the night "Teeny bopper movie night", because we watched this along with 3 other movies with tryhard teens thinking they can act. Between Waiting for a dog to go to the toilet and having to watch the Olsen twins run around wearing nothing but towels, we didn't know which one would kill us first. The thing my friends and I laughed about most, however, was the lame storyline with the girls each meeting a "super hot guy". This was most unoriginal as right away the girl falls for the guy after knowing him for 5 seconds, and what brought them together? Her getting caught on his bike. Wow. Romantic.....
