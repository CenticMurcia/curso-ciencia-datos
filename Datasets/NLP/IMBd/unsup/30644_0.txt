This movie is kinda vaguely like the Blair witch project but much much more boring and not even vaguely scary.<br /><br />I kept watching because some comments said it gets better as it goes on. They lied. Well I guess it did get better, after all it couldn't get much worse, but even better was pitiful.<br /><br />It's the kind of movie that I might watch if it was on TV and there was nothing else on and I was too tired to get up and find the remote, but I would not suggest that anyone should rent this movie.<br /><br />The only plus point I can see is it would have been very low budget. The scenes were probably real NZ bush and old buildings, there were no special effects, no big actors. Some of the camera work was fairly good otherwise I would have said it was made by a third form (13 year olds) drama class.<br /><br />As others have said you do get to know the individuals a bit and the twist at the end was unexpected but all in all not really worth watching.
