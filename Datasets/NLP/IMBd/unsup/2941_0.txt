I generally don't hold out much hope for straight-to-video horror films, but this was brilliant--such a pleasant surprise! It was obviously made by folks who know and love horror movies--especially zombie flicks. This is evidenced in the opening scene where Chuck, the video store guy, talks over the phone with a customer about zombie films (while "Plan Nine" plays on the TV, no less). This movie was made with real reverence and humor. The script was hilarious--it made me laugh out loud several times. And the acting was pretty darn good, considering that the cast was largely "amateur." No one should criticize it for having a low-budget look--it was a low-budget film, for crying out loud! And it was worth a hundred of Hollywood's big-budget, CGI lovin', based-on-a-video-game, crappy zombie flicks. Just get a six-pack and watch it!
