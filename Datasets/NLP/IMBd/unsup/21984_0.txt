Its suppose To be Under Siege in a Water Plant.. But it ain't... Its a really Woeful action Movie and thats what i love about it... (Kim Coates) is given the freedom of the entire movie to act like a complete dick. but he does a good job ..and he's made a fan outta me. He leads a team of incredibly dumb terrorists into a waterplant and will pollute the water unless blah de blah blah.... Cue (Jeff Fahey) the Worst Hero ever...Jeff spends most of this movie talking about his brie omelette's and generally Hiding behind (Carrie Ann Moss )..Yes Folks John McClaine he Certainly ain't .. He Kills 1 Terrorist ( a female one at that) .. and he shoots her in the back !! (Gary Busey) Pops up as the Brains behind the Terrorism...Then he Gets greedy and starts Killing his own men...Which is a good job , becoz i don't Think Fahey was up for it... Fans of Busey will Enjoy his moments on screen.... Yeah its a Dodgy piece of Junk .....But it gets my seal of approval Busey & Coates keep it entertaining and although the Action is "Z list" standard the Unintentional comedy element is Top Notch <br /><br />10 outta 10 for this Bad Boy
