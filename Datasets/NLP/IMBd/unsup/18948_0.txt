"I loose my mind at all, and then I fall in love." <br /><br />Love was in your eyes. Paris by night, in twilight, on jazzy evenings, on a rainy afternoon, on a sunny morning - High life in the fifties with Horst Buchholz and Romy Schneider as the two lost souls struggling for their love and life. This film is overloaded by dashing and lively scenes. Horst and Romy were the biggest movie stars in Germany at that time and in this film together they are better than ever. Horst "Monpti" is a Hungarian artist with no money and no company but a little duck called Napoleon. He meets Romy who seems to be less or more lonely than he is. Yes, a very romantic film and also a comedy ending up as drama. Zaza sings "Don't play me that shadow blue". This German film about lovelorn long ago is a real gem to be discovered. "Your love will stay in my heart."
