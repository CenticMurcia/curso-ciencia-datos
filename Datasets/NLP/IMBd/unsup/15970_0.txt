Charles Bronson stars as Paul Kersey a mild mannered businessman who turns vigilante after a brutal attack on his wife and daughter in this thought provoking, well made and humorous box office smash. Death Wish is indeed a pioneer in the genre for which it spawned, and overall it holds up well today as it did in the 70's. Charles Bronson's most note worthy date, and certainly one of his best. Followed by 4 weak sequels
