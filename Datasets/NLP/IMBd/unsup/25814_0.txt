It has been years since I have seen this film, but was kinda worth the time. I fine apocalyptic films interesting as a rule, but the directors over the top use of the color orange was distracting. It popped up in every thing from main character's shirt to elevator buttons, on and on. I found some of the special effect cheesy (such as when a character is suffering the effects of an explosion). Some of the hysteria was a bit overdone, all taken on the word of one guy corroborated by someone else most hardly new. Had the film taken the time to set a context by which this hysteria could have become such a driving force (as opposed to allowing the historical context of the late 1980's do it) the film would have fared better over time. I always enjoy Anthony Edwards, but again, I did have some problems with plausibility. The brief sexual tid bits are underplayed (perhaps due to the tastes of the times) but should have been made a bit stronger. There were some gaps in the plot events atop the skyscraper, and too much was left to the imagination for good continuity. This was the case when one character came back with a bloody mouth, and missing a friend, all with no explanation.
