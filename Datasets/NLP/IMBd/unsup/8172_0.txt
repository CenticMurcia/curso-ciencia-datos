What a waste of time. And the one star i gave was for the trailer. It was a very good trailer, full of suspense. And i thought that was worth seeing. And then...i realized this was a teen movie disguised as thriller. I don't know what David Morse is doing in such a movie. He really is scary. But that doesn't make his character believable. Why, if he has secret place where he kills and keeps his victims, would he keep one in the vents and kill without close his curtains? For example, there's more stupid stuff... And the girl, the new neighbor, what a hell does she see in such a loser like Kale? I really thought, as they showed the father being killed, that they were connecting Mr Turner to it, but no. So, the accident/murder was there only to fill time.
