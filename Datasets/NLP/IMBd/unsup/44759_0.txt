This movie could be the worst movie ever. I rented it because the cover had Apachi helicopters, and army guys running away from an explosion. After watching the movie I was disappointed because there were no Apachi helicopters, no army guys, and no explosions. Not only is this the worst movie ever, it also has the most misleading cover ever.<br /><br />The main character in the movie who we are supposed to like is a horrible person. He hates his wife, cheats on her, and uses every opportunity to run away and hide behind his wife in the face of danger.<br /><br />Despite the horribleness of this movie I would recommend others to rent or even buy this movie. Watch it with friends and laugh at the crappiness of it. It would be impossible for anyone to ever make a movie that made less sense than this movie. Watch this movie and take pride in the fact that you and your friends could make a better movie in less then twenty minutes.
