This film just feels like one long anti-bush rally, it is quite literally his city-to-city tour with no new revelations or any attempt to even break up the rally footage. There's tonnes of long performances by singers I'm not too familiar with and liking these singers is the only time I can see someone liking this film. After the first 15 minutes you'll see why this film is free. The timing seems convenient too, I was wondering why he held onto this film for a full term but it seems apparent that he's trying to use it to influence the 2008 election. If you're an American voter that's already anti-bush then you may enjoy this but it has 0 entertainment value.
