Charlie Croker (Michael Cane) and the men of imprisoned gang leader Mr. Bridger try to steal 4 million dollar worth of gold from a truck in Turin. We follow their preparation and the heist itself, including the now famous mini coopers. Meanwhile, they have to get the Italian mob off their backs as well.<br /><br />The idea of a heist movie is that you sympathize with the 'crooks', but in this one I didn't. They weren't likable at all. Add the dreadful pace and the silly carchase at the end (with a policecar re-appearing out of nowhere a couple of times, this wasn't an enjoyable movie. Although the coopers really are sweet.<br /><br />4/10, mainly for presence of Caine and sweet cars.
