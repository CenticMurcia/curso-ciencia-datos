This movie is of a flashback to history "genre", but I think it is the first I have seen which runs on three time lines. There is the pregnant woman at the beginning of the film having her fortune read one afternoon in the 1600's, there is the modern day SamJackson doing his violin consulting work over the span of a week, and then there are all times in all the years between. The movie saunters among these three times, like moving between delicacies on your dinner plate, with a taste here taste there, etc. I like how it was put together, and I like the passion running throughout the film. I had to give it a "10", and I hope you do too, since it is so much better than some of the films on the "top 250" list. This deserves to be there.<br /><br />
