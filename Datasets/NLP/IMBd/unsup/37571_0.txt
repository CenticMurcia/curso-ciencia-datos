Despite the incredible premise, this is only slightly amusing. There are a handful of moments where you will laugh out loud, but the storyline fails to hold your interest in between. It's actually a pretty boring movie, and the pacing is very slow.<br /><br />The scene where he receives all his gadgets is very funny and at that point I thought I was gonna have a good time with the movie, but it starts to fall apart pretty quickly after that. Watching Agent 00 fight guys that are three times his size is fun for about 30 minutes, but it quickly becomes predictable and the action scenes have a total lack of tension... In fact, the whole movie lacks tension or urgency. I almost fell asleep twice.<br /><br />I'm actually glad this movie was made and I'm glad I own it. It's one of the most bizarre and silly things you could ever imagine and I'm happy to live in a world where such a crazy thing could exist, but the whole thing just doesn't come together or deliver any entertainment value. It's one of those movies where I would show it to my friends, but I would fast forward to the good parts. I would never actually ask them to endure the entire film.
