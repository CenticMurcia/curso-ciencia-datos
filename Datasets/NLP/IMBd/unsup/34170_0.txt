Rather than disliking this show I'd just say I was kind of disappointed. Being a bit of a fan of the Tudor history I was kind of hoping for an in-depth look at a very complex time in British history, sort of like Ye Olde West Wing. The Tudors could have been a show that dramatically explored what was one of the most intelligent, erudite and politically savvy royal lines this country has ever seen. Instead I felt like I was watching a slightly more sexed up Ye Olde Hollyoakes. As a diversion there's absolutely nothing wrong with that I guess, but we just had Rome, which did it a lot better in my opinion. There's no one thing I dislike about this show, I'm just a little down that it wasn't as "clever" as I thought it could be. Maybe I'm in a minority though. Hollyoakes still runs despite my best efforts so.....
