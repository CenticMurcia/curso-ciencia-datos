Scrapple is a wonderful hippie comedy. Set in 1978,the town of Ajax, Colorado is poised on the edge of turning from a fun-loving hippie community to a yuppie ski resort. While a small time drug dealer is out for the ultimate score, the outcome could mean the end to a way of life, particularly for Scrapple the Pig. The groovy music is by Taj Mahal. Beautifully photographed by Robert Smith and sublimely acted by an ensemble cast, Scrapple sweeps you away to a more innocent time.
