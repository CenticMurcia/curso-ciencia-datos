Before Seth MacFarlane got to where he is now with adult comedies like Family Guy and American Dad, he actually had a job doing kids shows and worked on titles like Johnny Bravo and Dexter's Lab. But in the case of this short, this was a remake of an old short he did years back, which was essentially Family Guy with these two characters, Larry & Steve. So he tried again, but his target audience wasn't adults, it was kids. He took two characters, Larry( essentially Peter, except he's older and not fat) and Steve( essentially Brian, except he's taller and doesn't have any of the adult dilemmas that Brian faces, could mention them but you know what I mean).<br /><br />This was about how Larry met Steve, or by this short's opening, Steve's perspective. Steve is in the dog pound and if he doesn't get taken soon, he'll be put to sleep. Nobody can understand him until a dimwit named Larry comes along and purchases him. Larry takes Steve to his apartment and shows him his room, so far the room has everything Steve could want; light, television, and a bed. Then they break down and it's off to the store, where they try out a lot of high tech stuff that causes a lot of destruction.<br /><br />Out of all the shorts on Cartoon Network's What A Cartoon?! this was one of my personal favorites. Wish they did make a show out of this, although it does seem that MacFarlane was more of a hit with his adult cartoons. Shame, this was pretty good. But don't blame Seth, blame Cartoon Network( I guess...).
