I bought the DVD on sale and did not expect much. I had heard it had flopped when it was released. I thought it would be a long heavy pretentious film but I was mistaken. <br /><br />I found myself liking it. "One from the Heart" is a charming and moving film in a simple way. Maybe audiences expected much more from Francis Ford Coppola, something deeper and more complicated. What we got is a sweet and touching romance about a couple who break up and make up. <br /><br />The leads were a little shaky in the beginning but got warmer as the film went along. I wound up liking them. I thought the second leads were good too. It was nice to see Teri Garr in a sexy part, showing off her body and dance steps. Also, it was cool to see one of Nastssja Kinskis early roles. Maybe because the film bombed the two actresses never became really big in American movies. This film did not have a chance after Coppolas "Apocalyse Now". <br /><br />Give this bright and colourful film a chance. Great photography with nice tunes by Tom Waits!
