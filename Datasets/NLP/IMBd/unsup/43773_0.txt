They describe this movie as a black comedy about a stand-up comic trying to make it as a comic just like his dad did so successfully, however he fails miserably. As I watched it, I was asking myself why I am watching this movie. It is boring, predictable and misses the mark on being entertaining. Oliver Platt's character was not relatable, likable or fascinating. At the end I didn't care how he ended up or any of the characters for that matter. Nothing stood out as amazing, wonderful or even entertaining. Scenes were too long, dialog was boring and the plot line sounds better on paper than it played out to be on film. This movie totally missed the mark - don't watch it.
