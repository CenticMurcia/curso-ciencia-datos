Not much to really rave about in VIOLATION OF THE BITCH. What could have been a relatively interesting storyline about a strange love-triangle, instead turns into an unintelligibly average sexploit film whose only real highlights are a few weak hardcore scenes.<br /><br />A gypsy girl who has recurring rape-nightmares of some nekkid guy on horse, comes to live and work for a rich, secluded, and sex-starved female artist after her previous female employer banishes her under mysterious circumstances. The Nekkid Horse Rider ends up being a real person who has followed Gypsy Girl to Horny Artist's house, and begins a sexual-relationship with both women that will end in tragedy for at least one of the parties involved...<br /><br />VIOLATION OF THE BITCH started off strongly enough, with a bit of a "mystery" element to it, but quickly degenerated into a weak sexploit film. Now, I'm all for sexploit films, and usually plot doesn't necessarily need to be a key-point - but for the kicker to this one is that it introduced several interesting plot-points, and then never followed through with them. Who is Nekkid Horse Rider? What is his history with Gypsy Girl? Why does she call him "Manuel" while he calls himself "Chico"? What really happened between Gypsy Girl and her former employer? I guess I'll have to wait for the 30 year over-due sequel or the Hollywood remake to get these questions answered. Not a horrible film, but the few un-erotic hardcore scenes only help this film so much...4/10
