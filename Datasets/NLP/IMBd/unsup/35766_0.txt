My favourite part of this sequel is when Kiara & Kovu are playing together. Imagine my dismay when their cruel parents separated them. If that wasn't bad enough, suddenly they're grown up and have lost all their charm & personality. The rest of the film seems like a rehash of Lion King & Pocahontas. Apart from "He Lives In You", the soundtrack is terrible. I missed the hyenas. Kovu's siblings weren't half as funny. Zazu wasn't funny at all. I hated Simba. Whenever Disney characters reach adulthood these days they become either obnoxious or just plain boring. (In older films like Bambi & The Fox & the Hound they're not only young for longer, they also grow up to be likeable.) Disney are losing their magic touch. 4/10<br /><br />
