This is a great contender for the best of the worst. People go to investigate a murder and look for treasure on Snape Island. The gore is pretty graphic if you see a decent version of this movie and the atmosphere is very spooky. An island with just a lighthouse and some spooky caves underneath is a great idea and they use the suspense well. I have NO idea why it got banned in Finland. It is a very funny film as well. Loads of mistakes and a stereotypical cornish sailor named Hamp.<br /><br />''SPOILERS''<br /><br />When one of the girls come in and say 'Dinners Ready' with a bunch of plates there is nothing on the plates at all and why does she drop them all just because she can hear what sounds like a flute playing?!<br /><br />A character named Brom breaks every horror movie rule ever...He drinks, Smokes crack, takes bribes, lies, has sex, tries to steal a bunch of treasure until he gets killed!<br /><br />Hamp the sailor doesn't smile throughout the entire movie until near the end and he gets killed.<br /><br />The boat that there sailing to the island looks like its floating way above the water!<br /><br />Robin Askwith trying to be american. Now THATS comedy!
