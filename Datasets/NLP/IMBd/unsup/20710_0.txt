A rare misfire for film director Rob Reiner, this film has very little in the way of story, emotional push & pull and interesting subject matter. Advertised as a "comedy", and even verified as such by the director, this film does not have one semi amusing part in it. The problem is that there are scenes which are meant to be humorous, not in the laugh out loud way, but in the way that little things can make serious situations amusing, but they do not work. This film is about as exciting as watching paint dry- nothing happens, there are no compromises and no one really discovers anything they didn't already know. In one scene Paul Reiser as Willis' agent states that people who have very little leisure time don't want to read about a persons life that they didn't know, and wasn't famous- it seems pointless. In a few words- we don't want to watch it either! The filmmakers should have thought about this, because that's what this film is- pointless. There is some good acting, and it may be true about there being 6 people in the bed - but do we really want to know about it over 90 minutes. A total waste of time, and an incredibly disappointing effort.
