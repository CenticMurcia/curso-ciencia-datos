A virus is killing young girls from 15 to seventeen, right before they die they go through a Near Death Happiness or NDH, if you will then die. Once dead they rise again as zombies The government has commissioned the "Romero re-kill Squad" to dispatch said zombiefied school-girls. There's also illegal re-kill teams to pick up some slack. Sad to say, but this movie didn't really work for me. Satire is more then merely naming something after Georg Romero or having a chainsaw weapon after Bruce Campbell (shouldn't it be 'Ash's Righ Hand' anyway). It also tries to tell us a message. What that message is, who the hell knows. It tries to be a love story between an middle-aged man and a under-aged school girl, this too is misguided and contrived. The gore will keep your attention for maybe 10 minutes at the most before you keep checking your watch wondering when this mis-fire will finally end.<br /><br />My Grade: D+ <br /><br />DVD Extras: Uncut version, other then that just a Theatrical Trailer
