A Murder of Crows was recommended to me by my enthusiastic aunt and so I forced myself to sit through it despite my complete disinterest in it. It was about what I expected.<br /><br />Cuba Gooding Jr. played a lawyer who was disbarred when he decided he really didn't want to defend someone he knew was guilty. This fine upstanding man of high moral standards decides to move to Key West to write a book. But book writing is hard. At this point the movie's been going on for some time and I'm completely bored. Then this old guy comes into his life, and the old guy's kind of interesting, but I immediately detected something was fishy when he said his name was Christopher Marlowe. You would think a educated lawyer like Cuba Gooding Jr.'s character would have picked up on that too. He didn't, though. <br /><br />The old man ends up giving him a 'novel' he wrote, wanting an opinion on the book, and the lawyer is stunned by it. However, the old man mysteriously dies before he can return the book to him, and that's when he does something completely unexpected and decides to publish it as his own. I had to wonder at this point why he had a problem with defending an obviously guilty man just to make money, but doesn't have any problem with plagiarism. <br /><br />Cuba's character then rises to fame and fortune, although I can't imagine what he could have been thinking he would do at this point. You know his publisher would be expecting another book from him. This really wasn't a well though-out plan.<br /><br />Next thing you know he's being arrested, because it turns out all the murders in the book actually happened, ha ha ha.<br /><br />I've never been a big fan of Cuba Gooding Jr. and I wasn't in this movie. I do have to say it did have an interesting story, but I really have nothing else positive to say about it. Eric Stoltz's acting was almost as cheesy as his southern accent, the gratuitous sex scene was just kind of gross, and I never really cared about what was going to happen. The director really failed to draw me in or make me give a hoot about the characters. I would have to say that I would never watch this movie again, or recommend it to anyone, because that would just be mean.
