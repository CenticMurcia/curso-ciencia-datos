The film makers try to go for an early Peter Jackson/Troma vibe here, and fall flat on their faces. I was shocked at how unfunny, unoriginal, poorly acted, poorly shot, poorly written, and poorly directed this film is. I know there was little to no budget for this dud, but I've seen better films at student film shows at our local University. I'm baffled by the press this dog has gotten. It's possible (though highly unlikely) that I just didn't get it. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. I'm asking the dude at the video store for a free rental, and I'm sure he'll give it to me. I'll get Shaun of the Dead again, which is a thousand times better than this turkey.
