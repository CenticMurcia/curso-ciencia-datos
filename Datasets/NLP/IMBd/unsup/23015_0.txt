An EXCELLENT film that touched on every emotion I have within, An American Opera effected me deeply. It opened my eyes to the magnitude the crisis Hurricane Katrina had on animals. This film showed how some can be so compassionate, while others respond in a different way, by being so heartless and thinking that by shooting these innocent animals, the problem will go away. This film was so very informative and REAL, not masked by actors, it showed real people from all over, coming together to make a difference in the lives of animals during a crisis. It showed me that I, myself can made a difference. Thank you, Tom McPhee, for opening my eyes and making me realize that something CAN be done. Because of your film, I will be volunteering my time for disaster relief.
