We just finished watching this.<br /><br />We figured it would bad, but there would probably be some nudity...so why not. (By the way there is next to none and it's not good.) DON'T WATCH THIS MOVIE. This isn't even funny bad. There isn't a plot, it uses clich√©d parts from other movies, the acting is the worst I've ever seen (that kid was way better as Donkey Lips from "Salute your shorts").<br /><br />I'm not sure where it was trying to go. Now I know why I had never heard of it. It should be burned so no other person has the misfortune of wasting minutes of their life that would be better spent doing ANYTHING else.<br /><br />Pure garbage.
