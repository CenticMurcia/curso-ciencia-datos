It would be overestimating this movie to pretend it's the breath of fresh air that horror needed. However, in the saturated universe of slasher films, it is. It's not perfect like many enthusiastic fans claimed it was, but it sure doesn't suck and it's definitely worth a look for everyone who enjoyed the series involving Freddy, Jason and Michael. I personally thought it was a very clever, refreshing and surprisingly inventive slasher film. It makes fun of the genre like Scream did back in the 90s, with all due respect. Overall it's a very entertaining horror movie that can be viewed and appreciated more than once just for the fun of it. In my opinion, there are three underdeveloped aspects that made it fail to be a true masterpiece. First, I wish Robert Englund's character had a bigger part in the movie. Second I'd like to hear more about the mask and its symbolic. Finally the ''slasher act'' should have lasted at least 15 minutes more. Everything else is just perfect. I still strongly recommend Behind The Mask and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. If Scott Glosserman even plans to make a sequel, I'm ready to rock!!
