One of the disadvantages of films no longer having all the credits at the beginning is that you now have to wait till the end for clues that the film in question may suck - the appalling film of "The Saint" a few years ago had Leslie Charteris' name nowhere in sight, and similarly "I Still Know What You Did Last Summer" credits neither Kevin Williamson (writer of the first film) nor Lois Duncan (author of the book that it was based on), although they could both lay claim to having originated certain characters. Perhaps they declined to have anything to do with it on seeing the script by Trey Callaway, who also had a hand in the mercifully short-lived ER-in-space TV show "Mercy Point."<br /><br />And I can't blame them if they did - the first film was no classic but I can see why it was a hit (it did have some real jolts, it was less self-referential than other recent fright flicks, and the pairing of Jennifer Love Hewitt and Sarah Michelle Gellar was a gift to guys everywhere, even if SMG did get killed). But this time it's idiocy all the way, from the title (the most inaccurate title for a sequel since "Rambo III") to the climax featuring the world's only six-shooter that fires eight bullets, while Danny Cannon's direction and John Frizzell's score duke it out to see which is the most OTT (the music wins). And the ending may as well have had the words "Julie James will return in 'I Still Know What You Did Three Summers Ago'" splattered across the screen - it would have been more subtle.<br /><br />Jennifer Esposito is good as the bartender in the karaoke bar, though it's hard not to think "She left 'Spin City' for THIS?" - and at least we were spared Brandy singing over the credits (for those of you who leave before the end, Jennifer Love Hewitt does that job). But basically this is a waste of time for fans of good movies, although the delicious Miss Hewitt is as fanciable as ever (which is why I gave this film 2 out of 10 instead of 1).
