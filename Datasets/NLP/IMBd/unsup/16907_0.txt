I had not seen Dial M for Murder before I watched this film, so I had very few expectations about this film. I felt that the actors did well in the roles that they played, although this is not one of Michael Douglas's best roles (I think one of his better performances was in Romancing the Stone, or Wall Street). Overall this movie was an enjoyable way to pass the time, but not a movie that provokes discussion or debate. I was definitely glad I rented it, rather than paid full price at the theatre.
