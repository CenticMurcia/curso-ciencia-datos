This movie was terribly done, although Paul Giamatti did well in his performance it was not enough to save this film. I watched this movie in a theater packed with other people all excited about this film, however after its showing, more than half were at the box office demanding their money back. We pay money to be entertained in theaters, many were not entertained and therefore received rain-check vouchers. Bottom line,... go rent Sixth Sense.<br /><br />This movie was a tall order to swallow. Shyamalan has let all of his followers down and really has failed the viewing community this time. Please like I said go rent something else or watch Clerks 2!!!!!
