True life stories do not make for good films. Julie Andrews - giving a brilliant performance in Star! - could not redeem a poor script. Other, more recent examples could include films about Vietnam, American presidents, the British royal family.<br /><br />The true life element is uplifting; the film itself is not. Take Nathan Lane's hysteria (and histrionic it was) in The Birdcage, his bitchiness towards Andrews at the Tony Awards, and his bizarre turn in Jeffrey. Multiply by a hundred and you can see why I was irritated beyond measure at some of the turns in the movie.<br /><br />Like Philadelphia, this plays oh-so-safe. The gay men are queens. Finito. Little of the quiet dignity Hurt portrayed in Love and Death on Long Island, or Robin Williams in The Birdcage. Mostly all of them wear make-up, are transvestites or transsexuals. And the straight captain, starts to learn tolerance.<br /><br />Laugh at the prima donnas putting on make-up. Snigger as they fight over a man. Giggle uproariously as they wriggle their asses in a bizarre little dance routine. Guffaw as they stick out their tongues and screech to high heaven. Chuckle as the 'ladies' make it oh so easy to laugh at, rather than with, a gay population.<br /><br />The telling subtitle, 'Are you gay because you're not a real man, or are you gay because you wish you were a woman' (to that effect) is the crux of the movie. There is no honest attempt to examine the range of sexuality and celebrate gay differentness in myriad of colours. Here it's a shrill, high-pitched pink.<br /><br />Thank God for the dignified acting by Hangsopon as the Coach - truly inspired acting, and a pivotal role that raises this film from the depths of total stereotype. Phohklee as Chai and Buranapansit as Wit give good performances. <br /><br />Even two dimensional acting is better than one dimensional acting, and that's the kindest that can be said for most.<br /><br />In all, a really disappointing film.<br /><br />* 1/2 out of 4<br /><br />
