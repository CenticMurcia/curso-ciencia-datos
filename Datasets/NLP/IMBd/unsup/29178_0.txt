Phantom of Liberty challenges our notion of civilized society. Luis Bunuel gives us a series of connected yet individual little movies in one that asks questions like "why not?" or "says who?". He pokes at the little taboos we have, all the formal walls we have put up. Bunuel asks the question of why do we follow traditional social norms when we aren't even sure why they were created? Why can't a man wear butt-less chaps and have his wife whip him in front of complete strangers? Why can't we get some friends together and all defecate around a table? Why can't we love and lust after our elder aunt? Can you give a reason other than saying "because it crazy, weird, disgusting"? Those are all responses to social norms being broken, but their not real answers. This movie takes those ideas and other just as crazy, weird, and disgusting and asks "so?". He takes social norms like the social formalities, sexual taboos, religious authority, and the western justice system and turns them upside-down, just to see what happens. He even plays to audiences expectations and ideas of right and wrong. He makes us all think about our own judgments about aspects of our own life. The result is funny, confusing, and thought provoking; but over all it's crazy, weird, and disgusting. Just the way Bunuel would have wanted it.
