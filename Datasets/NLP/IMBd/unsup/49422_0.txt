Dear Jesus,<br /><br />How could you??? How could you rip-off Claude Mulot's '75 "Le Sexe qui parle" in such a shameful manner, just switching from... "main entrance" to "back door" and think...you could get away with it? I can understand if, at the time you made this movie, perhaps you badly needed to make a quick buck to pay rent and bills but, at least you could try to do it with the style I (and many more) know you are capable of. I know it's "hard-core" but we all know you can do better then this. I can absolutely NOT forgive you for having "thrown" at us (audience), "our" lovely Lina Romay in tasteless and gratuitous gynecological poses and, to make things even worst, let her hide under that horrible wig, which made her look so cheap and vulgar. Where did you leave the atmosphere, the mesmerizing images, the erotic build-up and the style you got us accustomed to? Perhaps you tried to make it funny but, the only time I was able to smile, was when Lina/Lul√∫ spots the "Oscar" statue sitting on top of a piece of furniture and decides quickly to put it...to use. First I thought this was your humorist way to give us your opinion about the "Academy Award" but, most probably, the statue was just found by the Prop-man somewhere in a box and he decided to bring it to the set, thinking that it may somehow fit in the plot.... Sorry Jesus, but this is definitely a NO-NO! I can only give a very merciful 3 out of 10 and, to get the bad taste out of my mouth, I'm going now to watch (again) "Les Avaleuses" or "Doriana Grey" and I hope it will help...
