The animation on this movie was so sub-par it is amazing it even made it to the screen. The movements are stiff and the faces are not very animated. There is no emotion in the faces and they are extremely bland and boring. The characters are all predictable as is the dialog. The main character, Pi, is so badly created he is almost forgettable. I guess the "big stars" offering the voices must have all cringed at the final product because it is embarrassing to watch.<br /><br />The writing is stiff as well and the jokes are for toddlers or little kids.<br /><br />If this was cut up and then shown on Sat. Mornings then it'd be above average, just.<br /><br />This is a rip off of both Finding Nemo and Shark Tale, and a very bad one at that.<br /><br />For the kids only. Young ones at that.
