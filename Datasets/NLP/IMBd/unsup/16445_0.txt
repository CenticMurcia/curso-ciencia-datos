I absolutely loved it (ARC)! The acting, wardrobe, cinematography and everything else in the film was utterly amazing. The film's movement kept me intently watching and guessing. And if that wasn't enough, the final message revealing the plot was beautiful.<br /><br />The character developments - and changes as the film progressed - was unexpected but perfectly understandable. It was highly believable that anyone under these circumstances would behave and change the same way.<br /><br />And, lastly, the way the film used black and white and color, and the meanings thereof, was brilliant. I will see this one over and over again.<br /><br />--- Jay Rossi (The Jay Rossi Project)
