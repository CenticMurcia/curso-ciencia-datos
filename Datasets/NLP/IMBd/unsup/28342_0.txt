i love this film so much it has a great story line and the actors are amazing.it helped that the film had Zack Efron in because he is a talented actor who recently the lead in high school musical i gave this film 10/10 because it was amazing and i dint want 2 blink because i did not want 2 miss a second of it i also thought that the film was heart warming and it made me see a whole new side of Zack's acting skills i no that i cant wait to see him in his new film hairspray because if it is as good as this it will be at the top of the charts the only downside to this film is that Crystal Hunt who plays Jill Overton got 2 kiss Zack i was so Jealous if only i lived in America i would of auditioned for that part but i live in england for now
