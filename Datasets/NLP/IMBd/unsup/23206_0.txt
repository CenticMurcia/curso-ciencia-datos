I watched this recently...oh man. This movie is a disaster. I remember seeing this movie on USA when I was a kid. I thought it was funny then. Unfortunately it stayed back then.<br /><br />There is nothing funny about the movie anymore. I liked Dean Cameron, Bil Dwyer and Will Sasso but seeing this now, there is little to enjoy. <br /><br />This is a cheapie, marred by bad mistakes by the crew. At one point in the movie, you can actually see where the actor's mark is. There is too much ski fodder as well, which actually reinforces the lack of story.<br /><br />There isn't much to redeem this flick. There are a couple of shots of full frontal nudity and partial nudity but you can see that in any number of R-rated movies. Maybe check this out for curiosity's sake but don't expect anything great at all.
