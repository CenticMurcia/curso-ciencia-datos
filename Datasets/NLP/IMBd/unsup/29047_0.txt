"Cowboy Bebop" is one of the best dramas ever made. It's tight -- well-written and smart, with interesting characters and a solid story that unfolds over its 26 episodes. Outstanding direction, acting and music make "Bebop" a classic, exemplifying everything that a good drama should be.<br /><br />The fact that it's animated has probably kept "Bebop" from getting the audience it deserves. If you're one who has avoided it for this reason, think again. Give Session #5, "Ballad of Fallen Angels," a look. You will find yourself pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />
