"One Frightened Night" is the story of an old man who invites his relatives to come to dinner and discuss his will. He tells them that if his granddaughter is found, she will get all of his money, but if she is not, he will divide it amongst the guests. Well, the granddaughter arrives in the nick of time, however, then another young woman shows up claiming to be the granddaughter. When the first young woman is found dead in her bedroom, a classic murder mystery ensues. This is one of the less known murder-mysteries of the 30's, but it is still very good. The plot has twist and turns and interesting characters that will keep you entertained. If you happen to come across this one, I highly recommend this obscure little whodunit gem! <br /><br />Not Rated, but should be suitable for people 10 years old and up
