Perfect! Are there only two fans of this movie? Unbelievable! I think, this is one of Belmondo's greatest act. We can see, that he played in several plays. IN THEATRE!!! The story is usual but it's not a problem! Maybe the 5.4 is for the theatrical scenes. I enjoyed each word of the film. This movie is a glorious victory of the European film. Williams is good. Carrey is great. But drama was born in Europe.( Actually, only a European actor can play this role.) Belmondo is perfect, Laforet is perfect, Marceau is not so perfect but we love her since La Boom. An easy entertainment, you must watch it! And then you'll know it's script by heart. PS: sorry for my "Hungarian English"
