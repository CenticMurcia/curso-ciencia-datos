I first saw this film when my children were so small that they consumed my time and energy and things went in one head and out the other. All these years, all I could remember about it was that it was one of those on my list of Movies to See When Your Kids Let You Have Your Sanity Back. That made it particularly fun to watch again recently. Goldie's character is so beautifully understated. She is just one of us, going about her day, until her life changes. You can relate each step of the way. I loved how the camera caught pieces of the truth that she did not, slowly building suspense. This calm elegance perfectly complements John Heard is at his deliciously evil best. The score works beautifully with the plot. Definitely put this on your jump-off-the-couch list.
