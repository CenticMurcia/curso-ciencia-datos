well i was a pretty big fan of G-unit after Get Rich or die trying. Then Game came out, yea when he came out with G-Unit i was psyched. Imagine a true west coast blood along with G-unit! "that would be the modern day NWA" yea the documentary came strong. it was a true hip-hop classic. Then the massacre came out, i wasn't a big fan of that but I thought okay w/e its mediocre. then came the beef at HOT 97 and 50 tried to make Game look bad, can u believe how he talked about the other members of G-Unit? wow that really showed 50's personality. Anyway 300 bars killed it. 50 tried to put out 300 shots which was junk and didn't personally address any of the beef. Well now Game came out with Stop Snitchin Stop Lyin the DVD/CD. he really showed that he had a connection with the fans, something 50 has lost. I don't think 50 could go out to Wilmington and Brazil and get the same kind of love game was getting in south Jamaica queens. point proved...
