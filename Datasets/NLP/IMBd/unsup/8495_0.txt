Another great addition to the animated series. Haven't seen it in theaters, I decided to rent it. And boy did I enjoy it. Oddly enough it was intended as the series finale, but thankfully it wasn't as later on in that decade we were treated to another series which was also great. It's everything like it's serialized counterpart but a bit more with adult situations and dialog that are by far appropriate for this kind of film. And the end song "I Never Even Told You" performed by Tia Carrere is nicely well done. Aside from being an actress, I never knew she could sing!!! I only wished that the film was longer and more ambitious in it's subject matter and dark violence. Get this along with the animated series and The Dark Knight to really get your Batman fix. I recommend it for all who want to enjoy.
