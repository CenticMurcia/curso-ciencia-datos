Count Dracula comes to an aged Dr. Frankenstein, currently working in a carnival fun house, with a proposition. The bad doctor agrees to manufacture a serum that will satisfy the Counts' need for blood and put into motion the Counts' plan to create an army of the undead. However, trouble is stirred when Jodie, the sister of a singer, Judith Fontaine, goes missing and Judith attempts to find her with the help of some new friends.<br /><br />This may not have been the most dignified swan song for Lon Chaney Jr. (as mute, Igor-like servant Groton) or J. Carrol Naish (as Dr. Frankenstein), but they add some class with their presence. In fact, Chaney elicits just as much sympathy as he ever did in his career. Regina Carrol is sexy as Judith, and a strong lineup of familiar faces also make appearances: Anthony Eisley as love interest Mike, future director Greydon Clark as a man named "Strange", Angelo Rossitto as the barker Grazbo, Russ Tamblyn as biker Rico, Jim Davis as police sergeant Martin, John Goff as another biker, Gary Kent as a lover on a beach, Albert Cole as an unlucky cop, and Forrest J. Ackerman as the ill-fated Dr. Beaumont. Roger Engel, billed here under the supposedly more impressive-sounding Zandor Vorkov, is an unscary, silly, and boring Count Dracula, but at least the massive John Bloom makes for a reasonably impressive Frankenstein monster.<br /><br />The movie itself is mostly just plain amusing. Then again, director Al Adamson and producer Sam Sherman often liked to have their tongues in their cheeks, so it's good that they can just have fun with their material. It's not as if the horror content is particularly scary, although it's not for want of trying. Certain scenes, like the trips through the fun house and the final battle between the Count and the Monster, are quite fun. Adamson certainly liked being up to the challenge of very low budgets and delivers a movie that's pretty much a bunch of amiable nonsense. It's not particularly violent, with not much in the way of gore (it *is* rated PG). It's also certainly a film of its time, with its portrayal of the hippie culture and psychedelic sequences.<br /><br />Overall, it may not exactly be a "good" movie, but Adamson gives it his all and delivers a movie that still has some assets and entertainment value.<br /><br />7/10
