the series just gets better and better.dont want to spoil it for anyone who hasn`t seen it yet but it is the best ending yet. it also leaves some unanswered questions that i hope will be answered in part 5. as i have said in my comments on the rest of the movies i hope pt5 is the final part cos we dont want the best horror series ever going on and on and on. the tall man isn`t exactly 25 years old now is he.it would not be the same if they replaced him with some one else i hope they make part5 the last.
