Francois Ozon's film 'Under The Sand' has a dark, sombre scenario. French couple Marie and Jean have been married for a quarter of century. They take their annual vacation un the south of France. The drama unfolds as they're enjoying a beautiful summer's day at a local beach. While Marie lies down to have a sunbake, Jean, after a reflective glance at the surf, rises, and heads into the surf for a swim. After dozing off, Marie wakes up to find that her husband is not lying beside her. She searches the beach and he is nowhere to be found. He has vanished, her nightmarish ordeal has begun. The best decription I can find for this film is that it charts the intense, oscillating experiences of one woman as she has to face the loss of her husband in a horrible way. Charlotte Rampling's performance as Maris is strong. The whole gamut of experiences are revealed. Even as Marie tries to accept a new lover but struggles, because her husband is still very much with her. This film was dark, even grim, but recommended.
