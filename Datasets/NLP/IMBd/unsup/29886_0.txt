<br /><br />Boy meets girl. There are a mountain of movies that attempt to tell a love story and disappoint and fall flat. JASON'S LYRIC is... unforgettable -- a love movie to enjoy many times.<br /><br />The greatest strength to this love story is the same as the key strength in the world-wide hit LONG VACATION tv series exported from Japan: as the story unfolds the viewer deeply and personally cares about the boy and the girl. The characters become real and we feel as they feel. Intense. Unforgettable.<br /><br />Highly recommended, but keep in mind that there is grit, drugs and depictions of violence in this movie.
