This has got to be the best cartoon network show of all time.<br /><br />The show originally started as a show called grim and evil. But the evil part was soon dropped and became one show following Grim, Bill and Mandy. The show uses gross out humour which is probably the only show of it's kind now next to ren and stimpy. The thing about this show is that it's too dark to be a kids show it literally gets away with murder with it's humour and story lines and just it's plain weirdness like when billy starts to work with cthulu. The show will not be stopped and should hopefully continue for a long time unless they show something really offensive or not suitable for kids TV which i think will be very soon.<br /><br />All in all this show is amazing funny and witty and fast on it's feet and well worth a watch unless you censor your kids from it.
