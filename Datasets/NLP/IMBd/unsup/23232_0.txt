"The Bridge" embodies all the aspects of great movie making with a rare mix of drama, music, a great climax and cinematography miraculously blended to perfection. In today's moving making society where nudity and shallow story lines tend to dominate movie theaters, this short film is a breath of fresh air. This film may be short, but it holds the power to fill the shoes of a full length film. "The Bridge" contains all that is important in a full length film, yet keeps the watcher entertained from beginning until end, with no dull, near pointless moments in between. "The Bridge" is a MUST SEE, both director Richard Raymond and lead actress Andrea Corr produce film-making at its BEST!!! Both actress and director seem in perfect unison in this BRILLIANT, MUST SEE film!!!!!!
