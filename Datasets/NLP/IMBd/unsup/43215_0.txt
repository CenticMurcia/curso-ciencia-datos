Pod People is a chaotic mix of flimsily related plot lines, bad actors, and lame ideas. It seems made to be laughed at-- it produced one of the best Mystery Science Theater episodes. Every scene is loaded with fog, strange people, and a failed attempt at producing a sense of mystery. The only sad part of the movie is that someone actually intended it to be taken seriously. The monster shown in the background during the beginning credits reappears during the end credits and is not seen at any other time during the actual movie. The ending provides no resolution whatsoever, which actually doesn't matter because it's impossible to care about any of the overly stereotyped characters anyway. A scene guaranteed to induce hysterics: Trumpy's telekinetic "fun" with the little boy's toys.
