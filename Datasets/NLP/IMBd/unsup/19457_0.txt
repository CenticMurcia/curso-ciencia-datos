This is a strange movie, but not completely bad . Only the ending is quite usual and poor - but the second part, after the first boring 30-40 minutes, worths the time wasted. I rented it because the presence of John Malkovich, who makes a funny cameo, and watched very perplexed the first part, really too slow and without new glances on the matter. Some moments are quite poetical, others just banal - the music is splendid, even if not clearly listed in the credits. Sometimes it seems old Italian Opera, but with a trivial remake. The actresses aren't equally good, and some stories (there are more) are simply lost in the ongoing of the movie. In certain situation remembers Polansky's "Who?". This may be a good exercise for movie lovers.
