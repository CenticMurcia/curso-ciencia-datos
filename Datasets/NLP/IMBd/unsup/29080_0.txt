This updated, new/old, gender-bending Macbeth mixes the Bard's lines with LiCalsi's text, giving even the Elizabethan-challenged a line on what's happening in Scotland. And England. And Ireland. Witty in a Monty-Python fashion, this one bears more than one watching to catch all the gags and allusions.
