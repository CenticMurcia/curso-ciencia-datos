This show rocked. It had something for everyone, love, hate, lust, magic, good, evil you name it, it was in there. It was the kind of thing that appeals to anyone who watches it, as it had the perfect balance between the supernatural and the natural, with great story lines between each of the characters.<br /><br />Each of the characters were typical sex-driven teenagers, but they were being driven into a world of magic without realising it, and it was done in a painfully addictive way. This said, the adults in the show also played an important part, and without them (Jez, Azazeal etc) the show wouldn't have worked.<br /><br />There's only one thing I don't get: Why did they cancel it?!
