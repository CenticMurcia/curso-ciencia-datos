This is the very first episode of South Park entitled "Cartman Gets An Anal Probe".It has the worst animation in the series because it was made using construction paper...but we never looked at the animation in this show anyway.Nowadays, South Park has plenty of its humor stemming from current events and politics.I like this, I like all episodes of South Park, but its pretty interesting to go back to a time when it was just funny fart jokes with a simplistic plot.In this episode, Cartman recalls a dream he had where he was dragged on a ship and got an anal probe from aliens.However it was not really a dream and the aliens have come to south park.Cartman just thinks the other boys are trying to scare him though.The visitors kidnap Kyle's brother Ike and now they must go find him.With the help of the school cafeteria chef(played by Issac Hayes R.I.P), they get out of school and try to get Kyle's brother back.Meanwhile, officer barbrady has been investigating why the cows are being mutilated.This episode was originally 26min long.You can find this extended version of the episode on the internet.It makes a few changes, such as Cartman having a father and a sister and an introduction to Nurse Gollum(without the fetus on her head).Overall, its the not the best episode but it is pretty funny and good.
