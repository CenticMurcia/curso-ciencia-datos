I have heard of The Secret Garden, it is based on a book and there have been many adaptations of it, but this is probably the greatest, it is a tale about a girl from India who comes to stay at her uncle's mansion and discovers a secret garden and meets a sick child.<br /><br />The acting is quite superb I think that they are all English actors and Maggie Smith is excellent as ever, but the real star is the little girl as she is very good, and the ending is the best I have ever seen, a really happy ending.<br /><br />I am more into my comedy and action films but this is a real feel good film for all the family I gave it 10 out of 10.
