Sean Abley's film "Socket" fails in every respect; the story is flat, pointless, and uninteresting, the acting is remarkably unprofessional, the cinematography reflects a frightening absence of creativity (or even competence), and the director reveals that he has no eye for screen presentation. One wonders how it's possible to expend the time, money, and effort required to create a film, and to then turn an apparently blind eye to the final product. The movie is presented as a gay horror film, so we're treated to pointless sex-oriented nudity, which delivers no heat whatsoever. Indeed, one wonders whether director Abley was more concerned about the film's gay/nudity aspect than its horror aspect. Either way, none of it delivers. These characters give gay people a bad name: boring. The DVD offers a "special feature" section wherein the cast and crew discuss the making of the film. It is pathetic to listen to these people discuss their effort as though they had created something worthwhile. Sorry, this film is terrible.
