One day I was looking up some of the movies that Abbott and Costello made, and I saw that this was one of them, and considering the fact that I am a really huge fan of Abbott and Costello, I decided to see this movie, so I got onto the internet and found this one a website to watch, and so I began to watch this movie. My opinion on this movie is that it is a pretty funny Abbott and Costello movie that I got some laughs out of! This movie I can say is not one of Abbott and Costello's best movies, but it is just a funny film that is a good one that Abbott and Costello managed to make! <br /><br />This movie features the return of one of my all time favorite Abbott and Costello routines, pack and unpack, in which Costello is going back and forth changing his pants while Abbott is trying to make up his mind if they should escape or not. Why doesn't he make up his mind?! Abbott and Costello have some really hysterical comedy routines that really caused me to laugh at! <br /><br />If you really love Abbott and Costello, then you will probably really want to see this movie, because you might like it, but if you are not a fan of the Perfect Straight Man and the Perfect Buffoon, then you will probably not like this movie, but I like Abbott and Costello, and so I did like this movie! <br /><br />8/10
