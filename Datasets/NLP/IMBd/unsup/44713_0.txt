How someone loved ALL of this movie, I cannot comprehend. It started off just strangely and slowly enough to captivate the audience. The middle of the movie was a bit long, drawn out, too self glorifying for words, and excessively contrived. But, I gave it a chance. Me, the most impatient person :)So, I sat there, only made a few snide, whispered remarks and continued to wait for the amazing ending that would bring the whole movie together and make me have at least a lilliputian epiphany. Needless to say, that semi interesting or even minimally boring ending did not come. Instead, the movie that had an amazing understanding of people, their emotions and how they express them, sometimes unwittingly, everywhere they go forgot to actually finish. The movie could have been amazing. The director could have done so much. So much more with it. But they did not, and what a waste. Which is why it is in the movie trash category that all independent movies without the last third go to. Too bad. Watch it, it is worth watching, but know to not expect much out of this sadly massacred film.
