What can I say that hasn't already been said? Michael Jayston is a god. Sorcha Cusack the first Jane I can imagine Rochester falling in love with. Both are at once fascinating and very human and their chemistry is extraordinary.<br /><br />Even minor characters such as Adele, Helen Burns and Mr Briggs are spot on - showing the care that was taken over this production. The direction manages to make Jane and Rochester's lengthy tete-a-tetes interesting - more than it ever did in the 1983 version - and the production values, for the time, are pretty good (a lovely touch - the wisps of smoke Rochester passes through after the fire).<br /><br />I've watched it over five times now and each time find something new in it to like. Only the novel itself has done this to me. Highly recommended.
