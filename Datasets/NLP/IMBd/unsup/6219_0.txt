The beauty of this masterpiece is that it's not only the simple, delightful and true story of middle aged women showing that they have the courage to step out and do something remarkable and ground-breaking, but also they could make it into a huge success. <br /><br />This tale of dedication to a cause illustrates the need by these women to achieve a charitable goal and prove to themselves that they are not `past it'. Brought to us by some of the most seasoned British actors and actresses, under the polished direction of Nigel Cole, it covers every emotion from grief to the joy of success and all are performed with such conviction by the amazing cast. Although Helen Mirren has the largest part, I do not believe that there were any `leads' within the female characters as such and that the support came from the male characters who had to stand by and watch their wives/mothers go from strength to strength in their battle to achieve their aim of producing a calendar for the W.I.<br /><br />A few memorable one-liners, a remarkable cast, a beautiful back-drop and many memorable moments make this film one to watch again and again and again. <br /><br />
