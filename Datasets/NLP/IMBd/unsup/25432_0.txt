This film does have a good message. Racism sucks. Overall, I did not like this movie. The only character (of the main 3) that didn't act like a total jerk at some point is Trevor, played by Mark Webber. I feel he is too good for this movie. Go see his other movies, you won't regret it. I also feel that Trevor was the only character of the main 3 that showed a shred of morality.
