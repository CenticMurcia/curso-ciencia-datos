"Frozen Impact" is typical of many TV movies that deal with the weather. It is a safe film for the family, which is quite an accomplishment these days, but it lacks in other areas. It has the typical plot of a family juggling work, health, and relationship concerns while a fierce hail storm named "Medusa" rolls through town. The hail storm is way overdone, as baseball sized hailstones fall intermittenly on a town in Vermont. The hail is unrealistic. Though the main focus of the movie is the weather, there doesn't seem to be much knowledge about how the weather works among the producers, directors, and writers of this film. I ended up losing patience with the film. But for those eternal optimists, there is a happy ending. I rate this movie 2 out of 10.
