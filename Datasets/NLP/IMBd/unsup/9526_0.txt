Charlie Brown and his little sister Sally are planning to go to Grandmother's place for Thanksgiving dinner but Peppermint Patty invites herself, Marcie, and Franklin to the Browns expecting one themselves. Linus suggests making one before going to Grandma's so Snoopy and Woodstock start getting the table and chairs. As Peppermint Patty and friends arrive, she's disappointed at getting popcorn, toast, pretzels, and jellybeans instead of turkey, mashed potatoes, and pumpkin pie. Marcie apologizes on her friend's behalf before Patty also says she's sorry. Chuck's grandmother then calls and invites everyone over...Another great Peanuts holiday special that's as much a classic as the Great Pumpkin and Christmas one. I especially liked the "Little Birdie" song sung by the late great Peanuts score musician Vince Guaraldi. Snoopy's battle with a lawn chair during this number is the most hilarious scene in the special. As with the Christmas special, Linus recites a wonderful story of Thanksgiving's beginnings with great heart and sincerity. Unfortunately, ABC cut the scene of Snoopy and Woodstock walking to Charlie Brown's house in Pilgrim outfits and the tag of Snoopy and Woodstock pulling the wishbone with the bird falling backwards with the broken wishbone. So my rating of 10 here is based on the original unedited broadcast.
