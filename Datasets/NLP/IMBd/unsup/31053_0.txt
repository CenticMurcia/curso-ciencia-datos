This is just the same Matthew M movie you have seen since the year 2000. New actors and maybe a few new story features. But the same ol' thing once again.<br /><br />I am all for new movies, but the same story lines have got to go.<br /><br />It's very predictable, you can set scene for scene by just looking at the box art.<br /><br />The only thing about this movie that was enjoyable was Michael Douglas. He did a great job and a refreshing twist to these common movies.<br /><br />The movie wasn't terrible. It was cute and nice to look at. If you haven't seen a Matthew M. movie. It will be a nice start for you.<br /><br />If you have nothing better to do and you like chick flicks, give it a try.
