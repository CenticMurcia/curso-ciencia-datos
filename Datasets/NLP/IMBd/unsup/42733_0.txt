What can i really say that hasn't been said about this movie before? This film is a mess. This is a film that is lacking in continuity, plot details, plot points, developed characters, and sense. I hate to say this about a low budget film, especially when i know that the creators are trying, but I couldn't get into this. I could only finish this after twenty separate attempts. Still, I'm a movie lover, and i can find something good about any movie. This film has it's moments. There is a unique fight sequence that takes place in a balloon room that is worth seeing. There's some interesting humor in some exchanges between two of the main characters, and when the film is over, there are some well done credit images. Other than that, unless you're a die-hard montage fan, there won't be much you'll like about this poorly done film. I'm not a big fan of concepts involving child ninjas, but I'm sure a good film can be worked out of it. 3 NINJAS almost worked, i loved the film when I was 2, but it lacked some appeal. POCKET NINJAS just doesn't have any redeeming qualities for most, if not all, viewers. Overall, not worth seeing. It gave me a headache. Hopefully they'll get it right next time.
