Well, let me start off by saying this was the worst movie I have seen in a very long time. My friends and I went to see this movie BECAUSE this movie had been awarded a full zero stars in the Chicago Tribune (and several other places).<br /><br />The good things about this movie, is perhaps that the producers must have spent a lot of money hiring people and buying a lot of clothes. Some of the clothes were sure pretty cool, and if I were a girl, I'd probably wear them. One thing, is that I never understood when the phrase "Brat" ever became a good thing and how a high school teenager hitting on a 11 year old was ever a good thing.<br /><br />The movie included such insensitive material, and the idea is very unoriginal. This is not to mention that the other Bratz movie that came out on the 8th of August now number 1 on the bottom 100 of the IMDb list. I don't understand how the Asian girl, becomes the mathlete/science team superstar; the Latino bratz girl has tons of Latino people in her house all the time, INCLUDING a Mariachi band and she and her mom start singing that very popular song that... "la coucou-ra-cha"... you know what I mean... song. Oh, also the girl who is awarded the scholarship at the end of the movie... because she "needs it"... can afford to go shopping all the time and has a big house as well? I actually only enjoyed it BECAUSE it was so bad, and because some of the scenes in the movie were just so awkward and hilarious. negative 3 stars for being that awful.
