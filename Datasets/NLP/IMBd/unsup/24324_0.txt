I give it a 'D' for Dialogue, which is hackneyed and atrocious, and there isn't a grade low enough for the script. Honestly, I really like the people in this movie, Mary McDonnell especially. But she and they are so much better than this. Mary McDonnell has been in countless movies of better quality. Emmy Rossum was one of the bright spots in "The Day After Tomorrow". James Badge Dale was excellent as Chase in last year's season of "24". Steven Bauer...well, I'm not sure about him. As for "Nola", the idea is good, but the material just isn't there. Seriously, I could see the end of this movie coming an hour before it was over. The young law student rides in on his white horse to save the legal day; Nola herself is put in a sleazy predicament; Leo the reporter breaks the story and, by the way, just happens to be Nola's long lost father; Nola ends up singing for a living; it's all way too predictable. I stuck around out of morbid curiosity; everyone else should spare themselves.
