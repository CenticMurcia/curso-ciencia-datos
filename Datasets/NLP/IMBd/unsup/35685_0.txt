I haven't. It's just a waste of time. From time to time this Mehmet Ali Erbil man comes from nowhere with such stupid movies and takes away all the enthusiasm of the hard working cinema lovers. I definitely hate this man, his movies, and everything about him. Don't try to rationalize his behavior. What he does has no meaningful explanation. He is a very clever man who thinks that we are all stupid. He makes very easy money out of us. He is correct in some way. His narcissistic behavior is encouraged by the Turkish people. I don't believe that anybody at the age of 18 would laugh at him. For the rest he should be avoided.
