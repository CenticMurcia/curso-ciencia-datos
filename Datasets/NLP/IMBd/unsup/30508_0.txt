Billy Chung proves that he has the makings of a good director, even if he can't quite get rid of all the sleaze that tends to appear in his films. DEVIL FACE's plot is a rehash of familiar Hong Kong films in the hitman genre, with nothing of note added.<br /><br />The leads are awkward, the story itself is rather blase, and the only saving grace is Chung's stylish direction. Unfortunately the movie doesn't leave enough room in its storyline for the audience to be involved, and the sleazy elements of the film really overwhelms what could have been a half decent story.<br /><br />Even a minor appearance by personal favorite Suet Lam doesn't help matters. Maybe he knows something we don't, which is why his character doesn't last long.<br /><br />4 out of 10.
