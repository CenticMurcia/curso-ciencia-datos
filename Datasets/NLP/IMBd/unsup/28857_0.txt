Daryl Hannah was much better than Merial Hemmingway as an agent even though they are both good actresses.Doug Savant returns as river guide Grant Carlson, who is on the verge of proposing to his girlfriend Agent Alex McGregor, but it's always a bad timing thing so he doesn't get the chance. A new group of agents work with Alex and they keep receiving death threats against President Jonathan Hayes again played by the gorgeous Gregory Harrison.Brandy Ledford gives a stunning performance as Agent Kelsey, who Alex always pushes around to toughen her up. Two assassins are hired by someone to make a perfect plan on killing the President, but first they intend to lure him to Seattle where they have people on the inside to help kill the President. A very handsome Aaron Grain stars as Evan, one of the assassins. Action packed sequel to First Daughter. I was looking forward on watching this and now I'll wait for the 3rd part! I just keep wondering why there isn't a love interest yet for the President since he did say in the first movie that he is a widower. I thought sparks would fly between him and Alex, but hey no such luck. It would be interesting to see that. This movie was good, but I don't think Daryl Hannah will be in the 3rd movie and it was also interesting to see the President trying to set Alex and Grant up.
