Disney sure does spend alot of money on so called quality childrens programming. Just like Hey Arnold and alot of these poorly drawn cartoons. All they do is just take 3 episodes of the regular cartoon and string em together and call it a movie . you could sit your kids in front of the tv and watch the same thing for free.. they dont improve the animation ,its the same lame stuff as weekday afternoon stuff. doug is a very poor cartoon and the characters dull stupid and idiotic.<br /><br />your kids would do better watching Zoom ...
