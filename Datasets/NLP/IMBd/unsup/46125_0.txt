You all know the story here... The opera of Paris is haunted by a guy (Julian Sands) living in the catacombs underneath it, and he's obsessed with Asia Argento's character.<br /><br />This story has been filmed many times, and I think the world would have been better of without Dario Argento brutally ravaging the wonderful story. One of the most stupid thing he does is to put as much blood and gore into a story that didn't contain any of it in the first place. Towards the end, the violence reaches an almost parodic amount. Don't misunderstand me, I don't find violence offensive or something, but here it was wrong to use, although Argento usually makes gory movies. Also, the whole concept of the Phantom being raised by rats, and having a face without scars was extremely dumb.<br /><br />The cast is another factor to point a finger at. Dario Argento should not have cast his daughter to play such a role, as this seems pretty incestuous. Julian Sands was also terribly misplaced as the Phantom, and didn't fit in at all. Nadia Rinaldi was the only cast-member who was any fun at all. I think I found her character funny, mostly because of her rather disgusting appearances and behavior. The best word to describe the acting is: terrible!<br /><br />Basically every aspect of this movie sucked, and the reason I'm not giving it a 1, is because of the occasionally good sets.
