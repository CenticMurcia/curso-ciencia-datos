I have seen this movie two time thus far. I plan on seeing it a couple more times. I am bringing all of the people that I can possibly get to come. The last show we had 15 people in our group.<br /><br />go to the website and see the trailer and share it with everyone you can.<br /><br />It is an insightful and intelligent documentary that investigates the relation of the Bible and Homosexuality. It is well filmed and has a lot of incredibly moving stories from several Christian families with Gay children.<br /><br />I promise that if you have ever wondered what the Bible Really says about Homosexuality, this movie is a must see.
