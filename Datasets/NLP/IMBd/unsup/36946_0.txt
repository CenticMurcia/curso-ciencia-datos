Jason Biggs, is definitely an emerging star, and he was hilarious! but this movie was horrible. Prinze Jr may be beloved by the women, but to me being a guy, he was nothing special. This had little plot, and was your standard romantic comedy, with an EXTREMELY predictable triumphant "get back together" in the end... So.. to sum this up, if you are a guy, do NOT waste your time with this movie.<br /><br />Also, the preview/trailer for this movie, had Jason Biggs and the 4 chicks when they say "have you ever been with 4 women before?" this was clearly to get guys to watch the movie... BUT this part was not even in the film....
