The film is almost worth it for one scene: A dead woman is to be made a zombie; the ritual goes like this: a dwarf in sunglasses and love-beads, top-hat and tux (over a tie-dye tee-shirt) whips the back of a native girl kneeling before him. She gets sexually excited (although fully dressed) and has orgasm. Then a goat is brought in. The dwarf licks the whip he has been using to beat the girl, and then he takes a tuft of goat hair and licks that. A white guy kisses the dead woman, who comes to "life". Later we find that the girl who has been whipped to death has died as a human sacrifice, although it's not clear how, since the blood on her dead face has nothing to do with the whipping. Maybe it was just the ecstasy, it was too much for her.<br /><br />Oh, Boris Karloff is said to star in this film I think he's on about five minutes of film here, but I may be overestimating; there's also a Karloff stand-in who's too tall, too thin, and otherwise doesn't look anything like him.<br /><br />The rest of the film just sucks.
