Evil's City (2005) is a real bad DTV flick about a creepy old town that a nosy reporter and her crew decides to visit. Nobody seems to know how to get there making the trek a bit difficult. A stranger with a hodge-podge English accent who's a drifter "in these parts" also gives the reporter a cryptic warning about darkness and evil. This doesn't deter the reporter who continues on her mission to find this mysterious town and learn about it's dark past. But will she and her friends like what they finds? Who is this mysterious stranger and why are people in the vicinity so quiet and mum about "Evil's City"?<br /><br />A bad movie that might appeal to survival horror fans and those who enjoy DTV movies. I was just disappointed in the overall execution and script. I wouldn't recommend it but some people might enjoy it.
