This film was absolutely horrible. I rarely write any reviews, but this was the absolutely worse film I have seen in years. It made Mission to Mars look like an epic. The film is just nonsense action followed by nonsense action. None of the characters are ever developed, they try but the actors obviously don't know what they were supposed to be doing, so the audience never figures it out. Certain plot elements like the zombies completely surrounding them just disappear after a while and noone seems to notice. They have the typical problem that bad horror films have of inconsistency. Sometimes, one thing will kill a monster and in a different scene, someone does the same thing to the monster 25 times and it hardly flinches. I guess it was supposed to be a prequel for the video games, but even with that it seemed unfinished at all levels. I was a little tired before going to this film and got myself awake early in the film and watched it. I wish I had just fallen asleep and had some productive time for my 5 bucks.
