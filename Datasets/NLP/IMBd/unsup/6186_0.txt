I saw "Ercole e la regina di Lidia" (called "Hercules Unchained" in the USA) on "Mystery Science Theater 3000". The movie itself is actually quite cool, but "MST3K" makes it even cooler. The movie basically has the muscle-bound - and often well-oiled - Greek hero (Steve Reeves) drinking water of forgetfulness and getting seduced by Queen Omphale (Sylvia Lopez). Mostly, it seems like an excuse to show scantily clad women. I guess that even ancient Greece was a male chauvinistic fantasy! <br /><br />But seriously, the "MST3K" version is the one that you gotta see. You can probably guess what sorts of things Joel, Servo and Crow say. Specifically, they sneak in mentions of Uri Geller, Kim Cattrall and Ricky Nelson. How else to keep sane while watching these cheesy flicks sent by Dr. Forrester and TV's Frank? <br /><br />Yes, you know what Hercules and the queen were doing when not on screen. Seriously, a buff hunk and a hot babe. How could they not do it?
