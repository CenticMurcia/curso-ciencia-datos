This was a pretty sad piece of work. All it is is another vehicle for Bb Drek to show off her tremendous body (and face). The acting is terrible in here and the story is muddled. Frankly, it's not much more than a soft-porn flick.<br /><br />What's disappointing is an actor of Robert Mitchum's status to stoop to this level. Yeah, and he acted poorly, too. If I didn't know it was him, I would have thought it was some amateur thespian. He, and the guy who played the police chief, sounded like they were just reading their lines. Jeff Fahey is the only actor who sounds like he knows (or cares) what he's doing.<br /><br />Derek is nice to ogle in her steamy scenes but this is a horrible movie.
