I found this movie strangely unemotional, and to be honest, I wasn't sure if I was insulted or not. By the end, I didn't care one way or another. As long as I didn't have to listen to that man any longer..Benigni needs an editor on his dialogue. I did enjoy Horst Bucholz's small part, but it was lost in this movie.
