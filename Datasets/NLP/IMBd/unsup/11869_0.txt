My Take: Good special effects make up for a somewhat lackluster storyline. <br /><br />I love watching Ray Harryhausen monster movies, they are really fun to watch. I consider it a gem whenever I find one in a video outlet, an addition to my collection. Harryhausen's effects may be dated to other viewers, but never for me. I mean, for I can see, he started it all. Currently, I have 4 Harryhausen monster flicks. "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms", "Clash of the Titans", and two Sinbad films, "The 7th Voyage of Sinbad" and "Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger".<br /><br />"Sinbad and the Eye of the Tiger" is a weaker entry in the many movies having Harryhausen's stop-motion monsters, but it contains one of the most elaborate collection of fantasy monsters. Well, we get to see a group of bug-eyed ghouls, a near-human baboon (which is actually a cursed prince), a bronze Minaton (also known as Minatour in mythology), a large bee, a gigantic Walrus (one of my favorite of the batch), a club-wielding Troglodyte and a saber-toothed tiger. All pretty well done.<br /><br />But lets go to the bad things about this movie. Well, the story's fine, but the script is lacking and the acting is fair. Patrick Wayne lacks the makings of a great Sinbad. I think that the only good performer is Patrick Troughton as the wise Melanthius.<br /><br />The film is weaker, compared to the fantasy films of this kind, but it is still a wondrous Arabian Nights adventure. Oh yeah, for those who wonder what the Eye of the Tiger is, your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.
