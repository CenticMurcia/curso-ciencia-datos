As stated in the subject, I am so mad that there is no 0 rate on IMDb site. Zombie Diaries proves the film theory that today digital movie making world is affordable to everyone. When I say everyone, I mean people that most probably should stay with another profession. This film is a total proof on that and a total mess! There is no plot, no tension, no continuance ... Nothing. Still, the director tries to steal a little bit from several movie blueprints made in last few decades. Movie is made in Blair Witch Project camera style. However there is more than one camera here and the director gets completely lost in first twenty minutes by mixing them. Then, we have Memento moments of going backwards in one part of the film, also parallel actions without interaction as in David Lynch films and all this cheep mishmash is followed by pale and somehow drunk zombies that look like bad navigated extras on the poor stage. Absolute waste. Don't even bother.
