I liked this movie, despite the dis from the review by that other guy. I like all norm films, and i liked this one. i am angered that someone could write so poorly of this. Any way, I thought it was a funny movie(u want a movie to walk out on, guy? try keeping the faith. Any way, i liked this, and found it to be funny like the rest of mr. mcDonald's movies. but then, i liked Mystery Men. Bye now.
