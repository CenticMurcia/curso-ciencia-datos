This film has great intentions but fails in areas too major to ignore: acting and script. When I saw it at a film festival, the audience repeatedly laughed at the corny lines ("I can't believe I just witnessed that.") and overwrought, one-dimensional acting. The director apparently told his cast to look menacing, and oh, did they look menacing. The actress who played James' girlfriend was so awful that I felt embarrassed for her. Some of the "horror" elements were amateurish and silly, again eliciting uncomfortable giggles. The cinematography is beautiful but often not in sync with the theme (such as a character gliding through golden cornfields). Too bad, because the basic story is fascinating.
