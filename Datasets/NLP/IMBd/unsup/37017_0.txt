This is without a doubt one of the worst damn movies I have ever had the misfortune of seeing. Batman a heroin addict? Batman getting beaten up by some common junkie punk? Batman getting zapped in the testicles w/ a stun gun? Then, to top it all off, batman is beaten, drugged & raped for over a month? What the hell is wrong here?<br /><br />This whole movie revolves around Batman (apparently) sending an innocent man to jail for 5 years. The guy then spends the next 2 years on the street. His motive for revenge is that he was a clean-cut guy on his way to college until Batman wrongfully had him sent to prison- where he was beaten, raped & became a drug addict.<br /><br />After all the villains Bats has faced, a nobody gets the best of him? NO F'N WAY!!! But, in this piece of garbage, that's what happens. The guy shoots himself in the head on front of Batman (why he is upset by this, I have no idea), the next day, Batman is found dead in the Gotham river due to a drug overdose. Of course, it had to have been the Joker along w/ at least 200 other criminals to pull this off- according to the news.<br /><br />After all this crap, Batman's true identity is never revealed. The scum bag just wanted to rape Batman & get him addicted to heroin.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor: Have sex w/ Rosie O'Donnell or drink a gallon of Drano 'cause that would be a helluva lot more entertaining & tolerable than watching this movie
