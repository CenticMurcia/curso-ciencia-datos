I don't know, maybe the rest of the people voting on this movie were looking for an Academy award-winning movie, but my family was just looking for what we saw in the trailer - a good, fun movie. <br /><br />It's easy to beat up on a movie because some things happen in it that don't seem logical, but come on, this is a movie! A story! Let them tell it, sit back and honestly react to it. All I know is my wife, my kids, and I all laughed our butts off watching this movie. We watched it a couple of times and have purchased the DVD.<br /><br />The bottom line is this movie HAS a story and if you actually WATCH all of it the majority of you will laugh at it. Norm Macdonald's other movie `Dirty Work' is good, but NOT worth buying for about $20 - this movie IS worth buying, and therefore is better (in my opinion, better movies are worth buying). In the very least it is worth renting for $2 to see if you want to buy it - if you like Norm Macdonald's style of humor, I think you will like this movie a lot!<br /><br />If, however, you are a stuck-up movie critic wannabe, stay away from this movie - you'll hate it!
