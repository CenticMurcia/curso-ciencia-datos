I read the comments about this movie before I saw it and was afraid I might not like it. One comment said they were disappointed by the ending of the movie. Another said it seamed as if Don Cheadle was thrown in as an afterthought, and Woody Harrellson was too much of a "dummy". However, I was not disappointed in the least bit. I loved the entire movie. It had just the right amount of action, suspense, and even some comedic moments. It is a perfect movie to watch if you just want to relax and be entertained. The only thing I might change about the movie is the frequent make-out moments between Pierce Brosnan and Salma Hayek. Overall - 2 thumbs up!!!
