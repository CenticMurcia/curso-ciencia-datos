If you like beautiful scenes of an old English Castle with huge stain glass windows and lots of antiques along with beautiful gardens and very odd servants running all around, this is the film for you. As the film progressed it reminded me of the "Beast with Five Fingers", starring Peter Lorre in the 1940's. Peter Cushing appeared in the middle of the picture as (Dr. Pope),"Top Secret",'84 and gave a good supporting role. Herbert Lom (Henry Fengriffen),"La Setta",'91, tried to keep very dark and horrible secrets from his new bride, Stephanie Beacham,(Catherine Fengriffen),"Wedding Bell Blues",'96, who on their wedding night went crazy with all kinds of images appearing out of various paintings in the hallway and in her bedroom, which prevented any love making! This is a good film to view only on Halloween along with a few strong apple cider's!
