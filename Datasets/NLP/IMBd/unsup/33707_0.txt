That was the worst movie we have ever seen. And we want our damn money back. My mother says if we got it on bootleg, which we don't get bootlegs, we would've beat up the bootleg man. We excuse Ving Rhames for such a terrible performance because we understand times are hard and he just needed a little extra money. The costumes were horrible, the music was horrible, and the writing was beyond horrible!!!The movie was so bad it was comical. Don't waste your money!!! Don't suffer like we did. The movie was low budget and very apparently so. In the part where Ving Rhames lost his hand you could see his actual hand in the cloth. The movie is almost like Nepolean Dynamite according to my sister, because of the long pointless pauses. You spend half of the movie looking at people look at each other and listen to bad music without any action, at all! So again don't rent it, buy it, or even watch somebody else's movie, its that bad!!!
