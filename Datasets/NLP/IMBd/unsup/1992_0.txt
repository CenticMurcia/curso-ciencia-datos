Admittedly, the plot could be more engaging than the B&C style robberies and shootouts. But was the plot really the plot, or more a vehicle to examine the lives of two men who love each other purely in otherwise twisted and sick lives? Contrary to what you may have heard, that there is very little overt sexuality going on between the leads Nene and Angel. In fact, the only real sex is between men and women. What is going on is a desperate attempt to sustain the relationship in a way crazy existence. And yes, gay men do like honest portrayals of love between two men . . . something you don't very often see.
