I saw this film a few years ago and since then I have been trying too find a worse film. I have not succeeded but even though I have viewed many bad films some of which would of been to bad even for the crew of The Satellite of Love.<br /><br />It would seem that a group of Power Rangers have come down from space and can't fall in water and there's a one eyed dinosaur. I cannot even begin to tell you how bad this is. Its so bad I considered committing suicide with the video box.<br /><br />Please do yourself a favour. DO NOT SEE THIS FILM. It is not worth your sanity.<br /><br />So in conclusion I will tell you again: THIS IS THE WORST FILM EVER MADE!
