Well what can I say about this film, its an utterly gripping mob movie without having to indulge in the grandeur of a scorsese/de niro mob movie. This Flannery gang are white knuckeld hoodlums who would shoot before they even spare a thought, even their own flesh & blood.<br /><br />The true revelation in this film is Gary Oldman-what an actor! I don't know if I've ever seen such a realistically sociopathic performance from another actor in any other film- its chilling you just don't know what he'll do next but one thing you do know is that someone is going to get seriously hurt. Sean penn is excellent as undercover cop noonan and Ed Harris is another revelation as the colder than ice boss.<br /><br />If you like mob movies, crime thrillers, heck just watch this movie. Your in for one hell of a ride.
