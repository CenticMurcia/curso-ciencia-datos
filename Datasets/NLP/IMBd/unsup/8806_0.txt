This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. No, actually this is one of the worst movies ever.<br /><br />Don't watch it. It is terrible. Well, I even don't want to comment it but I think I must warn you. It is the worst martial arts movie ever. The story is terrible. The acting is terrible. Well, I guess you don't need story and acting in that kind of movie. But "Dark Warrior" fails even in the action. The fights... Well, the fights are not exactly the most terrible fights ever but they are not good. The final fight is the worst I have seen.<br /><br />If you want to see some good good story, don't watch this movie. If you want to see good acting, don't watch this movie. If you want some good fights... You know what to do. Don't watch this movie
