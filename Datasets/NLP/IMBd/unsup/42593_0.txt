I saw 'Wounded' ages ago with a few friends! We mainly watched for Machen Amick, who was the lead character. Although the film is low budget and considered B-grade, it had some nice cinematography, but unfortunately the film itself was beyond boredom. From what I remember, the cast did an okay job with Machen Amick, Adrian Pasdar and Graham Greene in their roles- but were nothing special. The characters themselves were dull and stupid, and it was the story however that dragged ever so slowly and became mind-numbingly daft. In fact, we were just waiting for the climax- which was pretty lame and anti-climatic. *1/2 out of *****!
