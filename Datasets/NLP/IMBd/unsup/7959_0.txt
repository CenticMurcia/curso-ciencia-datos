This film is genius. 11 years on this film is still the best Kevin Smith has done. I have countless examples of how universal this film is. Over the years I have found one constant. If you don't get it, you ARE clinically stupid. NO-ONE I have ever given this film to who likes it is stupid. I mean ALL races, ages & sexes. NOT one specific group, NOT geniuses, all types unified by the fact they're intelligent WITH passion & have a heart, because that's what Kevin Smith gets to, your heart. The dialogue, given in moments of calm, sucks you in because of its surrealism, its ability to provoke thought, its reflection of your own experience, and then hits you with some of the most laugh out loud, wet your pants, surreal comedy moments that you just don't expect and have ever seen. You care about the characters& recognise yourself in different ones. Above all the film doesn't make many absolute judgements. A few universal truths, which if are unrecognised mean you need to stop living with mummy&daddy and grow up, but mostly a lot of differing perspectives. The judgement is left to YOU because Smith doesn't patronise you as Hollywood does, you're treated as if your intelligence is respected and present, which is as acutely as I can put it as to why you ARE a pricking moron if you don't get it. If you are the elite of people who finds because of this film you are in the minority, you will then realise how many TRULY stupid people there are in the world. Any critic who slams a Kevin Smith film, well, you can forever ignore any review they give. Pity them, they ARE stupid. If you want to sort out which of your friends are idiots watch this film with them. And if YOU don't get it, well, the kindest I can put it is maybe you NEED to live some more, open your mind and heart a LOT more, then watch it again. PLEASE trust me, when you get it you will be justified in feeling a little smug for you will be stupid no-more.
