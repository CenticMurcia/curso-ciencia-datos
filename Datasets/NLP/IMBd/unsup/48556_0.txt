This is by far the WORST film ever made..... It makes me a little embarrassed to be an Australian. On my 'TOP 10 WORST MOVIES' list,there this film will be, sitting proudly on top. Not only is the acting fifth rate, the special FX crap, and the script a sespool of junk, the direction is absolute garbage! I dont know if anyone knows this, but there are a few actors in this film who are rather big in Australian TV. Lisa McCune..... Harold from Neighbours....... this movie gave me an extremely low opinion of these people that they will never be able to win back. All Australian films aren't this bad, I promise you. Instead of this &%$, check out Moulin Rouge, The Dish, Chopper, Romper Stomper, Dead Calm.....or even Looking For Alibrandi(if desperate). I know i had to, to remind myself ...... IT AINT ALL AS BAD AS THAT!!!!
