<br /><br />This movie, by far, is my favorite romance movie! I watched it with my best friend over the telephone, who is like 1,000 miles away, but we still both cried at the sweetness.<br /><br />This was a typical "loser girl from middle school gets scorn by the school hottie, then gets her revenge" type movie. Not only teens would enjoy it, adults, too!<br /><br />This movie seems likely to happen in reality, in such a big city as Chicago. I just must say, the leading man was dead sexy in it, and if the cute plot and great acting isn't enough to make you go out and rent it, ladies, the guys sure is!<br /><br />This movie made me laugh, cry, and realize that romance needs to be re-introduced to todays men, so boys, take notes, and rent this movie.<br /><br />There are many reasons for every person to see This Time Around. I myself gave it 10 stars. The acting is great, and the characters are so realistic. You have your (brunette) leading lady, accompanied by her best (brunette) friend, and the evil evil (blonde) woman! You see, all parts to a great movie are there!<br /><br />So I say, rent this movie, watch it, comment on it, and give it 10 stars, because I sure did. This movie is pure romance, and cute to boot!<br /><br />
