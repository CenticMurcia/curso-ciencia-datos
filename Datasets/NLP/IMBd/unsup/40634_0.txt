I pray that I am never subject to a film as bad as this one. It had a little potential, but all of it was wasted. It is described by some as a screwball comedy, unfortunately every time they had an opportunity to do the screwball bit, the movie stopped and went in a different direction. I did not laugh during the entire 90 minutes (Thank God it only wasted that much of my life). One is constantly watching the film thinking: "Is the writer, or possibly the director, the dumbest person who ever lived? or Did they ever have to watch it?". After watching 75 minutes of a film that never went anywhere, we were now subject to the worst musical and dance sequences that celluloid has ever been wasted on.<br /><br />We suffer through 15 minutes of choreography that would annoy an 8th grade dance instructor. It has been described as brilliant and unique, it is neither. I imagine many of the practice sessions were better done. I saw that it was the last of the pre-code big budget films, other than being the worst film ever made that is the only thing for which this film will ever be known<br /><br />While watching through the interminably long end sequence, we are supposed to believe that this is a Broadway production, but there are so many inane camera gimmicks, that you know you are not watching something resembling a Broadway production, but something that comes across as a High School production which received a grade of D.<br /><br />The acting in the movie is absolutely horrible. After watching the film, I was tempted to look up all the movies I had given 1's and 2's on before and elevate those votes to 3. This movie is really that HORRIBLE. I had noticed that for a big budget production it received ZERO Oscar nominations when they pretty much nominated every film that was released. I should have saw that as a sign. I caution anyone who has the fortune to read this before they are subjected to this film to watch or rent<br /><br />anything else, even something like Police Academy 8 or Friday the 13th Part X.<br /><br />
