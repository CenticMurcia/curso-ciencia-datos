Once in a while, a television series will come along that is smart, funny, and honest. And then a money-hungry network will cancel it, just when it starts getting the fan support it needs to get ratings. That's just what NBC did last year when it canceled "Freaks and Geeks". What can I say? The show's great, too great to put into words. The late Brandon Tardicoff (I think that's how you spell it) President of NBC, saved Seinfeld when it was in the same situation as F&G: he kept it on the air, even though it was getting low ratings. Then, as praise for the show started to come in, the ratings stared to soar. The rest is history. Too bad he wasn't around when Freaks and Geeks got picked up. At least the show will live on for a while on Fox Family. Kudos to Fox Family for knowing what they had on their hands. ATTENTION STUDIOS: Somebody release this on DVD!! The writers + directors have been saying it will come, but no news yet... Long live Freaks and Geeks!! Where was Tardicoff when we needed him...?
