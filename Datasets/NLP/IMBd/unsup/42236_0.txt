This is essentially Basic Instinct, but worse. The story is lame, Caruso's character is not developed at all, and Fiorentino is a monotonous mope throughout.<br /><br />If you go back and watch Basic Instinct, you will be appalled at how similar the plots are in these two films. A previous user suggested that Ezterhaus was unhappy with the way the film deviated from his script. However, Ezterhaus should still be taken to task for writing yet another movie about a wildly successful and sexually adventurous female psychologist/author that lives in San Francisco and is under investigation for murder.
