This movie is the worst of any low-budget horror movie on this planet. It starts out that William Shatner (?) comes home to find his family worried about the rain storm outside. As they talk about the rain, his father stumbles home as his face starts to melt and he starts mumbling about some book and to give it to this man that is the high priest of some Satanic cult because it righfully belongs to him. His father dies and Shatner goes on a mission to find this priest (which is nonother than the king of low-budget horror flops Earnest Borgnine (sp).) And once he does find the priest he gets caught up in with the group of Satanist without eyes. After his dissapearance, his brother and his brothers wife go out to look for him and soon get caught up in the same mess. The book is nowhere to be found and we sit through hillarious scenes such as Borgnine summoning up Satan and turning into the Devil himself. Which looks to be a nothing more than a goats mask with a black cape. And the ending which is all too unreal as this crystal ball full of old spirits gets thrown down and breaks and then the rain comes down and everybody turns into melting wax dummies. This movie is trash, only watch it if you are bored and want a good laugh and a waste of your money. And by the way..... wheres John Travolta in this movie? As I had seen, this movie was so terrible that there was a limited cast. Unless he was one of the melting Satanist. I give this one a 2!!!
