One Way Passage is wonderful is all respects. However, nothing is mentioned in these comments about it being remade only 8 years later as Till We Meet Again, with Merle Oberon and a wonderful (but I think quite underrated) George Brent. Both pictures are marvelous, and the casting matches each other step by step except for the detective. Warren Hymer (remember him as a dopey bad guy in Destry Rides Again) plays in his usual character, thus enabling Pat O'Brien to tower over him in his role. His performance, to me, tips the scale way over in favor of Till We Meet Again. Both picture are excellent, but I feel the later one, in so many little ways (aside from the pivotal detective role) is just better. It would be interesting to have a role by role comparison between the two--as could be done with Love Affair and An Affair to Remember.
