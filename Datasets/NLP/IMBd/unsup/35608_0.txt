This, by far, is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I actually persuaded my date that it would be better than the current movies that were playing (i.e. Sleepers, First Wives Club, etc.). I mean, come on. Hemingway and Pare. That is a pretty good cast. During the movie, I kept telling my date that it would get better and that the plot would soon develop. How wrong I was. This was one of the crappiest movies ever made.<br /><br />I never knew that is possible for the moon to stay full for extended days on end. Save your money. Don't even dignify this movie by renting it.
