It should almost be mandatory for any Hollywood director to view a film of Todd Solondz before beginning a new project. No director at present can present the honesty that he presented in "Happiness" or the newer "Storytelling". His work, along with Larry Clark's "Kids" are what's missing in Hollywood movies. They don't require million dollar budgets for special effects or name stars demanding twenty million per picture. You start with a genuine script and a bunch of actors who know what they're doing and how to take direction and a cameraman who knows how to show the viewer what needs to be seen. That's the formula. The finished product is a little masterpiece such as "Storytelling". This movie, especially part two, will knock your socks off!
