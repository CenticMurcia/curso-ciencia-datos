I caught 'Arc' at the Indie Gathering Film Festival, and was very impressed. I must say, I'm not at all a fan of hip drug movies, but the depth of the story and superb acting won me over quickly. This film had an emotional truth to it that makes movies like 'Spun' pale in comparison. It is a gripping tale of redemption, without heavy-handed morality.<br /><br />Artistically, it is beautiful. The daytime world is black-and-white with selective spots of color, but the film, in a strange and disturbing way, comes to full color and life at night... much like the world of these shady characters.<br /><br />'Arc' is the ideal of what true independent film should be. Artistic, powerful, and solid, even with limited resources. I'm sure we will be hearing more about it.
