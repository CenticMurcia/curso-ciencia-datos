I hate sequels, but I still watch them in hopes that there will be one that actually is as good or better than the original.<br /><br />Some are ("Star Wars" sequels, James Bond films, "Godfather" films") but ones like "Sister Act II" are not. It's bad all right, but not in any normal sense. This is bad in its own unique way.<br /><br />Whereas the original had a sense, style, clarity and humorous thrust all its own, "Sister Act II" goes on a completely different tangent than the original. It abandons the old neighborhood from the first movie, adds a bunch of characters that are introduced then forgotten, there are no references to the cop (Nunn) that helped out Whoopi in the original and aside from Sister Mary Patrick (Najimy, always good for a laugh), everyone looks bored beyond belief.<br /><br />The sisters are back, there's a lot of music but they had to add a bunch of sitcom kids that would have been more at home on an episode of "Growing Pains" or something produced by Bill Cosby. Even with the palpable talent of Lauryn Hill, singing and acting her heart out, there is little support and little to no laughs.<br /><br />And Whoopi: I guess any "Sister Act" sequel would have to have her in it by design, but she just seems so weary by the whole idea that she wants to scrunch down into her habit and hide from everybody.<br /><br />I can't blame her. And there isn't even a Witness Protection program here to help her.<br /><br />One good line ("We haven't the balls for that!") does not a movie make. And in spite of the high spirits exuded in the END CREDITS (???!?!), it doesn't do too much for a movie that spends its running time taking a nap.<br /><br />"Sister Act II: Back in the Habit". Not a prayer.<br /><br />Two stars. One for seeing the nuns again and that end credit number. I think some contrition is in order here.
