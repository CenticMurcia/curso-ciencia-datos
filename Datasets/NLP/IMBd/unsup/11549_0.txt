We saw this on HBO back in 1984, as high school juniors, one night while high on acid. It blew our minds. I taped it (in crappy 6-hour VHS mode) and still have that copy. I must have seen this thing about a hundred times.<br /><br />Evil nerd genius Menlo Schwartzer is out to get revenge upon the handsome buff surfer boys. He dwells in a crazy sci-fi laboratory beneath the waves out at the surfer beach. Late at night, pot-smoking surfer boys get sucked down, and are forced-fed Buzz Cola, turning them into punk rock surfing zombies.<br /><br />Turns out Buzz Cola is made out of toxic sludge, but has addictive qualities. Two of the surfer boy's fathers manufacture the stuff, and sell it wholesale to Menlo, can you relate?... There's a great scene when one of the kids drinks it, and goes nuts slam dancing around his bedroom to thrash music, nobody can get him under control.<br /><br />There's a hot young love interest, who was once really ugly and nerdy, but Menlo transformed her into a blond bombshell. She likes the surfer boys because they're cute, but Menlo forces her to act as a lure, part of his insidious plot for revenge. You find out why Menlo seeks revenge at the end of the film, and that's a very funny plot twist.<br /><br />This movie makes fun of school, surfers, punks, parents, and the 1980s in general. My favorite part is the Buzz Cola advertising jingle, which you hear at the very beginning before the film actually starts. That song ditty is actually more stupid and obnoxious than the whole rest of the movie put together.
