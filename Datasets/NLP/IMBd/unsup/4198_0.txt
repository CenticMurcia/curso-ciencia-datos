"Dodge City" is Warner Bros.' action star Errol Flynn's attempt at the western genre. He portrays Wade Hatton, an adventurer who settles in Dodge City, Kansas and attempts to clean up the unruly city to make it safe for civilians who find the "cowtown" dangerous. Hatton's main antagonist is Jeff Surrett, a businessman who uses violence to achieve his aims. Hatton is ably assisted by his sidekick, Rusty (Alan Hale), who acts as deputy and backs up Hatton in all his fights, while he is sheriff and before. Wade has a contentious relationship with a woman, played by Olivia deHavilland. At first she does not like Hatton, blaming Wade for the death of her brother on a cattle drive but coming to love him when he shows his courage in opposing the men who make Dodge City a dangerous place to live. This film is directed by Michael Curtiz, one of Warners' top directors and top-billed by Flynn, a major star, bu this is only an average western, so it gets a grade of B-
