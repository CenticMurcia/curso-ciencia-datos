Lucky Break in 2 words would be utter rubbish, it was not funny, in fact it had about 1 jocks worth of laughter and it was just pretty boring. This film doesnt even compare to the likes of other newer british films such as the parole officer which was great fun. Please everybody do not go and see it.
