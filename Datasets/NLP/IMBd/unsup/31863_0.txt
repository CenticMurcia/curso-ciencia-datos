Art of the Devil 2 tries to insert some quality into this horror genre but it mostly falls flat. Uneven and confusing editing, low-budget effects, and the typical (but with slight twist) ending provide for a sometimes dull and ineffective gross out experience with glimmers of sophistication. There are a few flashes of humanity and the voice over is actually some of the best qualities of the movie. But the quality production is missing. The jerky shots and unnatural performances (reflecting the older-style Asian acting) distract from the flow of the movie. The transformation of the teacher during the movie isn't handled smoothly nor sympathetically. The English-dubbed Thai movie makes does not make the transition into American film market easily. The end result is more confusing than clarified terror. The demise of the first of the six students is also strikingly sudden and somehow out of character. At times, the movie does exhibit a terror-filled tense background and their are subtle nice flourishes of horror touches inserted throughout the movie, but they are unable to make up for the rest of the jumble of weaknesses that pervade this movie. Four out of Ten Stars.
