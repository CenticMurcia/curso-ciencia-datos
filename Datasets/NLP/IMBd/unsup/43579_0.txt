I had to watch this film with a horror-obsessed friend for over one-and-half hours and I think I've seen some of the most nauseating scenes in this film recently. A possessed character's bare breasts turned into two hands and attacked her boyfriend -- I will remember that for a long time.<br /><br />The film has no storyline, no good actor (although as far as I can tell, Ben Stiller's wife is in it), no horrifying atmosphere or even a decent screenplay. It only has some innovative (yes, indeed) demonic behavior scenes which fans of such movies like my friend might enjoy. I didn't see the prequel, so cannot compare.
