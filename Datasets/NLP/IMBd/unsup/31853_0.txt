I have been a fan of Lano & Woodley for ages, but I only got to see The Island DVD recently. I absolutely loved it! <br /><br />Its so hard to determine what is planned and what isn't. Eg. Setting the bag on fire?? Which, i think, makes it so brilliant.<br /><br />Each of the comedians get their own chance to shine, Col's definitely having to be his song about falling head over heals in love with himself. Frank has quite a few great lines in this show and i have to give full credit to him for his chicken noises.<br /><br />If you are already a fan of Lano & Woodley then you definitely wont be disappointed. If you haven't seen much of their material before then this would be a great place to start.
