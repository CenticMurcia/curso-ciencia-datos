After winning tickets to the premiere on local radio, I was looking forward to the event, but after reading up on the film's history was sceptical about the film.<br /><br />The plot, while it touches on the original story, sends you off course all the time with poor direction, and what to me, was obviously at best a pretty poor script. The sub-plots tried to grab your attention, but in reality only increased your eagerness for the film to grind to a blundering halt. I don't want to be too harsh on the director, and whilst she could of perhaps done better, the "hollyoaks" style actors are mostly to blame. The lead male (matthew chambers) was no where near strong enough for the part, and, an already "fake" uninteresting side plot involving prince William (matthew Turpin), was made worse by the "prince's" acting. At times it looked like he was reading off an auto cue for direction. The film then, I would only recommend to die hard lady Godiva fans or girls/guys on a awful blind date, as their is a perfectly acceptable excuse for leaving early. Dire! I don't normally comment on film's but I usually check reviews before going and only see "good" ones, so as no one had commented I thought it was only my duty to try and save some peeps some money.<br /><br />I'll give it a 2/10 as I saw a semi naked young lady riding into the premiere on horseback...<br /><br />Thanks for reading, Jason
