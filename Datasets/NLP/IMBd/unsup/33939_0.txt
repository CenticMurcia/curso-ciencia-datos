This movie was in th 27th International Movie Festival in SÃ£o Paulo, (Brazil). It seemed at first it would have a plot. A woman who would buy a baby from a stranger to get money from her boyfriend. But it got lost in nudity, violence and profanity. Besides, poor directing leaves the audience bored if not angry (many scenes have not a steady camera shot, it shakes as the cameraman moves, becoming more difficult to follow). Not that is has anything to follow. There is no plot. Many scenes have no dialog and, when it have, it has no use. Most of the times, it features the leading actor captured smoking cigarettes in different places, where nothing else happens. The characters don't have any personality nor aims. This is really a waste of time.
