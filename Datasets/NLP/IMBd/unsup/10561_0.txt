We saw the film last week at the London Sci-Fi Festival. Didn't know much about it but we wanted to see what Sean Astin had been up to after LOTR. All I can say is that from the opening sequence with it's stunning slowed down camera work, wonderful soundtrack full of strange electronic sounds and Astin's poetic voice over on the nature of time and space we were hooked! I'm surprised to read here that the director David van Eyssen worked on such a small budget but I suppose necessity is the mother of invention as they say. Maybe it helps to restrict the budget and what you have here is an interesting example of something between indie and full blown Hollywood feature that relies on performances, script and directive skill rather than throwing cash at a slim idea to make yet another bland effects fest. I'd call this film a crowd pleaser and everybody seemed pretty excited when they left the theatre which is always a good sign.
