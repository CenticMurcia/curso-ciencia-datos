I dreamed about being chased by dinosaurs every night for weeks! I was five years old at the time (1957) but, what higher praise can you give a movie in this genre? I haven't seen the movie in it's entirety since that memorable night so, my inner child gives it a ten. And high praise to the IMDB Power Search, without which I would not have rediscovered this childhood scarefest. I did not remember the title; my memory had fixed on "Hell's Chimney". Maybe that's a phrase from the movie.
