The Judges make this show horrible and I will not be watching in the future. The one judge x's everybody before they start and then when the other two don't because they want to give the talent at least a chance to perform, he reaches over and x's their buttons for them stopping the talent. He is a joke and needs to be muzzled or this show will not be successful!!! Also why do they X talent and then still send them through?? Do they have a clue??? The judges think people tune in to watch them. No we tune in because we want to see the talent good or bad. Take the x buttons away from them, they don't know how to appropriately use them and the show is very aggravating to watch because of it.
