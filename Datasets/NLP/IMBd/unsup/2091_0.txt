I can remember the first time I saw this movie on television, maybe 30 years ago. I cried like a baby over Candy's dog and then again at the end.<br /><br />Last night I watched the movie again on Turner Classic Movies, for the first time in 30 years, and once again I cried like a baby over Candy's dog and at the end.<br /><br />The dialog in this film is so real. Everyone is a "guy" and you feel like you're watching real men interacting with each other. There isn't a false moment in the whole thing.<br /><br />Lennie is believable, George is believable, and Candy is believable. You can feel their frustration with their current situation, the anguish they feel about how they got to this point, and the elation they feel when imagining their future. All they want is a piece of land they can call their own; that's not too much to ask is it? But things happen; bad things. It's nobody's fault really, but it destroys everything they'e ever wanted. They'll never get that little piece of land, they'll never have anything more than what they have right now, and they'll never be anything better than what they already are.<br /><br />If I live to be a hundred years old, I'll always cry at the end of this movie. Not so much because of what happens, but because of why it happens. As for Candy's dog, I think he and Lennie ended up better off than anyone else.
