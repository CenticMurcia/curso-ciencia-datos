To date, my favorite among Christopher Guest's projects is "Best In Show." I had seen "Waiting for Guffman" which is also good. And I finally got a chance to see "Spinal Tap" directed by Rob Reiner but which features the majority of Guest's ensemble cast. While it was okay, it certainly wasn't all that. "A Mighty Wind" is probably my least favorite though it had its moments.<br /><br />Nonetheless, his stalwart ensemble cast is quite simply flawless and most of the regulars return to make "For Your Consideration" quite a funny send-up.<br /><br />The standout performances here are undoubtedly Catherine O'Hara & Fred Willard. While Catherine is most funny, there are some very tender and very poignant aspects of this performance that really kinda grab you. Fred Willard who plays the jerk reporter, extraordinare to perfection is actually sorely needed here - I could not imagine how the flow of the film might have fared had he not been.<br /><br />Watching the transformation of personalities as a result of an internet RUMOR makes for some delicious fun - the cast appears to be having a blast as well.<br /><br />If you are indeed a fan of Christopher Guest and his projects, this will not disappoint in the least.<br /><br />Definitely recommend!
