My mistake was actually inviting a friend to see this film. I was so embarrased that I wanted to leave after only 30 minutes. This has got to be the worst film of the year. The main source of problems comes from the script and you can tell that from the opening scene in the boardwalk coffee shop. And what's with calling the main bad guy Snake and another bad guy Spyder...? This reeked of first-time filmmaker/film-school reject.<br /><br />We actually watched the whole film and got to witness a truly mediocre performance by DeNiro. Especially his ending breakdown/crying scene in the wharehouse...where's the director to guide the actor. Once again Franchise proves again that they can make a terrible film in just about any country and with any filmmaker. At least this junk was made in the US and brought money to the New York economy.
