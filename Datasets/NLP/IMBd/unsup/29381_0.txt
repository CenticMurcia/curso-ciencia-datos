**POSSIBLE MINOR PLOT SPOILERS** Superstar Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston) is receiving death threats and fears for her life. She hires a high-priced but excellent bodyguard Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner). They hate each other at first but naturally fall in love. <br /><br />Utterly predictable and a real mess. There are so many things wrong with this movie it's hard to know where to start. First off Costner's haircut is terrible! Seriously, it's so bad you look at it in amazement. I realize he did it because Steve McQueen was originally supposed to be in it--but that's still a stupid reason. The script is just lousy--full of terrible lines and the plot really doesn't make a lot of sense. The romantic sequences between Costner and Houston are so horribly written and acted that it's almost embarrassing. Purportedly Houston and Costner got along during the filming but they don't show any sparks on the screen. The acting doesn't help. Costner plays the movie with a blank expression on his face throughout (but that DOES fit his character). Houston is a very beautiful woman and a fantastic singer--but she can't act. A few times I was actually smirking at her terrible attempts at acting. An overblown overdone mess of a movie. Very dull too.<br /><br />Also if you're seeing this for the music don't bother. Houston sings four songs that all became hits (especially "I Will Always Love You") but you never hear the full versions of the songs in the movie! You might hear the beginning and middle but never the whole thing. Despite all this though audiences in 1992 loved it. It was a huge hit and was nominated for two Academy Awards (for the music). So, use your own judgment. Also Debbie Reynolds turns in a pointless cameo.
