Do you remember the times before television when people listened to radio? Of course you don't, you're too young! To be quite honest with you, I don't either.I'm even younger than you are. Woody Allen's Radio Days (1987) is a nostalgic look at those times.Mr Allen isn't seen in this movie, only heard.Seth Green plays in a way the young Woody Allen.Only that his name isn't Woody but Joe.This Jewish boy lives his life in New York under World War II.And listens to radio.The acting work is superb in this movie.Young Seth Green is excellent.Then there are names like Mike Starr (Burglar), Julie Kavner (Mother), Wallace Shawn (Masked Avenger), Dianne Wiest (Bea), Mia Farrow (Sally White), Larry David (Communist Neighbor), Danny Aiello (Rocco), Jeff Daniels (Biff Baxter), Mercedes Ruehl (Ad men), Diane Keaton (New Year's Singer) and William H. Macy (Radio actor).The movie is wonderfully written, by Mr. Allen naturally.This is a walk down the memory lane.A look at the past, at the 1940's, at the radio days.This is funny and sad movie filled with nostalgia, with memories of Woody Allen.At the end when there is the New Year's Eve, Woody says these words as the narrator; "with the passing of each New Year's Eve, those voices do seem to grow dimmer and dimmer."
