I thought this movie was so incredibly good. It touched my heart and I found myself crying through much of it. But I also couldn't pull away from it, I never took my eyes off the screen the entire time the movie was played. It is indescribable. I loved it. Angelina's role was wonderfully played and a better actress couldn't have been chosen. But, Be prepared to have your emotions running in this movie. I believe this film should be a message to all people that this is something they need to be well aware of. Do not see this movie if you are not prepared fully to cry a little bit. It is almost unavoidable because it is so true. I am almost positive it is something you will enjoy watching.
