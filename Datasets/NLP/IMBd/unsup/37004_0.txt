I understand the movie was fan based and the script was written with prior knowledge of the batman comic, cartoon and movie series. The character of batman is highly complex and possibilities to play with are infinite. However, this mortal human being is and immortal character whose sanctity is profaned by killing him on the screen.<br /><br />As mentioned in the above post, he has several instances where guilt from the death of several close partners and family has built up over the years. As the character has been developed by other script writers, we have come to realize that he, after a while, does not blame himself completely for all these deaths. Though they are the reason why some changes have been brought about in his actions; introspection leads to the development of wisdom on account of which he is able to continue fighting crime, even when he is incapacitated by old age.<br /><br />His strength does not lie as much in his physique as it does in his internal character. Years of training cannot have him addicted to a drug. The very concept of this is unimaginable. Rash decisions(heroine) and the usage of several of those tag lines in the beginning is not the Batman developed in detail over the years. Moreover, we saw no use of any gadgets by the dark knight. Gadgets are what bring him at par with his colleagues Superman, Spiderman, etc. They are the reason he cannot get himself into a situation created by an ordinary, off the street criminal.<br /><br />On the whole, credit must be given for the making of a decent short. However, the idea and script are rashly written giving no thought the brilliance of this character developed by writers over this millennium.
