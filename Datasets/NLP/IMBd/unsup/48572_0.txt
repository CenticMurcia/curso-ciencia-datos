This show plays to the lowest common denominator. Pretty much every punchline is a predictable stereotype about gays and lesbians. I'm not sure who told Amenda Bearse that a mullet, in and of itself, is high comedy. Or that a really queenie guy fawning over Madonna constitutes a comedy sketch, but the woman needs a reality check. THis is junk, pure and simple. Believe it or not, gay people like me find all sorts of things funny and interesting and witty...it doesn't always have to be about homosexuality or, well, *sexuality*, at all. How about a show with talented, funny, smart performers? Just being gay is not enough to make someone entertaining.
