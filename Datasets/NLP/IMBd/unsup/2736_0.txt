<br /><br />I had no idea what to expect when I saw this film. Cast of (relative) unknowns and the title doesn't give much away either. But...it's a treat. If you like a film that defies genre, that was made outside the mainstream and asks you to think a little then you could do worse than take a look. On the surface it looks a standard sci-fi thriller, two military officers arrive at a remote arctic station to investigate a distress signal sent by a scientist believed missing and wanted for crimes against humanity. As soon as they arrive the sci-fi trimmings vanish and it becomes an intricate and very human psychological game of cat and mouse. Shot with panache and directed with flair it's a little rough around the edges no doubt as a result of a probably low budget and WARNING! it does contain a healthy dose of male and female nudity. Trinity went to work on me long after I saw it and some of the images achieved on a relatively low budget stick with you long after the titles have faded. If you want an action fest don't bother but if you want to be challenged, surprised and in one particularly poignant moment actually moved then check it out. It's worth 80 mins of anybody's time.
