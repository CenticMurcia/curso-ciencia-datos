I'd heard from a friend that he was offended, but I didn't think this poorly shot movie was worth getting worked up about. A went with a small group of friends, (both gay and straight) and we left before it ended. <br /><br />As for being provocative, well, I thought it was pretty ho hum.<br /><br />It seems as though the writers thought that anything showing gays would stir up interest.<br /><br />I think the IDEA behind it had promise,<br /><br />but maybe with more experienced crew,<br /><br />it might have gone somewhere. <br /><br />The narrator had a great voice, though.
