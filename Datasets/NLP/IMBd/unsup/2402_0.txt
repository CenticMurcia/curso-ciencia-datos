Go see the movie. Bruce Willis and Mos def will latch onto through this crazy ride of corruption and mayhem. The story is gripping and at times heartwarming. The villains are truly evil, and I found myself wanting to kick the snot out of them sometimes.<br /><br />Jack Mosley (Bruce) is a stunning character that is willing to go all the way to do the right thing.<br /><br />Eddie (Mos) is just a guy with a speech impediment that was at the wrong place at the wrong time, and saw the wrong things.<br /><br />Jack and Eddie have to work together to survive the longest 16 blocks ever.<br /><br />See this movie!
