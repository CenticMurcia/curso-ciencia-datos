To us horror fans, Euro-horror is the optimum; Portland's video/DVD store Movie Madness even has a section devoted to it. Unfortunately, "Un delitto poco comune" (called "Phantom of Death" in English) has little to show for itself. The plot involves something about a piano player (Michael York) who unwillingly assumes a different identity and goes around committing murders, but the whole movie is poorly strung together and barely goes anywhere. A particularly bad scene is when Donald Pleasance is telling someone something, and then they cut the scene and he finishes the sentence several minutes later! All in all, there are plenty of cool Italian horror flicks (anything by Mario Bava or Dario Argento is right up there). No need to waste your time on this one.
