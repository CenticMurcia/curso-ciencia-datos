This movie is different in the fact it's about dragons and their rule of man kind.The acting was incredable for this film and the special effects were top of the line. The plot was a lil iffy but thats ok cuase its about human survival and not the dragons.( The dragons were very well done CGI and creature effects) It's a good movie and its very entertaining.
