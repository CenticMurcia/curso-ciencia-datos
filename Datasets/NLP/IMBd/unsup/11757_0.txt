In this film Beethoven meets up with a girl friend named Missy, who belongs to a nice man. Only that this mean lady named Ragina and her boyfriend (who is pretty dumb) Floyd have some ransom on him and take the dog away. But Beethoven goes after her and rescues her. Then the two go out, and eventually get lovey dovy, and at one point Missy has babies. The janitor of Ragina's place informs Ragina of this and she is disgusted when she finds this out and plans to drown the puppies but the janitor tells her that she should sell them, and make a bundle. However, they don't belong to her and the kids take them. In the meantime they hide them from the parents, but have to cut class to take care of them. The mom is the first to know, and says to keep it from the dad, but that night the dad finds out after hearing barking the basement. He very stressed out and non-violent gives in.<br /><br />Eventually, after going away on vacation the bad guys run into the kids, and take the puppies. Do they get them back, is the ? from there.<br /><br />This film also has pretty good quotes. Here's a few....<br /><br />Proper manners: Ragina: Floyd, people in California usually wear a shirt when they answer the door, and they don't talk with their mouth full.<br /><br />Kids trying to leave with the puppies in a box: Ragina: What are you kids doing here? Emily: We are selling candy for our school. Would you like to buy some? Ragina: Oh how nice, how much? Emily: $11 per bar. Ragina: $11. No. Get out of here! They happily do.<br /><br />Distraction to sneak puppies in house: Emily: Dad, where do babies come from? Mr. Newton has hard time explaining to young child.<br /><br />Mr. Newton finds the puppies: Mr. Newton (as each puppy is shown at each 'no'): No! No! No! NO!
