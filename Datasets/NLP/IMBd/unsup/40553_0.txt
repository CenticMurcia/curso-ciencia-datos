Its a typical American feel-good movie which is supposed to be a romantic comedy. The comedy is hard to spot and an hour and a half of predictable romances is just too much. There are no real turns in the plot and you already know the end of the movie within the first half hour. The only good thing about the movie is the feel-good part of it. It does make you relax and feel all romantic, although this is often spoiled by a moment of simple humor. If you're looking for a movie to watch when you're really feeling like simple humor and not too much thinking to do, this is it, else don't do it because you won't survive for an hour and a half.
