Having watched Bunuel's first film: Un Chien Andalou, I was expecting a film of a pretentious, pointless, and angering nature. I couldn't have been more wrong. This a brilliant narrative film, which grips you from the beginning. Throughout the film you will be questioning your own eyes, laughing at events before you and at the same time relaxing, and letting Bunuel's techniques entertain you. Give this film a chance, and you will be rewarded. Having watched it, I am sure you will be thinking about it for months afterwards. The themes and issues it raises are still very much relevant; sexual desire and frustration, the nature of desire, terrorism, the conventions within society that we accept. Bunuel has you questioning what you want in life, and challenges the decisions and feelings that you thought were reliable. Fernando Rey proves to be a reliable and likable protagonist, who guides you through events as he experienced them with the mysterious girl; Conchita.
