I saw Coneheads for the first time on TV last week. So, not having paid for it, and not expecting too much, its reasonable to think that I might not be as critical as I could be. (Drum roll...) I was VERY surprised how damn good it is. When I saw the title come on screen I thought, Jeeze, in 20 minutes I'll be clicking away, but no. Dan and Jane do amazing things to keep their limited characters extremely entertaining. Just about every other bit part, and there's a load of 'em, measures up. Even Sinbad does a nice job as Beldar's first boss. Adam Sandler is on screen for 2 minutes and I am still chuckling at his quirky sleaze-ball office geek. Its a good satire about the hypocrisy and prejudice in our so called Democracy, and on balance, a ridiculously accurate reflection of the diversity and opportunity in modern America. It came on again two days later and I watched it again. I would have rented it. No, seriously....
