In Red Dawn, clearly taking place in 1984, America is invaded by Cubans (allied with Russians). Nuclear weapons are never seen. Neither is acting.<br /><br />The filming/directing is horrendous. In long shots, nothing happens; you just see landscapes or people standing around. There are overlong, boring conversations fit only to be fast-forwarded past. You'd think the movie was worth watching for the actors, but they are so young and inexperienced that they become barely recognizable innocent bystanders in a clueless, unsympathetic story about stupid Americans fighting even stupider foreigners.<br /><br />There were many really good movies made in the '80s, and just as many really bad ones. Guess which category this belongs in.<br /><br />2 out of 10.
