BROOKLYN LOBSTER is a fine little low budget film that boasts a good story (based on fact) written and directed By Kevin Jordan, an excellent low key cast, and enough family love to satisfy just about everybody's need for feel good movies.<br /><br />Giorgio's Lobster Farm has been in the Giorgio family for years and has recently come on hard times: the bank defaulted on the note held by the business and the business faces foreclosure - and even worse, it will be auctioned off, removing it permanently from the family. Frank Giorgio (Danny Aiello) is trying to keep his business alive, neglecting his wife Maureen (Jane Curtin) who is tired of living with the crustaceans, and depending on his daughter Lauren (Marisa Ryan) to be his computer, and trying to convince his son Michael (Daniel Sauli) to return to New York from his home in Seattle to help run the business. Michael's steady girlfriend Kerry (Heather Burns) supports the concept of saving the business but when her family gets involved an incident occurs which damages all concerned. How Frank's close friend Bill Lau (Henry Yuk) and wife Jen (Jo Yang) step into the failing picture builds to a climax that demonstrates how family, love, extended family, friends, and perseverance can heal just about anything! The cast is excellent with Danny Aiello, Jane Curtin and Daniel Sauli especially fine. But the overwhelming result of this little film is a restoration of faith in the human spirit - with a lot of help from family and friends. Grady Harp
