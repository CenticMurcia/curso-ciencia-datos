'The Wizard of Speed and Time' is a wonderful film with a happy ending. The special effects, for the time and technique, are absolutely stunning. If you liked the animation in Nick Park's Wallace and Gromit series, you'll love this film made in 1989. The film shows that it is a low-budget labor of love, and although the fashions and beauty standards are dated, I can't wait for it to come out on DVD (hopefully with lots of behind-the-scenes information and trivia). The character development and plot is suitable for younger audiences, who may not get the in-jokes and broader theme, but will enjoy the visual animation and goofiness on its own merit. I find that this film is one I consistently watch every few years. It is incredibly hard to find a good copy, but well worth the effort.
