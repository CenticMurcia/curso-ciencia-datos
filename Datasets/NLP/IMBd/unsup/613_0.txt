Days Of Our Lives is by far my favorite show, it takes you away from reality and into a world so different or perhaps in some aspects the same and show's you different sides of it. Some story lines may be a little out their like the Salem stalker but most story lines have meaning to them like the Dimera/Brady feud to show real meaning of hatred. Even though sometimes the same storyline can drag on and on and yes it is a bit annoying but it makes you keep on watching and sometimes sitting on the edge of your seat. Days of our lives is something that was not made in one day all episode's of days in my opinion must take hard work and I find every single actor and actress is amazing. Days of our lives get a 10 in my opinion for amazing acting; creative story lines & amazing connections with are world and a different world. If you don't watch Day Of Our Lives I suggest you start now!
