Where did they get the kids from in this movie? I live in LA and all of those fake wannabe black kids would get laughed at acting the way they did in the movie. Even the "cool" black guy was a caricature and every line he had was cringe-worthy.<br /><br />If you are going to make a movie taking place in America at least get real Americans to play the part or at the very least people willing to act like real people in America.<br /><br />The disappointing part is that the movie had potential because of the acting of the mother and father and the overall story was a good one. The script was so poorly written that it made the movie unwatchable and the acting was terrible.<br /><br />And seriously, the main character in the movie is a British black guy who comes to LA to tap dance? You gotta be kidding me.
