This was the worst independent film I've seen since Clerks. That's pretty bad film-making. It was a waste of celluloid and the filmmakers should have burned the negative and collected the insurance--because it doesn't even belong on the American market.<br /><br />Have you ever seen those crappy European movies about lifestyles that you know for a fact doesn't exist in this part of the world? It's kind of like that--but on a larger scale. The content revolves around homosexual behavior among children and old guys--not to mention a boy who screws his sister just about every single day. This was obviously the director's personal wet-dream--turned real.<br /><br />I give this piece of junk a solid two thumbs down. And if I could I'd give the director a big kick to the head.
