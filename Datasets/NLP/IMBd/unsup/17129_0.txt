The director of that movie is a villager living in Kütahya(Turkey)and I'm living in the same city with him.this is his first movie and he recorded that movie with 10.000 USA dollars.<br /><br />All the actors in that movie are the villagers.none of them r actors.But they create a perfect movie... Can u believe it?And that movie was awarded in various festivals in Europe...What a pure and perfect movie...It presents the pure but emotional lives of villagers and two kids...Watch that movie,it is nice.<br /><br />First of the director Ahmet Uluçay creates good sense of vision.We can see the pure but colorful lives of people.
