I don't get what everyone is complaining about. This flick has something for everyone: cute, sweet blond chick (Kate Todd) for the guys; undressed male hunk (Tyler Hoechlin) for the girls; grizzly wins (for the tree huggers); and a really, really stupid bunch of characters (not the cast) for Darwin! <br /><br />It starts with four new high school grads, one maybe the valedictorian, who set out on a summer excursion, but change their planned destination by a vote of three to one. We start thinking maybe this is going to be a parody on blond jokes since the sweetie is the only one for sticking to the plan.<br /><br />But no, off they go to break into a restricted area. Then racing down an unfamiliar curvy, dirt road at 60 mph, the driver hits a bear cub and rams a tree, sticking a limb trough the radiator. Gosh, no water and momma bear is ticked.<br /><br />Two of the crew get busted up by the bear while trying to find water, the initial driver terminally, and the other three scarper in the truck (apparently the radiator is self healing). Then the injured mate (ah, los amigos... is this LA or Manitoba?) decides they can't leave their dead buddy and wrestles with the driver until they wreck.<br /><br />The driver then starts on a 20 klick run (in flip-flops no less) for help, but momma bear has him for porridge. After several other unbelievable misadventures the girl and the male stripper trap the bear in a building and stand around congratulating themselves (the innate blondness finally comes through), until the bear breaks down the door and comes out to eat them.<br /><br />Darwin rules!
