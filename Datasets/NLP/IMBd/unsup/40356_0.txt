I love a lot of Yuzna stuff like "Society", "The Dentist", his final<br /><br />episode in "Necronomicon" was easily the best in the movie, <br /><br />"Progeny" wasn't bad and "Return of the living dead 3" had some<br /><br />good outrageous moments, but this movie...really... it is just<br /><br />astoundingly bad! It's so bad it's almost embarrassing to watch. The acting is<br /><br />terrible,it's sad to see Jeffrey "Re-Animator" Combs in this mess,<br /><br />but probably he couldn't say no to an old pal Like Brian Yuzna.<br /><br />The effects, especially the digital bits, are laughable too. The<br /><br />costumes are rubber costumes that seem to come from a shop<br /><br />that sells cheap Halloween outfits! And worst of all, there is no<br /><br />atmosphere whatsoever. Knowing his previous work I really don't<br /><br />know what to say...it seems as if Yuzna has directed this<br /><br />blindfolded. I know the man has intelligence and a sharp sense of<br /><br />humor (in his grotesque but enjoyable over the top way), but it<br /><br />seems he's lost them completely on this one.
