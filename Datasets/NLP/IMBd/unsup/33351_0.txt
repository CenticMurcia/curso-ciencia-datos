Rocket Power is basically a show about four typical preteens.They are the sports fanatics who love to be better then the others.We got Otto,an airhead who wants to go big.Reggie,who is the smart reporter,but also the surfer girl.Twister is the silly,random jackass of the group and Sam is the super smart kid,who has more book smarts then street smarts.As if I haven't seen this before! Now,I lived in a "ghetto" town in Pennslyvania,so I don't know what life is like in New Jersey or California.but looking,it makes me not want to go.To me,its only showing that people on the coast states are stereotypical idiots who care more about sports and kicking ass,then anything else.I know,it deals with lots of issues,like breaking the rules,being carefree and being kids,but for God's sake,what the hell!? I might be so wrong,because I haven't seen this show in years,but how is this realistic?And what the hell is with the slang?I'm around lots of gangs nowadays,and I've never heard anyone say I've never heard the word "shoobee"or whatever it was.Even when I was at the beach in Maryland,I never heard one surfer kid say that.And what's with he word "lame-o"?Honestly,these kids are like 13 or 15 and they are still using baby ghetto talk.I haven't said "lame-o" since I was like firkin ten! All an all,I hate this show.It's not as good as Nick was making it out to be.If they laid off the weak and stupid slang,and stopping with the stereotypical comments (like all skaters are stupid,all neighbors are creepy pedos,smart kids are losers,older siblings are bullies and all that drama).But again,the point is,this show had lots f potential,but this totally blew up.If I want to see cartoon kids skating,I can watch Scarred or go see some of my friends go skateboarding.
