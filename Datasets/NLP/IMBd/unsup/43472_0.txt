"Scared To Death" is probably best remembered, if indeed it's remembered at all, as Bela Lugosi's only color film. Unfortunately, it was also one of his worst. I had a hard time trying to figure out just what was going on. Was it a mystery or a comedy or an attempt at something in between? Director Christy Cabanne didn't seem to know either. It was ultra low budget and surprisingly filmed in color, odd for low budget poverty row quickies.<br /><br />The "plot" has the murdered Laura Van Ee (Molly Lamont) "recalling" the events leading up to her death through a series of flashbacks. The story takes place in the creepy old mansion of Dr. Josef Van Ee (George Zucco) complete with the standard sliding panels and secret passages.<br /><br />Laura is marries to Van Ee's son Ward (Roland Varno) and she believes that they are plotting to kill her. Slow witted Dectective Bull Raymond (Nat Pendleton) and the love of his life, maid Lilly Beth (Gladys Blake)work for the Van Ees. Arriving on the scene, for no particular reason are a hypnotist Professor Leonido (Lugosi) and his dwarf assistant Indigo (Angelo Rossito). Later, fast talking reporter, Terry Lee (Douglas Fowley) and his ditsy girlfriend Jane Cornell (Joyce Compton) arrive after intercepting an attempted call to police from the house. And not to forget the mysterious green masked figure (Lee Bennet) lurking about the premises.<br /><br />The rest of the film has the principals running around the house accusing each other of one thing or another until we learn the secret of Laura's past and then........................................<br /><br />Had the director been able to decide whether this film would be played as a straight mystery or a comedy, it had the possibility of being an entertaining little film. They managed to line up a pretty good cast of veterans but Cabanne was unable to bring out their talents.<br /><br />Poor old Bela, complete with his Dracula cape and pulled down fedora is way below par. I think he's supposed to be parodying himself but it comes off horribly. I had to feel for George Zucco a talented actor who got stuck in this mess. Nat Pendleton had seen better days but is probably the best thing about this film. Fowley does what he can with the fast talking reporter role.<br /><br />Angelo Rossito had been around since the silents, playing menacing dwarfs but only gets to run around in circles within the house in this one. Stanley Andrews and Stanley Ridges appear briefly as medical examiners.<br /><br />Could have been better....much better. A real stinker.
