This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The DVD should come with a warning label "WARNING: If watched, INDUCE VOMITING!!!" I felt truly let down by Dana Carvey, as I hold him in high regard due to his work in the "Wayne's World" movies. Also the preview for the film had good jokes in it... WHICH WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE FILM!!! I saw the preview and found myself laughing hysterically at some of Dana's remarks and looking forward to seeing the movie (little did I know that such jokes as "the Neapolitan ice-cream" debate would be omitted to make room for crap like the fart jokes involving the ridiculous villain).
