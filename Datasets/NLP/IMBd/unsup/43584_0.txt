This is an excruciatingly bad Sci-Fi film, that's laughably amateurish and cheap, with an extremely dull story, and god awful performances. All the characters are simply awful, and it looks like this was made by a bunch of film fans in someone's back yard, plus This isn't even good in a so bad it's good way. The dialog is wretched,as one of my favorite lines includes "I wonder what Mrs. Murphy's been putting in her chowder", and I thought this was incredibly poorly made and written as well, plus the effects are really laughable. I'm sure the people that made this had a ball filming this, however It's most likely going to be a painful experience for everyone else, and the ending is terrible as well, as it made no sense, plus It was really hard to pay attention because it was so bad, and incredibly dull. I got this in a DVD Horror set called A Taste Of Evil, along with a bunch of other Horror films, and even people who love bad movies will be bored with this one, plus this should be a bottom 100 contender on IMDb. This is an excruciatingly bad Sci-Fi film, that's laughably amateurish and cheap, with an extremely dull story, and god awful performances, and I say Avoid it like the plague, it's not worth the torture. The Directiion is atrocious, one of the worst directing jobs ever. Bill Rebane does an atrocious job here with inept camera work, terrible angles, making everything look cheap and amateurish, and keeping the film extremely dull throughout. The Acting isn't even worth mentioning as it's simply abysmal. Overall avoid it like the plague!. BOMB out of 5
