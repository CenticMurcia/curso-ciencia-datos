I should start by admitting that I find Jennifer Aniston adorable.<br /><br />Vince Vaughn is every fast talking overly-confident friend I've ever known.<br /><br />This film could have been great. It isn't.<br /><br />It is a weak film full of odd underdeveloped (and thus unexplained) side characters and it contains one of the most unsatisfying (and the biggest 'cop-out') endings ever put on film.<br /><br />If I want inadequate, unfunny, unsatisfying and realistic, I'll refer to my own struggling relationships. I don't need to pay Hollywood top dollar to show me that. I can get that for free.<br /><br />It has its hints at humor, but overall? Awful.
