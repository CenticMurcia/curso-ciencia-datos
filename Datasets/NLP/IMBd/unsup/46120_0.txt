I hate to disagree with everyone, but, being a true phantom phan, I have to say that this was a terrible film and a disgraceful misrepresentation of the beautiful story by Gaston Leroux. If they hadn't pretended this was a Phantom of the Opera movie, titled it something else, given our phantom a name, a few minor changes with the plot, I may have liked the film and afterward said "Hey, parts of that kinda reminded me of The Phantom of the Opera."
