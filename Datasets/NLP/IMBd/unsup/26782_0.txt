This movie successfully shows the audience how this "university exam" concept affects high school students' lives dramatically in Turkey. In my opinion the acting performance of all the young actors are great and effective and also the musics chosen for the movie are making the movie more emotional and binds you with the characters of the movie more deeply.<br /><br />I guess the ones who will find a part from their life in this movie are the students. Also in the film we see not only the exam stress that the students are dealing with but also their relationships and mostly disagreements with their parents. In my opinion every parent should watch this movie as well in order to see how their negative attitude can have crucial effects on the child's psychology.<br /><br />"Sinav" is a movie worth seeing for. I'm sure that everyone will enjoy this synthesis of drama and comedy.
