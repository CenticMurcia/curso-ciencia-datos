Another fine example of the accomplished French art of turning daily mundane situations into sheer genius entertainment. With the added bonus of being spoiled with one of Lambert Wilson's brilliant performances. Absolutely fantastic. Excellent script, splendid set, impeccable casting topped of with sublime camera work, lightening & soundtrack. A perfect mix of penchant humour, subtle drama & tantalising coincidences. Just plain top notch French cinema. An absolute masterpiece that qualifies as sin to miss out on. The best word to describe this movie is 'gezellig', a dutch word which unfortunately is notoriously renowned for it's inability to be translated into another language.
