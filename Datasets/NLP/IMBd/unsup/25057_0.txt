I got my screener copy of this movie over the weekend and couldn't wait to check it out. You see, I was pointed in the direction of this movie a couple years ago, while the filming was still going on.<br /><br />The movie tells the story of Zack (Wicks), a billiard store owner torn between his love for his ex-girlfriend, Jen (Stanzione), and the temptations of bachelorhood.<br /><br />To be completely honest, I wasn't sure what to expect. It looked like it had some potential, but I was worried about the story and quite frankly, with indie films, you can weed through a lot of junk to get a few gems.<br /><br />I'm not going to give this a sizzling review, but I did like it a lot. If you like Kevin Smith movies, I think you'll get a kick out of this film. I honestly hadn't paid any attention to the fact that the film makers were influenced so much by Kevin Smith (Dogma, Clerks, Chasing Amy) but it wasn't far into the movie that I noticed a few subtle (and a couple very clear) Kevin Smith film references.<br /><br />In fact, according to the site, Kevin Smith gives it his seal of approval: "Kisses and Caroms is as assured a first film as I've ever seen. Crackling with strong performances, this sexy little day-in-the-lifer is worth your time." - Kevin Smith, Director Clerks, Dogma<br /><br />K&C feels a lot like Clerks, but is still fresh enough to enjoy. I expected less than I got in regards to overall quality and story. Unlike Star Wars Episode I, which didn't live up at all to my expectations, Kisses & Caroms was a pleasant surprise. I'm definitely going to be watching out for more Vince Rocca films, just as I kept the name Kevin Smith in my head after seeing Clerks.
