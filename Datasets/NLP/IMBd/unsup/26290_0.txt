This is probably one of the best movies i have ever seen dealing with the concept of American born desis. Krisha Gopal is an American born Indian who is completely ignorant of his culture, infact he detests it. The profound irony is that his college room 'partners' are also Indian. The movie shows how Krishna, with the help of his roommates, learns about the Indian culture as he falls for an Indian girl. The film combines the cultural heritage of India with the American culture and adds a lot of humor which both indians and americans can appreciate. The cast, though new, do an excellent job carrying out their roles. There should be more movies made like this. Part two should definitely follow.
