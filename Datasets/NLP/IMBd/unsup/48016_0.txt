That's pretty much it, yuck!!!What kind of crap does MTV come up with?Sure, there's your every now and then GREAT show on MTV, but usually there's dumb excuses for entertainment like The Real World aired.<br /><br />Okay, this show is "SUPPOSED" to be about a group of strangers who are brought together in a house for some period of time.(Wow, it sounds entertaining already doesn't it?)<br /><br />This show should've been named-The we will set you up in this house and give you a certain amount of money for everything you do that we tell to World.<br /><br />I mean, this show is "TOTALLY" unbelievable and complete sh*t compared to other decent "ENTERTAINMENT" shows on television.<br /><br />You're probably thinking,"Oh well, it's unbelievable, but it's still great fun to watch, right?".....WRONG!!!!!!<br /><br />I would rather shoot myself in the head than watch another episode of The "REAL" World, because watching this show is actually more painful than that.
