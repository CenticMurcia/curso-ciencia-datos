I imagine the creators knew they were going to have to make some people unhappy when 61 was made. Any movie taking on what has become a personal subject to many is going to unavoidably disappoint a certain portion of its viewers. Even a flat rendering intending to take no sides, point of view, etc., will anger some whose point of view was not given prominence.<br /><br />If not particularly daring, this film offers a nice throwback to melodramatic, episodic films of yesteryear; e.g., THE LOU GEHRIG STORY, the film about Dizzy Dean, etc. Nice touch to bookend 61 with Mark Maguire's breaking of Maris' record. The main emphasis on the overbearing, unfair media coverage was a little overdone. On the other hand, the special effects to create the older ballparks was terrific.<br /><br />Never seen such a great job of matching actors to characters. James bears a strong resemblance to Mantle and Pepper is a dead ringer for Maris! Fun to watch if you've a son who know nothing of the 1961 chase when this viewer, indeed, remembers being told by adults that Mantle, not Maris, should break the record.
