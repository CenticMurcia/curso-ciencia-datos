These two guys are the scum of the earth and obviously Jesus didn't manage to give these two suckers a little bit of dignity,reason and decency. If their message was " Lets watch porn" and "screw sin" I get it.As I am an Atheist I am grateful for such miserable "Christians"; opening our eyes to what religion has become, a device of self-worship, self-indulgence and though being corrupt considering yourself holy. I watched these two stand up comics and I am appalled by their sincere vanity, boasting about the money they earn and gloating in the media attention. It seems their vocabulary only consisted of "porn" and "masturbation". What revolutionary Christians! With their obscenity they scare every normal person.
