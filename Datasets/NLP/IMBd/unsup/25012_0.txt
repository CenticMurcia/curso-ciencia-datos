I can remember seeing this film twice. Once, when it was first released on TV in the late 50s or early 60s; and a second time, in the early 70s. And yet, my memories of it are crystal clear. And it's impact on me as strong as ever. I must admit to being quite surprised to find out that it had actually been nominated for two Academy Awards. Given the racial and political climate of that era, that recognition is remarkable. A wonderful "little" film, that uses strong, clearly drawn characters to tell a powerful story. And not a single computer-generated special effect in sight. Perhaps, the finest "B" picture ever made.
