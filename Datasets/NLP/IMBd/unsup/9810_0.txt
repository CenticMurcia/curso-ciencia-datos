This film has provoked such discussion amongst all of you, just read the comments, that i'm quite impressed. Those of you who blame it on conspiracy theory, are being single minded. I do not believe that the film is totally correct; actually, a lot of it is probably wrong. But only a small bit of correct evidence is not good enough. They have no conclusive evidence, but this helps their case to some extent. If the video tapes from the nearby buildings were just released straight away, then there would be no controversy, as they could have blown the Pentagon attack as a missile out of the water. But it wasn't. Isn't that just slightly strange? If the FDR was uncovered and released to the press, then it would blow their theory out of the water. But it wasn't found. How does a building, which nowadays are constructed so very carefully, free fall due to a fire in the upper segments. I'm not a great physicist, but there's something wrong here. Buildings just don't free fall, seriously. These are some of the more interesting discussion points, and i feel that they really ought to be discussed. One final fact that they have right, is that the Bush government did benefit from the attack. In favour of the sceptics, bombs could have been planted by terrorists, (I do think bombs were planted and went off, buildings don't free fall) and we all know at the moment that a bomb is one of the terrorists greatest weapons.<br /><br />I was disappointed that they took an opinion at the end, as one of the pros of the film was that it just gave evidence, perhaps slightly biased, and no accusations. I liked the film, because it obviously took a long time to put together, and there is an element of mystery. Except the soundtrack, which was corny and unnecessary.
