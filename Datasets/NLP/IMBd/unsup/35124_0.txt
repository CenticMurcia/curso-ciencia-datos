The story is about a fellow who ends up in the wrong place, directed by someone (fatty Arbuckle) who was in the wrong place because he previously was in the wrong place. And the reason to watch it is Lousie Brooks of course. She had already had an amazing rise and fall in the US, then to Europe where she found her greatest roles. Then immediately back here in this meatball, this weedpatch.<br /><br />Its her first talkie. She had been in a Philo Vance mystery that was horrid. (One of the subsequent ones is on my list of films you must see.) Like there, as here, she's charmless, which is darn interesting.<br /><br />She's the same beauty, but its a different eye. This eye isn't looking for the afterglow, the savor of the lingering survey, the woman hidden beneath the woman who pretends she is seductively visible.<br /><br />Wrong place. Its as interesting as being in the right place.<br /><br />Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.
