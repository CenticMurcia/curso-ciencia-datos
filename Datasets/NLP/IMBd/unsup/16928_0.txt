This is a wonderful film. It's a shame it is so difficult to see here in the US. I had to go to great lengths to first obtain a PAL copy from France that has no English subtitles, download a subtitle file online, and then use 3 different programs to rip the DVD, process the video and add subtitles, and then burn it to a DVD I could watch on my TV. But it was worth it. It is fun satire on morals and religion that reminded me a bit of the even more wonderful SIRENS. Given the subject matter and frequent full-frontal nudity both male and female, it is no wonder it has had little or no exposure (no pun intended) here in the puritanical USA. I have to admit, I was mostly interested in this film because of Audrey Tautou. Her screen time is very short, but for about half that time she is nude...and a glorious sight it is too. But I'm glad it turned out to have so much more going for it. Highly recommended... if you can understand French or have the ability to make your own subtitles.
