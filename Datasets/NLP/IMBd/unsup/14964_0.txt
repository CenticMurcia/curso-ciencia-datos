Harrison Ford is THE movie President of the United States in this movie. Action packed heroism keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole movie. Although the mid-air rescue sequence is a little improbable, the remainder of the movie is extremely believable. This is one of the ten most enjoyable movies I've ever seen - and I've watched it at least six times.
