The Black Box is an engaging thriller, which grabs you right from the beginning with a car crash and has all the right plot elements. The problem is, as the other reviewer said, the finale is quite disappointing and leaves many questions unanswered.<br /><br />Following his crash, Arthur Seligman is confronted with a wide variety of fragments from his subconscious and sets out to piece them together. What follows is an unnerving, inventive psychological journey that shares the paranoia and confusion of David Lynch with a suitably gritty, noir-like cinematography.<br /><br />Yet the denouement neatly discards all the mysteries of the film and dismisses the loose ends of the multiple deaths, the police investigation and the questions thrown up from his subconscious.
