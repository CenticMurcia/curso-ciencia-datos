Now I know why Aaron Spelling left Tori out of his will and the reason why her mother is not speaking to her. Tori should be ashamed of her work in this "film." So many flaws, where could I possibly begin? First of all, I don't know one Asst. District Attorney (Tori's character in the movie) who would show up to court sporting cleavage and wearing bright pink and lime clothing. Let alone fake blonde extensions. Can someone give her a believable character, please?!! Secondly, Tori's acting skills in this film leave much to be desired. I kept having 90210 flashbacks when she spoke and laughed in the movie. It was scary. Even a B movie is beyond her acting skills. She should stick to guest appearances on sitcoms that require very little acting and even less camera exposure. One thing surprised me: Dean McDermott is actually pretty good in this movie. However, even Dean's decent acting skills couldn't save the horrible writing, character development, and plot. It was actually quite laughable.
