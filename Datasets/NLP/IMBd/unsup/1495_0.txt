Now, I'm not a horror movie fan or anything, but I see several thrillers a year and this one is by far the best I've seen!<br /><br />The acting is just terrific. Leelee Sobieski and Stellan Skarsgard's best performances to date. It is a some-what normal story (it's not like aliens are invading Earth or there's a haunted mental ward or something).<br /><br />I guess I do have a couple of complaints, though. I couldn't figure out why they wouldn't run away from school or call somebody from a safe phone. But if they did that there wouldn't be much of film. <br /><br />But in several scenes, even though I know what's going to happen I jump every time! The perfect thriller! 9/10
