Sigh. How can zombies ever get respect when losers like Bruno Mattei and morons who get their hands on cameras make crap like this. I thought The Undead was stupid and bad, this is worse. Quite possibly the worst actually since Day of the Dead:Contagium and Zombie Night are right down there in the sewer with this worthless piece of garbage. Oh, did I mention I ABSOLUTELY HATED THIS? No decent acting, a stupid story, terrible camera work. I mean, a blind Ed Wood with a lobotomy would have done a more coherent job! This was just so lame. How do these people get the funding to make these craporama's when there have to be more talented filmmakers out there who can't even get a foot in the door? Amazing. Just a terrible, no-budget film with not an original idea in sight. Sigh... poor zombies. Perhaps one day someone other than George Romero and Jorge Grau will make a decent zombie movie. (And Alejandro De Ossorio).
