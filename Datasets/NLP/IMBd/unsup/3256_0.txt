I remember first seeing this movie at a showing at Rockefeller in Oslo, Norway. I was about 7 years then. I remember how funny all the characters were, and how I loved the cars and the racing action in it. After that I have seen it a lot of times at home with friends and family, but I never got tired of it.<br /><br />Then I watched it again, age 20, thinking this movie would sadly be "one of the childish past", but I was wrong. I laughed, and I got this really good feeling inside me, and I was amazed at the great attention to detail in this movie. There are so many things I didn't catch as a child that I could relate to this time, like the moonshine brewery kit, the moose on the wall with its moving eyes, the living fur, and the incredible "burnt asphalt" speed start of Il-Tempo Gigante. Of course, had this been anything near realistic, the Il-Tempo Gigante would have failed for lacking a streamlined profile and having too much gadgetry on it. But that is not what I see this movie for.<br /><br />It is for me pure escapism to a small village in Norway's mountains filled with all sorts of quirky, funny devices and an excellent array of charming characters. It is among the five best movies I have ever seen, and the best puppet-animated movie yet, and is well overdue a place among the top 250 here on IMDb.<br /><br />10 out of 10. "There is no question about it." -HAL
