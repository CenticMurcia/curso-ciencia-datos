I'm sure this was supposed to be a horror movie, or something like that? But no..it's not a horror movie about vampires...in fact, if you see this movie, you'll probably laugh the entire time, due to bad acting, and really really bad jokes, even Blade can do better cliché jokes. I think the gore parts are the only thing good about this movie, but I guess the director wasn't planning to make a gore movie. But heck, I really don't know what the director was trying to do..and I'm sure he was completely high when he hired those actors, specially Rutge Hauer, for the bloodsucking, Count Dracula. A old hag like that shouldn't have teeth at all. And please...the whole movie is a big cliché, nothing different, even the gore parts are hideous. The only reason I saw the entire movie, was because I wanted to make sure the film was bad until the end. And you better believe it was. Even the fight between the Chinese American priest vampire hero and Dracula, was awful. It looked like a handy cap match.. I'll be sure to lock the memories of this movie, in some dark corner of my brain. <br /><br />Warning: If you really like vampire movies, this one will go to the bottom of your list.
