It is this movie was awsome I mean it's like i'de even watch all the others if it weren't for Jason and the gore. I dont care if it's WAY WAY to unrealistick that he comes back too life after being blown into billions of peaces. The only thing I find stupid ( and it's not even that big a deal) is that you can only see Jason in front of a mirror that kinda bugged me but then at the end when he is reborn it gets much better. And the whole (new line) insider was kinda stupid too. I think the Jason films are much better than the Freddy's anyway. 9/10
