This film ran at least an hour longer than it should have and contained too many dead-end threads that should have been left on the cutting room floor. It was horribly sickly and cheesy and conventional and I am giving it 2 points because it managed to keep me watching till the end despite my almost reaching for the OFF button on a number of occasions.<br /><br />The worst thing about this film however was the pathetic attempts by the Coca Cola company to inveigle itself via a series of WAY TOO visible product placements. I found it disturbing and horrifyingly sickening given the status of the multinational in India since the disdain it has shown for the people of Kerala.
