A ridiculous movie that plays to the '60s-style stereotype that a lesbian is a woman who hasn't found the right man yet, so bides her time with another woman. If she doesn't, heaven forbid, want a man, then she's an evil temptress and must die in the end. Of course, there's the usual batty performance from Sandy Dennis and some interesting imagery with Keir Dullea and the fox. The relationship was almost redeemed when the word 'love' was finally uttered near the end of the film, but it was too little, too late for this dated and cowardly film.
