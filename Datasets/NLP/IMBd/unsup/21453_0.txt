love Coronet guidance films. They're the furthest away from any psychological truth and behavior. Take, for example "Are You Ready For Marriage?" A hilariously overdrawn yarn about 2 kids who want to tie the knot, and go to their Church's family counselor for guidance. The counselor shows them this device, something about psychological distance, that I still can't understand after watching it twice. The counselor then starts explaining how attraction starts, by using this word. "Boing". No explanation on what it means, but I think we all KNOW what it means... Soon, he says that the relationship grows thin, just like the elastic.. "And soon.." He let's go of the elastic. The two kids yell "It's Gone!" "Where did it Go?" Just like their relationship, lol. The acting in this never rises above sub-standard. with special note going to the female actress who plays the part as BORINGLY as possible.
