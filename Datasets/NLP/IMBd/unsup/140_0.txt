Nikita lived in my mind as an action movie with lots of blood, aggression, fear, all kinds of things I'm not very fond of to watch in a cinema. But I have seen this film more than ten years ago and things change and now Nikita is not that cruel movie anymore.<br /><br />I came back to re-watch Nikita after a lecture I heard about spontaneity and creativity. The speaker cited Nikita as an example for spontaneity. He told about the scene when Nikita gets the guns in the red box as a present and is told to kill a man behind her in the restaurant, run out of the room, look for the men's toilet, check the last cabinet and climb out on the small window there with place only for a women of her size to get through; the car is waiting for her for 5 minutes outside. Nikita does as told, shoots, runs, searches, opens the window - but then the windows is walled. And here starts spontaneity - what to do now? In fact, I watched the entire movie to see this scene - wow I learned again something!<br /><br />Otherwise, Nikita is rather a 'sweet action movie' by my standards of today. The storyline is interesting, the playing is OK, just the whole is unpolished and a bit rough to me. However, no question, back then, this movie was the starter for a whole series of story lines and Luc Besson merits credit for his originality. 7/10
