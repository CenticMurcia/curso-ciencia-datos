I've seen many documentries on Vlad Dracula, and even though this movie hits on some real points in the impailer's life I think it is more of a prequil to 1992's "Bram Stoker's Dracula" because it focuses on the love story between him and his queen almost mirroring in 90min the short prologue of Dracula '92.<br /><br />Insted of hindering the show expanding that prologue to 90min makes this movie very enjoyable and worth watching. When I saw it I then watched "Bram Stoker's Dracula" skiping the prologue and it worked well as one movie even though the filming style is different. <br /><br />Maybe Dracula 2000 will make this a good but unofficial trilogy?
