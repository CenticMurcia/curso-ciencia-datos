Resident evil has always been one of my favorite game series and when I heard about this film I just had to see it, so I sat down on my bed and watch it on TV and was like...Awesome! In my opinion when it comes to games like resident evil that have various story lines and many characters, it's kinda boring for a fan of the games to see the same characters and final bosses all over again, but this film has such an original resident evil storyline and original characters that I can easily see this movie fit in with story of the game without compromising the game. Mila Yovovich does a great job in this movie and I was amazed on how well she played that character, and let's not forget Michell Rodriguez which yet again shows us how much of a bad ass chick she can be. The zombies were good and kept me with chills throughout the entire film. These movie is great for both fans and people who have never played the game before and hopefully you'll enjoy the movie as much as I do.
