it's interesting to note that teens, college kids reviewing here - view movies - as nothing more than a 'bunch of stuck together bits'. minds seem unable to think in terms of a integrated 'whole'. <br /><br />cant believe i'm even taking time to write how excruciatingly awful unfunny boring clich√©d this unspeakable thing was, the movie studio allowing him to make it must have been because they wanted to see him<br /><br />as the assistant manager at a taco bell not writing producing movies - that is the only possible explanation<br /><br />with something this bad one must not have many friends to clue you in before it too late 'hey this is bad bad bad' 7th graders on you tube have better writing skills.<br /><br />i'm demanding my rental fee be waived on principle when i sheepishly have to walk this turkey of all turkeys in.<br /><br />i wonder if class action suits might be possible against the studio and producer for foisting this on unsuspecting consumers as a 'comedy'. the supreme court surely would assess this as 'cruel and unusual punishment' even for multiple victim murders. studio dweebs out there - how in the name of creation does something this BAD get produced?! That is what i'd like to know.<br /><br />BTW, the manager at my Blockbuster consented to waive the rental charge..and added she's heard that from EVERYONE.
