Being a musician myself, I hold this movie in such high regard. Music is about what you make of it, not what others want you to make out of it. Vitus is a wonderful film that is linear, magical, and groundbreaking in the musical genre. The film achieves near perfection with a fantastic score and wonderful cinematography. The direction of the Swiss landscape is visually stunning and gorgeous, which make the film hard to look away from. The themes in Vitus such as realism, determination, youth, and wonderment launch the replay value off the charts and make it the perfect feel-good movie. Adding to it's brilliance is the script, which is one of the finest I have ever witnessed. Ultimately, Vitus possesses a quality that most American music films lack which make it a film worth owning, rather than simply renting or borrowing.<br /><br />Vitus is the unsung hero of musical films. He is brought up to constantly improve upon his talent as a piano player until one day, when he decides on his own to take the piano at his own pace. His grandfather proves to be a wonderful source of inspiration and guides Vitus when it comes to understanding the ways of the world.
