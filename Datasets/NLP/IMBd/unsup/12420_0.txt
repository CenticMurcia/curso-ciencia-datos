A movie by Soren Kragh-Jacobsen. The third movie directed according to the principles of Dogma95. A touching story that I particularly liked: about a carreerist who suddenly realizes that his idea of leaving his wretched family behind and starting a new life is wrong, about a hooker who is trying to escape from the harrassing phone calls by an aberrant and their brothers who are also miserable and helpless. As the story develops these people manage to realize that even though they cannot change the harshness of their life, relying on each other's empathy and love can make things easier. As the hooker says at one point (no guarantee on the exact words): "Life is s*** and you will taste it with large spoons every day, but this is not an excuse to hurt the ones who are close to you". The happy ending suggests that there is hope for these people: I would be inclined to believe so...
