Frankly unique film from Full Moon and Charles Band himself features small dolls, a caged female rock band and a villain with a minute head, weird! It is the bizarre touches that make this film so much fun. The female band - though clearly sexy in appearance - are not developed enough as individual characters. They do sing well, their songs rough and crude but fun despite this. Part time actress/part time teacher, Debra Mayer (as Moira) wants Virgil Travis' wealth and spends a lot of the film wearing little clothing and torturing her man (Warren Draper). It's not clear why Virgil has a pinhead but the story is frequently so ridiculous it doesn't really matter (incidently Virgil is played by actor Kristopher Logan, using the name here of Jack Maturin). The 'killer' dolls are new and well designed but budget restricts their role and unlike - say 'Puppet Master' - they are mainly shown looking threatening but not doing much. Likewise Virgil doesn't have any particularly exciting scenes presumably because his small head made these logistically difficult. Phil Fondacaro is in charge of the girl band and his job is to demand particular songs at the request of Virgil, for whom he works. If the girls disobey they get a shock - literally. Well made, exceptionally acted - plot firmly tongue-in-cheek. Quite honestly, brilliant.
