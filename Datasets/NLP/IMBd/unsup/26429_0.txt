The story in this film was simply different and I am sure reached many tender hearts who could share in the feelings of a triangle love which is beyond words. Jeffrey Tishop, (Campbell Scott) is a very powerful successful movie film executive who is married to Elaine Tishop, (Patricia Clarkson) and they have lovely children. There is a young writer who has written a screen play called "The Dying Gaul" and Jeffrey wants to buy the script so he can change the characters in the story. The young man needs the money so he accepts the one million dollars and becomes good friends with Elaine & Jeffrey. From this point on in the picture all the characters in the story become very much deeply involved with each other, almost in a spiritual way. This is a very warm and well produced picture.
