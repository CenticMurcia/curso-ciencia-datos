The tagline here on this IMDb home page makes this sound like a really sweet, nice and enjoyable movie. "A picture as human and heart-filling as the love of a boy for his dog." <br /><br />Hey, I'm a sentimental guy, so that sounded good enough for me to spend a few bucks on the rental about a dozen years ago. Well, I guess I went "barking" up the wrong tree: the movie stunk. But - yes, it was still a "nice" film and I wouldn't knock it for that.<br /><br />What I am knocking it for is having to listen to this (politically-correct) pair of boys (one black, one white) overact for the entire film and moan and groan and weep constantly over the fact that they can't get their dog to hunt. They are trying to make the pooch into a champion and the dog is semi-retarded, or just not into that sort of thing.<br /><br />So.....the kids moan and groan, moan and groan and overact....too much to sit through.
