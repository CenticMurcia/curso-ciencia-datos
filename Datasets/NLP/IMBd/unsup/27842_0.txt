Contrary to some of the reviews on this page, Twin Town is a very good film. It is no Welsh Trainspotting, only marketing people will say that and consequently only the foolish will believe that. It is not even from the makers of Trainspotting as the US marketeers are currently trying to claim. It is a film that is to Wales what Trainspotting is to Scotland but that is really where the similarities end. Twin Town is much more of a comedy, and is much more difficult to understand, particularly if you're not familiar with welsh accents. The plot is nothing new, an ever escalating battle of revenge but it is the location and script which set it apart. Port Talbot is far more depressing a place to live than Glasgow could ever be. The chances of Port Talbot (or even Swansea for that matter) being called a European City of Culture are more remote than the Pope turning out to be Elvis. The Lewis Twins are synonymous with Wales in the 90s, poverty stricken, joyriding drug addicts. And yet there is something lovable about them, something heroic.<br /><br />You can sit back and laugh at this film if you're not welsh, or you could be utterly confused for two hours because unlike Trainspotting, the accents are not toned down for American audiences. However, if you are Welsh, Twin Town will speak to you like no other film you can remember. The ending is a thing of beauty, I only wish Terry the bent copper could have been English.....
