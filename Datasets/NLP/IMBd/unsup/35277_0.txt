Young lovers Michael (Owen Szabo) and Julia (Elizabeth Kell) decide to take a weekend off at a remote lodge, run by the eccentric Henry (Kevin McClatchy). They think it'll be the perfect weekend, until things start to go wrong. Soon they discover that Henry isn't who he says he is, and they find themselves in a struggle to survive.<br /><br />Basically "The Lodge" is just another run-of-the-mill horror flick where you have 1) a desolate location; 2) some good looking young adults; 3) a sub-par story; 4) even more sub-par acting, and 5) the feeling that you don't particularly care who survives. It's easily forgettable, and instantly regrettable.
