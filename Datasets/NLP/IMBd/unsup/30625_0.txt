One of the most emotional 21st Century films to grace Cinema screens! This production is simply awe inspiring. With Will Smith in somewhat of an unusual role than stereotypically seen, this depiction of working class society shows a new dimension to Smith's acting credibility. Every individual specific regarding the film works undoubtedly brilliant. The Genre, Mise-en-scene, Ideologys, Media Language, Representation and Narrative gel comfortably into one emotional tear jerking spectacle. As the narrative progresses and audience follow Chris's life, they are almost drawn into events, surprisingly sharing the pain, laughter and emotional on screen state off screen. A spectacle as good as this is unfortunately rarely seen in the movie industry with concentration focused on cinematography and character rather than other "distracting" aspects of production. A MUST SEE EMOTIONAL Roller-coaster.
