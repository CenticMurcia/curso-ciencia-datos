Probably not the worst film ever, but pretty close. My satalite provided the description 'Various nuclear mutants want to be with the last woman alive in a land before time'. I was expecting a terrible film, hoping at best for a few comical moments, intentional or otherwise, but this "film" has absolutely no redeeming qualities. It didn't even deliver on the promise of nudity or sexual content.<br /><br />I'm not sure if I can articulate how terrible this movie was. For starters I'm pretty sure the whole thing was filmed at one clearing in the woods. Because the 'nuclear mutants' can't speak (or presumably act) the audience is subjected to several long segments devoid of any conversation, filled only with the poorly synthesised music (which I swear at one point becomes 'pop-goes-the-weasel').<br /><br />I should mention that I missed 15-20 min about half-way through the movie when I went to wash the dishes that had been piling up in my sink for about a week. It was actually a much welcome break from 'Dinosaur Hell'. Maybe next time my roommates refuse to do the dishes I'll make them watch a few minutes of this movie.<br /><br />Now if you'll excuse me I have to go re-review a few films, like 'Good Burger' and 'Celtic Pride'. If this movie is a 1 on 10 then those films must deserve 9s or 10s (and prolly Oscar's).
