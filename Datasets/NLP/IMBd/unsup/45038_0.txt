Therein lays the main problem I had with this movie even as a kid. This movie had promise, but turns into mainly a giant rat movie with Bert I. Gordon's main technique the old rear projection monster. I liked his "Empire of the Ants" because it combined that trick with big model ants, but this one is mostly rear projected rats. I liked the wasps and there was a centipede and a giant chicken too, but after the wasps are destroyed there is nothing else but the stupid rats. So basically this one starts out interestingly enough, but degrades to something like another of Gordon's films "The Beginning of the End". How they destroy the rats is a bit stupid too, as doesn't Gordon know what a rat does on a sinking ship? So this one is one that has promise, but fails to deliver. It used to come on television all the time, but you rarely see it these days and seeing how low its score is here, that is probably a good thing.
