I don't know where the uppity reviewers come from but this show had some of the best comedy sketches ever. My personal favorite is the other Sesame Street characters trying to get Bert a date and introducing him to Oscarina at the bar. If someone pays attention to any comedy show, they will find more than half of the sketches are not funny, even the great Monty Python. The NEWZ was at least that funny and almost that irreverent. It was a pleasure to see Brad Sherwood again on TV. It reminder me of how much I liked the NEWZ. Like all the videos on the web about the show. Wish the Sesame Street parodies were on line. Agree that it would be nice to buy a best of DVD. Or even a set.
