The version of this Film that I have is Called "Dark Tales of Japan" Which actually features 5 short horror flicks not 8, and they are all well over 5 minutes long. They include "The Spiderwoman (Kumo Onna) Directed by Yoshihiro Nakamura, "Crevices" (Sukima) Dir by Norio Tsuruta, "The Sacrifice" (Onamakubi) Dir by Koji Shiraishi, Blonde Kwaidan (Kinpatsu Kaidan)-Directed by Takashi Shimizu,& "Presentiment" (Yokan) Dir by Masayuki Ochiai I'm not sure what versions that have in Japan of this, but once again the American title out here is "Dark Tales of Japan. And if you bother to look at the list of directors on this movie, you will see that there are 5, who directed five episodes, so I feel the main review of this film is a bit inaccurate.<br /><br />Either way, all of the films are very low budget, and silly for the most part. I actually found the last episode in this series "Presentiment" (Yokan) to be the best and most interesting. One thing the review does have right is, if you are looking for a genuine Japanese horror flick, look else where, this will only turn you off from the genre. Its almost as if the directors got together just to poke fun at some of these urban legends. Though there are still some scary parts, and a few jolts here and there.
