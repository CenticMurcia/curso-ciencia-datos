There's a proverb in Tamil <br /><br />"Kannal kanbadhum poi. Kaadhal ketpadhum poi" <br /><br />It means, "Things u see with your eyes are illusions. Things you listen with your ears are all lies" <br /><br />This movie is like tat... Impossibly the worst movie...<br /><br />I saw this movie... The tile of the movie is "Godfather"... But, the story has no connection to the title at all... Guess, the director doesn't know the meaning for Godfather...<br /><br />TO ALL TAMIL DIRECTORS... BEFORE TITLING A MOVIE LOOK FOR THE MEANING IN THE DICTIONARY BEFORE DOING SO...
