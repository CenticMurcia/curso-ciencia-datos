This movie rules. Why? Two words, ROSE MCGOWAN!!! This was Roses first major staring rule, and playing a confused and bewildered teen seems right up her alley. The dialogue in the film is striking and highly original, and the visuals are unforgetable. No one can watch this movie and feel comfortable, and that in itself demonstrates the meaning behind this expose on culture, violence and youth.
