Despite some humorous banter and a decent supporting cast, I can't really recommend this movie. The leads aren't very likable and I didn't particularly care if they got together in the end. I certainly didn't like the *way* they got together, with Bette Davis giving up her career to be the supportive wife & luggage-carrier for world-traveler Robert Montgomery.<br /><br />It's depressing to see films like this where strong, intelligent women are brought down so low, forced to beg the men who wronged *them* to take them back. Of course it's always the woman who has to change *her* ways, and turn off her brain. Ugh. Even the minor female characters are regretful spinsters, emphasizing this film's awful message - that all women really want to get married, and having a career is a poor substitute. <br /><br />By the way, I took an instant dislike to Montgomery when I first saw him in "Mr. And Mrs. Smith", and his performance in "June Bride" did nothing to alter my opinion. Did he *always* play a smug, sexist jerk who thinks he's God's gift to women (despite looking like a friggin' frog)? So irritating to watch.
