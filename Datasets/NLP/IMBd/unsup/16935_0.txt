The Planet is an interesting summary of today's environmental problem, covering such topics as global warming, but also less well known topics (albeit still very important) such as resource exploitation and waste management.<br /><br />Unlike An Inconvenient Truth this movie is based on many interviews with various experts in the fields shown in the movie. Between the interviews we are shown interesting footage of the topic discussed, for example on resource exploitation you might see modern agriculture at work. The mood of the movie is also set by rather dramatic music, which clearly emphases that these issues are important and have to be taken seriously.<br /><br />The movie is not only about experts telling us about the situation today, but you also get to see "normal" people that have an opinion about the subjects in the movie, like the Chinese businessman and his take on resource exploitation as well as global warming or why not the workers from waste centers in Nigeria.<br /><br />All in all this movie covers many interesting topics in a dramatical way. This dramatical tone is also what drags the movie down somewhat, as it can be too intense and too much to swallow, particularly if the topic's are new to you. Compared to Gore's An Inconvenient Truth the tone here is a lot darker and intense.<br /><br />8/10 + great and interesting info, educational - a bit too dramatic and intense
