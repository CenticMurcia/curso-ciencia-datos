"Phantasm" is a film that defined a generation of horror films to come. Don Coscarelli's vision, while implemented in a low-budget and thus low-key fashion, has proven to be a major influence on horror films of the '80s and '90s. The plot is original, the acting acceptable, the special effects teetering on the cheesy, yet still utterly entertaining, this film is a must-see for any true horror movie fan. The Spheres of "Phantasm" are one of the most memorable icons of the genre, and the "Tall Man" one of its most intriguing characters. The underappreciated sequel, "Phantasm II", as well as numbers III and IV serve to flesh out this masterpiece of horror. "Phantasm" is a B-movie classic, in the real of flicks such as the original "Nightmare on Elm Street" and the first "Friday the 13th".
