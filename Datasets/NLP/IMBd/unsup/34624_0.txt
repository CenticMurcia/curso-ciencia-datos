I am eternally grateful to the people who wrote scathing reviews of The Pirates of Treasure Island--it allowed my son and I to actually enjoy it and not want our $4.99 back. I rented it thinking it was another version of the Stevenson classic (also, Pirates of the Caribbean was not available). Had I simply turned it on, I probably would have sent the remote through the screen. The acting is absolutely atrocious--it is almost as if the "actors" are TRYING to come across as being annoyingly amateur. Like others, however, I did enjoy Lance Hendriksen as Long John Silver, although his infamous handicap is conspicuously missing. The sci-fi inclusions are cute, as long as you know they are there. The plot follows the Treasure Island storyline ultra-loosely to a point where the title would have been better off being "The Pirates of Let's-Make-People-Think-it's-Like-'The Pirates of the Caribbean'-and-'Treasure Island'". Honestly, I don't think I have ever watched a movie that received such a low IMDb rating (1.7!!), but after reading people's comments I was able to reduce my expectations to near-nothing and have a good time. Thanks again!
