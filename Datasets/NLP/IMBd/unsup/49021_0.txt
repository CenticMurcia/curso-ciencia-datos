This movie was absolute trash. I never though that the creator of Kill Bill could be in such garbage. Ted the bellhop walked in a very strange manner and his personality would switch all the time as if in mood swings. In THe Missing Ingredient he was very nervous and jittery and same as in the Wrong Man but in the Wrong Man he yelled at a guy with a gun in his face, something no one would ever do. But, in the Misbehavors(most disgusting, disturbing thing I've ever seen)he was angry and yelling at the kids and when he saw the dead hooker in the bed he threw up and almost made me. Then, in the last story when he was going to cut off Norman's finger in some sick bet Chester, Leo and Norman made he had no problem yet he couldn't even have sex with the women in the beginning of the movie and was throwing up all over the place in the Misbehavors. It was like some creepy remote hotel where there was only Ted and the people in the four rooms but it was actually in L.A where there would be many other hotel staff and you would see some guests. He was totally alone except for the significant characters and I found it strange and irritating. They had Antonio Banderas, Selma Hayek and Quentin Tarantino(hope I'm not forgetting anyone) but the movie still managed to be worse than dirt. The actors were horrible, even Banderas, Hayek and Tarantino and it turned out to be the biggest disappointment since Underworld. If only there was a negative number on the Vote cause this movie deserves to be taken to the desert and buried.
