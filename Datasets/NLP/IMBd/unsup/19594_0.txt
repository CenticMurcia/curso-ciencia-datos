This movie is one of my favorites. I think it is under-appreciated and if it were up to me I would have produced a sequel by now. There were scenes in this movie that were so funny that I find myself quoting them on a regular basis. There were also some important political messages that were delivered with a great amount of skill and intelligence. Bullworth's two campaign directors were genius. Their dialog was great and their physical comedy was masterful. Halle Berry was of course at her top form and seemed very comfortable with the role. There were so many classic scenes that it is difficult to limit myself to just a few.I would like to see a sequel.
