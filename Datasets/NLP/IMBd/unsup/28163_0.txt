Come on, people who thought this movie was bad are taking it too seriously. This movie is so funny ! it shows the fact that swearing is funny, well its only funny if south park does it. awesome movie. it had a classic offensive plot and this time making fun of Canadians as potty heads. ahem, Terrance and Phillip... so basically, the 4 boys watch the Terrance and Phillip movie which is very rude yet hilarious, so after they watch it they become vulgar mouths and the south park parents are very angry and rages a war against Canada for making children become potty mouths. and the great factor is that the plot was used so well and the climax is just jaw dropping. the musical is very fun and lots of fun to sing with it. And the very impressive event is that they explore the characters really well in the movie. Like Satan, Saddam Hussein. Warning this film is highly racist,vulgar, adult and graphic. Come on Matt and trey make a second one !!!
