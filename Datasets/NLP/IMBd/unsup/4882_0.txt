I saw this film a long time ago, just when it was new (1982) and was blown away by the very talented Mr. Keaton.<br /><br />Also notable are Henry Winkler in a most restrained and touching way. <br /><br />A welcome surprise is Shelley Long (For the record: I am NOT her fan) as a prostitute "with a heart of gold".<br /><br />A small, early gem from the Ron Howard-Ganz-Mandel team, with some personal touches, to wit: The line when `Belinda' (Shelley Long) tells `Chuck' (Henry Winkler) just after they made love that `she is not wearing her watch' to let him know that she loves him is just beautiful, a nice, semi-polished little gem that I think most people can appreciate and enjoy.<br /><br />Trivia: Clint Howard in a small role (His brother, Ron almost always gives him work.)<br /><br />Trivia: In the closing credits Rod Stewart sings a beautiful version of `That's what friends are for' that would later be made really popular by "Dionne Warwick and friends".<br /><br />
