I, along with other viewers,was duped into thinking that this was about a serial killer when in fact it was about an animal that kills humans. O.K. animals do this as it is part of their instinct & sometimes animals acquire a taste for blood. In this case the theory is that the "Gator" acquired this "taste" because of all the bloodshed from the civil war that had gone on for years in that country. Could be? All I know is that when I started watching the movie & realized that it was just another "Gator" movie I was not only disappointed, but just plain mad. Mad that I had been duped, but I am not alone as many of of my fellow movie goers will see!!........Very Disappointed!!!
