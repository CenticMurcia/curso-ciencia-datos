If you enjoy Japanese horror than this film is highly reccomended. The plot isn't really the hi-lite here, it is the camera work and the atmosphere that is created. With this atmosphere, the story really didn't need to be to strong because the viewer is captivated by its visuals.<br /><br />This film was shot on DV, I bought this movie thinking it was going to be another low-budget horror film, but boy was I wrong. If there is another movie that looks as good as this and was shot on DV, can someone please post a note in the message board.<br /><br />GREAT MOVIE!!!!!!!! A DEFINATE MUST SEE!!!!!!!!!
