From reading many of these negative reviews on this website about The Love Guru starring Mike Myers,Jessica Alba and Justin Timberlake. I decided to watch this movie and I did last night with my family.We all loved it! I was laughing in many of the scenes.I know that many people didn't love this movie and it didn't do very well at the box office and that is considered one of the worst movies of all time but I really enjoyed it anyway despite what people thought of it and that it was a box office bomb.It wasn't the best comedy movie of all time but it was a really good movie.Also not the best Mike Myers movie of all time but it was one of his good ones.I really liked the music and characters and plot 9/10 is my rating If you love Mike Myers then you have got to see this movie.
