It never seems for me to find some obscure film from the U.K. or even here in America that places itself in a situation simple human nature. You ran on and compared this modern day tragedy to Bridget Jones Diary. Personally I detest the Bridget Jones Diary whereas in this film you find common day people catching themselves in a common day probable tragedy. The characters you mentioned played by Ewan MacGregor and Matthew Macfadayen, one who is not only caught in the candidness of Michelle Williams character, but also her husband's Supervisor giving his personal tickets away to save his own carcass based on probabilities.<br /><br />I have suffered a modern day tragedy and if not for my family could easily seem myself wrapped up in my daughters personal items. Your complete and total insufferable ability to see the human nature side of this movie makes me wonder why you even watched it. I have many friends scattered throughout the UK and even a London Police Officer who speaks of the many things that happen on a daily work day for him. So perhaps you should climb out of your dungeon and take heart to the last words spoken in the letter to Mr. Osama. Because it is truly obvious you did not understand the plea to listen to the voices of the children and perhaps together we could speak of peace for it is the children that carry and must live in this shattered world we now live in.<br /><br />The movie was touching especially to one who has lost through accident or currently war related reasons. The issues they speak of in getting through the grief are true and do work for many. As I said before I am not one who would commit adultery but realize that people are different and suffer issues and can see clearly how such a transgression could have happen. It has been said that it is not man that preys on the broken heart of a woman but the evil within the man.
