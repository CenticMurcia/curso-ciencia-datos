A great little pointless flick with no effectively discernible dialog. At least not any recognized or recognizable language. Linda Corwin is a real cuty pie and basically turns the film into a Corwin-fest, emoting constantly. Is it great film? Ha ha ha ha ha. But great film requires a lot more energy to watch than this. This is just fun. I doubt that you will be disappointed and cannot understand why the Tromas didn't use this gal again as she brightens up the set, wherever the set happens to be. <br /><br />This is typical of Troma films which seem to just unfold in an otherwise pointless manner. The reason for the film is the film itself. There are what passes for special effects and lots of s-c-a-r-y makeup which has the added benefit of not looking very real; clearly poor stop action and masks, all of which just adds to the cache of this low budget charmer. I heartily recommend this to any one who has nothing better to do than watch TV for an hour or two. You really barely have to pay attention. A DVD would be the perfect way to watch it. I taped it seven years ago off a TV channel (USA Up All Night) and am strongly considering the purchase of a DVD.
