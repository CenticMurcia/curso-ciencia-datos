There isn't very much to be said about this film, so I will keep it short. The script is simply laughable. People will say: "you have to understand the magic of it...". They're wrong. There's no magic. Only excruciatingly poor story and character development. To top that off numerous smaller characters are introduced to the story without actually contributing anything to it, and the chemistry between the two leading roles is just non-existent.<br /><br />For those of you thinking: "I hear you buddy, but I think I'll take my girl/boyfriend to it. They love those romantic love stories." To you I say this: I watched this movie with my girl and another couple. We all left the cinema with bruises on our foreheads from smacking them with despair throughout the movie.<br /><br />This movie is a waste of your time. The only reason I gave it a 2 and not less is that Aishwarya Rai looks stunning. That's it.
