Video and film allow vast numbers of our citizenry to gather around our intentions while discovering the best or worst of our nation. The possibility of conspiracy on 9/11 is one of those ideas that will continue to incite more and more discussion as time goes by. So much of the 9/11 Truth movement makes total and logical sense. Many of those ideas are certainly in error. But, many are not. As with any disputed historical event, there will be those who deny any truth to a new theory, especially one as foreboding as this one, and those who will believe in conspiracy, no matter the evidence to the contrary. For those who watch "Loose Change" with an open mind," I suggest going to: www.911scholarsfortruth.org for a detailed and evolving discussion of the alternate possibilities. Videos such as "Loose Change" cannot cover the entire subject, nor will it ultimately force the government to conduct a totally unbiased and complete investigation (most of the evidence at ground zero has been destroyed anyway). As usual, only time and sincere scholarly legwork may eventually reveal to us to what really happened that day. For now, however, those of us who find grave gaps in the official investigation must continue to question the intent of a government that desperately needed a "Pearl Harbor" level excuse to once again invade the Middle East. Whether this disturbing video contains truth or not, it should be considered amid all the other explanations by anyone who seeks a personal truth amid the mountains of data now available on the internet. To question the official version of this event IS a patriotic act. To allow your government the luxury of unquestioning loyalty is to allow those in power the luxury of corruption. This was not the intent of our founders.
