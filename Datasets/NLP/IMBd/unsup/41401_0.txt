I just wanna get this clear, I know some teenagers in America dedicate there lives to cheerleading. I don't like cheerleading, one little bit. Whether it be the incessant, whiny voices cheering ridiculous. The dancing is alright but that is it. This movie just glorifies the annoying-ness of the whole thing. How dedicated some people are to such a ridiculous 'sport'. I just don't get it. Kirstin Dunst, who I usually like, I didn't like in this. I don't know if it was the character or what. Actually all of the characters bugged me except for Eliza Dushku's, who I liked, I also thought she did a very good job, she stops the movie from getting a lower rating.
