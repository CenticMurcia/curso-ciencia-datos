This movie is being promoted as a new Jackie Chan flick. Don't be taken in! Having seen(and really enjoyed)his last 3 movies I eagerly waited in line for my ticket. Once the film got to "present day" (the film starts with Jackie's characters' birth.) I waited and waited...and waited for anything resembling the humour and action of his most recent films. It didn't come, and hadn't come when I walked out almost an hour later. The technology alone was enough to make any modern film goer cringe. You could actually see the blue line between the 2 Jackies!! All I can say is that Jackie Chan must have signed and released the rights to this film long long ago! I will go and see the next Jackie Chan film but only AFTER checking the production date! Poor Jackie!
