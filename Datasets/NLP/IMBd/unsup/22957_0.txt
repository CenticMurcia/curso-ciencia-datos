I disagree with other commenters. Though not the best movie, the movie had a point similar to that of "To Kill A Mockingbird." An attorney took on a case and a client he really didn't want. If he loses, his client could die. The stakes are high. In "Knock On Any Door," the attorney had abandoned the father, believing that it was no big deal. His associate didn't take the consequences seriously either. In the long run, not only did the family's father and breadwinner die in prison for a crime he didn't do, but the son felt abandoned and became a hood, eventually dying in the electric chair. If the lawyer had treated this innocent and poor family just as he treated his rich clients, and had given them his best as he did his rich clients, the father and the son may have been saved. The moral is, all people have value, whether poor or old, and when one is entrusted with the care or safety of another, one should treat that life as if it were his own in all cases. Not the best movie, but, when looked at from more than an entertainment perspective, it does its job well.<br /><br />Believe it or not, situation as happened in this movie happen in real life all the time.
