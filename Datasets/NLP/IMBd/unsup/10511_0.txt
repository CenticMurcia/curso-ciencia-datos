This is a film with a strong and universal message. You learn that the state will change if the trait is there, no matter how hard one is affected. Kudos for Oliver Stone and non-Yugoslav (Serbian?) cast who were brave enough to participate in this pre - 9/11 project (things seem to change diametrically after this date), and performed masterfully at that. One could argue that there is some artificial even-handiness in this film, but without this, the film could have been labelled as 'propaganda'. Now, this is a well-balanced story that takes you for an emotional roller-coaster ride and leaves you shaken at the end.
