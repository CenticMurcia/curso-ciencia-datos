I've seen a solid handful of the Gemser 'Emmanuelle' films by this point, and I've had this one laying around for years-so I figured I'd finally give it a shot (even though it's an 'Emmanuelle' film in name only). Glad I watched it during a bout of insomnia-as it was just what I needed to put me to sleep. <br /><br />A junkie has a boating accident which leaves him on a semi-deserted island whose only inhabitants are an old man and his two children-one of which is super-smoker Laura Gemser. Of course the junkie falls for Gemser and her pops doesn't like it. Neither does the brother cuz he was getting tail off her til the junkie came along and cock-blocked him. A bunch of boring stuff happens and Gemser walks around with her tits out a lot... <br /><br />This snoozer plays out like a sluggish mix of THE BLUE LAGOON and that Tom Hanks movie where he talks to the volley-ball. As others have stated, Gemser, and the well- shot island locale are the only reasons at all to watch this film-but even her tits and some pretty beach scenes aren't reason enough to try to stay awake through this one. Recommended only to Gemser completists-and even then I'd just recommend re- watching EMMANUELLE IN America. Not a horrible film if you're in the mood for am extremely tame soft-core romance-but being that I don't have a vagina-it's pretty rare that I'm ever in the mood for such a film. 4/10
