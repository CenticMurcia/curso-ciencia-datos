Granted, this abomination was filmed nearly 40 years ago but it lacks most of the style and energy of Flynn's 1941 Custer epic. The technical aspects alone are enough to consign "Custer of the West" to the Dust Bin of Hollywood, let alone of History.<br /><br />Just a few gripes among many: The topography of the climax in no way resembles Montana. Maybe that's to be expected of filming abroad, but there must be ONE grass covered hill somewhere in Spain.<br /><br />The troopers and Indians are armed with Winchester repeaters. If the 7th Cavalry had been so equipped, the battle might have gone the other way.<br /><br />One suspects that the portrayal of mounted Indians riding down the soldiers is inspired by Hollywood convention. In truth, the battle was fought on foot with the Indians making use of cover and terrain to approach the cavalrymen.<br /><br />SPOILER FOLLOWS The ending is just plain stupid: hundreds of Indians simultaneously halting in their tracks to spare Yellow Hair so he could be humiliated at the end of his life. That segments strains credulity to the breaking point.<br /><br />This pony's leg is so broken that the only thing to do would be put it out of its misery--and the audience as well.
