Ah, paramedics. Is there anything they can't do?<br /><br />Quite possibly the best film ever made featuring rapping white ambulance attendants - in fact, I think rap and hip-hop music in general received a monumental boost in its quest for legitimacy after Uptown and Mad Mike belted their street-savvy showstopper at the conclusion of Paramedics. Magnifique! And to the agent out there representing the Fat Boys? Shame on you! What a perfect vehicle for those crazy corpulants this would've been. One can only sit and think about it.<br /><br />Please, PLEASE regard all of this as sarcasm and steer clear of this trash. Peace out.
