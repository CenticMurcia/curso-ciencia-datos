A truly moving story. Wonderful composition of shots and a strong theme make this is a compelling indie movie. Not one to miss! Watch for new faces that demonstrate some sound break-out performances! The filmmakers took great care in crafting this story and it clearly shows as we follow Matt's journey though the film. If you can watch this film at one of the many festivals it has been accepted to, you should. Don't wait for a DVD release, but rather watch it on the big screen. The cinematography alone makes it worthwhile, and the strong story strikes home for most father/son relationships in real life. It can make you reflect on your own personal situation and that is the message of a powerful film.
