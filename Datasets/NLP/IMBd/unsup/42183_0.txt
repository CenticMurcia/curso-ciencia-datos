I always knew Bob Saget was destined to make a god-awful parody movie, ever since his early days on Full House. And I knew it would turn out like it did. This was a terrible, extremely unfunny film that seemed to put in stupid sex jokes just to make it adult. It's about a lonely penguin Carl (voiced by Saget) who is horny, and on his way to the penguin mating grounds with his buddy penguin Jimmy (voiced by Black). My first thought when watching this is how did they get such known celebrities to become involved in this. Samuel L. Jackson narrates the thing, and really just wastes time. The main supporting roles are played by Christina Applegate, M'Onique, Whoopie Goldberg and Tracey Morgan. And there are dozens of cameo voices including most of the cast of Full House. Even with a talented cast it just seems really unneeded. The movie only had about 30 minutes of plot, and it was stretched paper thin. Just to add time, they'd add random cussing penguins (or even a random panda bear voiced by Harvey Fierstein) talking to the narrator for several minutes. Several stupid subplots came in, including Carlos Mencia playing a penguin trying to get to the top of a mountain. And to top off all of this awfulness, it also looks horrid. It's all done on archive footage of penguins that no one can tell apart. I hated this idiotic "parody" movie, and I hope Bob Saget lays low for the next 40 years.<br /><br />My rating: BOMB/****. 71 mins. R for sexual humor and language
