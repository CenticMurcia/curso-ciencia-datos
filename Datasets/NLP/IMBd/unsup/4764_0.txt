I was at some of the filming of this movie (in Wilmington, NC)and it was great. I was also involved in the investigation of this crime.<br /><br />People always want to know if the book (made first) and the movie are as what actually happened. My answer is that both are Very Close to the actual facts in the matter. <br /><br />There are some minor differences between the book and the movie but nothing of any value that would drastically change anything. If you have seen the movie - get the book and read it. The book has some of the trial of Dr. Taylor and the movie covers almost nothing of the trial. A forensic pathologist (Doctor)testified at the trial - and the same Dr. testified in OJ's trial.<br /><br />Questions? Let me know. Bob
