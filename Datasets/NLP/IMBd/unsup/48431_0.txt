This is the type of movie actors appear in when they're trying to revive their dead in the water "career". Something Joe Pesci and Christian Slater should not have to resort to.<br /><br />Pesci and Slater are outstanding actors and should have known better than to accept these roles. This film takes away from their real talent. The script is too reminiscent of Slaters' film "Pump Up the Volume." I was grateful to see this film for free on local television rather than renting it or God forbid, paying to sit in a theater with no hope of escape. <br /><br />If IMDb doesn't like these type of reviews- then maybe they shouldn't have this option available -after reading guidelines-.
