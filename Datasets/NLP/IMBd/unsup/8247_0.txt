Out with the old n with the new...<br /><br />I like this movie because of its rare style similar to the lost skeleton of cadavra.<br /><br />Great no name cast.<br /><br />an speaking of names<br /><br />I thought the raspberry brothers should have used their real names.<br /><br />though I have read a few reviews that hated this DVD because of the <br /><br />changes what not in the film or score, but I think the f.b.i had something to do with this, so its the politics of DVD they should be upset with.<br /><br />a classic si fi treat.
