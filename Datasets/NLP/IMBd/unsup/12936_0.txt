I'm quite surprised that some have rated Eklavya so high. It is a below average film at best. The whole setup of the film evokes high promise but it fails to deliver by a big margin. There is royalty, magnificent forts and palaces, the intimidating backdrop of Rajasthan - dry and cruel. But that is all there is. I guess Vidhu Vinod Chopra believes that he has an intriguing storyline with a conspiracy trail running through and buried secrets dug bare open, but by the end the viewer almost cares a damn about who dies and who lives. The film fails because it does not engage the viewer in the upheaval in the lives of the characters. I would like to think that had the narration been different - with longer flashbacks interlaced to the proceedings - such that it lent some urgency to the flow, a stronger flavor of suspense and a definite hint of thrill, the film might have looked much better. Also, I'd have loved to see more of Amitabh and Saif's one on one sequences. Saving grace of the film, of course, is the performances. Everyone is good. It is sad though, that all of it does not add up to something better. Amitabh is intense, convincing and a sheer delight to watch, as always. Jackie just mumbles these days. I don't know why directors still cast him. All in all, a promise not kept.
