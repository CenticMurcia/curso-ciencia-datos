I expected a lot from Anurag Kashyap, as he was famous for being real and showing reality. But after watching the movie i didn't understand a single thing. What is the content of he movie. What message he wants to give ? I was completely lost. It was difficult to believe that the director of BLACK Friday made NO SMOKING. I saw 12- 18 people leaving the movie halfway. The only good hing about the movie was Ranvir Shorey who did brilliant job. It was a joy to watch Paresh Rawal not making a fool of himself. But his performance lacked a punch that the character demanded. And as you may have gathered, I still have no clue what the movie was about. And quite frankly, I don't want to know.You try so hard to understand what NO SMOKING tries to say, but the film is like one big puzzle that refuses to get solved.
