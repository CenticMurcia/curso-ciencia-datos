This film, coming out the same year as Star Wars, doesn't begin to approach that landmark film in any capacity. Acting is acceptable, as is the story. But the cinematography looks like a very lousy TV movie. Smoky, sepia filters are utilized to change the sky colors, bleeding over into the other areas in the frames. In as much as I am very much impressed with visual items such as cinematography, special effects, contrasts, colors, etc., when it comes to movies, this is a big letdown. Final score from Miller-Movies is a 4, that high mainly due to the acting.
