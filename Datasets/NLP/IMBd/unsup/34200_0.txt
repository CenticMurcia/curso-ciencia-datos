Normally, I like independent flicks. They can be pretty charming in their own special way. However, "The Off Season" was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The cover on the DVD made it look half way decent. The so called special effects were lame. The acting was terrible. There were absolutely no scares anywhere. I thought that was the goal of a "ghost story", to scare and shock the audience. Not even close. More like rolling in the floor from laughing so hard during this low-budget "thriller", with absolutely no thrills. Still, this is not the WORST movie I have ever seen. That distinction goes to "The Zodiac". For sure, the WORST movie ever created!!!
