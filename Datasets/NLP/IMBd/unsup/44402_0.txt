I first read the book, The Indian in the Cupboard with my Reading Class when I was in sixth grade, and I enjoyed it. But then we decided to watch this movie, I really became excited because I thought that the movie was really going to be like the book. But when I saw it, I almost fell asleep, I thought that it was really boring! I thought that it was nothing like the book, I thought that it was totally boring, that you will want to fall asleep when you watch it.<br /><br />First off, the mistakes that they made with the movie. The movie was updated, instead of taking place in England, like it does in the book, it takes place in the United States, you can tell that it is New York because you can see the World Trade Center towers in one scene! Another big mistake was changing were Omri had gotten the characters from. He got some in the book by buying them at the store, in this movie, he got them by swapping them with some of his other toys at an Indian exhibit in school.<br /><br />You can go ahead and watch it if you please, but I sort of would not highly recommend it to you, because of the tedious arrangements they made with the plot. But if you want to watch it, go on and watch it, I am not going to stop you from doing it, though I did not like this movie.<br /><br />4/10
