A pseudo religious story of salvation and redemption with wood carved characters that you would never choose for a mission like that. Egomaniacs, corrupt bureaucrats, a wise black man, a mother as a second in command who is totally obsessed with her sick kid, a riffle guy as a commander, a lonely girl without a mom raised by here tech dad with secrets to be kept.... The actors are also mostly to be rated B, the series wasn't very challenging anyway. Scientifically absolute nonsense. When will there be a sci-fi show where you don't have to think in every scene "oh G what a crud!" If you like Lost, this might be something for you. If you like fantasy, join the club. If you like sci-fi, don't waste your time.
