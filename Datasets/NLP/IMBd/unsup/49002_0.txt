Yeah, this is another somewhat typical "big bad critters" movie.<br /><br />Yet something is a little charming about this and the original Tremors. It's not intense or riveting... it won't keep you on the edge of your seat. But it's enjoyable to turn on while paying your bills or doing the dishes.<br /><br />Probably Michael Gross' acting and to some degree Susan Cuang's (nice and spunky - I liked her) made it enjoyable. The characters weren't deep but they were watchable, which is a lot more than can be said about a lot of stereotypical archetypes from Hollywood which TRY to be more.<br /><br />Nice, unassuming movie which doesn't try to be more than it is.
