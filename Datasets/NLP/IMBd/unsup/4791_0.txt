A sparse and atmospheric cross between Suspiria and A Watcher in the Woods -THE WOODS delivers subtly for its first two thirds and erupts in a rushed finale that deserved a more thorough and complex screenplay. This film needed more odd side characters and more Angela Bettis she was the voice of the woods though and that and the 60s settings along with Bruce Campbell and Patricia Clarkson's performances made this worthwhile from my viewpoint, I liked the pacing and effects and the bed in the corner had creepy possibilities that were misused by the writer. Overall I liked it but a lot of gorror fans might struggle with this one
