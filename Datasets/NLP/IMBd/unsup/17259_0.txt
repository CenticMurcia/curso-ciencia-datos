One word to describe this film... a Masterpiece. A sheer masterpiece with such a perfect blend of comedy, tragedy, and feel-good moments. I found myself wanting to jump through the television screen and be part of the movie myself. The young lead actor will capture your heart and leave you breathless. I was especially moved by the epilepsy scene. Don't give up on this movie just because the first five minutes are a little dull. And on another note, how misleading that comment on the box is, "Rosie O'Donnel is hilarious"! She is in a few scenes, but she makes little impression on the storyline. Its directing is flawless. I am so glad i stumbled across this film, it has made such an impact on my life! I hope that you can say the same.
