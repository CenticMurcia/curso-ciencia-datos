I have just watched twenty minutes of "My Date with Drew" and I was initially irritated with the DVD released by "First Look" distributor, which wrongly indicates the availability of "closed caption" (cc) on the cover of the R1 DVD, which is not captioned, has only subtitles in Spanish. The shameful self-promotion of the author using the name and a poster of Drew Barrymore on the cover to attract naive viewers that expect to see a romantic comedy with Drew Barrymore is one of the dumbest things I have ever seen on DVD. However, the intention of the author was achieved and his "documentary" was distributed, inclusive I was misled and bought it. After twenty minutes, I really gave up watching it since I really could not believe it could improve. I love independent movie, but not this type of cheap opportunism. I used the forward button and I was surprised with the generosity of the magnificent Drew Barrymore, participating in this farce. My vote is one (awful).<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Meu Encontro Com Drew Barrymore" ("My Date With Drew Barrymore")
