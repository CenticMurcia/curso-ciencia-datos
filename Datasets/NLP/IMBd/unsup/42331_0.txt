Warner's Brothers B unit goes for a straight exploitation plot, but manages to stay within the Production Code nonetheless, resulting in a movie that is neither amusingly salacious nor particularly well made -- a look at the plot outline offered by the Internet Movie Database will give you a rough idea of how silly and coincidence-actuated it is.<br /><br />Ronald Reagan seems to have been temporarily typecast as an insurance man at this time. Here he is a lawyer for an insurance company. Sig Rumann appears with black hair, ordering his daughter into the cold night, Sheila Bromley spontaneously develops a nasal tone and the habit of talking out of the side of her mouth and Jane Bryan, in the lead role, tries to present an air of bewildered innocence without once stammering or hesitating.<br /><br />Most of the other actors don't seem to put that much effort into this tripe. Don't you either.
