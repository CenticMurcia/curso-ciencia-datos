I would have to say, this is one of very few movies, that actually made me scream out loud. This film is not the best in the world, but its not the worst either. Some scenes Mystery Science Theater 3000, could have fun with. The end of the credits with the frog, and the hand sticking out of his mouth, that was good, I liked it, and wasn't expecting it either. I thought all the actors were good in it, including Ray Milland (from one of my favorite movies: "Panic in Year Zero", he was the director and star of the film). The cinematography was good in "Frogs" even through, you could see the shadow of the cameraman and the camera once in awhile, definitely in one running scene you could see the shadow of both the camera and the cameraman. All in all, I give this movie a 9. It was pretty good, and worth seeing. Check It Out!
