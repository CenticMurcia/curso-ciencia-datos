This film is set in the 1950's, not only in time but in style. It was a time of Poodle skirts, McCarthyism and fear of the bomb. This script acknowledges the first only. There is a simplification of the time that will appeal to some but not to most. <br /><br />The characters lack depth and the "feel good" problems the characters face lack tension. That said, the low-key acting services the low-key script very well.<br /><br />If you can identify with the characters (especially if you are Mormon). you will enjoy this film. If you cannot identify with the characters, you will probably find the film slow and very boring.
