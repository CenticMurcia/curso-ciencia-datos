After viewing ?, upon my travels to the US a fort-night ago, I have developed a whole new sense for comedy.<br /><br />At first, I was taken back by the film's unyielding, in-your-face, wicked humor and plots, however, upon completing this remarkable piece of cinema, I was able to digest and grip what the main characters' (West, Art, 'Nancy' - boy is she a hoot -) social positions in our/their world must be like. The pain, the disillusionment of being an outcast or mentally disabled, while lost in a cruel vortex of reality.<br /><br />? movie is gripping, perverse, and brilliant. Hilarious, off-the-wall, while oddly majestic. The hidden, real-life camera scenes are exquisitely juxtaposed to its fictional storyline, and will perplex; awe extensively.<br /><br />This new American comedy is what Monty Python and Peter Sellers were to us, altering the view of what humor can and will be. Fantastic!
