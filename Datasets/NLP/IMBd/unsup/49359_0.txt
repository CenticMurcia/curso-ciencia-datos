Badly synchronized audio together with silly lines and mimicking of "foreign speak". I really don't understand how or where money gets raised to make movies like this. A mish-mash of diabolical characters scheming to perform "dastardly deeds". Although the plot is beyond being obvious I won't spoil the joy of any that are courageous enough to see this thing through the end. Be prepared to feel like bursting out laughing when the really "bad guys" pull some dirty tricks (for the benefit of the creative minds of the authors) with their eyes almost popping out of their orbits.<br /><br />Prague is a truly beautiful city and that is about the only positive aspect of this movie.
