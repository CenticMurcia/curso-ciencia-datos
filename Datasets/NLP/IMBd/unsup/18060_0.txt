Keep in mind that my comments are always serious. HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA!!!!!! This was the most funniest movie I have ever seen in my Uncles house. No but for real this is a very funny movie. This is the funniest movie that I've seen that doesn't have to have any sex in it to make it funny, like American Pie. Now dont get me wrong, I love American Pie. Anyway this is a very entertaining movie. My uncle Alfonso Cardoso likes it.
