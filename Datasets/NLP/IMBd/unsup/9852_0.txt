(MAJOR SPOILERS) Low-budget B-grade Canadian horror flick is the same vain as 'The Faculty', where aliens disguised as humans have become a part of the campus. Except all these aliens inhabit a college and happen to be hot chicks who love cold weather, and mating men- except, err, the men don't survive the process, and they literally turn into frozen corpses. Of course, this all baffles the police, yet one guy is onto these dastardly hot girls.<br /><br />And that guy is Luke (Corey Servier), who happens to witness two of the ladies in their room spring tentacles out of their chest. Of course, none of his pals believe a word he says, and they all want to get laid. The Detectives think he did it. And his good lady pal, Alex (Meghan Ory), is the only one willing to help him- and, of course, she actually wants to be with him, but he can't see. Don't get me started on the tacked on ending involving them! If the movie wasn't tacky enough, the ending doesn't save it.<br /><br />The acting from the guys is generally bad. Corey Servier is a likable hero, but he needs to act better, and the guy who's playing the wannabe homeboy couldn't act to save his life! Elias Toufexis does the best as Luke's virgin frat buddy, who gets involved with one of the so-called chicks, but his performance is up and down. The girls do better acting wise, but then again, they act as the standard cliché eye-candy too. There is an interesting turn in the story, which could have made the film decent- involving Toufexis' Roger, and his alien girlfriend, but the filmmakers ruined it with unbelievable character actions and unconvincing acting. Soon after that, we get memorable lines from Luke such "how about the belt of O-FRYIN!' which really displays the B-grade aspect of this movie.<br /><br />The cinematography and visual effects are pretty decent, and I guess 'Decoys' doesn't take itself too seriously. I wish it did! Even within the context of the plot of the movie. The acting is so unconvincing, that it "feels" like a movie, and the storyline had potential to take an interesting turn, but of course, they had to have that tacky cliché horror-movie ending! Not the worst I've seen, but this was still extremely bad! <br /><br />*½ out of *****! (1.5/5)
