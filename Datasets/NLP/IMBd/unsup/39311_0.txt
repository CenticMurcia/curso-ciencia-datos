Tim Allen was pure genius with the 1st movie of this installment, and surprisingly enough the 2nd was also delightful. But I have to say, the 3rd, having added Alan Arkin, Martin Short & Ann Margaret, SHOULD have made "The Escape Clause" a film trifecta.<br /><br />But it didn't. All the humor from the 1st film was missing, and all the nuclear familial bonding from the 2nd film just didn't appear.<br /><br />What we got instead was Martin on a Short leash. His humor is an acquired taste to start with, but the man is known for creating quirky characters that leave you amused by their human flaws, and touched when they realize the error of their ways.<br /><br />Then there were Alan Arkin and Ann Margaret's couple bickering so much you really wondered what they ever saw in each other in the first place.<br /><br />Santa & the Mrs. seemed out of touch with each other. The other Legendary Characters, though fun to see, seemed they could have been utilized better. Kevin Pollack and Michael Dorn never fail to deliver.<br /><br />My favorite secondary character though is Judge Reinhold's ever optimistic, quirky psychologist.<br /><br />Tim Allen, whom I've always found amusing, seemed as though he rushed through the film. I think it would have been nice if Bernard the Elf, had been able to leave his "Numbers" chalk board long enough to give Santa a much needed hand in the Supporting Best Guy Friend role.<br /><br />The problem with the film for me, was that this time out I felt the script writers dumbed the movie down far too much. It came off preachy and left you wondering why, if they wanted to drive the moral of the storey that Christmas is for Familys, not just to make money, home so badly why crank out such a poorly scripted film, that would have made a better holiday movie of the week special? Perhaps it's my own fault that I was disappointed, because I'd had such high hopes for this film, but all in all, I was left feeling that this installment, which ought to have been another glittering Snowflake.<br /><br />Was just another production line cookie cutter script: Aww Baby=Cute, Family Bickers=You Still Love Each other. Cute Little Girl + Grinch Like Bad Guy=Predictable Hollywood Ending Where She Changes His Stripes. Edit in filler footage, slam it on a reel and call it a great Holiday Fare for the whole Family.<br /><br />Unless they have a fantabulous script, I hope they don't film anymore in this series.<br /><br />This film felt like the dieing embers of a Yule log, spluttering, a few pretty pops, but none of the warmth that made the first 2 films so enjoyable. It wasn't entirely a waste, it had a few moments that were enjoyable, the scenery was great, but the poor script kept getting in the way.<br /><br />If I could, I would have seen it at the dollar show. Or better yet, since I had to buy 3 tickets, I'd have rented it on DVD and been able to pause it to use the bathroom, because the treacles sweetness made my tummy queasy. Love, Grace & Peace, Gunner
