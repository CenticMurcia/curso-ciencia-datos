OH dear. I was channel surfing in the USA and I came across some footage that made me nauseous ,courtesy of SHARK..that showed the wild horse races in the USA!.Disgusting,barbaric, ,appalling and abhorrent.I also note the AHA investigation as stated on SHARK also came up with,like Lord of the Rings..more injured and dead horses..it all sounds all too familiar..problems on set being covered up and not exposed properly thereby letting the self centered film industry get away with it again...-the second time in three years...and again the media covering it up..the bad behavior of the movie industry..I work on films...there is no need for any one or animal be harmed in the making of a movie.Large or small.We have been doing it for a while..we know what health and safety is.We are not all this bad.Kids this ain't no joke.This is not funny.If you have pets..do you let harm come to them in your house and under your care?.This is no different...on TV I saw mid west thugs doing cruel stuff to horses....unnecessarily......thugs with little in the way of common sense or decency treating animals badly ..and I presume there wives. And it sounds like,well Lord of the rings ,not good things happened on set and was covered up.This is appalling and the industry should be ashamed as hsould Americans.(and fair enough..we banned fox hunting in the UK and thats not even apatch on this ..fox hunting is humane compared to this)I for one am unable to support or watch this movie as I know enough about the AHA that although they may not print the whole truth and they may err on the side of caution ..they do get at least the tip of the iceberg out so you know on both those film -FLicka and LOTR things were amiss...and thugs were worse than what the AHA can reasonably say on their site(see film & TV unit of AHA).Disappointing that Tim McGraw allows this and he is not Ã«yes open yet.You know can one forgive him for this kind of support for these wild horse races.NO.Cna I buy his movie now.NO! He is in a position to make a difference and he should open his eyes consciously and look at what is really happening here and real see it and understand the pain being caused.Thumbs down to every producer,actor and director on this movie.Thumbs up to SHARK for getting the story out and to any sponser who pulls out.Thumbs up to Paul McCartney.Thumbs up to ... tried so valiantly on LOTR to stop this crap happening on film sets..Animal or human, undue suffering is not required.Here,in Africa, UK ,Mexcio,Canada ,or anywhere.Undue suffering in Afirca,Dafur and elsewhere like hunger must end.
