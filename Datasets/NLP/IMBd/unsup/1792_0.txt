'Beverly Hills Cop II' is an utterly obnoxious movie that epitomises the worst aspects of flashy '80s action and serves only as a monument to Bruckheimer and Simpson's lack of interest in anything besides cars, guns, tits and swearing. Sandwiched between the enjoyable original and the underrated third movie, not only is this sequel soulless, abrasive and boring, it's entirely lacking in laughs. Eddie Murphy's Foley comes off as a rude, selfish jerk this time round, and it's the fatal flaw of the movie than none of his shtick is remotely inventive. He just talks and talks and talks and talks and talks. Meanwhile the overly complicated plot relies on moronic coincidence to drag itself from one empty set piece to another, and the gaps in logic are filled with unmemorable pop songs, orange filters, Harold Faltermeyer's keyboard/electric guitar/bin lid/biscuit tin score, shoulder pads, bright red lipstick and big sunglasses. Diabolical.
