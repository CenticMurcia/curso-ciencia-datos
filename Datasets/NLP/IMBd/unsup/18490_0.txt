This film, shot in black and white, takes you back to the films of yesteryear. Johnny is an island of innocence in a modern sea of debauchery. Undaunted and unflinching, Johnny captures the bad guy and gets the girl. I could almost say that's a spoiler, but the nature of this film makes it quite enjoyable no matter if you know the ending or not! Fun and frivolous, this film deserves your attention. I caught it quite by chance on IFC and am happier for it. Don't miss it, this is good stuff.
