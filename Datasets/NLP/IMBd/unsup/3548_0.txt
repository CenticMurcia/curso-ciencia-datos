I think it was a movie well done. It is an inspiring story of faith, and hope. It was the act of taking a stand for something you believe in. And not really giving up on it no matter what. The end really got me, something that seemed so impossible,(to me)was actually accomplished. Somethings that did happen in the film were frightening.However, there was a lot of courage,and strength. Which showed the goodness and the awesomeness of God.God always seems to work things out. AWESOME! The leading actress was wonderful,the acting of all of the actors were great. All in all, it was a great movie. Highly recommend. Two thumbs way way up! 10 out of 10 definitely.
