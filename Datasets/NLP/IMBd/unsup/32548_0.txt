Loathsome is the only word I can use to describe this aberration to an already weak series of films.<br /><br />At best the Sleepaway Camp series has always been something of a guilty pleasure amongst horror film fans. This iteration not only undermines the silly B-movie cheese that fans have come to expect from the series but it also manages to create an incredibly unlikable cast of losers that you can't cheer for or care about.<br /><br />Fan's of eighties slasher films should note that the gore here is weak at best. There is no nudity and the cast is made up of unlikable miscreants. The plot (if you can even call it that) leads to a completely out of left field ending that adds up to a miserable filmgoing experience all around.<br /><br />Ignore this one like it never happened and you'll be better off.
