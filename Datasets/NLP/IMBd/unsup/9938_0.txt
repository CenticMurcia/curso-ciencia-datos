Millard Mudd is a down on his luck cartoon writer whose fortunes change with the arrival of a cute little dog named Lucky. Murder and mayhem ensue.<br /><br />Lucky is not a good movie - it's too wordy, the "hero" is completely unlikeable, and the pacing is off. But it's filled with more disturbing stuff than most movies: necrophilia, sex torture, and chainsaws among them. Plus it really seems to hate women. SIDEBAR: I'm a chick horror fan and get really upset when people point to horror flicks as nothing but misogyny. But this movie really doesn't like women.<br /><br />It kept me watching right up to the dumb ending because I had to see where it was going. Has some darkly funny moments but nothing special. No animal cruelty though - the car wreck that introduces Lucky excepted.<br /><br />Best Line: "Perception is nine tenths of the law."
