When I rented this flick - despite my prudent dislike - I thought I was going to be served a touchy-feely picture sporting the message that math is not redeeming answer to life but love is, or such Hippy New Age existential hogwash. (Though I prefer that, violent nihilistic self-destruction is the only salvation, as preached by Fight Club) I need bland cotton candy sentiments to balance my diet of bitter misanthropy.<br /><br />Instead I was dished a geriatric smug rendition of "The Ant and the Grasshopper" fable. I liked the main-character. The fact that she got up as early as noon, complained about everything and dismissed and alienated people around her with sophomoric clever sophism's and incivility made her a character I could really relate too. In the end though, trough the nagging of her aged father and the boring intervention techniques from her equally boring boyfriend she is swayed to abandon her hobo-hedonistic lifestyle and yielded to the white-collar work-ethics all scientists obey (except she isn't motivated by monomaniacal self-important worship of math and greed of course)<br /><br />Though plaid-shirt wearing math-monkeys feel the sand of human ignorance towards their exalted science grinding in the neat little clock-works of their pedestrian brains, so too my pop-culture filled remnant of gray matter is vexed by the blatant disrespect for human reality , or at least my reality; I never met an interesting mathematician. So I conclude that the lovable socially apt Greenday pet-chimps who know pi to a thousand places are Hollywood creations. (What's next an overrated art-house actor playing a vagrant in a Fantasy world who is the king descending from an ancient bloodline, that fought the Tin Woodsman on steroids in some battle thousands of years ago?)<br /><br />I say; I you want a movie about social and spiritual redemption go watch "The Fisherking" by Terry Gilliam, he has something math-monkeys don't have - Imagination.
