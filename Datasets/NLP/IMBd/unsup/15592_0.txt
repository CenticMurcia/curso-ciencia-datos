Yes as mentioned, a lot of fun. Haven't seen Love Crazy but prob just as much fun. I too wish it had a more solid title but movie factory was in<br /><br />crank 'em out mode as Great Depression I rolled on. If they remade this one, Grace from Wiil & Grace (Debra Messing) would be a knockout lookalike for Myrna Loy. DM has the bearing and clothes horse style with a slow/fast burn comedic ability. DM not given big screen use much except for Woody Allen in Hollywood Ending. Woody is always 5 years ahead of consensus at breaking talent. So give this one a ride unless they make one for the<br /><br />Great Depression II from viewpoint of unemployed that is as that is the usual determinant.<br /><br />
