Of the six movies that I've seen from this series, this is the movie to tell friends about. The locations are beautiful, the background (extras that appear) are not too glamorous and not too plain. The Thai bathhouse scenes are what I attempt to "sell" as the highly erotic shots. These are so hot, in fact, I'd rather watch EMMANUELLE movies than most X-rated films. I learned much later that director Roger Corman had directed some films. And now, in 2006, I find the webpage, and it contains more EMMANUELLE movies than I previously thought. This is a great film. Sylvia moves with grace,exudes sexuality but never showing her motives until the timing is there.
