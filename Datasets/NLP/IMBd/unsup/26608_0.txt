I found this 'Oh My Goddess!' VHS today while trying to find my 'Rat Race' VHS. I seriously thought I had recorded over it. Back then when I thought I recorded over it, I was very devastated. <br /><br />I remembered that I absolutely loved this animation, but I thought I just loved it because I was in sixth grade and that I enjoyed just about anything. It's been almost a decade since I last saw it, so I thought I'd rewatch it.<br /><br />The sound quality was horrible, but after a half an hour, it didn't bother me anymore. The story captured me, and so did the animation. I mean, here's a good saying: 'nice guys finish last.' Not only do they finish last, but they get the prize winning. It's such a feel-good anime, and I know that just about anybody would enjoy it. However; if you find goodie-two-shoe type of girls annoying, then this isn't the animation for you. Though, she may seem like a goodie-two-shoe, but everything is explained at the end. Like why she did what she did and so on... Very good animation.<br /><br />OK yes, it's true, this is a cute-sy chick flick, and if you like love stories, then this is an anime for you.
