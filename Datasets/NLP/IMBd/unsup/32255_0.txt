For anyone who likes to watch a bad movie for a good laugh. "DNA" isn't it. "DNA" is just plain bad all around, with nothing to even laugh at. It was made on a cheap budget, has real bad action, acting and REALLY BAD directing and no writing. I think everyone made it up as they went. There's no interest in the action (Joe average guy is able to take out several big commandos, I don't think so). The sad moments don't make you feel sad or sympathetic.<br /><br />The idea that the CIA would send into the jungle one agent (who's your stereotyped woman who falls at the critical point type), with a doctor as a guide, to take out a dangerous villain and the monster he's created, is just stupid. As I said, it's as if they didn't bother to write a script.<br /><br />Any TV station who shows "DNA" should be ashamed. I just watched it on the SCIFI channel. They're too good to show something like this. I'll bet no one on their staff ever saw it before. It was a complete waste of my time!
