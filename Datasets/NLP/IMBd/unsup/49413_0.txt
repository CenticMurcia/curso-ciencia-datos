Don't expect a balanced view from this movie. It is a highly biased propaganda piece, although there is some counterpoint scattered throughout. Micheal Moore comments that corporations are only after profits. The narrator announces that the corporation is bound to place profits of the stockholder above the public good. Noam Chomsky, throws in his radically left ideas as frosting on this bitter cake. He paints with a broad brush that even though the people working in corporations may be moral, the institution of the corporation is inherently evil.<br /><br />The movie points out that a corporation will move into an impoverished country and are hailed as a hero for providing opportunities for workers. When the pay rises and the workers start making additional demands upon the company, the documentary states, the corporations leave those workers behind in search of more worker to exploit. There's no denying that there is some truth to that. The balanced point of view is that those exploited workers have had an improved standard of living as a result. It is clearly not up to the standard of living in the first world, but it is an improvement.<br /><br />The movie progresses by creating a psychological profile of a corporation as through it were a person. The premise being the corporation is an amoral or immoral person. They even interviewed an FBI employee that profiles psychopaths. If course, they only look at the negative aspects of corporations.<br /><br />I know one of the experts interviewed, although I won't mention his name because he is tort-happy. I know his motivations are less than honest. He is out to make a name for himself.<br /><br />I am the CEO of a corporation. I am also a life-long Democrat. I have a blog on political moderation that advocates, among other things, reasoned debates on things of importance to our culture. There is absolutely no doubt that there are corporations whose culture is oriented toward the exploitation of people. There are also corporations, like mine, who have a corporate culture toward providing a service to customers. I am well compensated for the service I provide, but I enhance the value of companies I serve and I can serve them with honesty and integrity. Corporations have served to enhance the standard of living for all Americans, although at times in unethical ways. I was looking for a balanced review of the value that corporations have brought as well as things that need to be changed so that pure greed and unethical behavior in some corporations can be held in check. There was an opportunity to present some legitimate concerns about the affect of corporations, both positive and negative, but the producers passed on that opportunity. Ironically, the "What Do We Need to Do?" Segment on the Q&A bonus materials is a lot closer to the reasoned debate that I had hoped for in the movie.<br /><br />If you believe that corporations are inherently evil, this movie will be preaching to the choir. If you are looking for something other than propaganda, you will be disappointed by this film.
