I wasn't sure what to expect when I saw this film. I knew that it was 4 parts, all thrillers and each somewhat related to the others. I was surprised at how entertaining the movie was. Each part had something in it to make you laugh, groan, roll your eyes and even jump out of your seat. I especially enjoyed The Psychic and it's attention to details (pay close attention to Madam Badeau's shop). <br /><br />The music added to the suspense and terrified the person I was sitting with. The film did need some work with lighting and sound but overall was a fun flick and definitely a thumbs up for people who enjoy this genre.
