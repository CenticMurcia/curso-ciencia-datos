this movie is one of the worst ever, do not watch it, it is total crap. Nothing makes sense, it's only 48 minutes long!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />Carrey shows no talent in here and why does it say introducing Janet, that's stupid. The quality was bad and the audio was bad, we all just laughed during it, for shame!!!<br /><br />I can't understand why someone would want to make this movie, or watch it. This is a slap in the face to anyone who is a Jim Carrey fan, his talent is absolutely no where to be seen here.<br /><br />If I had a choice of watching crap float around in a toilet or sit through this, you can bet your ass that I pick the crap.<br /><br />There is nothing in this movie that gives it any mark, Just as bad as BELLY, ENVY or House of the dead!!!!
