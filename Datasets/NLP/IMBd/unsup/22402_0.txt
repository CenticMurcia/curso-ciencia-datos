This show is nausea inducing. It features rich kids celebrating their 16th birthdays and basically behaving like the most spoilt individuals you have ever seen. The episode I just watched feature Jazmine who was formerly in foster care but now a full time brat. Having watched half an hour of her on screen I think perhaps being adopted by rich parents wasn't the best thing for her as she was clearly a horrible young woman who was only going to get worse with age. All of the kids featured on this show make your blood boil due to the sheer lack of respect they have for others around them. Why you would choose to raise your child like this astounds me. they have no work ethic, no manners, no discipline.<br /><br />The most amusing thing about the show is those appearing on it think that appearing on the show is a really cool thing. How wrong they are.
