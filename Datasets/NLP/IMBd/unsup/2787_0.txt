Awful comedy loosely based on "Snow-white", featuring a massive amount of German comedians. <br /><br />The appearing comedians play their own style as it probably would be in a fairytale scenarion. Netherless the plot is very predictable while the gags are highly unpretending. <br /><br />Many of the jokes are based on German language and probably won't work translated. (To be honest they don't really work in German either)<br /><br />Silly, heartless old jokes suitable for viewers aged < 10 years. Sophisticated adults should under no circumstances waste their time/money with this movie.
