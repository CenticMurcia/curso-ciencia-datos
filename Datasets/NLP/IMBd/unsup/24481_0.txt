Now I respect the guy for making the effort, and yeah it was interesting to see how the film makers tried to get over the technical difficulties and the like, but honestly, I swear to god, this was the worst film I have ever ever seen. And I can't even say why! It should have worked, everything was there, but it just seemed to miss the mark, consistently. Now, I would recommend this film for aspiring filmmakers as an example how to bypass certain budgeting restrictions, as in this respect, it did work, but as an actual movie? No thanks. It was like some parody of student films. There was some interesting camera work, but then, and especially in the dialogue scenes, there was the most awful,awful talking heads thing going on, the most static and boring shots I have ever seen in a motion picture. Now I imagine it was all shot on DV camera, and there have been some interesting things done in DV, and certainly, I think it should be considered the way of the future. I mean you only have to look at some of David Lynch's work, and especially inland empire, to see just what can be done in the medium, but it is unredeemed dreck like this, which consistently mark DV, and DV film-makers as amateur, when it needn't be! Please,please, to the film-maker: actors, real actors please. INTERESTING shots, especially in scenes of dialogue, something that lifts it a little, and most importantly of all, get a screenplay that says something new about the human condition. Budget restrictions needn't be restrictions on the quality of the drama! of the uplifting experience that comes from learning something new about ourselves through drama.
