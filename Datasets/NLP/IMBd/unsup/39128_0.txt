I didn't expect to be blown away by this film, but i expected a good time. I thought that the topic was somewhat original, and the trailers seemed promising. Alas, once you've seen the trailers, you've pretty much seen the funny parts already. While this film isn't bad it kind of get cheesy at times. Johnny plays Johnny and not Jean-Philippe, a character that should have been more developed, the story is ill conceived and the end is plain silly. Add that cheesiness to a very bad song that closes the film and you somehow regret you paid 8,50 euros to have seen it. I heard the Americans are already on it to buy the rights and have thought to make their movie revolving around Madonna or Springsteen. For once i think the American version has a good chance to be better than the original at least. I also enjoyed "true lies" better than "La totale" though.
