i loved this movie, i saw this movie when it came out on DVD,because of Kate Hudson, i had recently saw how to lose a guy in 10 days from my sister and loved that movie. when i saw this movie i thought it would be so funny,it didn't really have that many funny parts, there was a couple, me and my sister were cracking up when Kate woke up in the morning and her hair was blue and she went to work because she forgot to get it dyed back to blond,and she used her shirt and wrapped it around her head so the people she was working with wouldn't see her blue hair, and so during her meeting all she had on was her pants a suit jacket and her bra,and it was so funny.then when the shirt fell off her head and she was telling the people that she was fighting with her best friend and everything and then she sat down and she ripped of part of her hair and was like "oh my god i'm gonna be a bald bride"that was funny....it is a chick flick/comedy, for that reason it was good and i would totally watch it again. but its not like one of those comedy's where you are gonna keep laughing
