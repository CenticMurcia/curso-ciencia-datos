Woody Allen tends to rehash his movies a lot, and when he every so often makes a movie that departs from his usual formula, I'm doubly pleased. The Purple Rose of Cairo is one of the most brilliantly weaved and most original stories I've ever seen on film. It doesn't even just stop at the inventive and inspired premise. The film manages to arouse every emotion. It's hilarious, it's romantic, it's heartbreaking.<br /><br />In all, The Purple Rose of Cairo is one of the most effective movies I have ever seen in stimulating one's sense of imagination and fantasy. I'm getting corny and about now is where I realize that there's nothing else specific that I can substantially comment on. I mean, the acting is great, the camera-work is fine, et cetera. But it's inarguably one of Woody Allen's best films. It's proof that he is one of the greatest, funniest, and smartest screenwriters.
