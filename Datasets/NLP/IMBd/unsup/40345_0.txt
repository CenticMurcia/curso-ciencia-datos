I wasn't sleepy last Sunday night and I chose to watch whatever was on TV. Channel 29 ("Space")was airing this, and I foolishly believed it was "Exorcist III". The movie lacks everything, but it's watchable.<br /><br />John Jaspers made a deal with some sort of devil named "M" to clear M's way to world domination. Somewhere in the way, he repents and ends up in an asylum, where a pretty psychiatrist (or doctor, or whatever) visits him and hears his story. Jaspers claims "they" (M's band) are coming tonight. She hears it as if he was saying "1 + 1 is 3" but on his way out sees something "unusual" and runs away. Indeed, Jaspers is taken away and buried, while the girl calls a detective friend and is caught by the same guys before the cop arrives. Luckily for her, Jaspers is back as Faust, who should (given it's an horror film) look like a devil but most of the time is a red bug ("Bugman":::). Unfortunately, M won't give up, and the bulk of the movie starts there.<br /><br />The cast is nothing spectacular. I wonder why Andrew Divoff keeps getting overlooked by the mainstream, since he's a hell of an actor. The girl who plays the shrink is OH beautiful, and M's chick seems to be taken out of a porn. Comic-based, it should be scary but it is not. However, despite everything, it's worth a watch, even to laugh a while.<br /><br />4/10
