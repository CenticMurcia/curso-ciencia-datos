There wasn't a single positive minded person working on this movie! The entire movie is utterly depressing with everyone telling this poor Jeep that he can't fly in different derogatory ways. My son watches it three times a day and it gets more painful every time, I think I'm gonna hide it. The negativity isn't worth the 3 minute happy ending! Parents who try to instill positive thinking in their children should avoid this movie. The makers were attempting to show the end as victorious, but it goes way over a young child's head and leads to toddlers running around saying "Lock it up Shorty". Fun Fun! You get used to the not so hot animation after the first few minutes.
