I do not rate a movie a "1" unless it is *offensively* bad, and trust me, this one qualifies.<br /><br />The writing, directing, and editing are comically horrid; many scenes are so badly done that you break out laughing, and no, it's not intentional! Washed-up Dolph is not being paid enough here to even pretend to act, and none of the other actors are helping.<br /><br />The only thing that is half-decent is the special effects, or rather, the sci-fi bits from the future, and the passable intro with the meteors hurtling through space and plunging into the Earth.<br /><br />Everything else about this movie is a total loss and a total waste of life. Don't bother. Please.
