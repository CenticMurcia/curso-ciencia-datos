I really tried to like this movie. And while it wasn't horrendous, I found myself getting more and more fatigued as it went along. It perked my interest enough that I was too curious to just turn it off. But it was SO SLOW MOVING that I felt like I was the one lost in a time machine. The acting was not bad, but the scenery was unchanging and boring. Although the ending was good, by the time it finally got there I didn't even care how it ended.
