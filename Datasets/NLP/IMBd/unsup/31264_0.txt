? is a film that speaks volumes about society as a whole.<br /><br />Through aggressive, pungent humor, the movie hits home on what life as an outcast could be like in today's materialistic, capital driven world. West, going nowhere fast, Art unfortunately, nowhere ever, and Nancy, though being a symbol of true unbridled love, her synthetic limitations and tragic circumstances leads her down the same dead-end road as her male co-stars.<br /><br />? definitely tests the outer boundaries of humor, but uses this so cleverly to attack some very critical issues facing our society today.<br /><br />I felt, really felt emotion while watching this film! Disgust, hate, happiness, sad, pain, intrigue, and most of all, I laughed, when I probably shouldn't have.<br /><br />Thanks Mr. Harz & Mr. Kennedy for this experience!
