Apart from Babette's Feast, this is probably the best food-themed movie I have ever seen. Despite sounding dreadfully dull, the entire movie is about two brothers who own a struggling restaurant and the preparations they make for a special dinner which will be attended by the singer, Louis Prima (King Louie's voice in Disney's Jungle Book). How is this interesting? Well, the relationships between the characters are so well-written and the acting is so good you really find yourself caring about these ordinary and very believable people. It is a fine counter-point to the often loud and vulgar fare from Hollywood and in many ways is reminiscent of a foreign film (particularly the excellent German film "Mostly Martha"), though it was made in the good old USA.
