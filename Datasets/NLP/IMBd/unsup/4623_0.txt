If you where run over by the Miramax foreign film juggernaut, then you missed this brilliant gem tucked away in one those twenty seats cinema theater.<br /><br />A film is very much like a painting, meant to be seen not discussed or explained. So let us just leave it at 'see it'.<br /><br />Benito Zambrano's talent on the other hand merits more than a discussion. A sensitive director and a poignant writer. In many ways 'Solas' reminded me of another gem in the dust 'Heavy'.<br /><br />Benito managed to keep the movie so simple, that it hurts. His flare for observing and then relaying in his film the raw human angst, is inspiring.<br /><br />The actors for there part, rose to the greatness of the moment.<br /><br />BZ makes us cling to hope by our finger nails while steadily adding to our feet the weight of reality. But then, isn't that life!<br /><br />To look for hope in 'Solas' is to look for simplicity in 'Guernica'. It's there, you just need to see it.<br /><br />And like all good things in life this one is elusive too. No video or a DVD release yet.<br /><br />Once again, it lives up to it's name.
