This is only the second film from Tonino Ricci I've watched, but I can already safely say he's one of Italy's worst horror/exploitation directors! With the other turkey being "Thor The Conqueror", this sad excuse for a movie called "Panic" is probably all I'll ever watch from him. For the gorehounds among us, this movie features a handful of gross murder sequences and utterly cheesy make-up effects, but it lacks literally everything else like structure, tension or understandable dialogues. Here we have yet another over-ambitious scientist that falls victim to his own stupid research and mutates into a hideous and bloodthirsty monster. It's his own damn fault! Who the hell, in his right state of mind, experiments with bacteria and lethal viruses anyway? The smooth & womanizing security officer Captain Kirk (Captain Kirk???) starts a search for the monster on the loose, while the army forces consider it to be better to exterminate the whole city and its entire population at once. It's a really lame and boring horror effort with an occasional gory killing. However, DO find the courage to remain watching until the very last minutes, as we only get to see the monster's face at that point. It'll be worth it, since the bloke looks like rotting pepperoni-pizza.
