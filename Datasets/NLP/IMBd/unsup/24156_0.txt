I saw "Always Will" at Dances with Films, where it won the audience award. The story was very clever and I could not believe that this was made on a shoestring budget by an independent filmmaker. It honestly looked more like a studio film. I laughed out loud, and was surprised by a little twist when Will decides to return to when he dug up the relic. The only fault I found was the Dad character. The actor played the character a little one dimensional, but since it is a comedy it still works. I loved that I could take my kids, when most festivals (unless they are "family" festivals" show the most outrageous films they can find.) I hope to see this in theaters, it's that good.
