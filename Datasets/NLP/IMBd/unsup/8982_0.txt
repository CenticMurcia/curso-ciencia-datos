I have seen this movie twice now, and I'm wondering what is up with that large orange block in the first story? Is there something real going on here? The movie as a whole seemed like a cross between American Rose and Six Feet Under. Selma Blair seems to have an affinity with quirky indie type films. The moment when Vi walks into the restroom to freshen up, and discovers the dozens of photographs of other girls, some who i believe are in Vi's class, who ended up in the same predicament was a nice touch to a kind of dry film. Teacher/Student fantasies happen in real life every day. Who hasn't wondered about sex with a teacher, it goes as far back as grade school.
