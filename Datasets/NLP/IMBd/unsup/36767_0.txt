This is arguably the second worst movie I've ever seen as I rarely give movies a "1." The ONLY reason I ever give a movie a "1" is if the movie commits what I call "the unforgivable sin." That being, it has an incoherent plot. (Vampire Assassin is arguably the worst) I'll start by saying, it's very hard to tell what exactly is going on. The dialog is poorly written and delivered even worse. No one really seems to "care" about anything even when they're shot or shooting at someone. Basically, the whole thing is like a script someone threw in a blender, ground it up, then pasted it back together at random then made a movie. This movie more correctly depicts a wild wild mess than the wild wild west (yea I'm not original, so sue me). :) Basically Dwight is the "Uwe Boll" of westerns.<br /><br />And Dwight is normally such a good actor, like he was in Panic Room and Sling Blade. This was a lesson to him to stick to acting and singing and give up writing and directing. And he's got one of the greatest country voices EVER.<br /><br />He needs to get a new team of songwriters together and make another hit album. Directing and writing..."it's just not for you, dawg, it didn't do it for me." Sorry, I had to do that. :) I don't even know how to go into the plot...was there a plot? Um...Dwight was the sheriff...Vince Vaughn was the leader of the bad guys...umm...the bad guys did something bad for some reason which wasn't clear...Dwight and his buddies try to stop em, I puke, the end. :) Sorry Dwight, I respect you so much as a singer I'm trying to wipe this movie from my mind.
