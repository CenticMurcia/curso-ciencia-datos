Today I went to the movies to see "Funny Games," an apparent shot for shot remake of an Austrian film produced ten years or so earlier which I also didn't see. I suppose its supporters will claim its a 'black comedy/horror.' I must admit, I am not one of these supporters. In fact, when I left the theater, I found myself feeling an overwhelming sense of disgust with both the film maker and the audience! Of course, I will get to more specifics on this, but for now, lets focus on the story.<br /><br />This film is about a husband and wife, and their young son going to what appears to be their rather lavish riverside home, unaware as they drive past their friends that there are a pair of degenerates who are terrorizing the community, one family at a time.<br /><br />The sociopaths, Paul and Peter, are a pair of soft spoken blonde haired guys who one would expect to see living in these mansions- who knows, perhaps they do. Either way, there isn't any kind of substantive catalyst to the horrors they unleash aside from a patronizing determination to 'remain civil' at the expense of their victims dignity, right until they reveal their true intents.<br /><br />This story could have had a lot to say, and indeed, some of the technicals of this film are quite effective. This director knows how to ratchet up the suspense, to prod his audience into a state of near catatonia, however ultimately the effectiveness of both the story of the wolf in sheep's clothing and the quality of some of the film making becomes saturated in a need to demean and torture would be victims.<br /><br />Case in point: in a scene where the two villains are debating the quality of the female victim's body, they decide they want her to take her clothes off- and to effect this, they stick a sack over her son's head and twist it to the point that these rather loud screams of pain and anguish can be heard. Imagine my absolute horror when members of the audience, and in particular, female members of the audience, could be heard laughing hysterically.<br /><br />While I write this, I think I've concluded that the thing that I find most unsatisfying is the degree that the villains manipulate pretty much everything that happens in this story. You see, there's nothing particularly intelligent about them...just condescending and fake! There's nothing physically impressive about either of them: indeed I had hoped and still believe that someone like Tim Roth could've throttled them to within an inch of their lives, golf club or not! But on a couple of occasions there is an acknowledgment of their omnipotent control of everything and anything that I found just so inappropriate and ridiculous in this story.<br /><br />For instance, at one point one of the characters talks directly to the camera (and of course, by extension, us); at another, one of the characters when the victims rise up (as one would naturally expect after they KILLED THEIR LITTLE BOY!!!) manages to rewind the action when it is unfavorable, and alter it so that the husband is shot dead, and the wife is bound and dropped into the lake.<br /><br />And then we have the ending. But guess what: as the audience, I kinda feel like it was MY right to alter the action, and not that of one of those nothings who unleashed their horror! Therefore, I'd like to go back to the scene where there is a confrontation with these two over the eggs, and have the husband take his driver and knock both of their heads off BEFORE they get to kill the little boy.<br /><br />To summarize: privileged young devils torture and kill a family. That really is all this film is about, and whilst it can hide behind its "uniqueness," truth is there is nothing unique here. Its not as gory as "Hostel," but its main purpose for being barks up the exact same tree! A tree that, as it grows, says less about our own world, and more about us! I'd recommend passing on this one!
