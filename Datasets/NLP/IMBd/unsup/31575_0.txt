Hide and Seek is a movie you will either love or hate. It was not really scary, and sometimes got too silly to invest in these one dimensional characters, but for the most part, the movie delivers. One reason is about to be 12 year old Dakota Fanning(War of the Worlds, Uptown Girls). The actress gives a chilling performance as troubled Emily Callaway, who after her mothers suicide, goes to live with her dad in a new town where her imaginary friend shows up...scary things begin to occur and the movie really gets going. While the ending is somewhat a washout and too out-of-nowhere, the suspense and acting carries the film. While the so-so ending disappoints, Fanning and De Niro certainly don't. 7/10 C+
