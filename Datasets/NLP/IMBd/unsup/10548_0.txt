I like the show. <br /><br />It's humor is dry but that kind of humor matches my own.<br /><br />It took a couple of episodes for me to get warmed up to it, but after that I really like it. I think it is my new favorite show.<br /><br />The problem is, nobody that I know of has heard of the show. So, HBO needs to find someway to get the word out.<br /><br />I am surprised that there is not more action on IMDb about the show. That goes back to the problem of letting people know that it exists. I think I am going to have to find out what the ratings are on the show. It would be interesting to find out.
