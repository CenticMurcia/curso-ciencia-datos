Hi<br /><br />Loved this movie - very thought provoking - saw it two days ago and its been going around and around in my mind.<br /><br />I loved the fact that both scenarios used the same dialogue and the dailogue in both sceanrios fitted perfectly.<br /><br />One thing I don't understand and maybe someone can clear this up for me. At the end the girl confesses while the man doesn't - also at the end the Chinese interrogator is highly praised by his supervisor while the American interrogator goes home - quite unnoticed by anyone. Also the look on Glenn Close's face suggests she hated being a part of the process. I'm just wondering what this signifies - does it mean that these practices are done in the US but reluctantly whilst in china this practice is not made a secret? Any thoughts on this I'd love to hear as the end I think is very crucial cause at this point both stories end up taking very different paths. Also love to hear anyone's comments on what they think would happen next to the girl and the guy.<br /><br />Thanks Patrick
