Walter Matthau stars as Morris Buttermaker, a ex-minor league player turned swimming pool cleaner who is hired to coach a misfit little-league team. Because of the clumsiness and shoddiness of their skills. He enlists the help of 14-year old Amanda (Tatum O' Neal) which causes irritation on and off the field. Buttermaker nevertheless has to whip them into shape for the playoffs. Vic Morrow also stars as rival coach Roy Turner whose team is more focused than the other. The movie spawned two sequels, a short-lived TV series(which was good), and a 2005 remake starring Billy Bob Thornton which is so-so, since it's a carbon copy of the original. Anyway, pass up on the remake and enjoy the original.
