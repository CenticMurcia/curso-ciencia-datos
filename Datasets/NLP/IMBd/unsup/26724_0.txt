In the midst of a wasteland of "Millionaire" and "Friends", I finally started to watch television again. I record it every week, and I'm over 30. The writing is brilliant and it is THE most talked about show at my office water cooler. Definitely the prince on the frog network. Unfortunately, looks like the WB isn't capable of marketing a show properly or standing by one long enough to build an audience. Just want to say thank you to the forces behind Popular.
