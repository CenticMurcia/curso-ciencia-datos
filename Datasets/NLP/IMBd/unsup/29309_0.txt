The title may sound like this would be a satirical comedy spoof,it sure is not, The director Takashi Miike normally has directed horror film, here he attempts a western, with a decided Japanese flavor. .The dialogue is all in spoken (NOT dubbed)English,giving the stylized film a sense of reality. Combine all the qualities of a Japanese Samaurii film & a classic shoot out western ala the Italian Spaghetti westerns of Leone films of the Sixties. The film is very well acted & the production values are first rate.<br /><br />The various stunts & effects are all real I doubt if any CGI was used.<br /><br />The film is quite violent with an ending almost tragic.<br /><br />It is not a great film,BUT is very interesting & well made.<br /><br />The DVD includes excellent extras including 54 minute 'making of' short subject.<br /><br />Ratings *** (out of 4) 87 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10) **<br /><br />** this rating would be about the same on most GOOD American westerns of years back.
