I kept trying to figure out if "Lake Placid 2" was supposed to take place in Maine, like the sequel was, because everyone in this movie has that Southern drawl. Then I see signs for Maine, Arostook County, etc. etc. and I'm like, apparently the directors think a Maine accent and a Southern accent are one and the same. It's an insult to the great state of Maine. Also, the one girl says she's going to Boston College and will be moving to Newton, which she describes as "south of Boston." No, it's not. Newton is west of Boston. So, apparently the folks who did this movie have no concept for geography. As for the movie itself, it's like "Lake Placid" except not nearly as good. The Betty White role of the weird old lady is taken over by Cloris Leachman, who is not nearly as hilarious. The crocodile stomp-a-thon was entertaining, but there wasn't enough of it. And that's the silly love-interest plot line that nobody cares about. Overall, there are worse crocodile movies (i.e., "Blood Surf"), but you could do better.
