This movie must have Ben written by someone with absolutely no exposure to the military. If your big on bashing the military or you think everyone who serves is a drug addicted scam-mer or a high ranking moron, you will probably enjoy this movie. If you have any grasp of reality you will hate it. Buffalo Soldiers is the kind of movie that reminds you that actors are not in general very intelligent.<br /><br />I actually like Ed Harris and Joaquin Phoenix,but how on earth could they lower themselves to make this a piece of crap is beyond me.<br /><br />I can't help but wonder how movies like this get made. You have to at some point realize that what you are making is absolute rubbish.
