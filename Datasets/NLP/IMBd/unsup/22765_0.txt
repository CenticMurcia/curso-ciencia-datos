I'm a fan of Asian gangster/noir films, so I maybe biased somewhat in giving this movie thumbs up. I can totally see why this movie might come across as totally lame; it has half- baked plot with a rather strange pace, underdeveloped characters, and a little substance overall. The movies feels like some Japanese manga comic. But I guess that's the whole Asian gangster/noir genre in general(actually many are pretty bad, I think). Even then, Fulltime Killer was pretty memorable for me. Maybe it is because some of its cool and innovative cinematography? Maybe because the movie had some strange but strong feel, an atmosphere to it. Maybe it's because I thought Kelly Lin was such a hotty. I can't really say. But Fulltime Killer got under my skin. I saw it over and over again.
