This HAS to be one of the most boring movies in the last few years. The story was vague at best, the acting was horrible, and I don't know where they found the music they used - but it was unbearable.<br /><br />Definitely not recommended. If you want to see a good movie, go see Shrek for the fifth time or something. <br /><br />
