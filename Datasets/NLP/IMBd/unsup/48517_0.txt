Avoid these "movies" (and "Filthy McNasty," the other feature on the DVD) at all costs. They are probably only funny to the people who made them, and their friends. Both appear to be made on a home video camera by a group of people who had nothing better to do on a Saturday night. There is no talent involved here (except Debbie Rochon, who deserves much, much better than this). Both movies feature the white director as a black character, complete with blackface and Don King wig. No joke. The external reviews link from IMDb are mostly positive, and I can't understand why. One boldly states that Mulva "deconstructs zombie movies" and that the guy in black face "actually turns that entire minstrel concept onto its narrow-minded head" without suggesting how it could possibly accomplish this. Oh, please. These two movies are the most unfunny attempts at comedy I have ever seen on film.<br /><br />My Rating (both movies): 0/10.
