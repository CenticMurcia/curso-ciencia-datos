The best way I can sum it up is a cross between a David Mamet movie and Starship Troopers. Here is why... There are two kinds of people. The people who understood STARTSHIP TROOPERS, and those who didn't. These are people who looked at the superficial exterior and then stopped there, failing to see the true brilliance of the satire and the other fascinating qualities it had to offer. These are the kind of people who look at the sand on the beach, and see only dry sand. They then assume that all the sand is dry, even though it is wet just below the surface.<br /><br />Best men is like Mamet in that the dialogue is not the way real people talk, but is stylized, much like Shakespeare stylized his. The way shakespeare wrote was far from the way people talked back then. BEST MEN actually has close ties to shakespeare, as his work plays a major part in the plot. The film is in a way a tribute to shakespeare and his work. The script is in my opinion one of the best and most layered scripts I have ever seen or heared. Unfortunately I don't know if most people will realize how good it really is. The acting is acceptable for the most part. The only really great performances are turned in by Dean Kane, and Brad Dourif (who is one of my very favorite character actors.<br /><br />If you are going to see this movie, I would recommend seeing it with a completely open mind, have no pre-notions of what it will be, because you won't get what you are expecting. I didn't, I expected a Drew Barrymore movie, but she actually has a rather small role, but I good one.
