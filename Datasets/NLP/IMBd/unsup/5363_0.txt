This is drek. Kyle McClanahan, Patrick Stewart in the Jules Verne story? How could it go wrong? Hallmark is not what it was. They used to do, at worst, a Cliff Notes version of stories that leaned toward the sappy, So I thought their version of "MI" would at least be fun here and there...<br /><br />The rewrite that began as one story got rewritten and raked over.<br /><br />I watched about 45 minutes of a 2 part movie?...and it was obvious that when they shot it the story was in flux. Vernes' story is completely hollowed out and subverted into the most shameful of cash-cows. I think that if the 3 well known stars in this new what a mess it would turn into they would not have been in it. It tries to make hay from the "Pirates of the Caribbean" popularity and add some bad pirates in worse costumes searching for treasure-where else but on the Mysterious Island. I just couldn't stand more than I saw when the "pirates of the pop-scene" came aboard so malevolently. Any resemblance to Vernes work is minimal and the writers of this junk should be marooned on an island somewhere! Fay-Wah! (Mandarin for "Nonsense!" I think)
