OK so, the idea is good but the movie overall feels soooo shallow. Yes there is gore....lots and lots of gore, but does that really save the movie from being so bland and uninteresting??? No! <br /><br />The main character 'Jake Sawyer' is so bland that all he seems to do in this movie is tattooing people and then following them to a club/party whatever to meet asshole after asshole after asshole, seriously nearly every person he meets is an asshole.<br /><br />The plot is confusing and mind-numbing, Jake unknowingly plays a role in releasing a deadly spirit as he attempts to learn tatau, the Samoan tradition of tattooing and at the same time trying to hook up with an asshole father's daughter who has also an asshole of a brother, the 3 are as bland as Jake himself (with possible exception of the asshole father). So from the moment Jake unleashes the 'deadly' spirit(which by cutting himself at the end of an samoan tattoo stick he ROBBED!!!),This 'deadly' spirit has the job of killing people with his techniques of samoan tattooing, oh yeah and can only be seen in a mirror...why??? I don't know, but he can only kill people if Jake has tattooed the people AFTER he cut himself.....if you're getting confused by this so-called mindless plot, you're not the only one.<br /><br />So i'm gonna wrap up and put down 5 things i didn't like about this film: <br /><br />1. Why in the holy mother of f**k did we have to see Jake's ass in front of the camera...WHY?!?!?(eye-candy for women) <br /><br />2. Bland characters including the main characters <br /><br />3. poor plot <br /><br />4. uninteresting killer <br /><br />5. overall boring This film is...is...pointless, mind-numbing and bland. I really do not like this film, in fact all that there was in this film were the tattoo's.<br /><br />2/10 = BULLS**T!!<br /><br />Youtube Channel: MrRandomReviewer <br /><br />XBL gamertag: RatedRIcHIe 316
