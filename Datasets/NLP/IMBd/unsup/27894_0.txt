Adam Sandler's best, by far. This movie is funny from start to finish. I don't understand why people complain about Chubbs wooden hand, it's obviously fake, thats whats so funny. If you look in goofs, it says u can see his hand...u can see it the whole time, his frickin prosthetic is about 2 feet longer than it should be (exaggeration maybe). Adam is having a good time as usual, and he is really funny in this movie, where as in some other ones, just strange. The only part I didnt like is Bob Barker winning a fight. I guess that was his stipulation for doing the movie, but he fights like a sissy, not that Sandler looks like he can fight..although he does play a hockey player..sigh.. Great movie, don't take it seriously. have a good time like sandler 10/10
