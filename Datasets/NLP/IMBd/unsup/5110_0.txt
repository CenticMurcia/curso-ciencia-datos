This is a perfect hindi masala movie - it has everything - love, action, comedy, good songs and a great story. Amar, Akbar and Anthony are all brothers separated when they are very young. However fate has them crossing paths and eventually a big family re-union at the end.<br /><br />You walk out of the film, however, only remembering Amitabh as Anthony. He is at his hilarious best. There are places when he becomes the Angry Young Man he is famous for - but his comedy scenes are what set him apart in this movie. The song "My name is Anthony Gonsalves" is an absolute classic and himself talking into the mirror after being beaten up is another great scene.<br /><br />All in all if you want a movie to entertain you for 3 hours this is it.
