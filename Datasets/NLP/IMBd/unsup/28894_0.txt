This movie very well prevents itself from becoming a soap opera. The story has a stark realism to it that makes one realize that things weren't that different almost seventy years ago. Dunne and Grant play a couple who ends up adopting. Dunne is a pretty easy-going, sensible woman, but Grant shows a tendency to be rather flighty and impulsive. After some hard lessons in life, including losing their baby during an earthquake in Japan (making it impossible for them to also have any natural born children as a couple), the two move to a nice, small town in northern California.<br /><br />They then decide to adopt a child, but not without difficulty. It is very difficult to adopt, and they are put on a waiting list. Through the help of a kindly adoption worker, they are able to adopt a little girl. It is very realistic, how the father (Grant) doesn't warm up to the idea of raising a girl. Yet, both parents instantly fall for the little girl. Thus, begins their adventure in raising a new child.<br /><br />An old friend and colleague from New York City (Buchanan)shows up one day. The couple is trying to run a small town paper. They need all the help they can. Their paper's circulation remains a constant 908. Their old friend, is an former orphan/adopted child and he knows more than the couple about raising babies. In fact, he shows them both how to make a proper diaper.<br /><br />However, two challenges are ahead. First, they have to close down the paper until they get their finances together. Because they don't hold jobs, they are forced before a judge to plead their case. This is real life in 1941 and 2008. Once that challenge is matched, they lose their daughter to a sudden illness. It almost breaks up their marriage, but the adoption worker saves the day by calling them with news that she found a boy for them to adopt.<br /><br />The movie is very good. At times, it gets almost too sentimental, but it always saves itself from that by bringing the "real world" into the film. There are real challenges in both the marriage and the adoption. They aren't rich. They worry about finances and the difficulties of raising a child. It is real life.
