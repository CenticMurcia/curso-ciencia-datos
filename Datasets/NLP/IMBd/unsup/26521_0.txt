Stuart Gordan the master of really (and I mean REALLY) cheezy literature based horror movies (Re-Animater, Pit and the Pendulem, Castle Freak, From Beyond etc.) brings us FORTRESS, a Christopher Lambert, Sci-Fi classic. Look it is a little cheezy, but that is Gordon's style. If you like Sci-Fi and if you like Christopher Lambert, you'll probably like this movie.<br /><br />Sometimes I feel a little bad for Lambert. He's an international star, who's career looked so promising after GREYSTOKE in 1984. He got type casted as the sword guy do to the popularity of HIGHLANDER and has been making nothing, but straight to video action/dramas for the past 15 years. Yeah, I feel bad for him, but then, I watch his movies. What can I say? I really enjoy watching them. Most of them may be cheezy or even bad, but when I go to the video store and I see a new Lambert box sitting on the shelf I get excited. So yeah, maybe his career didn't go the way he had planned and maybe he is stuck in "straight to video", but thank God he is! That way when guys like me go to the video store and we're not in the mood for some hollywood bullsh*t, and we've rented every horror movie on the shelves a hundred times, and there hasn't been a new Bruce Campbell "straight to video" classic released in ages, we can pick up one (or all) of the seven Christopher Lambert videos that have come out that week and know that our weekend is not going to be a complete waste!
