Awful anime. The animation is even more limited than the stuff Rankin Bass would turn out years later. Its dubbed by Chuck McCann and friends for the Hal Roach Studios and its awful. I can't tell if the source was bad or the English dub, but its bad. Ten minutes and I was screaming, "no no no" while reaching for a bottle of rat poison... for the cartoon rat on screen, not me. I can't believe I've had this compared to the films of Disney, I don't think Disney ever made a movie this bad, or if they did they certainly didn't release it for the public to see. Not worth the time effort or money to see it.<br /><br />Avoid it if at all possible
