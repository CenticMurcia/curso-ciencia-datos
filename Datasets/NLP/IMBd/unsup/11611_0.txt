This movie is one of the best Robert De Niro films ever made. Its endlessly quotable and has enough comedy and action to keep everyone happy. Watch out for Dennis Farina as Jimmy Serrano. The funniest part he's played until Get Shorty's Ray Bones. The banter between Johnaton Mardukas and Jack Walsh is genius and watch for Joe Pantoliano playing basically the same part he would play later on in Bad Boys. I would recommend this to anyone with a decent taste in movies. 7.5 is an abomination for such an excellent film. Everybody needs to see it and then give it the rightful place it deserves 10/10. More laughs can be gotten from Yaphat Kotto's portrayal of Alonzo Mosely FBI. It has solid acting and a solid script. It is an absolute must see for fans of De Niro or films like Welcome to the Jungle or buddy comedies. It's a film that will never become dated or old. In fact am going to watch it again now
