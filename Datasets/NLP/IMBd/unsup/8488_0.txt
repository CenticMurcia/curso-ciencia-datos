This was the first Batman cartoon I have seen I first seen it when i was about 5 years old and this is how i got the cartoon batman also staring Kevin Conroy as batman and mark hamill as The Joker. The things that make this movie so good are that there is lots of action in it the storyline is great. The Cartoon effects are really good. The way the movie is set like it is really dark and it just makes the movie a classic. Also the voice over actors are really good such as Kevin Conroy as batman, And Efrem Zimbalist Jr. as Alfred. And the villains are great such as mark hamill as The Joker, and Dana Delany as The Phantasm. So I am sure that you will not be disappointed with Batman Mask of The Phantasm because it is really good. So make sure that you rent or buy Batman Mask of The Phantasm because it is a great movie.<br /><br />Overall score: ********** out of ********** <br /><br />***** out of *****
