This is not a movie for Julia Roberts. She is one of my favorite actresses and she shines always (wherever she's in). I, just, think she should play in better roles. This movie doesn't suck but it is nothing special (at all). This one and "Runaway Bride" are the worst movies of her. As I said before they're not awful but Julia Roberts deserves more than this. The best movies of her are: "Pretty woman" (of course), "Nothing Hill" and "Erin Brockovich". I'm looking forward for more of her brilliant movies. 4/10
