The obvious similarities start with the title abbreviations E.T. vs. CJ7<br /><br />Then the healing power of the CJ7 vs. the "healing finger" of ET. The low battery and illness of CJ7 and ET after the battery wears off. In general very predictable and preachy of the "good values".<br /><br />The cockroach scene was really gross and useless - THEY ARE POOR WE GOT THAT. And for god sake the kid doesn't need to be always dirty - poor DOESN'T EQUAL DIRTY. Poor people wash and take bath too. Please STOP that BS!<br /><br />It sounds like china government sponsored propaganda art to create obedient citizens.<br /><br />On the plus side beautiful photography and excellent performances - especially from the young actors.
