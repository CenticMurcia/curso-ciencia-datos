Good indeed but little seen... <br /><br />The horrors of theses times are haunting the picture but the confined atmosphere of the apartment muffles a little the sound of the outside. This is a movie on dilemmas : The dilemma of the loss of identity versus the almost certain loss of life is in Alec young wife. The dilema of acceptable but full of compromision life versus hardship and bad food is in Steffania. The dilema of a new love taking the place of a previous one is in Alec.<br /><br />Making choices was hard, nobody was spared. The inspiration of Huis Clos by Sartre is real but the film retains a fabulous originality and shows very good actors. A must see.
