Loved this show as a kid, about 18 years ago. I always had a vague memory about the show, and could never find information about it. Thank you for helping me find this, IMDb users! From what I do remember about the show, at the beginning of each episode, a guy crawled through a log to get access to a secret clearing in the woods. There, he would play his guitar and sing songs. The show aired sometime in the 80's and perhaps early 90's. <br /><br />By any chance, does anyone remember a show which would air around the same years as this show where there was a woman walking around with a net. I can't remember if she was catching bugs or animal watching. Does this ring a bell for anyone?
