I found Michael Crichton's novel "Timeline" to be one of those - can't put it down - experiences.<br /><br />One of my acoustic music jam buddies worked post-production (computer) on this film, so I REALLY wanted to like it. No such luck. So much of the plot and characters have been changed, persons familiar with the novel are not going to accept this as the "Timeline" that they know.<br /><br />I am confused; if the film writers are going to tamper with EVERYTHING why even claim association with the book.<br /><br />Like "Sphere" this is a classic example of a good idea gone very wrong.<br /><br />Watch it if you like, but don't say that you were not warned.
