Paul Naschy plays Waldemar Daninsky  handsome, heroic and more than a little hairy during the full moon. Yes, Daninsky is a werewolf and, once again, the curse can only be broken by the one who truly loves him.<br /><br />Enter two Euro-hotties  Elvira and Genevieve  searching for the fabled tomb of a powerful witch/vampire, Countess Wandessa. Daninsky offers them refuge when they become lost, and it is not long before he becomes romantically involved with Elvira (convenient, eh?). They find the tomb and stupidly remove the cross embedded in Wandessa's rotting corpse. Before long, the vampire arises and attacks Genevieve, who becomes one of the undead herself.<br /><br />With a full moon on the way, bloodsuckers on the loose, and a werewolf for a boyfriend, can Elvira save the day? The Werewolf Shadow lacks the gore and gratuitous nudity that usually make these affairs bearable, and despite some unintentionally chuckle-worthy moments, the film is rather slow and uneventful. There are some nice atmospheric scenes and the ladies are pretty easy on the eye, but this is still not reason enough to recommend this lacklustre effort.<br /><br />Definitely one for Paul Naschy completists only.
