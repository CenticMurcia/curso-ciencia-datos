It's boring. A slow, stupid movie about people trying to find themselves and where they want to be in life. I used to like these gen-x movies too, but now I find them irritating. Maybe if I had seen this when it first came out I would have loved it, but today, it's just dull and stupid. The dialog and things the people do just isn't believable. I think it's trying to go for a "higher message" here but it just doesn't reach it. Sort of an after-thought of a movie. Like "OH Gee we have these people here and they're somewhat famous let's make them say lines and drive around and stuff". Pass. It's boring. OK one more line of text and DONE! Yah don't see it.
