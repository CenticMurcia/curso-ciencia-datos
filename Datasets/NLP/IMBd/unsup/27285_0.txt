One of the finest pieces of historical drama I have ever seen, if only the BBC could still produce such quality television.<br /><br />The story covers around 70 years of epoch making history, from the perspective of one of imperial Rome's most unusual and unlikely Emperors, Claudius. For most of his life he is regarded with contempt by most members of his family, due to his seriously debilitating stutter and ungainly limp, attributes most unwelcome in the elite family of Imperial Rome. Derek Jacobi is simply outstanding in his portrayal of Claudius, as you watch him grow from boy to youth, man to Emperor. He seems by the end of the series to become part of your own family, and you find yourself comparing the historical figure to todays political leaders. However, my personal favourite has to be Caligula, played with breathtaking vigour by John Hurt. This man has the ability to both terrify and entertain in a single scene. His timing and delivery leave you crying with laughter, even if the subject matter is murderously horrific. You even find yourself liking the tyrant.<br /><br />All in all, this output of 1970's British broadcasting can only be described as a masterpiece.<br /><br />note: it's been rumoured that I, Claudius was the inspiration for HBO's latest multi million pound production "Rome", again made in conjunction with the BBC. Almost certainly another classic in the making.
