Something about the muppets always got my confused like why are the muppets ironically related to the puppets. and there name is so similar! Why i ask you! Why! but besides that the movie can be described as a ghost of the muppets before the whole Gonzo incident with the T.V. that was something i wasn't expecting! exclamation mark! exclamation mark! And with all that out aside this movie shows a lot of power and the ability to rule over all the muppets in Muppet land, or wherever it is that they come from. And they should have put in Samuel L. Jackson in the snakes on the movie! It would have got so much more ratings and more viewers! But possibly the best part of the movie was when he got his cookie back from the evil critiques! So all in all this is a well rounded movie but since its muppets it gets a extra point. So remember kids there is such a thing as the Bigfoot Nessy man! (Bigfoot+ loch Nessy monster+ Bogey man)
