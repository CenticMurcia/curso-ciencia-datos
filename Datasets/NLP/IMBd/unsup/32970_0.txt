This film is the rock bottom of awful. If I heard one more character calling "Lucy" I was going to be sick. The plot line is thin as is the script. The actors did the best they could with a terrible script. It was so predictable. Scary? I'll say only one scene in the entire film got my attention for a split second. For shock value they threw in a quick eye blinking scene of dead, mutilated pigs. Same old, same old, a kid so stupid she wanders around in the middle of the night with a flashlight, doors that won't open no matter how long the guy on the outside says open the door. This film just wasted more than an hour of my time.
