This is a film about human relationships and loneliness, reaching out and healing. It is not your typical old man seduces young beauty that you may expect. It is a thoughtful and introspective film. I think more than anything the title L'idole, or The Idol, is meant to revolve around the James Hong character. In that everyone in the building in which he lives respects him, and when a young and beautiful new tenant played wonderfully by Leelee Sobieski comes into the picture. He is the only one who finds a real meaningful connection with her. Therefore the rest of the buildings tenants also become somewhat envious of him in their own emptiness of depth-less or stale relationships as he and the new beauty grow closer. Perhaps even some viewers will be envious of the graceful and experienced Hong character, and I think that is part of the point. I guess you could twist around the idol idea, and say that Sobieski is the idolized one in certain ways. Nonetheless, loneliness and disconnect seem to be a major theme here. Pretty much every character seems to struggle with anything that would resemble a deep or truly meaningful relationship. All in all, L'idole is an intriguing watch as both James Hong and Leelee Sobieski are hard to not watch, as they easily out act the average Hollywood standards. The supporting cast also fits very well here, helping to make this a quality piece of character driven film.
