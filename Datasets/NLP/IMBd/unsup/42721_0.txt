Let's start with an irrelevant montage of karate training that consists entirely of fresh-air punches and kicks. The cover on the DVD bears no resemblance to the movie, which is much worse, but let's cut to a montage of the same karate training with crappy music. Plot? Ha! There's 3 annoying kids who who communicate entirely in sarcasm talking about a white-dragon character/crime fighter but it's difficult to know if he's real or not because we've just cut to a montage of fresh-air karate training again (really the same 3 kids just wearing masks). Now Just when you think the plot gets going somewhere, there's another cut to the bad guy (presumably the bad guy, he's really a scrawny kid) with his henchmen dropping nun-chucks on their feet and weather he's real or not isn't entirely clear as we cut once again to the 3 main characters and another training montage that is entirely identical to all the others before it. The music sounds like a theme to some crappy kids TV show and just makes you want to bury your fist through the TV speakers after hearing it for the 1000th time.<br /><br />And apart from a truly bizarre fight sequence in a carnival tent involving Robert Z'Dar and a lot of balloons, that really is the entire movie. But just to finish off, cut to a training montage of fresh-air punches and kicks. I gave up counting after the 6th repeat.
