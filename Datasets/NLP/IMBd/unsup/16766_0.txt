The title suggests a comedy, but it's more like a fluffy drama about a woman who starts to become jealous when her husband lavishes too much attention on his secretary. It's fairly well done, but perhaps it would have worked better as a comedy. The cast is stellar. Gable is charming in typical role of the virile male who makes the ladies swoon. Loy is wonderful as the loving wife, a role she played often. Harlow is effectively subdued as the devoted secretary. Stewart, in only his fifth film, shows the screen persona that would soon carry him to super stardom. Unfortunately, all this star power is undermined by the mediocre script.
