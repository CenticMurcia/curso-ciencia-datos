Where to begin? The fact the term "Nephilim", which actually means the offspring of Angels and humans, is used for the Fallen Angels themselves (correctly termed "Grigori")? Or howabout Thelma the Lesbian Ghost, who can't touch people, but can touch everything else, which includes opening doors, eating food, changing her clothes (and hair) and who casts a shadow? Then there's the fact that no one notices Cassie speaking to what would appear to be nobody at all, even when she's in a crowded room with people right next to her? And what the hell kind of high school is it where they allow male and female students to freely visit each other's rooms, unsupervised, and where teachers go to bars with the students? And what's the drinking age in England, anyway? I thought it was 19, but here we have high school juniors going to bars. And when Ella shows up, no one notices that she wears the same outfit every single day? But such details aside, nothing compares to the tedious, drawn-out, snail-paced storytelling style. Such a shame, too. This show had all the ingredients for being really good, but, I hate to say it, that dopey show Charmed was more exciting. And here I thought British TV shows were better than ours.
