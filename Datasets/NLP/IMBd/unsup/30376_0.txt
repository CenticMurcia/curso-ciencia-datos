You look. You experience time. You dream. Reality is a combination of all three. The Inland Empire is not Hollywood, the town of make believe, but you and your inner empire of thought and delusion.<br /><br />Movies are imaginary concepts, yet we all get caught in the net,like lost fish. Our knowledge of the real is not our five senses alone, but a mix of memory and wish.<br /><br />Intertwined with loss and hope. Loss of the past and hope for the future neither of which exist, except in mind.<br /><br />This is an expanded sit-com.<br /><br />A movie within a movie within a nightmare. Do spiders have nightmares? Do you have to be big or small to have emotions? A snail or an ape?
