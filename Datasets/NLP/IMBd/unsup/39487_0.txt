.............this is nothing compared with the book of the same name. Occasionally you'll get movie/ miniseries conversions that are better than the book (Green Mile, Shawshank Redemption, Misery, Stand By Me), some that are different to the book but ultimately on a par (Christine) but from the ones I've seen so far, more often than not they get completely lost in translation; this is a classic example. It would probably be a good idea to see the film first then read the book to note the comparison, and in doing so also raise the bar on the story. If you want to be entertained, I'd suggest going for the above title or maybe 'Storm of the Century'.
