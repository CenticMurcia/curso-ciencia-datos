Fannie Hurst's novel came to the screen in 1934.<br /><br />I have to say that while the picture was good, the 1959 remake with Lana Turner was far better. That one really drained you with the emotional stops pulled out by Turner, Susan Kohner and Juanita Moore. With the exception of Louise Beavers, that emotional drain is missing.<br /><br />Warren William who played Colbert's love interest was as stiff as a board. He was very similar to John Barrymore in appearance but that's about it. Colbert did not show what I call a sharp range in this film as did Fredi Washington, as the daughter who was ashamed of being black.<br /><br />The story line was better here in that it allowed for both women to go from poverty to wealth.<br /><br />The film literally dealt with two women who made a success for themselves financially but were unable to cope with motherhood. It's really a shame that Hurst had Colbert taking advantage of the Beavers character by offering her only a 20% share of the business.<br /><br />I never believed that the daughter was ashamed of being black, rather, she was angry at the fact that black people did not have the same opportunities as whites.<br /><br />The scene in the classroom and that funeral will forever tug at your heart.
