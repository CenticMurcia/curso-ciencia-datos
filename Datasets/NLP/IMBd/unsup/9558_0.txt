This tenth Bobby Jones short feature is the first one in this series I've seen and I was pleasantly surprised. It isn't just some dry golf lesson that only golfers could appreciate, but a little humor and story involved in it, with a couple of famous Hollywood personalities. However, more than anything, it shows off the amazing talents of the great golfer Bobby Jones.<br /><br />The "story" is a side bet that comedian Joe E. Brown (witnessed by actor Edward G. Robinson) makes with Jones on the course one day. He bets he can beat Bobby if the latter is forced to hit the ball from wherever the comedian hits it off the tee, and vice-versa. Of course, Brown hits it in horrible places, behind trees, in ditches, buried in sand traps, etc., but Jones shows how he still manages to get the ball not only on the green but near the hole, out of their almost-impossible conditions.<br /><br />As a past golfer, I can appreciate some of these shots by Jones. They are amazing. For example: few, if any, golfers today, including Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson, could hit a one-iron as Jones does here.<br /><br />This turned out to be a fun little bonus feature. It was part of the DVD from the feature film, "Bullets Or Ballots."
