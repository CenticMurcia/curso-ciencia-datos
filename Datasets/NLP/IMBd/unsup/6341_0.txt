Watching this movie, you would never guess that it was made with a budget of under $10,000 or that this is writer/director Thomas Ikimi's first film. It's a truly artistic expression in film that is metaphysical, existential, and flat out brilliant. The sombre mood is consistent throughout, there are many memorable performances, and the plot takes many unpredictable twists and turns.<br /><br />Limbo takes the concept of being trapped in a single hour, and how the lines between right and wrong, good and evil, begin to blur when there are no consequences to ones actions. It is a film worthy of great praise and it is strongest in the areas that matter most; the story.<br /><br />Limbo seems to have been influenced by film noir, Hitchcock, Memento, Usual Suspects, Unbreakable, Fight Club, The Man Who Wasn't There, The Matrix and the original Twilight Zone. Limbo manages to match the quality of story telling of all of these. It simultaneously reminds one of so many films and yet it is so remarkably unique.<br /><br />Anyone who enjoys the titles I mentioned should give Limbo a chance, it is a decision you will not regret.
