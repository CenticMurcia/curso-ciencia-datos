One of the best performances of the year (2007), Christian Slater's acting is superb and in fact spectacular. Completely disposing of his own personal character, Mr. Slater has been able to transform himself entirely in this very performance labored production as a deranged employee. Heavy elements of BRAZIL (1985) come to mind in this updated version of contemporary fantasy-reality of the harsh facts of corporate existence and the alienation from the human compassion in today's civilization. This production incorporates startling relevant human relation issues that pertain to today's violent world. With the apparent increasing media attention to shootings in malls and schools by individuals whose behavior has bewildered America, this movie begins to shed some light on this tragic existence of some individuals in our Country. This innovative production value with a new fresh look together with an intense drama script come together to make this one of the best movies of the year. Except perhaps for an ending that could have gone in a number of different directions, this movie is the complete package for emotional engagement, dazzling visual images, this movie is a must see for anybody who is concerned about humanity in today's modern world. Nine out of Ten Stars.
