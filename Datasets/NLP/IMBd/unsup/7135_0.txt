For an independent film, this movie has a great cast. The acting is good, the stunts are simple but done well, and the makeup is great.<br /><br />As an inspiring SFX Makeup artist, I enjoyed the makeup and gore effects best. Most of the horror scenes are done with makeup, like the mummies/zombies and the characters that die by zombie attacks and other oddities, but there are a few CGI effects as well.<br /><br />If your an indie horror fan, i would highly recommend checking this out... for a couple hours of your time its worth it!<br /><br />As far as the release date, American World has not given an exact date, but I've heard its set for early 2006...Jan/Feb.
