This is lousy beyond expression. All necessary comments why so are already written! It's not a matter of taste or different senses of humor or anything negotiable. This movie is simply a physical offense and a cry in' shame for the German film history! The only acceptable part are the 20 seconds (!) for Helge as Gandalf, and off! RÃ¼diger Hoffman also can't save this. Though his play as the mirror is okay, he could never make anything out of this that I could watch and stand. Boris Aljinovic as well. Neither can Cosma. Watching adult men stomping through the woods in a line, chanting "Hey dwarfs Ho!" (the only line of the song) for about 4 minutes is a reason for a day in court!
