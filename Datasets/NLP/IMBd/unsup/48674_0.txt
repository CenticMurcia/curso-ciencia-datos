I think every movie deserves a chance but! The Creature wasnt nice does not deserve even one minute of the 90 plus minutes of my life I wasted watching this piece of space waste!!!!!!!! My friend bought this attempt at a movie for $6 dollars Canadian at walmart I think that with todays exchange rate thats less than a dollar American.
