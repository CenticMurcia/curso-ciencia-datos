By the early '80s, the car chase genre began to wind down. During his final years of being president of New World Pictures, Roger Corman produced another typical but fun car chase comedy starring Jimmy McNichol as a mischievous teenager who loves to steal cars and having the local sheriff and his bumbling deputies chase after him. The sheriff's daughter, who's planning to be in the next homecoming parade at her high school is kidnapped by McNichol, and from then on, it an all-out auto war between the two starry-eyed kids, the cops, and other hot-dogging speed freaks.<br /><br />The reason this is a lesser effort from Corman is that much of the car chase sequences were lifted from other movies he produced, particularly "Moving Violation", "Eat My Dust", "Grand Theft Auto", and "Thunder And Lightning", albeit with new footage and different sound effects dubbed in. However, if people haven't seen those movies, it shouldn't be a problem for them to watch it. It was directed by long-time collaborator Charles B. Griffith, who also wrote and directed "Eat My Dust" and has an uncredited small part as one of the deputies. There's also a sub-plot involving a deranged group of sheiks out to uncover a secret recipe of moonshine...huh? Anyway check the movie out when you have the chance to.
