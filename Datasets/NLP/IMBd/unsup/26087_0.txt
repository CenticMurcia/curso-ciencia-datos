Mediterranean playboys woo the affections of sexy tourists, and treat them to fun and frivolity aboard their yacht, while a ferocious tiger shark cleans up after them.<br /><br />Sordid, heavy-handed approach to the conventional shark tale, with perennial Cardona leading man Hugo Stiglitz, tag-teamed with Andres Garcia (no, not Andy Garcia) acting like a pair of macho morons in pursuit of the next booze-fuelled orgy. Somewhere amid all the frolicking, their care-free capers are interrupted by the occasional graphically depicted shark attack.<br /><br />The 130-odd minute cut of this yawn fest is an endurance test; the audience hanging on, in the forlorn hope of actually seeing a shark attack. Trimmed down versions don't fare much better, unless you like the idea of a threesome pact being broken by a fourth contender, who's about 15 feet long and lives underwater.<br /><br />A diverse cast can't recover any dignity to the proceedings, with Susan George as the main love interest (there are so many, it's hard to keep track), and Fiona Lewis and Priscilla Barnes popping in for a good time, not a long time, just to add some comforting familiarity for non-Spanish speaking audiences.<br /><br />Overall, while the all-too-few shark attack scenes look convincing, and the multitude of semi-nude babes are distracting, it's a labour that will leave you feeling betrayed: this isn't a shark movie. It's soft porn and a deep throat.
