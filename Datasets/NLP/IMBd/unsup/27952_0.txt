This felt like watching a Lifetime Original. Only I had to pay for this sanctimonious tripe. I'm all in favor of truly inspirational, uplifting drama, but for the love of god, give me some substance. Overly broad acting, self importance, and unbelievable characters make up the bulk of this meaningless drivel. And what's with getting it to play simultaneously at different theaters? And why did it have to play in the middle of the day? It was a beautiful day. I could have been at the beach, but no, I was inside, giving my time, and, let's face it, my money, to this waste of celluloid. The music was awful and cheesy. I've seen lower budget films do a better job at cinematography. The clouds were pretty, I suppose. I kept expecting Michael Landon to be flying through them. Tragically, he is not around to elevate this to watch ability. Very unfullfilling.
