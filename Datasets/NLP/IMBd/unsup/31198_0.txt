Back in the Stone Age of cable television, this was one of the few programs that worked as enjoyable, reliable nightly entertainment. You could depend upon it when you tuned in. Good times.<br /><br />"Night After Night" aired opposite the "Tonight Show" and snagged a younger (and much smaller) audience. It deserves to be released on DVD. I would gladly pay to see it again. Allan Havey never found a better outlet for his talent.<br /><br />The Audience of One was a cute bit that worked well. I also thought the running gag with Dave, the weird Weather Guy, was priceless. The banter between Nick Bakay and Allan was comparable to that of Johnny Carson and Ed McMahon, or David Lettermen and Paul Shaffer.<br /><br />"Night After Night" is sorely missed.
