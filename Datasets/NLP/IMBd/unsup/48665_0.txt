I'm 15, I watched this movie with my younger brother (11). Please keep this is mind when reading this review.<br /><br />This film is extremely cliché (SPOILER SPOILER ---workaholic father realises he does not know his family so hires an RV to go on the road with his "hardcore" son, sarcastic teenage daughter and "perfect" wife. Disaster of course, ensues, they meet a "madcap" family and try to avoid them but fail and after a lot of chaos eventually manage to become best friends and LOVE is returned!)SPOILER OVER.<br /><br />We rented this movie as we believed it would be light hearted, clean family humour. It is actually probably the grossest movie in history.<br /><br />The majority of the sentences refer to "crap" "poop" "t*rd" or "sh!t" and there is one particularly disgusting scene in which the Father (Robin Williams, this movie's selling point) gets sprayed in the stuff. It was then my brother said "Turn it off! Its gross and not even funny!" but, believed it would get better we carried on.<br /><br />Direction was OK, plot was cliché, SOME STEREOTYPICAL acting was good (the "odd" family parents and the younger son) albeit "Jojo" whose sarcastic teenager whose lines left me saying "What?". This film is ideal for a 6-9 aged audience as only that audience would appreciate its toilet humour and supposed "hilarious" scenes.<br /><br />If you consider "RV" funny, please compare with "Little Miss Sunshine" and realise what a "rolling t*rd" (which the family lovingly christen the RV) of a movie this is! <br /><br />My Brothers comment? : Just DON'T watch "RV".
