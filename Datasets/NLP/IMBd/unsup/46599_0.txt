I got this DVD for free, with a chicken dinner, no less. The chicken dinner was not very good but it was way better than this movie. Actually, I don't think I've ever rated a movie a 1 before, but that's only because IMDb does not allow a minus or a zero. The cast, I can't believe they would even come within a mile of this horrendous bomb, but they did, many of them, all broke, I suppose. Ed Asner, Hal Holbrook (who has one of the most appalling jobs - a father offering his 15 year old daughter as a bride to the most absolutely appalling cad), James Cromwell, Renee Zelweger and on and on. There is no script, no development of character (apart from a tiny slice of the James Cromwell bit)so many clich√©s it should be shown as how NOT to make a movie. I did not see it all the way to the end, my gag meter had maxed out and I needed to take a breath of fresh air. Shame on all concerned. 1 out of 10 for those 1000 unfortunate bit player brides running through San Francisco.
