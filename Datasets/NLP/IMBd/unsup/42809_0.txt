I have seen some bad movies in my day, but this is the worst by far. I could find nothing in it to keep me watching it. No suspense, likable characters, engaging plot, nothing. The music is annoying and too loud. I understand this was a low-budget film (less than $20,000), but why bother? I tried to watch this movie with my wife and we had to keep pausing the thing in an attempt to figure out whether a particular scene was a flashback, a dream, or what. Even the premise of the film was confusing. Why worry about serotonin levels when you are making a clone? Transplant a soul?, consciousness? Is all that necessary when making clone?
