Although this movie is in French and dubbed in English, the most important thing required to enjoy this movie is using the English subtitles even though the speech is in English...the voice over seems to be competing with the background movie sound (rain, music) so it is difficult to make out the conversations without it.<br /><br />The movie is a bit difficult to follow during the first portion of the movie, but that alone is usually a positive for me as this isn't a movie whose plot is known 10 minutes into the movie. The movie takes place predominantly in France, so the scenery is pleasant. Due to the voice over, the dialog is sub par but the pace and mystery of the movie is very good and the story line isn't bad for a thriller type movie.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment for me was not having Jean Reno dub his own voice, but other than that, I did enjoy the movie.
