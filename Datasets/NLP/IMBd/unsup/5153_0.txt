If you're like me and drool like an over-hormonal teenager when that unlikely sex-symbol James Nesbitt smiles his cheeky-charming smile then you MUST go and see this film.<br /><br />Even if you don't, I'd highly recommend it. As with the director's previous Brit-hit `The Full Monty' this provides plenty of laughs, many colourful characters and some poignant moments. They also managed to fit a love-interest into a prison movie (hard to do and not particularly convincing but fun to watch nonetheless).<br /><br />Perhaps not as belly-laughingly funny as the Full Monty, but still loads of laugh-out-loud moments and an all-round enjoyable film.
