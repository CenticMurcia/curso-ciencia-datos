Boy, I thought seeing W.C. Fields and Mae West in the same movie would really be something! However, the only thing it turned out to be was just plain annoying. I could barely get past the first 15 minutes. <br /><br />West's "routine" gets tiresome in a hurry. All she does, scene after scene, is roll up her eyes and say something she thinks is clever and-or funny. Since she co-wrote the script with Fields, I'm sure she thought those lines were good, but I heard nothing humorous in them. The soft lens on her on every time is pretty obvious, too. What were they trying to cover up? <br /><br />Her reputation is far better than her performance.<br /><br />As for Fields, he was better off in his own films where he could ham it up on his own. He had a few amusing bits, but nothing memorable.
