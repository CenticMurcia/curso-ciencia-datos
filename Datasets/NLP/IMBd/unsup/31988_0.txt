I got REALLY excited when I saw this movie in a Blockbuster one day. I kept telling people I wanted to see it really badly...as the title is my name. I finally caught up with this movie about a month ago and was thoroughly disappointed.<br /><br />It cracks me up that so many say that people who don't like the movie just didn't understand it's "brilliance." I understood what was going on. I got the "twist" ending where everything ends up being a sad delusion. The fact is, it just wasn't that great.<br /><br />People kept asking how the psych was also the nanny. In her delusional world, all the characters still had parts. The psychiatrist visits weren't real, just like none of the life after the accident was real. These are known as coping mechanisms. She was trying to cope with the loss and pain, so she created an alternate reality in her mind.<br /><br />At the end of the movie, you get the real story.<br /><br />TBH, I enjoyed it at first, but at the end, I felt like I had just wasted that time. It's rare for me to say that about a movie. I can almost ALWAYS find something I like. I really WANTED this movie to be good, but the the whole point didn't seem very original to me, and I feel like I've seen twists like this done a lot better.<br /><br />There just weren't any redeeming qualities about this film. Itw as awful.
