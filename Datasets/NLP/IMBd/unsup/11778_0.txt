I love detective shows. One can watch Cannon on TV Land. I never saw a detective show with a fat, out of shape protagonist. The same formulated detective series, of running around asking question, with the usual confrontational climax. The viewer is assaulted with the out of the blue investigation breaks leading to figuring out the case. The usual plot devices of a found phone number, or random run in with character directs the story. The weired musical score sets a strange tone! A very 70's show because of the music, cloths, social message, and characters. The quality of filming and acting has come a long why from the 70's. Still a interesting show 7 out of 10 spy cams for Cannon.
