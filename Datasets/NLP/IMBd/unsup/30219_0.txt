A little of those Spanish spicy movies from late 70's, a little of "Indecent Porposal", a little of comedy (if there's someone who really laughs watching' this), a little of drama... A little of everything to get to nowhere. The plot releases what we're gonna get through: a door-to-door salesman is forced to film some porn movies with his wife so he can keep his job (yeeeeha!!). Anyway, though the movie has some good points (a nice setting, good actors such as Diego or CÃ¡mara), the final product is too weak, neither the dramatic part nor the comic one are that good.<br /><br />Basically unnecessary.<br /><br />PS: "Torremolinos 73" won the prize for the Best Movie at Malaga's Festival (that's a lot significant)... I can't even imagine the quality of its rivals.<br /><br />*My rate: 3/10
