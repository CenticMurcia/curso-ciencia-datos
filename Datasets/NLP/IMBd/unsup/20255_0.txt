Harold Lloyd ranks as one of the three greatest silent comedians next to Chaplin and Keaton. He combines great comic timing with crisp editing and physical daring-do that wows audiences. Girl Shy, written by Lloyd and the first film he produced, tells the story of a sweet-natured, stuttering bonehead who can not approach the girls. The irony is he has been secretly readying a book on how to be romantic with girls while working his day job as a tailor's assistant, back when a guy could still be a tailor's assistant. He takes a shine to Jobyna Ralston, his co-star in his best films, but then he's embarrassed by his publisher making fun of his book. The publisher decides to publish it as a joke to make the public laugh, and then Harold must spring into action quickly to save Jobyna from marrying a caddish two-timer. Did someone put a gun to her head though? Never mind, it's all in good fun and a set-up to the magnificent thrill comedy Lloyd was known for at the time. He employs just about every item of transportation known at the time to arrive to break up the wedding on time. It's all the more thrilling when you realize these are actual hands-on stunts Lloyd performs without a stuntman. Some of them are obviously quite dangerous upon viewing them. The large estate appearing near the end was Lloyd's own property. It's a terrific piece of good old-fashioned entertainment. *** of 4 stars.
