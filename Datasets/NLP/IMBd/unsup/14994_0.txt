It is a shame that this little known movie hasn't gotten more exposure over the years. For fans of all ages The Land Unknown is a great film that is sure to delight all but the most critical of viewers.<br /><br />This has got to be one of the most atmospheric movie sets ever to be captured on film, and it just gets better from there. The acting is very decent, as is the storyline and pace of the movie. We are treated to many dinosaurs that, although not the most realistic looking, are quite effective and are integrated well into the movie and the overall storyline.<br /><br />Yes, the FX are somewhat lacking, but compared to the many, many low-budget horror and SciFi films of the 1950's, The Land Unknown stands tall and delivers a face-paced action adventure that surpasses many of this era. Actually, this movie reminds me a bit of the 1925 silent The Lost World...from what I have read was indeed an inspiration for this film.<br /><br />If you are a fan of dinosaurs, action-adventure, SciFi, thrillers or just plain fun, well made movies, The Land Unknown has just what you are looking for and will deliver a pleasant viewing experience for all ages.
