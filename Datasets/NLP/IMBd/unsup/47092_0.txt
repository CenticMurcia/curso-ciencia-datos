The title of this rather tired film should be called I'm In Love With My Best Friend's Husband! Such a simple plot seen in countless TV dramas and mini-series, I think to myself why time and effort was wasted in making this. I've always been a fan of Cheryl Ladd since her Charlie's Angels days, and she certainly proves herself an actress of all genres. However, it's Bess Armstrong who steals the show. Her reaction at finding out her friend's betrayal seems very true-to-life; her marriage may have been on the rocks, but it's still a shock to discover that he is involved with a person extremely close to you. Had it had been someone unknown to her, this movie would simply not exist!<br /><br />My Best Friend's Husband could be factual in that sense, but the plot is certainly nothing new. In a nutshell, this film is one clich√© after another, but viewers might be able to feel the emotion and anger towards the characters, and that is what makes it a little more interesting. 4/10
