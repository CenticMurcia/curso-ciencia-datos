I used to hang with Kevin Rapp, when he was making this film. Making this film on a shoestring, editing on a home rig, using money from his day job as a CSR to pay for film and actors. No studio machine, no investors.<br /><br />Is it a classic? No. But it is very good for what it is. The direction shows style and promise and an attention to detail I respected then and respect now. The script is clean and the dialogue well-written (I would go out to lunch with Kevin and we'd discuss dialogue, seeing as I am a writer...I got paid in steaks and fries).<br /><br />All in all, I would like to see more from my friend. He makes me realize that the film industry isn't completely glossed over and weighed down by the commercialization of the art form.<br /><br />Side note: Dean Anzalone, the menacing presence in this film, was the collections manager in at the firm Kevin worked at. He has a nice menace to him. I'd pay up, if he ever called me.
