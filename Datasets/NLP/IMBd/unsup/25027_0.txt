Without a doubt, Bava left his mark on popular cinema with "Twitch of the Death Nerve." It is one of the earliest 'slashers' I've ever seen. The best thing about Bava's classic is that it starts out in traditional Bava fashion as a sort of Gothic piece and then it generates into a much more modern-feeling horror film with kids at a lake being hunted by a psychopath.<br /><br />The blood flows in this one, probably Bava's most gory. It's ashame that he didn't make more like this, but I think his talent was actually the old school horror pieces like "Blood and Black Lace," which was actually an even earlier slasher from Bava. The difference is that "Blood and Black Lace" lacks the theme that is now so popular, with kids being stalked and hunted. That is where "Twitch" wins the crown.<br /><br />With all there is to love about this awesome flick, I still have to gripe a bit. The ending is a little vague. I am still not too sure what happened, but the twist only halfway works. Still though, "Twitch of the Death Nerve" is a must see! 8 out of 10, kids.
