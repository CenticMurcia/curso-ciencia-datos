Iron Chef USA sounded like it would be a suitable compliment to the great Japanese version of Iron Chef, which was always elegant and well produced.<br /><br />A slap in the face and utter flop, Iron Chef USA was a circus joke and mockery to the original, from the flashy, disrespectful Chairman to the bimbo interviewer. What a disappointment and supreme embarrassment. Thank goodness old Japanese Iron Chef reruns exist!
