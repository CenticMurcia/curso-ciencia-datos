What we have here is an Indonesian wrestling women/crime drama film dubbed over by some goofy guys into an "R" rated "What's Up, Tiger Lily?" sort of film, and it mostly works. Seems that there's a young woman that must obtain money for her young brother's operation and she gets involved with seedy elements to do so. There's a big lug with an Elvis voice involved, as well as lots of strange people in masks and lots of women wrestling. The Troma DVD contains both the original Indonesian version (badly dubbed in English) & the goofy re-dubbed Troma version, both of which are pretty funny. I watched some of the "original" first then switched over to the Troma version & while the original was pretty funny (unintentionally) anyway, the Troma version was probably much more funny. Silly and juvenile stuff but still pretty entertaining for a slow afternoon. 7 out of 10.
