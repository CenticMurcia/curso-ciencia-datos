This review is based on the 73-minute version of this film sold through Luminous Film and Video Wurks. It's a minimalist tale of three people--a gypsy girl, a rich woman, and a mysterious man who likes to be in the buff whilst riding his horse--engaged in a three way relationship. The sex scenes are blunt, perfunctory, and frankly quite dull, the characters are one-dimensional and lacking in motivation, and the film's conclusion is almost as ridiculous as its contrived opening sequence. I'm not sure what the other reviewers liked about La Visita del Vicio (titled Sodomia on the Luminous tape), as it bored me to tears. Perhaps not quite as bad as the worst Jesus Franco film, but close.
