<br /><br />spiders is a good film it trys hard for a small film and it looks good. The sfx are very good for a film of this size (they are from knb)and they are well put together. you cauld say a lot of bad things about this film but then you are missing the point. You are not surposed to take it that way and if you cauld make a better film about giant spiders for under $1.5 million for that is what this film costs i would be pleased to review it for you. so if you like big B movies then watch this.
