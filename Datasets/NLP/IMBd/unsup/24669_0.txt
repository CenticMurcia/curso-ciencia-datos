This program has been out for a couple of years now but every time it premiered I never gave much thought to it. I mean black actors retelling the lives of former slaves? It seemed like an insult to those who lived that in that time, or so I thought. The truth is no matter how much its not talked about in mainstream media outlets or how downplayed the subject receives. <br /><br />Slavery in America is American History. I thought it was simply some PR joke have black actors reading the stories of former slaves, but after watching it and seeing the pictures and hearing the sounds I understood. I tip my hats of to the actors reading and admit my error in prejudging this documentary. There were moments in which I just had chills because it was real. I never understood the meaning of Juneteeth until watching this and over all I came away learning more.<br /><br />My fear now is that younger generations, who have my mindset prior to watching this, see it as something to fall asleep on not important or it's in the past. If anything, history in general teaches us that things that go forgotten often repeat themselves. I hope that for something as insidiously evil as slavery, the holocaust, or any of the current dealings with Middle Easterners or Latinos, I hope that we get over the hatred and can move on knowing our past and move forward.
