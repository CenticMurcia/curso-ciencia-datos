Wow, did I dislike this documentary. That's really sad, as documentaries are among my favorite films. However, this one was so pathetically pointless and sad, I felt through much of it that someone was reading some very dull person's blog--every excruciating detail including their thoughts, interests and even random people they meet. With an interesting person, this might be worth seeing--but here it just seems pointless and slow. Referring to it as a blog isn't originally my idea, though, as roberttroll previously reviewed this film and his observation seemed right on the mark.<br /><br />The film ostensibly stars out as a documentary about Sherman's March. Well, as a history teacher, I wish it really had done that! Instead, the film focuses on the love life of the film maker (Ross McElwee). Now it isn't just that he came off as rather dull, but the women he was set up with also really didn't spark any interest as well. In particular, Pat seemed rather flaky though pretty and Ross came off with a personality that was akin to balsa wood. From this "relationship" (which never seemed to even begin), he went on to more slow, slow meetings with other ladies. This part of the film felt like I was watching someone's home movies. So a dull blog and home movies--how could anyone find this particularly engaging? Anyone can record their dull lives--does this make a real film?! <br /><br />If I want to watch a lot of dull folks from the Carolinas talking about the weather and chit-chatting, instead of watching this film I'll just go visit my wife's family!
