In this day where we are supposed to applaud the small movie maker and his quest to bring us something different, I have to vote nay on this piece here. From the Ooodley song which will forever be on my list of most hated things ever, (up there with Hitler and Astroturf) to the, well we might as well have one more night of sex, I just could not get into this movie.<br /><br />Yes it portrays people in all their awkwardness and inability to come up with the right or clever lines to say at the right time but I go to movies to see that. If I want annoying or weird I will hit the local supermarket or Dollar Store.<br /><br />That being said, I probably could not do better. Either way, not impressed here.
