Reading about this movie it sounded like a decent little action flick but I wasn't expecting it to be this bad. Poor acting, Poor script and bad directing. I was really disappointed with this, given a decent cast and a decent script and someone who can direct then it would have had the potential to be a good all round film. It could have been one of those films thats really good even without a big budget. The camera angles are terrible and the acting was truly terrible, a really shame. The effects where bad and poorly done, the stunts weren't that bad, at least it looked like some professionals were on the set, hopefully the food was better too. I can't Begin to put into words how bad this is, its long, drawn out intro of the film and then a rushed ending really spoiled it and made it hard to watch as it became boring within the first 20mins. After 30mins I could feel my eyes starting to close, it was putting me to sleep. If you have some time to waste then watch paint dry, its more entertaining than this film.
