I just watched this movie last night and I just have to say WOW.<br /><br />'Beyond Borders' is such a good movie, the writing is excellent... the story really pulls at your heartstrings.The actors do an amazing job bringing this story to life.<br /><br />The war violence and the danger were believable and well-done... <br /><br />I was captivated from the very first frame of the movie... it just draws you in and won't let go. <br /><br />Some people may not like the ending but I was glad they did it in a realistic way, 'cause this stuff does happen sometimes.<br /><br />Clive Owen played the stubborn/charismatic/compassionate character wonderfully, I don't anyone could've done a better job.... and Angelina is a wonderful actress, she pours a lot of passion into her character into the movie as well. Its nice when actors just disappear into a role :)<br /><br />I cannot recommend this movie any higher... It takes its time telling the story, which suits it nicely, but don't turn it off right away, if this movie had been fast-paced, it would've ruined the experience *if that makes sense ;-)* <br /><br />It's a pity this movie wasn't more well-received at the box office.
