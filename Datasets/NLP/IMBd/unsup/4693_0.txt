In my top ten movies list. Brilliantly captures the feeling of the voyage through adolescence. The excitement and anticipation of "the first time" (first kiss etc) is beautifully expressed by Madeline "The best part's before you taste it..." <br /><br />This movie is not for viewers who require explosions to satisfy their entertainment criteria but if you wish to relive the joy, the sweet pain, the magic and the limitless possibilities of your adolescence let Billy Forsyth transport you. There are so many elements packed into the film that I love. Seeing a glimpse of Phil Menzies alone but happy in his garden adds an unexpected depth to his character. <br /><br />What I enjoy about the film is that on the surface it may appear to lack depth but the depth is there if you want to find it and admirably Forsyth leaves profound moments like Madeline's words of wisdom understated and ,for me, only joyfully discovered after repeated viewing.<br /><br />I hope this movie takes you to a similar beautiful place as it has me.
