This film was so bad that it was worth watching just to see how bad it could get! Seemed like it was going to be alright until Nas a.k.a. Det Fuzzy Rice dies, i thought maybe he was deliberately making his acting horrendous in order to trick Steven Segals character into thinking he was about to dye, BUT then he died!!! His last words i believe were "i'm so cold, cough cough, don't let your daemons defeat you! errrrrrrrrrk!".<br /><br />The "Don't let your daemons defeat you" line comes up a few times in the film but not much is done explain what these daemons are, why Steven Segal has them, or to push the fact that he is supposed to be a man suffering emotionally. It's all just mentioned in passing, so the lines just seem over-dramatic! I cant really remember what goes on in the rest of the film because the story line is muddled and i lost interest.<br /><br />What saves this film is the state of the art cutting edge special effects. ha ha no not really the effects are absolutely chronic too!! I especially like the bit when the car brakes and the blue screen background stops instantly, that was a corker, look out for that bit!!<br /><br />The director was terrible, the action wasn't worth remembering and the script was pants. The only reason it didn't get a 1 is because it was so bad it was comical! Think Segal should go back to big budget movies like Exit wounds and if he's getting to old or out of shape to fight as much, add a sidekick who can to his films to increase the action.
