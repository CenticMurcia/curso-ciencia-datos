Having grown up New York Irish I can completely empathize with the characters and their lifestyles. A truly first class job by Director Phil Joanua and leading men Sean Penn as Terry Noonan and Gary Oldman as Jackie Flannery. Robin wright (Penn) is excellent as Cathleen Flannery and Ed Harris is great as the elder Flannery. One of my favorite movies of all time- a masterpiece.
