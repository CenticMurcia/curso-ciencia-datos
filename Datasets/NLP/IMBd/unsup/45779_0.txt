<br /><br />At its heart, the Conqueror really wants to be a great film. Its got big name directors, big name actors, and an epic story. And in the pit of its heart, it wants to be a great film, but then again, in my heart, I want to be a thrice published novelist contemplating my fourth book which will surely garner me a nobel prize for literature. As expected, then, what it wants in its heart, much like what I want in mine, just is not going to occur in reality. Wayne not only is miscast, be he seems woefully unsure of the heroic aspect of his character, which is fitting, because Kahn was not a hero. The cast in and of itself are good actors, but their characters are underdeveloped, lackluster, or just plain wrong. The movie is worth a watch to those who love John Wayne, B-movies, or epics of any porportion, or to those looking for a good movie with which to play Mystery Science Theater 3000.
