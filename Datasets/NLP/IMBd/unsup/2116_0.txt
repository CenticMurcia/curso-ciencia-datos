"The Prince of Egypt" has to be one of the best movies of 1998, let alone one of the best movies I've ever seen. This animated story of Moses (though minutes into the movie, you almost forget it's animation!) is told in such a unique and refreshing way which adds new life to the Biblical story yet sticks with it well enough to convey the same sense of power and inspiration. The animation is impeccable and the music (after a few listens/viewings) will stick with you for days on end. The Burning Bush and parting of the Red Sea scenes alone are worth the price of the movie ticket. If you're looking for a movie that has more character, more inspiration, more LIFE than the usual shoot-em-up's, check out "The Prince Of Egypt".
