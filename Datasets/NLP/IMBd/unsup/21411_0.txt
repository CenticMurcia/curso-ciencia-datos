I never heard of "Angus" until it came on television. I watched it and loved the movie. I then went to Best Buy only to realize that Angus is not sold on DVD and VHS is near impossible to get a hold of. Thats when it hit me.<br /><br />Angus is a very under rated movie. It depicts a very real world of the years of Highschool. The main character is Angus, hence the title. An overweight, fat kid who has dreams to leave his town, while constantly thinking about his Dream Girl. His grades are good enough to go to a college out of the town to escape his outer demons. Demon, that being the star quarterback of the school and most popular kid, Rick, who picks on him and his friend. His main good relationships are with his Mom, Grandfather, and best friend. The plot point of the movie comes when Angus is chosen (by Rick as a joke) to go to the dance with his dream girl. Angus then must face his insecurities and step up. *At the end of the movie, Angus overcomes the troubles of high school and humiliates Rick, to get a kiss from his dream girl.<br /><br />The movie is just brilliant, with good character depth on all the characters. Even the dream girl, admits to Angus that she has an eating disorder. It is a shame that this movie has not been released on DVD yet. But if it is on TV, check it out.
