Finally, there is a sitcom that allows people to see that we as black females do and can have a productive lifestyles. It is funny, refreshing and the women are attractive. I think all the women on this show are beautiful and I just want to thank them and hope that they continue to be a part of my Monday evening line up, that I love to watch. I pray that they do have a new and wonderful season in the fall. We need more shows like this, I really appreciate the show, if I am not home to watch, I tape it. Maya oh hell yea, and Toni and perhaps she could give her little husband a little more time. My favorite Joan and her freeloading buddy with the "degrees" are a joy to watch. I love William too, and I want to wish you all much love and thank you for your show. You have our support and hope that you can continue to be a blessing to the black community.
