I tried to rent this flick a bunch of times, but a copy was never available at the video store. So, I just broke down and bought it. Got tired of waiting. Anyhow, I thought it was pretty good. I mean, it was low budget and all, but so what? It was creepy, fun and different. I liked that not-so-Hollywood look. These days everyone's so spoiled with how they make big, expensive movies look. "Halloween" doesn't look as good as most movies out nowadays, and everyone loves that. So, what's the difference? I think I know. Everyone blasting this movie is bummed because they were taken in by the slick cover art and the "Lions Gate" name. And now, because the movie itself isn't as slick as Scream, or The Ring, everyone wants to blame the filmmakers. Well, for those who don't know, I'm pretty sure they don't oversee that stuff. If you wanna blame somebody for taking your money, blame the guy who made the art work. Seriously...I bet if someone handed you a blank disc in a brown paper bag and told you to watch it, you'd be pleasantly surprised with what you got. It's all about the presentation. I bet you're the same folks who bought all those Dracula, Wolfman and Mummy movies because the packaging was cool. <br /><br />Anyway, it seems to me this is just a cool little flick by some unknown who's trying to make movies. That's it. I suggest everyone who initially hated it open their minds, accept it for what it is and watch it again. I bet you'll feel differently.
