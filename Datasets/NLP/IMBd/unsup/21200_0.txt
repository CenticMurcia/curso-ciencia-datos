No, it's not Akira. It's not Ghost in the Shell. It's a different beast entirely, and just as good! The key to understanding and enjoying this film is knowing what it is: a sexy and violent movie adaptation of a video game! Things move fast, the animation is awesome, and it is pure eye candy! This is definitely testosterone theater. If you are looking for theme heavy, weighty intellectualism, with a deep message and all that, you won't find it here. This movie plays out just like a video game... lightning quick, assaulting the senses, and with quick flashes of amazing action. Throw in a little saucy nudity, some great perspectives of the female form, and some incredible character designs, and this film rises to the top of the genre. It is pure frivolous fun, which is why it can't be compared to Akira, Ghost in the Shell, etc. Its just as good, but very different.
