I must say, first and foremost, the casting for this movie is superb. All of the actors in this film had chemistry with the camera and with the audience. The main 5 could not have been played by better people, magical. Film technique was a little weary, but for a cherry popper, it is just fine. Some wobbly handheld shots is all I am complaining about, but what are you going to do for a handheld? Comedy central should and will (via myself) receive great feedback from the viewing community on this one. I myself feel very privileged to have viewed such a to the point and believable movie. I myself, who am a college student, agree with every statement and every act that occurred on this campus. It is all very true, and as much as I would like to say, right down to the porno on campus. KUDOS to all of you at comedy central! SEE THIS MOVIE!!<br /><br />
