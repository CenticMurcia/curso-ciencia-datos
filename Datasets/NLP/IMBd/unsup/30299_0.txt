I first saw this movie on late night television in the fall of 1986 on an independent channel which had a policy of showing a movie after midnight would guarantee that nothing would be censored such as adult language or nudity. I was going through a punk phase of my own and I felt that the movie really moved me and the soundtrack was awesome. I actually found Robin Johnson to be sexy and am saddened that her career has not really been the best. As luck would have it, the channel's sister station carried the movie the following night and I watched it again only to be disappointed because this station had a censorship policy that left the movie edited down. It seemed like every time Niki opened her mouth, the censors worked overtime. I didn't get to see the movie again until my mother got for me for Christmas of 1990 on video back when it was put out by Thorne-EMI HBO Video and I was lucky enough to find the soundtrack at a second hand record store on the old RSO label. A few years later, I unfortunately sold both the soundtrack and video for some extra cash. I do have the movie on DVD that has commentary from Mr. Moyle and Robin JOhnson, but I would love to know if the soundtrack has been re-released on CD. As much as I love the movie, I do admit that with age, the appeal of the movie does come and go for me.
