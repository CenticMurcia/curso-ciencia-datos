I was ready to love this movie as I was already sold with Guest's previous works. His comedy and characters have always been on the "edge" of being irritating, but so far he has managed to balance it towards lovably ridiculous, and in turn hysterical. This time the balance fell the other way and what a heavy thud it made. It is almost painful to watch. The whole scene it tries to make fun of is already a ridiculous one and in this Guest makes his characters so over the top that it completely separates him from the actual Hollywood, making his satire pointless and outdated. It is not even hard to say where he has gone wrong: the characters he created before were quirky, offbeat, but ultimately lovable. The ones in FYC are not not not. I flat out hated them. I was ready to punch, slap, or spit in the face any one of them, and it is hard to laugh at the same time. I still liked Willard though. He brought the 3 stars. Otherwise there would be none from me...
