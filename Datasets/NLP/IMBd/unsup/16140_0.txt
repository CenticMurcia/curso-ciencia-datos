Okay.....I can't believe people are brain-dead enough to actually LIKE this piece of dog poo. I saw it as a child and it insulted my intelligence like no movie ever has. It's so bad it SHOULD get no stars. Not even the cute dog saves it. The dog gets drunk. HE ACTUALLY GETS DRUNK. He "saves" a boy...from drowning in AN INCH OF WATER. May I bang my head on a wall now? No, that's right, I've gotta stay for the most touching part of all: the boy and dog get separated and the dog TRACKS THE BOY BY SNIFFING EVERY PLACE THE BOY HAS URINATED AT TRUCK STOPS. WHICH, I MIGHT ADD, IS ACTUALLY SHOWN. Isn't that oh so charming and cute? Even if it's SUPPOSED to be a parody of child+dog films, it doesn't work. It's not cute. It's not funny. It's atrocious and stupid with atrocious and stupid scenes. The actors are also so bad that you'd swear it was a sketch from All That except THOSE sketches actually are amusing at times. The "special" effects look like they had a ten-dollar budget. Bottom line: DON'T WATCH THIS. Don't watch it even if you love dogs or kids or dogs and kids. It's bad bad bad. Not so bad it's good-just so bad like "Can I kill myself now?" Don't even make your dog watch it. This is the WORST kid and dog movie ever made. And it's definitely NOT appropriate for children.
