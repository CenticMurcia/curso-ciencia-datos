Perhaps hardcore Bunuel fans won't like El Bruto that much. It doesn't contain much of his surrealism. It is a lot like many of his other Mexican films: dark, melodramatic, brutal, and tragic. El Bruto is mostly a social melodrama, with a wealthy man trying to evict a group of poor residents from some slums that he owns. To intimidate these rebellious residents, he hires a giant thug, nicknamed El Bruto (the Brute, duh!). El Bruto is big and dumb and he follows orders well. But he's not a bad guy. He can be tough and mean, but, deep down, he's a gentle giant. Pedro Armend√°riz is fantastic as the lead. The other major actors are as good. Katy Jurado, most famous for her role in Fred Zinnemann's High Noon from the same year, is much better in this film from her home country. The script is excellent, with some good (if a bit predictable) twists. I think that those who haven't "gotten" Bunuel yet might want to see this one. It's probably his most easily understood fim. It may not be exclusively Bunuelian, but El Bruto ranks with Luis' best films. 10/10.
