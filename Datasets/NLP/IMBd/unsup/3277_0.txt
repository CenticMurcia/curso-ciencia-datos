of all hijack movies this is the best of the worst! only decent thing was SR-71! that is always a cool thing. except the hooking under a jumbojet... and a FBI agent can do anything, f.e. land a jumbo without a door. yeah.<br /><br />i could write all the funny mistakes down, but it would take all the fun away from watchers. anyway, remember to concentrate on f-16s radars. and also i found funny that same poor pilot was sent for same mission two times. not a good day for him.<br /><br />good thing with these bad movies is that if you're hit with bullet, you don't actually get hurt that much. but that is just movies, isn't it. good thing was that the world (america) was saved once again. and an aircraft.
