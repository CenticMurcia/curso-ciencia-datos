This is quite a western, that reminds one more of war films like Robert Aldrich's "Attack"(1956). During practically the whole film we are in doubt if Sgt. Vinson (Joel McCrea) is placing his personal feelings of hatred for the Apaches, who killed his wife, above the interests of his military mission and his men. Pvt. Travis (John Russel) is a man totally undecided about what to do with his life and also how to judge Vinson, but he is aware of his shortcomings and we identify with him. Pvt McGurney (Forrest Tucker) does not have doubts about Vinson. To him he is willing to kill them all just to get even with the Apaches. Joseph M Newman directed some routine westerns like "Pony Soldier" and "Gunfight at Dodge City", but he did well with "Outcasts Of Poker Flat" and this film.
