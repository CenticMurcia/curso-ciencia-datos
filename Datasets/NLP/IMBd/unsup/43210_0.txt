Spain's film industry is notorious for not putting out good movies, and this is a prime example. Los Nuevos Extraterrestres (The New Extraterrestrials for those of you who don't speak Spanish) has a plot like this:<br /><br />A group of aliens lands and has a bunch of eggs with them. A group of hunters discovers these eggs, and two of them hatch into aliens. One alien goes on a murderous rampage, while the other, who was taken by a local boy as an egg, grows up to be a sweet, kind thing. One of the worst uses of stop-motion photography is the scene where everything moves crazily about in Tommy's room. In the end the good alien gets reunited with its parents while the bad alien dies, and gets immediately sucked into the earth.<br /><br />Avoid this one unless you're watching MST3K.
