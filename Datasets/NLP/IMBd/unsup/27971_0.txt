I visited the showing of Indigo in Amsterdam and I invited six friends to join me. Stimulated by the emails, the announcements from the Spiritual Cinema Circle and a trailer-DVD that was sent to me, I had high expectations. That was my first mistake and it reminded me not to expect anything in life. I agree with most of the negative comments about the movie and I am not going to repeat them. I would like to add the following: <br /><br />1. The indigo child was turned into a super child by combining several rare but proved traits in one character. That made her as unrealistic as Raymond Rabbit (Dustin Hoffman) in Rain Man. The negative effect of this mistake is that viewers can no longer identify themselves with indigo children. They would think "they are definitely not me" rather than attempting to discover aspects of indigo children in themselves.<br /><br />2. All interesting story lines came to a happy end when Ray (Neale Donald Walsch) prevented the indigo child Grace from being kidnapped by her father. Helas, that already happened after 10 minutes! The rest of the time was killed by driving to a safe place and smart answers of the super child.<br /><br />3. In one of the last scenes a police agent showed up who appears to have stolen the money. Was that a coincidence too stupid to be true, the work of the super child or a failed attempt to correct a mistake in the script?<br /><br />I don't mind the bad casting and acting. After all this is a low budget movie. But if you take that out, it is still a bad movie, technically and spiritually. Therefore I don't think it serves the producers to continue the one-sided promotion of the movie on their website and in their press releases. If they are lucky, this might only help them financially in the short term. But it will definitely ruin their reputation in the long term, which would be a pity for the spiritual community and the society as a whole. <br /><br />The good things I see in this movie are the raising of awareness for indigo children and the learning experience.<br /><br />Hopefully, the stakeholders are more critical privately than they demonstrate publicly. Only then their new project, a film about Neale Donald Walsch, can become successful. <br /><br />But I could be wrong. Let's see.
