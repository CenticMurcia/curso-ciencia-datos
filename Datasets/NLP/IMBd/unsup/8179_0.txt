Apparently... in Disturbialand, all adults are idiots. As a teenager, you can point out direct evidence of a murder and the adults will simply laugh at you. Your mother will insist on going over to the murderer's house and apologizing for you. The murderer will suddenly and stupidly (after years of calculated planning of all his murders) start attacking all of his neighbors.<br /><br />What could have been a decent homage to Hitch, is instead, a direct descendant of John Hughes. There's the misunderstood (but extremely perfect) lead, who lives in a perfect house in the perfect neighborhood, and who has a crush on the perfect member of the opposite sex. Amazingly, he has the perfectly funny Asian sidekick and he's a perfect outsider at the perfect teen party (he's so perfect that he can't attend!), and he has the perfectly, ever absent parents (a dead father and mysteriously disinterested mother).<br /><br />They should have made Molly Ringwald the killer. That would have made perfect sense.
