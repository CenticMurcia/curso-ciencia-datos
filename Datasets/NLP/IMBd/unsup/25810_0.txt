After years of reading reviews in books and online about how good Miracle Mile was, I finally got the chance to see it tonight on tv.<br /><br />As someone who was seriously moved by other films dealing with impending nuclear doom scenarios such as Testament, The Day After and Threads, I was really looking forward to seeing this.<br /><br />Imagine my disappointment then to sit down and watch a film with a great premise totally ruined by illogical plot development, ludicrous dialogue and characters who I never got to care about.<br /><br />What is it with modern day moviegoers who would accept such laughable execution of an appalling script? <br /><br />Is it any wonder the writer/director's CV looks painfully thin since this film?<br /><br />Garbage of the lowest order - one out of ten - and that's only cos this trash lasted less than 90 mins.
