Are you serious? I wonder why this stupid movie has made even a penny. This movie would have been a thousand times better without the stupid teenage lust fest. It was not my turn to pick the movie, and I had no curiosity to see "Rear Window Jr." and boy I wish I listened to the inner voice! <br /><br />There seems to be an alarming trend that I call "through the eyes of a teenage boy vision" You think from the way the director ordered so many shots of the teenage girl, that he had some crush on her! How about making a suspenseful movie that appeals to everyone, and not just males who have just exited puberty? Great job alienating your "broad" audience.<br /><br />WAAAAAY too many shots of the "hot" girl next door doing Yoga, slow-mo swimming, sun bathing, and your teenage angsty stuff. I like Shia, he was great in "Holes", I even liked his cameo in "I, Robot." Poor David Morse, he's a tremendous actor, but given NOTHING to do here. What a waste of Carrie Ann Moss! There are a couple of "shock" moments, but they appear and leave in the first 5 minutes of the film, after that, the teenage love puppy story sprinkled with tepid moments of "tension". This is a predictable, silly, unrealistic and awful movie. To quote another IMDb userÂ….."why would someone who was so calculated and precise just start sloppily and obviously killing neighbor's?" Couldn't wait to leave, Giving a generous 2 stars for my respect of Mr. Morse and Ms. Moss, Shia, shame on you for being in a mess like this, you're much better.
