At least some bad movies have *something* in them that you can talk or laugh about after the fact. Some are so bad they are funny. Not Futureworld, my nominee for the worst movie of all time. I challenge you to find me a worse movie. Watching this was agony. I know its a rare sequel that matches anything like its precursor, but man, they could have copied a little of the first one--even a sex scene for cryin' out loud. It's been over 20 years, but the taste in my mouth is still bad.
