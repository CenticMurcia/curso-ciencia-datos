There is nothing worse than a presumptuous movie that tries to be what it is not, in this case something smart, profound, intense and thrilling. This movie is exactly the opposite.<br /><br />Roth, an actor I truly like, seems to go along with the sleepy mood and not even when he kicks the bad guys on the balls he seems to wake up. Ormond drags herself along the screed with an expression on her face as if she had been born preoccupied.<br /><br />I seldom saw a so bad editing, precipitated and hurriedly. The plot line stays horizontal throughout the entire film and you are carried from mood to mood without any reasonable connection. For half a hour nothing happens and suddenly they are on a bathroom floor making intense love (very pathetic) like Rourke and Basinger in Nine 1/2 Weeks. 15 minutes later the relationship is assaulted by doubt and drama. If this was not enough, in the last third of the movie they inject under pressure some parallel story inside the prison that undermines and overshadows the already undermined relationship between Roth and Ormond, which focus on nothing really and ends with some pathetic shooting scene at the end.<br /><br />C'mon, give me David Cronenberg and his smooth story telling, where suspense and mood reach the climax so slowly and so perfectly. Perhaps in his hands, this move could have lived to be something decent.<br /><br />Well, a very very bad movie. To be avoided at all costs, unless of course, you need desperately to get some sleep.
