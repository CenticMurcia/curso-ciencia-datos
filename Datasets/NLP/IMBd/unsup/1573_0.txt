Gotta say, I, too, used to think it was "preachy." But not anymore. Like Star Trek's "Let That Be Your Last Battlefield," which I also used to think was obvious and beneath me, this one now wows me. Perhaps it's because what was once so obvious about what "might be," to a young person (oh the evils that await us in the near future, yawn), now virtually IS.<br /><br />What was once totalitarianism in other places is now happening in the United States of America. God and the Bible: banned. Prayer: banned. Dissent: banned. Wrong thinking: banned.<br /><br />Why not ban all books? Most people don't read anymore anyway. No books? No need for librarians. The Khmer Rouge would find this show a positive portrayal of their "right" thinking.<br /><br />It's not just about Fascism, Communism, or Islam, it's about the state, any state, that can call all of the shots. I'm sure the State in The Obsolete Man would be making some changes, like not letting the condemned choose their method of execution anymore (too much choice is not a good thing).<br /><br />Effective set design, lighting that plays a part in the narrative, excellent acting. I personally like the way Fritz Weaver' Chancellor is dealt with, almost like they're feeding on one of their own at the end. Creeps!
