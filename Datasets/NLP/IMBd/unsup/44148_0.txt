I am really a frenetic horror movie picture fan, really, and the storyline of this movie sounded really interesting to me...awakened beast from recent American cultures......shiver....and I really got shocked from a lot of horror pictures in the past....but this one -It Waits- is a real shot at your rear panel. The most shocking something was the cruel acting due to the actors. Huaahhh. Please, Ms.Cerina Vincent, show mercy to us whenever you think about doing this again. Even more, I had the non-questionable luck to watch the German synchronized version, Jesus! The moment, the corpse fell down, the parrot yells, and it sounded like "MÃ¤nneralarm", translated this means 'mens alarm'. Auch!! Please, for gods sake, next time rate such kinda work at 85+, or better 100+. Never mind. <br /><br />And now something really spooky...I'm going watch the last 10 minutes left from this mind dazzling horror picture...and I hope I will survive!
