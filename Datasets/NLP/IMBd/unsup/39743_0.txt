...if this thing got four stars. I was really looking forward to this film, but it let me down in nearly every way imaginable. The plot line is improbable (no one could be as dumb as the protagonist seems) and jerky/rambling (no vignette really develops before we're on to another misadventure by our hero). The acting runs from forgettable (the best performances were probably by a couple of fellow inmates) to simply awful, as Muni simply gnaws on the scenery from time to time, especially in the final pathetic scene. Some details, like camera-work and costuming are nice, but not nearly enough to rescue this from the stink-heap.<br /><br />I think what really irked me was this film's supposed commentary on America's penal system, when really it seemed like a snarky attack on the Deep South. If Hollywood wishes to perpetuate regional stereotypes, they really should produce a better film in which to do so.<br /><br />4/10...watchable but certainly not memorable.
