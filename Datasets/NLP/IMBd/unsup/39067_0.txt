Kuffs is a truly awful film that contains one of my all-time favorite show-stopping plot points. Slater's character walks out of a church where his brother is praying. Hears gunshots. Runs back into church to see thug standing over his dead brother, smoking gun in hand. At the police station, Slater is informed that the police can't press charges because-quote-"You didn't actually see the thug shoot your brother. Therefore, he can just claim he saw a gun and picked it up."-unquote. Of course, the police let the thug go...<br /><br />I know Kuffs is supposed to be mindless, but this scene caused my jaw to hit the floor. Evidently, the San Francisco police have never heard of fingerprints, ballistics and testing for powder burns. Much less, questioning a suspect, as to why he was standing in a church with a smoking gun in hand and body on the ground (with bullets in it that no doubt match those fired from the gun).<br /><br />I never knew that modern-day police had to rely solely on eye-witnesses to secure convictions.<br /><br />awful awful awful - avoid like the plague
