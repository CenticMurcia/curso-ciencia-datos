At first I was put off this film due to the title 'Please Kill Me, I'm a F*ggot N*gger Jew', but after being constantly badgered by a friend I eventually sat down to watch itÂ… Boy was I surprised. 'Please Kill Me, I'm a F*ggot N*gger Jew' is a touching tale about a man who in his own words is a "F*ggot N*gger Jew" and the daily hardships he must endure due to his social status.<br /><br />This short film says more about the plight of being a minority more than all of Woody Allen, Spike Lee and Lloyd Kaufman's movies put together. The only problem with this movie is that it's way too short, but in it's short running time it says more than most Hollywood movies say in their 2hr plus running times. Hopefully someone will have the vision to release it on DVD with the underground classic "G*yn*ggers From Outer Space"
