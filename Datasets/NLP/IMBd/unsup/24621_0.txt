Why can't TV make better movies? No wonder the the big 4 networks lose viewers to TBS, HBO, and A&E. Their movies entertain, have originality to them, and have fresher writing. Another leftwing the US government is bad conspiracy movie where the media is the only true hero. This makes me sick, because I wonder how many times the media has destroyed careers, caused riots, ruin investigations, and caused deaths by unethical reporters. We need a media, but some of these tv movies are like a commercial for the nightly news. Conspiracy movie of the big bad gov and CIA have been around for 30 years; they need a new angle. After some of these crazy government conspiracy theories, people have become leery of these stories. The same formula, an Alan Alda type hero, a sex interested for ratings, a stupid Frank Burns right wing guy who does something stupid and gets killed, and as always CIA plot, everyone has to be good looking, idealistic, and all the world's problems simply can be blamed on the US and the government they support etc etc etc... Nothing new here, they even try to do the Vietnam flashback imagery, with that same Stones song used in everyone of these movies. War dirty, and evil nothing new there, except they get a big name b actor,Goldblum, to make you waste your time watching this crap. I think the ending left little for the viewer. 3/10
