How could a film with such a provocative title be so drab and boring? Released at the height of the seventies exploitation boom, Virgin Witch sadly falls by the wayside of many other similar films. The film sort of like your standard lesbian vampire film, except this time its lesbian witches and instead of being interesting and erotic, it's slow and boring. The plot follows Christine; a young virgin who travels to a modelling agency with her sister in the hope of getting a job. However, it turns out that she wasn't being headhunted for a job after all, as the head of the agency wants Christina to join her witch's coven! Any hopes of this being a gory lesbian sex-fest will not be fulfilled, as the film doesn't feature much in the way of either and director Ray Austin seems more keen to show photo shoots and religious ceremonies than blood and sex, which is odd considering that the film is from the seventies and is titled 'Virgin Witch'. Overall, this film won't do much, even for fans of this sort of stuff. Good elements include the fact that the lead isn't bad looking and that the film isn't on for long. Not recommended.
