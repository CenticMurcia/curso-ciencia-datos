We expected a horror movie, but it is more like a horror-comedy. The actors are good, special effects also good. The Eye 10 has nothing to do with The Eye 1 and 2, other than the same directors/film-makers.<br /><br />Some teenagers are trying 8 methods of contacting/seeing ghosts. A few of those ways are really funny, its a long time since we have laughed as much as we did seeing this movie. <br /><br />I recommend this movie as a horror/comedy, not if you are looking for a scary horror flick. Guess that those who gave this movie low scores was expecting something else. There is not much blood and gore in this movie.<br /><br />Liked the ending too.
