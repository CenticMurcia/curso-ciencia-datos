I want you to imagine for a moment. Imagine you are coming home from an evening out on the town with a friend, after having a few drinks together. As you're coming around the corner, You see a person carrying a child and walking a dog. You hit the brakes and try to swerve the car, but you end up hitting him/her anyway, then going off the road and ramming a telephone pole. You wake up hours later where you learn that the person was your spouse and the child was your child, and the dog was your dog. Then you learn that not only did your best friend go through the windshield and die, but he had advanced AIDS and since he bled all over you, now you do too. And to top it all off, they've had to amputate both your arms. Then a Man walks up to you and says "I can make it all better, I'll let you have another chance. I'll give you back your family, your dog, your friend, your car. I'll take away the memory of this evening, and the disease as well. I'll even cure your friend. And All you have to do for me is watch Spoiler." It's not worth it. Say no and walk away. <br /><br />Spoiler is hands down the worst movie I have ever seen. I've sat through Manos, The hands of Fate, I've sat through Monster a Go Go, I've watched Red zone Cuba twice, I've seen every move Steven Seagal has ever made. I saw street fighter, Armageddon, Clockstoppers, the Core and the Day after Tomorrow in theaters and spoiler is still the only movie I've actually almost passed out from watching. It's also a landmark movie in it's use of time compression technology, as it makes each minute feel like you've just watched between 6 minutes and 4 months of nothing happening. My Friend and I Actually looked at each other after it was over and said that it was the longest 7 hours of our lives. Then we looked at a clock and realized it had only been 90 minutes. (Then we promptly pulled the tape out of the cassette, snipped it in a few places and threw it into a dumpster off a fifth story balcony). <br /><br />Spoiler___________________________________________<br /><br />In the end, your expecting them to build up something climactic, and the surprise is that nothing happens and the movie ends, and no one cares. The best part of this movie is when they drag the main character in and beat him with clubs. If only they would do that to the director too.
