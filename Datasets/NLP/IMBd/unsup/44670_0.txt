After seeing `Down To You,' you might wonder whether Freddie Prinze, Jr. even has more than one facial expression. His one puppy-dog like expression seemed endearing in the first fifteen minutes of the movie, but later translated to simply bad acting. In his new movie, Prinze plays Al Connelly, a college student searching for love, among other things.<br /><br />When he meets freshman Imogen, played by the lovely Julia Stiles, he is immediately fascinated by her. Unfortunately, the audience doesn't get to revel in this too long, because ten minutes later they were sleeping together, and soon after that, acting like an old married couple. The movie chronicles their tale of first love, along with every obstacle in between, such as Al's friend who directs porn movies, and his father, who wants to start with a Cops -like cooking show with his son.<br /><br />At the beginning, this seemed like a wonderful idea for a movie. The first fifteen minutes were a sweet, almost realistic account of first love, which many people could relate to. A particularly endearing moment was when Al tells the camera, `I thought this would last forever,' after describing a romantic moment shared by the couple. However, all of the potential of this movie was shattered when all of a sudden, in a moment of 90210 like melodrama, Imogen thinks she's pregnant. Of course, this event is the beginning of their problems for the rest of the movie.<br /><br />The film continues its downward spiral, culminating an unrealistic and contrived ending. Prinze and Stiles simply had no chemistry on screen, and by the end, the audience was simply not interested in whether they got together or not. Prinze seemed incapable of showing any emotion, making his character extremely boring and just annoying. On the other hand, Stiles (of 10 Things I Hate About You) was charming as usual, but unfortunately stuck in a bad movie, with no place to show off her talent. Additionally, the supporting cast was no help, awkwardly put in scenes to make badly acted sex jokes, and having no relevant or even interesting purpose.<br /><br />Written and directed by Kris Isacsson, the movie had some good ideas, but those were quickly overshadowed by too much melodrama and contrived storylines. What could've been an earnest and sweet romance, turned into a boring story with annoying characters.
