I have to grant at the start that this game is quite different from the other Final Fantasys that i've played (all but #5). Every game goes through an evolution, and this is the case with this one. One of my favorite changes is the Salary system. Many people complain, but be honest: How many dragons, or mechanical weapons carry a pouch of gold, or gil? I mean, really, where would they put it? How are they going to spend it? This makes no sense. Plus, with the characters actually having an occupation, they should get paid for doing their job. They are mercenaries. Mercenaries get paid. Simple. I think it is a refreshing change.<br /><br />It would be pretty hard to dispute the fact that the graphics are beautiful. They are. The CG scenes are the most incredible i've ever seen.<br /><br />I'm a guy, but somewhat of a romantic at heart, so i was overjoyed when i learned that this was going to be a love story. The sole problem is: I don't like the girl in the love story. She bugs me. Squall, on the other hand, i can accept. He's a cold bastard at times, but seems to undergo a lot of development. And if you think about it, he's only 17. So is everyone else, except the adults, Edea and Cid.<br /><br />I do have problems with the magic system. I like the Junctioning of Summoned Monsters (or Espers, or GF, whatever), but the magic thing bugs me. Personally, i'd prefer to go back to FFVI where you learn spells from the Esper.<br /><br />Everything is an experiment, and i'd get tired of playing the exact same game over and over, so i like the changes, and i love the Card Game...this is the single coolest side quest in a game ever.<br /><br />To sum up...I love this game. It is a worthy addition to the Final Fantasy family, and i'm looking forward to conquering it (on disc 4 now)
