I didn't watch the BM show till just recently now that it's in reruns and I LOVE it. Soooooooooo cute. Very well done. Much better than The Cosby Show, more real for sure. I love the boy's devilish laugh and I love the way the little girl (baby girl) says: " Uncle Bernie"??? So sweet and innocent. The oldest child's problems as a teenager are done very well too. So glad I found out about this show. Won't miss an episode. Does anyone know where I can write BM to tell him how much I love his show? I also get a kick out of how protective he is of the kids. That's true love. And they always seem to try to out smart Bernie but not without a fight from Bernie. <br /><br />Bravo Bernie on a great show. Too bad it's gone but at least we have it in reruns.
