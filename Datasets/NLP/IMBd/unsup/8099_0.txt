AKA: The Very Thought Of You<br /><br />This has been done many times before. You take a basic fish-out-of-water story, and try to put your own spin to it, in an attempt to make it seem like a "fresh" idea, and hope no one notices.<br /><br />I'm happy to say that this time, it worked. Tom Hollander and Monica Potter are delightful as the would-be couple. Monica Potter is the fish out of water, as an ex-Minnesota resident cum Londoner.<br /><br />This is delightful, and quite smart in places, giving this production an overall slick execution, while not pushing the envelope so hard, as to detract from the work.<br /><br />This is quite enjoyable, in spite of the clich√© level of the base premise. The two key performances are quite endearing and sweet. This one grabbed me, and pulled me in, in spite of myself.<br /><br />It rates a 7.2/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
