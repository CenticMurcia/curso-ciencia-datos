This is one of those TV series you remember fondly from earlier days, due to its two stars and the gentle humour which honestly reflects the actions of two awkward people, each looking for companionship and never expecting to find it. Mike and Laura are made for each other in the eyes of their friends; it really is that obvious, but not to themselves, of course.<br /><br />Viewers of 'As Time Goes By' may find the show less fun. Perhaps that's due to the late 70s and early 80s being a strange period, especially for those of us who managed to survive it without any scars! I've seen ATGB from beginning to end a number of times and am sure it was partly done as Judi's tribute to Michael. He's one of my three favourite actors, right up there with James Bolam and Alun Armstrong.<br /><br />Some people have commented on the shortness of the series, but it was and still is common practice in England to produce seasons of less than 10 episodes per year, in order to maintain quality control over the content.
