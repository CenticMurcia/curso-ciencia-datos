This is a textbook example of how the Hollywood cookie cutter factory takes a nice sleeper hit documentary and turns it into 2 hours worth of clich√©s. I lost count as to the number of other films whose elements and ideas it used. I almost expected to hear the blonde competitor say, "You're okay LaRusso", when she presented the trophy, or have one of Pierre's kids get on the mike at the end and say, "If I can change...and you can change.........everybody can change." <br /><br />If you want to feel uplifted and see real kids enrich themselves in real life situations, please do yourself a favor by skipping this and seeing Mad Hot Ballroom instead.
