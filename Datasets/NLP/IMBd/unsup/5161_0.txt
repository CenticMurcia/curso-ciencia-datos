Calling this a comedy is like calling a pile of compost a flower garden (I was going to write something else but didn't think it would be published).<br /><br />Its just isn't funny<br /><br />- its unbelievable, - "Hello I'm a very attractive, professional woman, I'll just wander off alone with an armed robber for a romantic meal !!!",<br /><br />- makes no sense "Hello I'm depressed prisoner(Timothy Spall) - the guards hate me, my wife is seeing another man, I was framed ... oops now I have cancer,,"<br /><br />- and is very, very bad.<br /><br />I wasted nearly 2 hours of my life on this film ... I wish I could have had a 'Lucky Break' and missed it altogether<br /><br />
