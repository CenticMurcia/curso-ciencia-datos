The first time i ever saw this movie was probably in 1992 when this was still on the video shelves and as far as SciFi Horror goes, this is one of the very best there is. I will not go into the story line as you can read that in the Plot Summary..but i will say this, watch Shadowzone and you will find yourself in the realms of parallel universes, unknown creatures, demons from the inner mind and human fear. The characters are developed pretty well, Louise Fletcher (esp), David Beecroft and James Hong are giving good performances. I think there is a great deal of atmosphere as well as tension-building and in my opinion this is definitely J.S. Cardone his best work. See this movie! Especially if you are interested in a great SciFi Horror flick. I am giving Shadowzone a 9 out of ********** since this is a classic example of turning basic horror elements (in this case the storyline) into an effective, creepy, moody and atmospheric film. Get your hands on this gem, if you can find it!
