I had high expectations with this movie which may be part of the reason I was so disappointed by it. Thinking that it was going to be another "There's Something About Mary", I was excited to see it. It is about two conjoined twins who own a burger place in a small community where it seems like everybody knows everybody. However, one of the brothers wants to become an actor in Hollywood. So, they go to Hollywood so he can live his dream. Unfortuantely, perhaps the best part of the movie is that Cher is in it...yeah,it IS that bad. It is just like any other comedy movie. One star a guy nobody has ever heard of and a plot that is pretty much an excuse to tell jokes. This all works out fine for most comedy movies, but the problem with this one is that it just isn't funny. The jokes are boring, and just downright not funny. This movie did not make me laugh out loud at one single part of the movie which takes away the comedy aspect of a comedy movie leaving pretty much nothing. Rent it if you really want it but you will be regretting it if you buy this movie without seeing it first. 3/10
