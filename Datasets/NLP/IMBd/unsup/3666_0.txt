First I would like to say I really enjoyed this movie. I don't mean to diminish it, but it was very obvious to me how it was strongly based on Richard Linklater's movies: Before Sunrise, Before Sunset (and Tape, because the whole movie takes place in one room).<br /><br />There is a scene that is a clone of the famous Before Sunrise scene where the protagonists hear the song "Come Here", by Kath Bloom, and exchange furtive looks towards one another. In "En la Cama" they hear a song an exchange looks in the exact same way. Unfortunately, I think this scene is very pale (the acting and the setting) if compared to the Before Sunrise one, and is a bit out of the context of the movie (it definitely doesn't make sense in a motel bed right after the two made passionate wild sex). I prefer to think it was made as a tribute to Before Sunrise, rather than a shallow copy, a way for the director to say "This is really inspired by Before Sunrise, I love it too!". I strongly believe the director watched those movies and asked himself, "what if I did this with the protagonists in a motel bed, during a one night stand?".<br /><br />But it doesn't mean this movie has nothing to add. It feels like an antithesis of Before Sunrise/Sunset, and shows the concept of the movie (= deep communication) applies in other contexts as well. It is also shows a great irony in today's society, where people will go to bed without knowing each other (and this probably happened even before one night stands even existed...). Sex is trivial, while reaching each other's inner thoughts, feelings and truths is the unexpected, obtrusive and life altering act.<br /><br />The acting is very good and realistic. The dialogs are great and keep you enticed to the movie. The plot is good and has a lot of depth, but I think it has some minor flaws (no big deal, though). The sex scenes are very artistic, but I wouldn't take my kids to watch it.<br /><br />If you like Before Sunrise/Sunset, you will enjoy this movie a lot (but don't worry, it won't replace them in your shelf). If you liked this movie dialogs or any part of it (besides the sex scenes), you should watch Before Sunrise as soon as possible.
