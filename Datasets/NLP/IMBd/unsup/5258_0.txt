This film is miles better than you might expect from the video cover (a bunch of impossibly young good looking kids - I thought 'Star Trek' rip-off, but no, it's better than that, even if it did come from a video game) (or so I am told..) Freddie Prinze jnr is a bit wooden, but the other actors more than make up for it. The marvelous Tcheky Karyo is a standout, and so is David Suchet, popping up quite unexpectedly, as the too short-lived Captain of the Tiger Claw. The women are excellent as well, Saffron Burrows as Angel Devereaux and Ginny Holder as Rosie Forbes. The story has depths and I wanted to learn more about the Pilgrims, and the war against them... The international cast is a great strength, how refreshing to hear a mix of voices and accent for a film set in 2654 (?).
