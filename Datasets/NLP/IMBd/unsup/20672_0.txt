Ouch! This movie is painful to watch. The SAG should require a warning on the movie box saying "This movie could be hazardous to your eyes". This is the retarded mans "Die Hard". The cast consist of two juice heads, a few nerds and a semi-hot stripper/actress. All of which can not act their way out of a wet paper bag. Salt is thrown into the wound by a special effects display that appears to be done by Corky with a $100 budget. And to top it all off, we don't even get any T&A shots from the chick:o( All the so called actors/actresses need to either go back to acting school or go back to waiting tables. As far as the movie production quality, I have seen better writing and production value in porno movies. I give this movie 2 thumbs and a soggy Oscar-Meyer hot-dog DOWN!
