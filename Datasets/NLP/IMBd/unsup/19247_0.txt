I vote 10 out of 10. Film was great I enjoyed all of watching time. I have watched more than 5 times and whenever i think of my resemblance with character Dum. He lived alone all his life without love and only thinking Rumpey helped him worth of living. Also I had that feeling in my life that everything hasn't be happy and so this film make me felt so emotions (laughing, a little bit crying) that's for me best film ever. Directors makes films to people so they can really enjoy it and Sasaientag did it to me. Also touching soundtrack helped show the emotions if the characters. So best film ever for me I suggest to watch it at least 1 time very enjoyable!
