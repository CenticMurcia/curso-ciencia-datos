Simply put, the film has as much resemblance to the book as the American Godzilla film has to the original.<br /><br />The book, which is actually written by R. Chetwynd Hayes, is much better. Had they remained faithful to it, people might have had a finer opinion of the film.<br /><br />The movie only has one story from the book, "The Humgoo." The other two tales either are a mishmash of two stories, "The Mock" and "The Shadmock," or aren't in the book at all (that horrid tale about the boy whose father is a vampire).<br /><br />If only the filmmakers had included "The Vampire & The Werewolf," it might have done better.<br /><br />As it stands, though, you won't be doing yourself any favors by watching this piece of crud. Feel for John Carradine and Vincent Price, as they don't really seem to be enjoying themselves.<br /><br />Read the book.
