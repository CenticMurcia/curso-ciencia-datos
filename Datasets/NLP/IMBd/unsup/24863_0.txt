This movie has some solid qualities that make it stand out far from the slew of 80's horror movies. If you like campy horror films with a sense of humor, then go find yourself a copy of this movie. I think the characters are a good mix of personalities. The action is kind of lame at first but picks up towards the end and the gore is half decent. This is a classic B movie entry that I had never heard of, nor knew anyone that has seen it. Troma bought the rights to it though they did not produce it. I hope it makes its way onto DVD.<br /><br />For being a practically unknown movie, it definitely delivers entertainment. Even though I wouldn't consider it a serious horror movie, I think it does a lot of things better than the so called serious horror movies.
