I was very worried when I heard Ben Stiller was making this movie and my fears came true. His and Owen Wilson's portrayal of Starsky & Hutch is an insult to anyone who ever enjoyed the show. The weak and whining characters they created along with the sexual overtones they put into place between Starsky and Hutch ruined what could have been tremendous fun. Once again Ben Stiller has proved to be a one-trick pony without any real acting abilities. Owen Wilson has created some entertaining movies, however this certainly is not one of them. The best that Stiller and Wilson can claim is a reasonable physical resemblance to the original stars of the television series. The movie is made even worse with the terrible performance by Snopp Dog as "Huggy Bear". This movie once again proves that Hollywood can take a good budget, a good television show, and produce a waste of time.
