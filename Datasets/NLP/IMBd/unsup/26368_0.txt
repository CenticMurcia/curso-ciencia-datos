Filled with several plot-twists and unconventional classical music, 'Stuff Stephanie in the Incinerator' focuses on three main characters, all of whom seem to be wealthy and have a flair for the theatrics. Their hobby, is thinking up different characters and scenarios, then living them out. What the film-makers succeeded in here, is not letting the viewer know if what they are watching is real...or fantasy. But sadly, that's about all they got right. To me, the essential ingredient in any good (or even bad) film is the writing. And in this case...it was terrible. I don't mind bad acting, no-budget production, lousy editing or any of that stuff. But if the story doesn't grab me (and this didn't), it's all a complete waste of time.<br /><br />I definitely don't recommend it.
