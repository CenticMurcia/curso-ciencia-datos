Wilbur is a wonderful character, he is the type your mother warned you about, but in the end he becomes the man of your dreams.. He is dangerous to a fault, yet gentle. He is scared of life, and tries as hard as he thinks possible to kill himself, but due to his will to live, he cannot finish what he started... I reccommend this movie for everyone, I enjoyed it immensely.<br /><br />I went to see the movie and found myself stunned by the cinematography and the actors are notebly good.
