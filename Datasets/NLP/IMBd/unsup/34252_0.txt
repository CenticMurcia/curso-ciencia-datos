I saw this film recently at the Vancouver Film Fest and left thoroughly disappointed.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, this film is rather one-dimensional. Easily 75% of the movie is Alan Conway (Malkovich) hanging out in bars trying to convince guys that he's Stanley Kubrick so they'll: a) give him free drinks and stuff AND/OR b) sleep with him. Which gets old pretty quick... Virtually no insight is given as to what drives Conway's need to escape the insignificance of his life.<br /><br />Also, the repeated allusions to Kubrick's films are so heavy-handed that they some off feeling uninspired. A little more subtlety would have gone a long way, and prevented from reminding me of how superior Kubrick's films are in comparison to the one on-screen.<br /><br />All in all, it's not a completely terrible movie. However, given the subject matter and the lead actor I definitely felt really let down by this film.
