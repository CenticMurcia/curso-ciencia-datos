this movie sucked. For one, they made the hulk to freakishly big. He's supposed to be about 7 - 8 feet tall. Not 15 feet! On the second point, Bruce Banner was exposed to Gamma Rays by way of an explosion, not by some lab experiment or any other way. And third,why couldn't they have had one of the hulk's famous arch enemies appear in the film? Like the Abomination. The idea of the "hulk dogs" was absolutely stupid. Concerning his size, how do you explain his pants stretching that much? When he's running amok in San Francisco, the movie started to resemble King Kong. The good news is that a new, revamped, Hulk movie is coming out in 2008. I'm sure it will be better than this crap.
