Possibly the best Balkan comedy in 10 years! Masterful direction by Rajko Grlic and riveting performance by Emir Hadzihafizbegovic (without doubt the best Bosnian actor ever).<br /><br />A comedy that's actually funny! Because the humor is so raunchy and scatological some people may be a bit embarrassed about entering into the spirit of this film, but I'm sure they wouldn't be able to help themselves. I roared laughing out loud and that didn't stop until the final chapter that turned into a tragedy (there is always a thin line...) This is not so much a 'political' movie as some people may believe, rather it's a story focusing on the character and mentality of people from the Balkans. Despite all problems and absurdities of soldier life on brink of war their sense of humor remained second to none. Highly recommended! 10/10
