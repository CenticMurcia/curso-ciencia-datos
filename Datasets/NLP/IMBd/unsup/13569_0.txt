I just saw this movie for the first time on cable and absolutely loved it! I don't understand how it could have bombed at the box office. This movie looks in-depth at human relationships and the impact of our decisions on others. Robin Williams as usual does an incredible job of portraying the robot who acts human and wishes to look the part. Hallie Kate Eisenberg is just as adorable as always and does a wonderful job in her first movie part. I encourage anyone who has yet to see this movie to rent it or catch it on TV. It really captures the emotions of the characters and leaves you feeling all warm and fuzzy. Happy watching!
