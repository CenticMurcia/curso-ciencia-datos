I finally got around seeing Alex Jones 911: The Road to Tyranny, which a left-winged friend of mine, told me was very revealing. This left-winged friend of mine, I must tell you also believes in UFO's and that CIA created LSD and AIDS to get rid of opponents  but he is a great guy none the less. The first 30 minutes of" 911: The Road to Tyranny" I was appalled. I really believed in the so-called facts of the documentary. But the documentary quickly fell apart after that. I have never seen a so bias a filmmaker as Alex Jones was in this documentary. Alex Jones carefully chooses the evidence and totally ignores all the tonnes of evidence that speak against his own cause. Further more: all the so called "evidence" can easily be read in another fashion  that is: his entire conclusion can very easily have been misread, because it is based on very few and very easily disputed evidence. This "documentary" is just too political, to be considered neutral or have anything to do with the truth. Alex Jones is simply way too bias in his theories and the way he work. Alex Jones deliberately ignores and lies about certain facts about all facts that just in a small way could compromise his political statements against George Bush and USA. The rest of the documentary is very laughable  Alex Jones does time and time again deny undeniable facts, over and over again, very low-quality job you could say. Alex Jones have taken the few small things that could support your theory, and then you twisted them in a very political way, to fit your own theory People like Alex Jones are ruining the unwritten rules about documentaries should be neutral and non-political. I will never trust a documentary again: thank you Mr. Jones, thank very much for ruining a good and until now neutral genre. I personally respect Michael Moore and his documentaries  they are at least bound in reality. <br /><br />I can sum this political "documentary" up in a few words: Very poor workmanship.
