Sam Jackson never disappoints. I loved this movie! I didn't know what to expect, and was surprised at how good it was. My husband even liked it, which is somewhat unusual, as it was partially subtitled. A wonderfully told story, with a great plot twist, and an enthralling climax. A "must see" for anyone with a brain.<br /><br />10/10...again...I don't give this rating very often.
