Usually, I like to be 'troma'tized. From the "Toxic Avengers" to"Rabid Grannies", "Cannibal! The musical"... I really enjoy these movies and their fun atmospheres. And I also enjoy low-budget ones too. But this time, something is wrong.<br /><br />It's the story of Frankie, a war vet, 'troma'tized -sorry, traumatized- by Saigon and the War. He's jobless, has a very 'troubled' mind and needs to take care of his wife and their abnormal baby (thanks to the chemical weapons daddy recieved). His only 'friends' are junkies and gangs he owes money.<br /><br />Honestly, this movie is bad. It's unfair to call it THE worst movie, but it's true it's boring, classical (the ending is soooo obvious) and really glaucous. The same glaucousness as in "Henry, portrait of a serial killer" or "Cannibal Man", but this time instead of adding something to the movie and its tone, it doesn't work and you just want it to stop more quickly. The FX are pretty well made (the baby is surprising, as an ET cousin), the few gore is well made and the Vietnam's views could have been worst. But it can't save the whole movie. And the music is the most irritating I've ever heard. I know it's a low-budget, but still. If you want a good one, go for "Deadbeat at Dawn" by the excellent Jim Van Bebber instead.<br /><br />4/10
