My take on this movie: Helen Westley great. Randolph Scott a tall hunka sweetness. Ginger Rogers has nice accent. Irene Dunne lovely singer. Fred Astaire great, especially playing those organ fingers. Indianians and Indians a nice touch tongue twister. The elevator being stuck always gets some laughs out of me.<br /><br />I also like the 1950s remake: "Lovely to Look At".<br /><br />I loved the little black "vulgar" dress, the front at least. The back I would have re-designed to have more substance around the waistline.<br /><br />Scott's fianc√©/gf was a miserable, cold fish, cold block of ice. I am glad she got talked into getting the terrible dress. That was so funny, and an ironic comeuppance for her.<br /><br />A sweet movie. 10/10.
