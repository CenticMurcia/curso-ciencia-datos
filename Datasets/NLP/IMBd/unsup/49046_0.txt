this movie is billed as a spoof/comedy,but it's not really funny.there are 1 or 2 mildly amusing moments,but mostly it's just silly,without being funny.this movie would work as an actual spy movie,except that you have the expectation that you will laugh.it's gonna be hard to get the required 10 lines of text in here,but i'll try.i think the problem is the filmmakers tried too hard to get laughs.sometimes you can go too far with a joke and it ends up as flat as a pancake.so the movie isn't really funny,but it does have 1 redeeming feature.that is the casting of Andy Griffith(TV's Matlock and the Andy Griffith show) as a maniacal nut case who plans to either destroy the world or rule it.Griffith is great in this movie.he has so much fun in the role.Barry Bostwick is also good for some comic relief.but overall,the movie is not good.the most i can squeeze out for "Spy Hard" is a 4/10
