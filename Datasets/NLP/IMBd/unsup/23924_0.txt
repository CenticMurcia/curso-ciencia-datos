In this age of consumerism and multimedia, this movie makes you wish you were born in the thirties, a time of naivety, fantasy and wonderful "tunes" as well. Woody Allen here remembers his childhood, and his narration is involving, funny and moving at the same time, making you say "past times were better", even though you've never been there. A delicious Mia Farrow and an awesome photography by Carlo Di Palma complete this perfect little jewel.
