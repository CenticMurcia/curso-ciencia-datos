This is blasphemy! Doesn't Clive Barker have the final power to say no to a Hellraiser movie ?!? I gave this a "4" because it was mildly entertaining. The acting was hurtin' for certain. The lead girl was beautiful. The guy playing Adam's father was the only decent actor though. That guy with the asthma problem was not only a bad actor but, annoying to look at with his gooberish expressions. This was like watching Scream. This had very little relevancy to The Hellbound Heart. Look at the fat cop at the end and you will see how much sense this movie made. Funny, seems as though our heroine has a pretty good imagination...
