A frightening look at a once thriving neighborhood which becomes the subject of decay.<br /><br />Veteran pros Lee Strasberg and Ruth Gordon are a married couple who live in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn and are literally terrorized by the gangs there.<br /><br />It was nice to see the wonderful Lillian Roth attempting a comeback in this film. As a tenant in an apartment building in Brighton, this film marked Miss Roth's return to the screen following a 44 year absence. She is effective though her part is brief. While her good looks faded with the years, she still had that pretty smile and I thought that at one part she would break into a medley of her former songs.<br /><br />Strasberg's inner world is falling apart just like the neighborhood. Stricken with cancer, Gordon dies literally in his arms.<br /><br />The ending is totally unrealistic. Could a man like an elderly Strasberg overpower one of these gang members? Come on now. Nonetheless, for nostalgia buffs, the film is worth seeing.
