I love "teen" movies. I loved 10 Things I Hate About You and all those other movies. With the exception of "Simply Irresistibe," this is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm a big fan of Julia Stiles, and it hurts me to have to watch her in this film. I don't know what the writer was thinking, or what the producers were doing when they greenlighted this trash, but it is one of the most boring 2 hours in cinematic history. The dialogue is absolutely horrible, there is no plot, and even though there are some decent actors, Freddie Prinze Jr ruins it by coming off as a big dope. Stay away from this.
