You know what? Standing alone as a comedy, it had some really good moments, but as an action movie, this was beyond unbelievable and incredibly clich√©d. I'm going to start with the good parts, see, Eddie Murphy is still great as Axel and is always very funny. He has some really great moments, but for me in this sequel, it was Judge Reinhold that stole the show as Billy. He was just such a lovable goof, which was semi-sad since he was a cop in the film, but I got past that part pretty much since he has been a goof from the first Beverly Hills Cop movie.<br /><br />Axel is back in business, in Detroit he gets into a once in a lifetime for a cop normally, type of shoot out with dirty business men, one who is an extremely super duper bad dude, who just won't stop killing people or stealing, why do you ask? Because he's a super duper bad dude! Well, he leads Axel to Wonderworld in Beverly Hills, California, where he finds out that that's where they do business. He gets his favorite buddy Billy back in the game and together they try to find a way to reveal the super duper bad dude's true identity to the crowd.<br /><br />Now the complaints, there are a huge list of them: first off, for security guards, most of them had pretty crappy shooting techniques and couldn't hit a barn. Secondly, Axel saved these children from a ride in Wonderworld, with one arm?! Third, a shootout like they had in this film in reality is a one in a million chance for a real life, but somehow Axel just seems to keep getting them like their a dime in a dozen. And fourth, the super duper bad dude, did the badness a little too much, to the point where it was just obnoxious. But who am I to judge, you try it.<br /><br />4/10
