This film is sloppier than a school dinner. Awfully cheap picture quality, lighting was terrible, sound even worse Â– the background sound most of the time drowned out the actors voices. The acting, apart from a 17-year-old Uma Thurman and a cough and a spit part from the ever-reliable Steve Buscemi, was also abysmal. Paul Dillon, obviously a relation of Matt, was a needless and very dislikable character who made me want to fast forward every time he appeared on screen. This monstrosity of a film was cheekily re released again to look as though it was a new Uma film, I have seen it floating around on DVD in second hand shops and car boot sales on numerous occasions - and now I know why. Avoid.
