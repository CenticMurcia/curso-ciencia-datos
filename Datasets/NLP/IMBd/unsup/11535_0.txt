For you outtake fans: The DVD collection includes a movie trailer for "Buck Privates", and in the few seconds shown of the "Drill" routine, if you look and listen carefully, you'll notice that this footage is NOT the same take as the scene in the finished film. I was startled when I noticed it.<br /><br />Having seen this movie dozens of times on TV over the years, I was also surprised to see a couple of minor scenes, for the very first time, that had always been cut by our local TV station in order to make room for the commercials. And the prints are great. If you're an big A & C fan, the DVD volumes are worth every penny (except maybe Vol. 4).<br /><br />Incidentally, I'm amazed to find that some Abbott & Costello fans are still under the mis-impression that they hated each other in real life. Not true, according to the several books I've read about the team. If I'm not mistaken, most knowledgeable sources describe their off-camera relationship as ranging from an amicable partnership to genuine friendship. Bud wept at Lou's funeral, for instance.<br /><br />The closest they came to a falling out, rumored to be instigated by those jealous of their success, was when, several years into their film years, Lou asked to have their 60/40 split of the take (60 Abbott/40 Costello) even'd out to 50/50. Bud agreed to Lou's request. (The 60/40 split for straight man/foil was more or less the standard for comedy teams during that era. Unheard of now, of course, but there you go.) But this incident was never a heated one, and never threatened their partnership or their friendship.
