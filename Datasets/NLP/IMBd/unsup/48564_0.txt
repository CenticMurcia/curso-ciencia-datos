Not a bad film as American cops and robbers cinema goes. But I am puzzled why so many US films focus on the toilet bowl of their society, burned out ghettos and amoral, worthless, usually unshaven characters. There is nobody in this movie to like. I know nothing about Long Beach NY but this film certainly triggers no desire on my part to visit there. Isn't that the reason communities lobby for filmmakers to shoot movies. I get a kick out of visiting places I have seen on film (or seeing films shot in places I have been.) Long Beach looks about as desirable as downtown Detroit. (And they never shoot movies there.) I found the whole thing depressing when it could have been inspiring. I generously gave it a four.
