Of course, I recommend this movie to any Wes Anderson fan, but if you're new to this director and you have yet to jump on 'the train,' (No pun intended), this is a fantastic place to start. Set against the backdrop of preset-day India, three brothers try to piece their lives back together after the shocking death of their father. As always, Wes gives us dead-pan acting, dead-pan camera angles and dead-pan composition, his signature moves. We are never quite sure whether to laugh or to cry, but we know the emotions we feel inside. Anyone who has ever tried to reconnect with any family member needs to see this movie, you will see the parallels, as crazy at it may seem, it's true. Everyone of our families has a character just like in any of Wes' films.
