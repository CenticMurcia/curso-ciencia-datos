I don't know if I'm more angry and disgusted with the filmmakers of this piece of stinky-cheese, or my local video store for carrying it for rent! This movie 'might' have been borderline okay with even a crappy TV cast and some dialog that didn't seem made up on the spot, but... probably not. Avoid this stink bomb of a "movie" at all costs... Hey -- get a director that knows what they are doing, take acting lessons and learn how to write a script BEFORE you try to make a movie. It might work out better for the audience in the end.<br /><br />90 Minutes of my life I want back, NOW. Maybe I'm the fool for sitting through the whole thing!
