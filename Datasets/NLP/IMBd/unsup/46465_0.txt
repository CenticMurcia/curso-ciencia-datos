This show is probably one of the worst shows I've seen on the network. I have begun to even avoid its commercials because I still am astonished how its been on TV so long. This show is probably the worst thing I've seen in a decade. When I say bad... I MEAN BAD. The things done are mostly scripted and very repetitive. All there is, is riots and people beating other people up. I just don't understand how this show was even thought about putting it on air, because its just so bad. It's completely ridiculous. Out of 5 stars *****, I don't think I would even give it a star.<br /><br />At all costs. Avoid this show.
