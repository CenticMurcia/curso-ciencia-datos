This movie has a good concept, but it is ruined by Sarandon's horrible performance. She is forever latched into playing herself, a foul mouthed, small minded individual to whom the world must constantly adapt and cater to. Just like her other meager performances, and something to avoid, unless you like discarding two hours of your life frivolously.
