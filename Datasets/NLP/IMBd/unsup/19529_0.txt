I Love this show (although I was a baby when the second series was aired) All the characters are so cool especially Tucker, Garvey, Nancy and Donna. The show so deserved the awards it got it is amazing how the stories in the lives of loads of individuals in army life can be portrayed in such amazing detail. I also like Ultimate Force which is also about army life, but Soldier Soldier tells the stories of the lives of the wives and girlfriends as well as the stories of the actual soldiers. This was an amazing TV Show, is is a shame that i couldn't watch it when it was first televised. (Does anyone know if it is TV on a Sky/ cable channel?)
