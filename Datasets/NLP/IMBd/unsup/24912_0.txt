When this show first came out it was considered the Sex and the City for the black folk, and while the premises of the show is smiler (withe the four female friends looking for love career and everything else in between) it's rather different as well.<br /><br />it's incredibly witty in that Frasier type way and that probably has to do with Kelsy Grammar producing the show, and while they not afraid to talk about sex or in the case of Joan the lack there for every episode is not contaminated with naked torsos all over.<br /><br />this show does not give the illusion that as a writer for a weekly column you can afford to stay in the heart of Manhatton (i come from South Africa and i know that is expensive) and afford Jimmy Choo's and Blonicks please, these women work hard to look as good as they do, and in Joan's case you might even make yourself broke trying to maintain the look.<br /><br />This show defiantly found a way to touch on all subjects, broken homes (with out being stereotypical because daddy doesn't always have to beat mommy or be an alcoholic for the home to break up) in the case of Maya and her husband.<br /><br />you have the Nimphomaniac friend who refuses to stop studding and get a job in the case of Lynn.<br /><br />the up and coming Legal Aid in the form of Maya <br /><br />the definite girls girl in the form of Toni Childs so this show def has something for us all....<br /><br />Defnaitly something for the ladies but Gentlemen you more then welcome to join the fun....
