I am so sorry, after all of the online hype I REALLY wanted to like this. I was finally able to catch the first 7 episodes here in the states on BBC America & I was disappointed. The idea was there, even if it was ripped off from Anne Rice & her Mayfair witches, even the atmosphere and setting was pretty decent, and no one can really speak badly of Thelma. However I am a true fan of this genre and I have been spoiled by the high quality of the X-files and Buffy the vampire slayer. After experiencing what Chris Carter and Joss Wheden have given the world in paranormal storytelling I am appalled that this dreck could so easily satisfy so many. Hex is awful! The character's are not particularly interesting or sympathetic due to a severe lack of development - this blame can go on the writer's. It shouldn't be a welcome relief when a main character "bites it", as we say over here, however when Ella sticks it to Cassie we find ourselves really applauding a situation for the very first time in this show - SEVEN EPISODES IN! And I don't understand the casting of Michael Fassbender? Is he supposed to be "sexy"? Where I come from he would be the last guy picked for sports! The term "pencil-neck geek" comes immediately to mind.<br /><br />This show left me bored and unimpressed, Thank God it only took two episodes of x-file reruns to make me forget most of this. It is offensive to us that this show would liken itself to Buffy or any of our paranormal/SciFi shows. When it comes to murder mysteries no one can hold a candle to the Brits. However the paranormal/SciFi genre is better left to the Yanks.
