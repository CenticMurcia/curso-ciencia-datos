This movie was most definitely the worst film I've seen in the year of 2006. Not only is the story line jumbled and poorly maintained, but the technical work is disappointing. It held way too many characters to keep track of and way too many sub plots that lose your interest and attention throughout the wasted 2 hours. I suppose you can't expect much from a director who has spent most of her time on music videos. I would say hold your breath and save your money. Stupid shots in petty attempts to be creative, clich√©' dialogue and terrible acting, and the only thing that put this film up in the box office was a good preview. Don't get me wrong, there were some amusing and moderately entertaining scenes, but they were outweighed by the handfuls of junk surrounding them.
