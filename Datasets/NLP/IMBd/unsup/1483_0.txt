This film was so horrible, I'm not even going to go into detail about the plot. All I will say, is that it's a poorly acted, cheesy, predictable "thriller" that, unfortunately, is not trying to be comical. Young actor Trevor Morgan demonstrates to the audience with grace that you can get acting jobs even if you have no talent. I garauntee you you will be pointing and laughing by the last scene.
