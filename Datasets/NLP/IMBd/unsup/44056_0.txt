well no sooner had milla jovovich done away with her previous zombie killing fest, another adventure lurches menacingly toward her, or so the makers of this film would have you believe, in fact this films does little to further the praise (if there was much for the original) franchise, its loud brash incredibly clich√©d, wise cracking black man anyone? and loose on any meaningful plot, in fact the film makers deemed far more appropriate to deal with the flashy fight scenes and sexy protagonists than anything else.<br /><br />so racoon city is now over run and milla jovovich and jill valentine team up with various other survivors to escape from the zombie infested city, whilst being pursued by the umbrella corporations new toy, project Nemesis, an uber hard as nails villain, there s a less than engaging sub plot involving a doctor guiding jovovich and her lot to saving his daughter in return for there escape, and thats about it, there's no gravitas to any of the proceedings its just shoot explode zombies run and repeat, you wont care about the characters because there's nothing to make you care about them they act as eye candy and Little else.<br /><br />the style of this film is very out dated as previously mentioned they even decided it was a good idea to include a token wise cracking black guy in it all, along with the non stop techno music accompanied fight scenes, if at point you do feel drawn into what happening in front of you it so still dispelled by the drivel that holds it together.<br /><br />if you're a fan of the games then you may notice a few set pieces from resident evil two, the police a station and the gun shop are among the most obvious and there are a few corridor/alley way shots that a ripped straight from the game, other than that it strays so far from the original source material,if you don't know the games then you'd be forgiven in thinking the game was something of a devil may cry ilk. <br /><br />still if you like formulaic,dated horror action films then you'll lap it up if not then it'll do as post pub fodder.<br /><br />and if you don't drink then there may be nothing to stop its mediocrity depressing you, and making you wish you'd done something more worthwhile with an hour and a half
