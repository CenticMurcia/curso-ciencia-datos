The DC comic book heroes are so naturally interesting that it seems it would be very easy to make a good film here. However, they failed terribly. I found the film a little painful to watch. If I had another DVD on the coffee table I would have ended this one early.<br /><br />If you had to look for good things about this movie you can find a few. The actress paying Supergirl was very good. She really came across as a teenager with super powers  a little awkward at times, not always very self-assured. She was really good and had great schoolgirl good looks.<br /><br />However, it ends there. The dialog was strained. The story drug on, almost endlessly, with lack of action. The special effects were terrible even by 1984 standards (I often felt like I was watching the old Batman TV show). Someone else commented that they thought Faye Dunnaway was good. Sorry, I have to disagree. I felt the villains were just average, everyday, bad people  not the scheming, diabolical, evil but fascinating, super-villains typical in DC comics.<br /><br />If you want a good super-hero movie you need a great villain and a riveting plot that moves at a fast pace. You won't find that here. If someone would have warned me off seeing this they would have done me a favor. Hopefully I am doing that for you.
