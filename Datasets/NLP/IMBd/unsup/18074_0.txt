I like really smart, or brilliantly stoopid. I think brilliantly stupid is harder to pull of and they did it! The potty humor, snow ball fight, mini bike, etc, etc, etc were just awesome! I almost needed to wear a diaper I laughed so hard while watching this.<br /><br />Although I don't like all Jim Carry movies, I think he is enormously talented, and Jeff Daniels was the perfect match for him in this inept comedy! I watched Dumb and Dummerer for about 5 minutes and couldn't continue. It was too painful, and I felt really bad for the actors who tried to fill the shoes of Jim and Jeff in the first installment. There are no two that could have pulled it off. Just as Jacky Mason or anyone could ever replace Rodney in Caddyshack.
