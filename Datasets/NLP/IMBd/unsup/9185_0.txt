The major problem with the film "Let it Be" is the director who quite clearly shot far more footage and sound than he could ever hope to wade through (check out the 30 days bootleg to hear over 16 cds worth of sound recording made by the film crew) so when it time to match performance with film , well he couldn't do it . For proof of this checkout "suzy parker" , at no point in the film do you see Lennon sing this song because hogg either has no footage or cant find the footage so another songs performance of John's is dropped in to substitute. As a musician I noted many instances where what you are watching ( such as Billy prestons solo on "long and widing road " or george on "let it be") had zero bearing to what I was actually hearing ! There is a book you can buy that chronicles the exact( tlls of film that were used and which were patched into the film ( titled "Get Back the unauthorized chronicle of the Beatles Let it Be disaster) . The film is a good look at the Beatles second to last studio sessions but as a documentary goes there is so much tampering with what you see (its very badly synched up even when the performance does "match" the visual) that it loses marks in my opinion .
