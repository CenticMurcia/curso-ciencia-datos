<br /><br />The hole ironically named after its major weakness (holes in the plot!) seems to move from flash back to reality a little to frantically for me. Some parts seem rushed and it could of done with more interaction within the hole itself. The acting is hit n miss, Birch isn't great. And her accent tends to wander off to australia, south africa and back to her native country. Although the rest of the cast seem competent. I was specially impressed by Kiera Knightley as the slutty teen queen. This a refreshing film and an indication that School influenced comdies/dramas/thrillers. can be effectively implemented in England. The U.S bubble gum high school nausea is waring thin in the states and these kind of films have found a fresh ground (U.K) In the hole. Our cultural and class history doesn't have to be spelt out like the jock,geek,stoner bland recycled crap that floats to the surfaces regularly<br /><br />good 7/10
