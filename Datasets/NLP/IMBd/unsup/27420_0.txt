It's out on rent so, rent it. <br /><br />Man, is really good. It deals with a few stories that are connected if you think about it, mainly by a building. <br /><br />Love, lost, memories and discoveries are the main emotions that drive this movie. Again, another perfect film that's plot-less. This film even has an event, which has been done over and over in film but, just because you are not attached to a plot it seems like the most original event in the movie. Mothers, daughters, friends and fathers are all living their lives, like any of us, not noticing the small things in life. Our sense, specially sight and sound are over stimulated by this beautiful movie. The little simple things is what drives this movie and god that's filmmaking, that's art. Let me tell you how good it is, is so good, the movie was over and I stopped the DVD and started it again, I was it twice last night I think I'll see it tonight again.<br /><br />
