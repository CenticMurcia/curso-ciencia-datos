But whoever came up with this crap? The series had more action, more funny lines, and a packed story altogether. The effects are crappier than I've ever seen before. Take the shot with the lorry that's being rocketed - you clearly see a dummy driving. Or the shot where a car passes a tram, it's clearly computer generated.<br /><br />Might not be that bad, but untrue characters that do really stupid moves, it might have been acceptable at the beginning of cinema.<br /><br />And then the soundtrack. After practically every scene a bit of English or German noise has to be added. Why, is it a musical or what?<br /><br />Really awful and unbelievable. We've seen many events in other movies before, and a lot better. I loved Kommissar Rex, Derrick, Der Alte, Der Klown, but this is major C*R*A*P!
