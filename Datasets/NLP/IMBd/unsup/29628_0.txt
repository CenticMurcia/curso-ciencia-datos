The cast is just perfect. The casting crew have done an excellent job. Roger, Tuesday, Corey, RT, Margret, Katie, Sophia even Owen are all good actors. It is 1000 time better than that 70s show. That 80s show is way more hilarious than the 70s show. The 70s show had crappy flashbacks and overall was pathetic. While the 80s show had excellent characters and the jokes were hilarious. All the crew performed above themselves. The storyline rules! I hope it is brought back because there is super potential in this show.<br /><br />Full on crack up! The setting is mad the cast is cool!<br /><br />10 out of 10 for a Sitcom no doubt!
