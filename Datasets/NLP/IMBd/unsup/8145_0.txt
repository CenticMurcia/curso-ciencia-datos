Roger Moore plays the head of a private security force specializing in matters at sea named ffolkes. He is a gruff women hating perfectionist who prefers cats to people. When Anthony Perkins leads a team of hijackers in taking two oil rigs the British government is forced to call in ffolkes.<br /><br />Call me crazy, but I love this film. Its always been one of my guilty pleasures and its often a film I'll watch on a rainy do nothing sort of Sunday. Moore is allowed to actually act, granted with tongue firmly in cheek, and show that he could do more than just be James Bond. As the villain Anthony Perkins is wonderfully loopy as a man who thinks that he's gotten all of the bases covered. The plot and the action is of a solid B-movie style and it doesn't try to be anything more than be a 100 minute popcorn movie. Best of all is the humor which is knowing and right on target, as when ffolkes becomes flustered when trying to warm up what he thinks is a young man .<br /><br />If you want a good film to fill an afternoon or evening, try this film. I doubt you'll be as crazy about it as I am, but I do think you'll enjoy it.
