I found the cast to be very good. Mr Lane was exceptional as were other members of the cast. I must say that it was in my opinion as his best movie he has done. I have seen this movie many times, from this my interest in him has grown. His character Max Prince reminded me of his true character. Serious yet entertaining. I personally would like to see the play for this movie as I have heard that the cast were different to the ones in the movie, this would probably allow me to judge which was more superior. I must agree with the fact that the music could have been chosen better, as to could be said of the location, my recommendation would be Chicago or new york.
