"Home Alone 2" clones virtually every aspect of the original,without adding anything new or funny. The plot is basically the same except this time the movie takes place in New York and not in a house. Macaulay Culkin gives a decent performance but he can't save this movie. I suggest that anyone who wants to see this that they go rent the original, you will be much more entertained.
