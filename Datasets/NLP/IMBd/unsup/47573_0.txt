Spaceballs is the first spoof movie and Mel brooks movie i saw, and i loved every minute of it. when i heard of this show i was yelling "i need to see this! do we have G4?" etc. Im glad Mel, Joan rivers and Daphne Zuniga are back as their roles, Dee baker is OK as helmet (he actually funny in Spaceballs of the Caribbean), Tino insana sounds good as a John candy impersonator, but Rino Romano sound boring, he doesn't even try. every episode is a spoof of hit movies(Skroobinator,spidermawg, watch your @$$ic park etc), i was hoping for "search for more money" and even a spaceball prequel. P.S. Mel brooks did not write any of the episodes. one more thing, i wanted more colonel Sanders, where is he!! i missed him
