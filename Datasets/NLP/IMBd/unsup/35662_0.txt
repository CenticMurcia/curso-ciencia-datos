Maybe the story was good. Unfortunately, I can't say for sure since Carpenter's painstaking direction failed to hold my attention for more than a couple of minutes at a time. I know it's unreasonable, etc. to hold a director up against his previous work, but c'mon John, you know better than this--where Halloween was riveting, Prince of Darkness was, well, tedious.<br /><br />It did have it's good moments. The makeup was effective, and Alice Cooper does creepy as well as you could hope. "Prince" also ranks high on the Eighties kitsch scale--I counted three mullets, and that handlebar moustache speaks for itself.<br /><br />On the whole, however, I'd recommend this only to those blessed with extreme patience and attention spans. It's not worth the $2.99 at Blockbuster, but if you come across it on FX or something, it might be worth your while to flip between it and "The Jeffersons."
