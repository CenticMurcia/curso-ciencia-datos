Interesting "Friday the 13th" entry has nothing connecting it to the last entry ("Jason Takes Manhattan"). Instead, the opening has Jason pursuing a nubile young woman through the woods; she turns out to be an FBI agent who lures Jason right into a trap - and his body is blown to smithereens in the ensuing ambush. HOWEVER (of course, there has to be a "however"), this still doesn't mean that Jason is dead - the evil force that has animated Jason all these years is still very much alive and free to inhabit a succession of victims.<br /><br />This ninth "Friday the 13th" movie has some interesting story twists that were only then, after eight previous movies, being concocted.<br /><br />This is an energetic, emphatically violent, lively (and very mean-spirited, unfortunately) horror sequel with spectacular gore (particularly in the unrated director's cut) and performances that are actually something approaching decent.<br /><br />An entertaining way to spend an hour and a half.<br /><br />There are a few visual in-jokes that horror fans will instantly recognize.<br /><br />In addition to playing Jason, stuntman Kane Hodder also appears sans makeup as one of two FBI agents (he's the big, bearded one) guarding the morgue.<br /><br />Even if you don't enjoy it, you may want to stick around for the surprise in the very last scene. It will either make you groan or clap, depending on your disposition towards these kinds of movies.<br /><br />8/10
