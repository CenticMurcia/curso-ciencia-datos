I never even heard of this movie, until about a year ago. I seen it for sale at blockbuster. I bought it because of Sean Penn. This is one good gangster movie that few know about. The acting is great, it surprises you and even has a pretty good love story going on. One of the best scenes you have to see, is when Ed Harris meets with his boss about killing his brother(Oldman). The tension is so strong when he tells his gang to come and back him up if he don't call by 2:oo o'clock. This is good movie making. You have to see this scene and the movie has a lot of great ones. I highly recommend State of Grace.
