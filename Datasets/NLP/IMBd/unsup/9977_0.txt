I've seen the MST3K version of this movie under the "Time Chasers" title, and I agree that it is NOT a good movie. In fact, it is barely watchable, and the leading man is not at all photogenic, and shows little-to-no charisma on film. He IS rather likable if you aren't looking for an Arnold or a Clint to carry your movie. I rather suspect with that strong chin and wedge shaped face that he is the type that looks much better in person than on film, which is the sad case for many otherwise decent actors.<br /><br />However, it hardly deserves to be in the Bottom 100, ranked below sludge like "Space Mutiny","The Creeping Terror", or "Escape 2000". It comes off as some would-be auteur's attempt to tell a story he'd been thinking about for years, and it has some heart and some honesty to it that are missing from many of the films on the "Bottom 100". It is ten times more competent than "House of 1000 Corpses" or any of Coleman Francis' work.<br /><br />The story attempts to be thought-provoking and amusing, sort of a sideways version of "The Man Who Folded Himself" or "And He Built A Crooked House", and no one in the film is as bad or corny as, say, the actors in "Werewolf" or Bo Derek in "Tarzan". What the movie is missing is good direction, or any real energy or compelling drive to hold the viewer's interest.<br /><br />So yes, the movie is dull and boring, but it lacks the sleaziness, or contempt for its audience, or sheer incompetence that mark so many movies on the list.
