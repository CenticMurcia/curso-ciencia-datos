A psychiatrist, Dr. Marcus Collier who is the head of the Institute of Behavioral Studies, is having an affair with one of his patients and is using extreme methods to render information from her during hypnosis sessions so that he can write a revolutionary book. When the patient's husband threatens to expose him, a fight involving the three of them ensues and Collier accidentally kills him; he quickly decides to make it look like two intruders executed the act during a burglary...<br /><br />A refreshingly originally conceived Columbo adventure, which like "Death Lends a Hand" and "Dagger of the Mind" features a spontaneous act of manslaughter, which is covered up to become a murder.<br /><br />Another asset to this episode is, in spite of the simplicity of the carefully-crafted "burglar" cover-up, how Columbo is able to increasingly undermine it's likelihood with elements the viewer is largely unable to telegraph. This is unusually conveyed by Columbo at a party full of guests; an engaging and sharply observed sequence, which also sees the murderer cleverly execute the murder of this lover through hypnosis over the telephone.<br /><br />One must also mention the quality of Hamilton's performance in all of this; his character's womanising ways are typically exhibited, but his presence in this episode warrants respect, especially considering his unflappability and self-assuredness; traits which are powerfully upheld until the closing scenes, when he tries to undermine Columbo's perceptions of proof and the validity of an eye-witness (who comes forward rather conveniently late in proceedings) in front of his colleagues.<br /><br />Like "Death Lends a Hand", "Mind Over Mayhem" and "Negative Reaction" Columbo effectively gambles on the murderer implicating himself. The methodology used here is mind-blowingingly clever and caps another very worthwhile case for Columbo aficionados.
