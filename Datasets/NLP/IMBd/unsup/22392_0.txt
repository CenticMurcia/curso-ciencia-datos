What the hell is that show..This is basically what American teenagers looks like...This how MTV portrays them..wow... Laguna Beach does the same thing...All spoiled teenagers which the prize of the things they own is sometimes mistaken for their phone numbers!...They look like those women that freaks out on their wedding day!..You know the TV show..They don't know how fortunate they are and They dare to complain...i live in Canada and to me that is a culture shock If this how teen girls are......well...they would feel like living in a Survivor in Canada...we are not poor..not at all...But come on...this is ridiculous and even pitiful...poor parents...<br /><br />Its probably the worst TV reality show ever!
