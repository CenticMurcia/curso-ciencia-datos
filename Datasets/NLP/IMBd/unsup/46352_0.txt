One of the worst movies i have ever seen! I didn't find anything worth in the movie. These kind of movies shouldn't be brought to theaters. They were only trying to steal our money. I cannot think for a reason that someone should see this movie, it didn't have a plot ,at least until the middle of it because i left from the cinema at about that time. it was the first time i left from the cinema and didn't see a movie till the end. Perhaps if the movie had a little bit more dialogs it would be better, but there is a pause of about 30 minutes where you don't hear a word and go to places of the writer's imagination. This is where you start thinking maybe i should have gone to Superman:the return or to a bingo night (anything else but this)
