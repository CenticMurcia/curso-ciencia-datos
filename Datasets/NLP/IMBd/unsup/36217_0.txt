I'm surprised the screen writer's efforts were listed under the term "credits". He trashed the book, he trashed the bats, and everyone who was involved in the making of this film should have been sued for wasting the viewers' time and money. Rinehart's original story was a (dated) but interesting and entertaining tale of suspense, nothing that involved misinformation about little animals. Considered by some as the author's best work, this deserved better treatment. As for the acting, well...it's not that Vincent Price was incapable of a decent performance - "Shelby" was delightfully slimy in LAURA, but he seemed to need better direction than he got in this stinker. Read the book - or watch the paint peel from the ceiling. Either would be a better use of your time.
