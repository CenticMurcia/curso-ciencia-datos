Robert McKimson's 'Hurdy-Gurdy Hare' suffers from a feeble premise which never offers much of an opportunity for laughs. Bugs Bunny, in an unusually money-grabbing, greedy incarnation, purchases a hurdy-gurdy complete with monkey in order to make some money. When the monkey attempts to swindle him, however, he fires the simian and takes on his role himself. The monkey informs his father (an unattractive reimagining of Gruesome the Gorilla from McKimson's previous 'Gorilla My Dreams'), who comes after Bugs in search of retribution. Set against the dull backdrop of an apartment building, 'Hurdy-Gurdy Hare' feels instantly laboured and unfunny. It never even threatens to come to life once throughout its seven minute runtime and, while it doesn't quite plumb the depths of the studio's very worst output, 'Hurdy-Gurdy Hare' is a cartoon that I could easily live without ever seeing again.
