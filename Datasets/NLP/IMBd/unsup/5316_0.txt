I had been warned about Mike Leigh's 'All or Nothing', by a friend, and so approached it with trepidation. However there is a lot here to be admired. Yes, it's a depressing tale at times, and this is lent a lot by two cracking performances from a wonderfully hang dog and passive Timothy Spall, and a cast-against-type turn from Lesley Manville as his shrewish wife. There is a scene when Spall repays his wife some money he has borrowed from her that just perfectly encapsulates the pain at the heart of their relationship. There is also some fantastic actressing around the edges here: Marion Bailey gives probably the most realistic portrayal of an alcoholic that I have ever seen on film, Alison Garland underplays perfectly in the aching role of the quiet sibling (that seems to have become a staple of Mike Leigh's dramas), and the wonderful Ruth Sheen gifts us a counterbalance in an optimistic role as the neighbour who refuses the be pummelled into submission by her daughter's foul mouth, responding with a smile and humour. Sally Hawkins also impresses as Bailey's gum chewing daughter, and makes for interesting viewing if you have already seen 'Happy-go-Lucky'. There are also some wonderful little comedy moments that punctuate this film if you can get your head round the bleakness. But Mike Leigh's forte has always been human relationships and he doesn't disappoint here. And around the hospital bed in the final scene Leigh gives us that slight taste of hope that has made the journey worthwhile. It's superior stuff.
