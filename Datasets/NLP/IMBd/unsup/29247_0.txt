I don't understand why people expect movies like these to be superb. This is a low budget movie with a very few well established cast and the cast has acted their parts well and the movie in general had good scripts. By the way we expect some few goofs here and there but hey, the car races were crap I think thats what spoiled the movie. And the movie could also have done damage with a little more romance(I mean Kelly and Jack could have kissed at least one descent kiss).<br /><br />MOst movies that are acted outside the US and UK are not all that, I wonder why Wesley Snipes agreed to do this movie. I hope there will be a sequel, I think they can do better than that because there is a lot of potential in it.
