I'm surprised somebody actually got money to shot this turkey. Goes slow, slow, slow through the snow... and ends nowhere. Completely absurd story with some kind of pseudo-ecological concerns about global warming. (By the way, what happened with global warming this year? It's been a bloody freezing summer in England!). On top of this, the director thinks he's Bergman or something, and punishes us further with "arty" shots which are neither pretty nor arty. They're just plain boring.<br /><br />Don't waste an hour and a half of your life watching this "film". Just skip to the last ten minutes to have a laugh with the crap CGI. The Elk-Demons are absolutely hilarious.<br /><br />I'm thinking of claiming compensation. Seriously.
