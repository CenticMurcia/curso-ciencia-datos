I loved this film! Finally a movie with gay characters that's thought provoking and funny without featuring vapid pretty boys coming out of the closet and finding true love. These characters are crazy and so deeply unsettling that I couldn't take my eyes off them. They're enchanting and flawed and I just wanted to give each one of them a hug! The dialogue is witty and brutally honest. The movie is like a warped after school special. It's sentimental but at the same time totally bizarre and crass. It reminded me of the TV show Strangers With Candy. This<br /><br />movie is unlike anything I've ever seen before. It's surprising, heartwarming, disturbing, twisted and utterly original. I can't wait to see what this director can do when he has a bigger budget.
