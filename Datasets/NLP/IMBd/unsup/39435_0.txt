Well if the Disney studio couldn't have gotten any worse back then well check out this piece of work! Clearing running out of ideas, Walt Disney clangs two classic novels together and turn them into a brand, new piece of storytelling the Disney way (similar to Fun and Fancy Free's "Mickey and the Beanstalk") but this whole movie lacks the heart, movement and the ordeal than all the other Disney adaptations. Like in "Sleepy Hollow" why do they turn Ichabod Crane into a long-nosed, clueless moron who is frightened of his own shadow? And in "The Wind in the Willows" how is it that Toad's horse-pulled caravan can easily jump over rivers? ANSWER THAT ONE! The animation is below Disney standard of the time and the voice-overs are so lame that they make you want to vomit but with the expection of Eric Blore who makes a brilliant Toad. Bing Crosby and Basil Rathbone are brilliant narrators. Overall, this Disney movie stinks and I'm not putting it in my favourite movies league in a hurry!<br /><br />1/10
