Believe me, reading the plot summaries to this film, especially the back of the DVD, make the film so much funnier because the film is nothing like what the film creators want you to think. The tribe of ape men is hilariously pitiful, almost as bad as the acting. This is a movie that completely lacks an ending, especially if you were expecting something from what you've read on the back. <br /><br />I think one of the best and funny things about The Wild Women of Wongo is the fact that it wasn't intended to be the comedy that it is.<br /><br />I ended up giving this a rating of three only because of its comical value - if you don't make this an interactive film, by which I mean talk about it and make fun of it as it plays, you will be bored. I must admit, though, that I got it as a present at a Christmas present, and it was a hoot at the party. I don't know if Mystery Science Theatre ever got a hold of this one, but they ought to have.
