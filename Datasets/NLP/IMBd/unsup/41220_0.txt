What is the hobbit anyway? April 15, 2004 was when saw this movie. The intended audience for this movie is children although the movie was not rated. The hobbit is an action/adventure movie. The opening date for the was in 1977. The movie was 78 minutes long. Some of the voices are John Huston (Gandalf) who also directed Annie, Otto Preminger (Elvenking) who also played in The Human Factor, Rosebud, and Skidoo. Also, Cyril Ritchord (Elrond) who played in the new clothes, half a sixpence. Jules Bass, the director, also directed The Wind in the Willows, 'silverhawks,'flight of the dragons, the Thundercats, the Coneheads. The general opinion of other people that have viewed this movie said it was magnificent. One viewer said, "as echoed on my "lord of the rings" comment, this production captures a positive aspect of the Tolkien material that I believe is missed by current critics and readers-namely the distant but constant promise f success in the quest."I didn't think that the Hobbit was as good as some of the other movies produced in the 1970's, like the many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh, and watership. I personally thought there too much music. Maury laws has also done Wind in the Willows. The company which made the movie was Rankin Bass productions. Overall I really didn't like the movie "The Hobbit."
