I watched 'Buffalo Girls' because of the Larry McMurtry 'Lonesome Dove' connection. With a cast of the calibre of this offering this TV movie could have been remarkable, but this books' translation to the screen just kept making me wince. Everyone in this sadly average offering seemed to be working on auto pilot and I can only put it down to schmaltzy dialogue that followed the letter of the novel but not the spirit.<br /><br />I've seen Angelica Houston in a lot of things and enjoyed her in every one.... except this one. I wish I'd never seen it.<br /><br />Sorry
