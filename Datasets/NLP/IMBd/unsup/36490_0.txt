This is honestly the worst movie I have ever paid money to see. Throughout the entire movie, I could not figure out why we were supposed to care on little bit about either the exploits of the two writers or the two historians. I truly cannot think of a more contrived, boring, inane use of film. I am one of Gwynneth's biggest fan, however this film was simply horrid on every level.
