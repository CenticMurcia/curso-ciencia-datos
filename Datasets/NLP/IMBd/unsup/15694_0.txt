Had the pleasure of seeing a preview of this with the director and a producer at the Odeon Hemel Hempstead of all places on 8 May.<br /><br />Do NOT be put off by the trailer shown on British cinema screens over the last few weeks - its poor technical image quality is NOT representative of the movie in any way. Instead watch the (presumably American) trailer on this site.<br /><br />The central heroine - Cassandra - is a delightful new young actress and totally carries your interest through the movie and her convincing development from a naive teenager to a woman learning about the world and men.<br /><br />Tremendous production values with some super rustic/castle scenery as well as a beautifully staged 1930s London environments make for an entertaining couple of hours likely to appeal to anyone from teens to OAPs (who remember this teens from the 1930s!).<br /><br />Enjoy it while you can - though presumably as a BBC Films production it'll be on the small screen soon - big screens are better!<br /><br />Nothing earth shattering but good ENTERTAINMENT!
