My Take: Ridiculous and blood-thirsty. It's bloodily bad. <br /><br />Even if it was pure camp material, the original DELTA FORCE with Chuck Norris, Lee Marvin and a supporting all-star cast didn't take itself too seriously as it might have. The movie is pure B-movie, and it rarely took itself seriously. Same cannot be said about its sequel DELTA FORCE 2 in 1990 (also known as the COLUMBIAN CONNECTION). What the first film does with so much fun with itself was taken to darker and bloodier heights in this solid but joyless and too bloody sequel. Some stunt work (especially the skydiving scene and helicopters) are pretty good, but the overall film is too bloody serious to even be fun, hence it's often tedious.<br /><br />Chuck Norris looks bored replaying his role in the first film (Col. McCoy) for vengeance when his pal's wife was killed by a merciless drug dealer named Ramon Cotta (played with surprising menace by THE UNTOUCHABLES' Billy Drago), who has been freed numerous times after being captured. Although this villain is pretty mean as it should have, he's too bloody serious and cold-hearted, you'll hate him rather than like him for being mean. The rest of the film is as well, there's no fun to have here.<br /><br />If the film could have taken itself less serious, like the tone of its predecessor, it could have had more fun with its stunts and all. There are some neat stunts sequences as said, but like I said, it's not much fun. The seriousness could have been turned down and replaced with a lighter one, it could have warrant a passable rating (and perhaps, still keep its R rating). Production values aren't very high and some of the dubbing is weak, and the screenplay even given to the English-speaking actors aren't that good. Some fine helicopters but that's just about what this cheap "say no to drugs" B-movie from the Cannon Group Inc.<br /><br />Rating: * out of 5.
