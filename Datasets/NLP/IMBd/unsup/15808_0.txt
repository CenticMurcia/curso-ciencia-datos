"No Barking" is a standout short for a number of reasons. For animation geeks, the fact that Ken Harris was the sole animator for the entire short is certainly notable. The only appearance of Tweety in a Jones-directed cartoon is notable. Its a Milt Franklyn score instead of Carl Stalling. But only dog owners will be able to fully appreciate its most endearing quality- the fact that it accurately captures so many goofy dog behaviors that are absolutely hilarious. Sudden barking fits. Becoming convinced that an inanimate object has attacked. Mirror terrors. Bone-burying frenzies. And its not just the gag itself, its the expressions, the raised hairs, bared teeth, and subtle behaviors that are so spot-on (bad pun intended). Someone had a dog (or dogs) that deserved a lot of the "writing" credits on this one.
