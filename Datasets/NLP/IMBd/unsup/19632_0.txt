The story of a jewel thief who may or may not have retired and who is lured out of that "retirement" has been done before and done better by most other versions of the tale. On paper this should have worked, you have a good cast, a good director, a decent script (in theory) and enough money to do something special. The problem is that none of it comes together and you end up with a very big mess. Actually its like a beloved uncle who comes to cheer you up after a horrible disfiguring car crash but all he manages to do is depress you even more.<br /><br />WHat were these people thinking?<br /><br />It's awful, it's terrible, and I never want to see it again.<br /><br />Unfortunately I probably will, repeatedly on cable.
