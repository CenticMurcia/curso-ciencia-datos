Being a huge Gary Oldman fan, I had high hopes for this film. And the "Deleverence/Straw Dogs"-esquire story about an English couple vacationing at their friends house in a remote part of Spain where they find a poor child locked away in chains and have to face the wraith of local villagers, started off well enough. It had some good atmosphere and it kept my attention, however sadly It seems to run out of steam and lose it's direction somewhere along the way. I felt my interest waning as the story seemed to limp along to an extremely unsatisfying ending (however at that point I no longer cared) It IS always cool to see Oldman though.<br /><br />My Grade: C- <br /><br />Eye Candy: Virginie Ledoyen & Aitana Sánchez-Gijón both bare all <br /><br />Lion's Gate Region 1 DVD Extras: Trailers for "The Eye" remake, "Retribution", "Christie's Revenge", "Dead Man's Bounty", & "Blood Trails"; and a promo for Fear.net
