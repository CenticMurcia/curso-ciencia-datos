This movie is way over-hyped. I tried to get into it twice before I finally forced myself to watch it all the way through. I understand why it was noticed in America, though. It's presented like a typical Hollywood sandwich: one side slathered with sloppy special effects, the other with fast-paced action sequences. Drop The Matrix, Saw, and Underworld in a blender and this is what you get.<br /><br />The story feels contrived and is too convoluted for its own good. Many of the scenes are loosely connected to one another, making the story hard to follow. Using existing mythological archetypes (vampires, witches, etc.) is a fine attempt at helping the audience accept the other world presented by the story, but cracks at freshness are mostly failures. Nothing in this movie feels original.<br /><br />I don't hate this movie, but I don't think it's worth watching either. I've seen it done before and I've seen it done better.
