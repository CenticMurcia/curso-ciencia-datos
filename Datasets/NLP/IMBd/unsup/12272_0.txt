I first saw this film as a small child and it made a great impression on me---the nearness of God, the effects of our actions, like ripples in a pond. But most of all,the lesson in this film is God's Love and compassion for his creations. Eternal fountain of eternal love! I encourage everyone to watch this film---it will lift your heart, ease a troubled mind and bring you closer to God. I have seen this film many times over the years,each time there seems a new message or sight I had missed, before. The acting is delightful--- it is set in the country, and the actors (who may never have been out of the city, before!) are so natural, and most believable in this rural setting. Their struggles with temptation and the small everyday sins are depicted in a realistic way, and I love the angelic interaction! This film is a classic treasure, and should be shown in movie houses around the world.
