When I saw the movie picture I thought it was something like Alien or maybe like Jurassic Park, but I found a movie that is completely dissapointing, with an high level of violence/gore unnecesary, a stupid end, a creature that is ridiculous, etc, etc. If I have to say something good about this movie is that it taught me when I have to safe my money instead to rent a stupid movie.
