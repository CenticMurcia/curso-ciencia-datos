This movie is a burlesque attempt to ridicule the slasher movies. Using a reporter (blond of course lol) who's trying to produce a documentary on slasher killers and manages to get the consent of one to film him ''working''.It was quite a good idea ruined by....everything else! It could be great but there's a total lack of substance on the whole picture, on the killer itself, on the way the story is told, on the dialogues which are totally plane, and i hated, it started with the concept of one ''crew, one camera'', and was suddenly changed in the middle. The script (that could have become a pretty deep,disconcerting and realistic view over the original idea the movie starts on), was totally dashed by a deficiency in keeping any fact believable or sustained on any grounds, in total gaps in the story that make absolute no sense like:(why the crew stayed to the killing night and didn't warned anybody?wouldn't that make them accomplices?...why would they think the killer would let them go away clean, if by his own statements on the documentary, the idea was: No witness?, etc, etc, etc.....). I think this movie was just a copy of ''scream'' but without the fun. Watchable for the, yet kind of predictable, twist in the end,and the idea it starts on but that's it.
