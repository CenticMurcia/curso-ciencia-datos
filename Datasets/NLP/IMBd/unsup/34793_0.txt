I have not seen a movie, I have seen a poisoned bulk of very low-level propaganda. Yeah, just like "Aleksandr Nevskiy" or "War and Peace" somebody could say, but Moretti is neither Sergei Eisenstein nor Sergei Bondarchuk. The film fits the slot of Fahrenheit 9/11 and Bowling for Columbine: shouting to politicians. How interesting. The actors' play is very bad, but it's a constant feature of Moretti movies. If you are not a left-winged Italianman looking for politically engaged movies, don't watch it. If you are, watch Roberto Benigni, a real artist. If you simply are a guy other than Italian, looking for Italian Movies, look elsewhere.
