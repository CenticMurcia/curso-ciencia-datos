didn't like it at all was not what i expected it ruined a classic and the story was way off as the Iggy's dad was not the mayor and it was in fact Mrs Claus who went to mother nature not Santa himself and the characters were all wrong it did not have one good point in the who thing they even managed to ruin the snow miser and heat miser songs it was a major disaster i changed the channel and never went back too see it may now Hollywood will leave well enough alone but I'm not holding my breath anyways it was a waste of air time some might find it amusing but i did not and it was awful hopefully it will never air again but I'm not holding my breath on that one either
