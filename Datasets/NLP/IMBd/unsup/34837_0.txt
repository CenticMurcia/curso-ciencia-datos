The best part of this awful film is when the ending credits are rolling and you hear the band playing and singing the title song.<br /><br />Trouble is that the film is anything but good. 4 teenage girls and a young guy embark on a summer of fun when they land a job playing as a band at a beach resort. One girl is an orphan, but nothing is said about the other teens' parents. They just hop in a van and go.<br /><br />We have what could fall into a beach blanket movie with singing,gaiety, an attempted suicide and a romance between Justine Bateman and Liam Neeson, a widowed song writer who shall we say has a lot on his mind.<br /><br />Of course, Neeson likes the band so much that he wants them to defer school and go rock in Europe.<br /><br />I added the extra 1/2 star since the film did end correctly, that is, that school comes first. Unfortunately, this film comes in last.
