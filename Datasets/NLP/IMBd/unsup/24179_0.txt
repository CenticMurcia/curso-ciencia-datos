Oh man! Me and my five year old son saw this movie tonight and we had a rollicking good time..... it started off slow and surprisingly somber ( the kids dad is off at war; he's lonely, sad ).... however, once the water horse itself grows and is released into the loch, the movie turns into magic! Seeing the full-grown Cruscoe rise from the depths of the water had us both wildly cheering out loud, and the scene when the kid rode on his back and went for an underwater sea romp was pure celluloid gold -- beautifully filmed and an AMAZING RIDE!!!! Furthermore, while the "drama" at the beginning lagged, I actually find myself kind of into the anti-war drama towards the end. All in all, a most satisfying night out at the movies!
