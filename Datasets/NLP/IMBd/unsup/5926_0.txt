I watched this film in Poland, the fatherland of Agnieszka Holland, after being attacked and robbed in a dark alley earlier that holiday-trip. I had to watch it with one eye closed because of broken glasses, but this wonderful fairytale deeply moved me, brought many tears to my eyes nd transcended me in a happy world where everything is fine. At once I knew this was going to be forever the most memorable visit to the cinema. The story will be well-known.The end is fairly incredible, but that's what fairytales are usually like.What made this film so great was the wonderful music by Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner.Listen to the music alone and you'll know why this movie moves you.It's available on CD, like a lot of other filmmusic of this composer too ("Trois couleurs","Dekalog" and "At play in the fields of the Lord" to mention some).
