I'm sure this was a better movie in its native language but when dubbed in English it's impossible to understand. Either it's very abstract or the director and all the actors are completely stoned out of their minds, the movie is like a neverending seizure with cuts every two seconds and a poorly explained story involving (from what I can discern) crazy Russian vampires and some epic struggle between light and dark...<br /><br />I watched this at night with a good friend who was equally unimpressed, and we still have no idea what this movie is about. The whole time I just wanted it to end. Please never watch this, I actually consider this the worst movie ever made.<br /><br />Unbearable. 1/10
