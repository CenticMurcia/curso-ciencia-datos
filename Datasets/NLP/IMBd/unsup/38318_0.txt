The idea is interesting, and it's refreshing that people from future are in game, and not aliens again. And also, music, title sequence and effects are very well done.<br /><br />But story is not believable and neither is acting.<br /><br />I can't believe how unrealistic and incompetent American government and her officials are displayed. Well, except the part about acting all morally righteous, especially with people from other countries (Rwanda).<br /><br />It's a shame, because this could have been a great SF.<br /><br />Have you noticed advertisement?
