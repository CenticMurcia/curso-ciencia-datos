Not since The Wonder Years have I seen a show that has managed to capture the angst of growing up with such honesty, originality and humour. This show brought the characters to life and actually made you care what happened to them. The actors were great, the scripts were great, it got rave reviews from critics, the only reason this show isn't still on is because NBC never gave it a chance. The people who run the networks should be ashamed to have let such a quality program fall through the cracks. This was an extremely good show that deserved better. If NBC was complaining because no one watched it, they should've tried advertising it more and keeping it in the SAME timeslot instead of shuffling it around and weakening the small fanbase. Had they done those things I have no doubt in my mind that this show would still be on today or at least would have had more than just 16 episodes. I strongly urge the fans of this show or people who are curious about it to go to Amazon.com to vote to have it released on DVD. You will NOT be disappointed.
