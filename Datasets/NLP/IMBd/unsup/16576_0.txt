Pretentious and a huge waste of talent.<br /><br />Julia Roberts is a great actress and has a fantastic smile – a smile so un-really radiant that it becomes unreal pretty soon. That’s the risk she runs. And so does the movie.<br /><br />Dialogues for the single sister are good while the movie is quite pretentious and a drag at times.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid is fantastic. The story borders on the most idiotic generalization – southern men think with their southern asset and the women don’t have brains at all. Pretty idiotic fare.<br /><br />Gene Rowlands mom lacks depth and looks like she is on prescriptive medication - she takes a 180 degree turn in the middle of the movie. And Duvall's character is so foolish it hurts. <br /><br />The only saving grace is the dance sequence - but then I can bet there have been infinitely better results than this.
