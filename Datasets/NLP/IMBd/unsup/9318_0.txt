This is simply one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This is not a B movie series, this is a Z movie. Lousy actors interaction, lousy CGI (final fantasy, where are you), and the more than predictable ending takes out any interest on the movie. The low budget shouldn't serve as an excuse to produce low quality movies. If you don't have enough money to build a sky scraper, you don't save on the concrete and all the other building materials. You just don't build it. I tried to give this movie a -10 vote but IMDb system only allows rates between 1 and 10. Let this be a warning to you. Just don't waste your time watching this movie.
