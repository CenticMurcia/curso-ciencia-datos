Don Knotts and Tim Conway are my favorite comedians. I liked this movie a great deal, mostly because they were in it together. They play off each other very well. The messed up poems (and Tim's apparent confusion) had me laughing so hard I was snorting. Tim's constant pigeon problems were quite funny as well. And no one can do 'scared' or 'cocky' funnier than Don. A true estimation of their talents was quoted early on in the movie when the gas station owner said, "Those are two 'idiots' what'll make their mark where ever they go.", just before the station blew up because of Don's cigar. I like the mark they've made with this movie and their other works as well.
