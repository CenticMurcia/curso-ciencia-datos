I am not sure who okayed this movie, but i know if i were to put my money into this garbage, i would be truly angry. Maybe I just didn't get the whole, "I have a better life than i thought" message. It just didn't seem to matter. Will someone please give Crispin Glover a good role already? I mean he was good in the "Charlies Angels" movie and all, but the man is much more talented than what he is in. Jennifer Tilly (Oscar nominee for "Bullets over Broadway") and Oscar winner Eric Roberts, (yes Julia's estranged brother) what the hell were either of them thinking? Must have just been a few days of shooting i guess. Please don't waste your time with this 2 hour bore show.
