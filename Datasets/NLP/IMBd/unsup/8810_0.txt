I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. It was funny and heartwarming and the little kids costumes at some points were adorable. It is the story of a dance school called Mr. Jonathons dance studio that is trying to win the most prestigious of Australian dance group awards. The story winds together a tough dance teacher who has won the award every year called Ms. Elizabeth, a competitive mum who can't stand to watch her child lose (played superbly by Kerry Armstrong) and the children who are just trying to have fun. Its a touching Australian dance movie that reminds us of Strictly Ballroom. All in all I was very impressed and happy with the film and would recommend it to any family who is thinking about entering a dance competition.
