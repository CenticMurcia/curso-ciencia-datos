This movie is terrible. The story could have been decent (think Weekend at Bernies meets Mean Girls) but it never takes off. Instead you are given over an hour of Haley Duff doing her best to act, in a cheap synthetic wig and a wardrobe bested by Sears. The rest of the actors are not that great either, in fact forgettable...the wig is the star. The dialog is cheap and rides the current 'netspeak' craze, "Totes!", for example. You spend 99.8% of the movie in a pink house and like with the storyline, you are stuck there. From impromptu jello wrestling to hand jobs, you are given nothing more than a collage of 'national lampoon ultra lite', clich√©, offerings.<br /><br />Obviously made on a shoestring budget (again, the wig) it's like a Direct to DVD student film, slathered in pink.
