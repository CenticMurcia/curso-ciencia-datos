I had no trouble believing the May/October romance. It was Sarandon's rude, crude, arrogant, and tacky behavior at the Thanksgiving dinner that made me wonder how the hero could stand her. (Sarandon so often seems to play that kind of a self-righteous character.) Spader was compelling in this film--at least until the last ridiculous scene. That was too much, and killed the glow of the ending for me. Still...an engrossing movie.
