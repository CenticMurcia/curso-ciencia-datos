I adore well written comedy from the US and UK but this is not it. While sometimes there are funny moments the majority of it is predictable and a bit pointless. I don't know if its just me but Im sure its intentionally dumbed down. I don't know the reason why because undoubtedly the two writers can write a much better script ( well I hope they can) While the show attacks all groups and genders it is in fact riddled with political correctness in every sketch. Its to much to go in to here, but its the usual promotion of certain leftist agendas and tries at every opportunity to ridicule any right wing thinking. To cover the tracks of an agenda no group is left out of the scenery whether its gays, fat people, Christians, the Pope, Hindus, posh people, gypsies, Scottish people etc but the one group they have never made fun out of is Muslims. Its not that I care one bit whether they do or not but its an obvious display of double standards. However the show is on the BBC and no one on the BBC would dare put a Muslim or Islam in a comedy sketch.<br /><br />Some would say Im just miserable and shouldn't let the politics be involved. Well perhaps I am miserable but thats why I watch a lot of comedy and I cannot ignore the political agenda when its drilled in to me. It wouldn't be so bad if it were done with much more intelligence but its not.<br /><br />The two main actors are very good, but I see the taller one as the main talent by a long way. Everyone seems to like the shorter one the best but I think thats because he is short and fat. I think we will see the taller one go on to much greater things. Im also sure these two can write much better comedy and when they do I will happily write a glowing review.
