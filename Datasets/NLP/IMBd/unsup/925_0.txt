The movie Looker is worth a look in my humble opinion. I read the reviews and I was surprised at the results.I think that Looker is a terrific movie.It has everything that you could want in a movie, strictly for entertainment value.You can sit down, relax,and just escape into a good science fiction thriller.The movie is campy and cheesy in some parts, but that is what makes the Looker fun. The soundtrack is great.I love the music and songs in this movie.Looker has a wonderful high tech glossy value to it.This movie has a knock out cast. James Coburn,Albert Finney,Dorian Harewood, Leigh Taylor-Young, and Susan Dey did a wonderful job.Albert Finney and James Coburn are good in just about every movie that they make.I highly recommend this movie to lovers of science fiction.
