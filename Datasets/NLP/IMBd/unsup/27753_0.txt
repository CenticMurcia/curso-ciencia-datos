It's a harmless, little romantic comedy that entertains and delights me. I watch it every time it's on TV.<br /><br />Demi's character conveys mystery and innocence...and the blonde hair is most suitable to that end. Plus it foreshadows (spoiler) that Jeff Daniels (also blond) and she are meant for each other.<br /><br />The gay parts are subtle and sweet...I take no offense at all and am surprised that others do.<br /><br />I no longer expect perfection in any movie. Having said that, if you just want to be entertained and need a break from violence, cursing, and nudity....give this movie a try.
