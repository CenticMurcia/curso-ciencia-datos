I do not blame the game, but myself, for losing hundreds of hours that with ease could have been spent doing something constructive/more fun. It took me a good two years before realizing the complete nonsense of actually devoting even a minute to this game, and at the point of recognizing this fact it took me less than no time to stop playing for good. Why is it nonsense? <br /><br />The game is horribly linear. Play it through with one character and you've explored all there is to it. Quests come in 3 variations ("Wow!" is pretty far from the first thought that comes to mind when seeing that). Character development comes to a halt at level 20, after which little hope is in sight. At top level all you can do to further build up your character is to grind, grind, and grind some more for equipment that is slightly better than what you already have. Character skills are dead and stale. Exploring non-existent. Character progress is lost. PvP is another means to drain you of yet another couple of hundred hours and dreadfully predictive unless you are a dimwit, reaching ne plus ultra meaning (take a wild guess) better equipment.<br /><br />At level 70 _everything_ boils down to getting better equipment? For what purpose? To be able to get even better equipment. I would chuckle if I did not feel sorry for everyone still playing. The economic aspect of the game is lacking in so many areas it's painful to even think about it.<br /><br />Sure, there are a few pros as well. Playing with your friends is fun for a while, but there are better and more intricate games that actually give something in return while doing so. Clearing an end-game instance is fun the first time, after which it gets repetitive. Same with PvP. This game is flawed in so many ways it's a wonder that people continue to play it.<br /><br />Wow is a hoax and you're all being cheated.
