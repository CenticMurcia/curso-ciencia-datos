This movie is a guilty pleasure of mine. Maybe the stressful, what-else-can-possibly-go-wrong? genre of films is my thing (I also love "After Hours"), but I stand by my claim that Neil Simon's writing and Jack Lemmon's and Sandy Dennis' performances all combine to create one of the funniest movies ever made. Of course you wanna strangle Jack Lemmon by the end of the movie, but that's why he is so great in it. I can't imagine any two people who could have better or more hilariously portrayed George and Gwendolyn Kellerman, the naive Ohio couple on their visit to hell...er... New York City. Rent this movie if you are ever feeling like your life is going wrong... it'll cheer you up.
