I bought this movie off of ebay thinking it could be a well made viking movie made by actual Scandinavians, but I was wrong. Now I regret watching because it was so awful. The cinematography was uninspired, the acting was OK, and the action boring. Never once do you get to see the harsh and beautiful Icelandic landscape (I've been there), only the shore and the vikings' huts. There are some interesting characters, but they were never developed. The Irishman seems like a sadistic killer since he seems to kill every viking he meets, how could he know which ones pillaged his village? He even throws a knife into a guy's mouth as he yawns, what did that guy ever do to deserve that? The action was also terrible, the Irishman kills by throwing knives and never actually confronts his enemies. The vikings themselves use strange machete looking swords. If I wanted to make a film taking place in Iceland I would first show off the Icelandic landscape, create interesting characters who have motives, and then show more of the viking culture itself: the weaponry and armor, the religion, the sailing, the long-ships, etc. 'Revenge of the Barbarians' fails at all this and was a disappointment. If you want to see the Icelandic landscape I would recommend seeing 'The Viking Sagas,' which is a bad movie, but bad enough that it's entertaining. If you want to see something that's actually an interesting movie, though Hollywood, see 'The Vikings' or for something more lighthearted 'The Longships'. I haven't see this year's 'Beowulf and Grendel' but it sounds like an interesting film. See 'Revenge of the Barbarians' if you want to see how NOT to make a movie about the Vikings.
