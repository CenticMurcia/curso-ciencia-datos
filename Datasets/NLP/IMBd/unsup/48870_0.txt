I really didn't enjoy this horror movie, in fact i don't even suppose it IS a horror movie or any kind. Though you have the chance to see once more how talented and breath taking Lauren Bacall is and her creepy portrayal in the film, the script is lousy, it lacks of plot and reason. The child players have an amazing performance. Their casting is very successful because it must be hard to pull of such characters. I think the production company wanted to make a different kind of adaptation. One that is not classical. If you think you're going to see a horror movie like "The Shining" or "The Pet Cemetery", I'd say you'd be disappointed. The movie gives you the impression, but it never actually answers the questions in the plot. Why do the kids hide their secrets or why Lauren Bacall's is so evil- you never get the answer. The ghost thing in the movie is never scary, maybe funny! Antonio Aloy who's portraying the father is the worst, I think. His character never really involves in the story. Nevertheless, some surprising scenes actually do exist like the kids' traumatic reactions and the sudden appearing of the mysterious ghost woman. The rest is dull, annoying and empty.. Waste of time!
