There is not a single original line in Faust: Love of the Damned, and, the truth is, that's not even the worst of it. Faust... is a miasma of eye-rolling sexcapades (dressed up in a way that is clearly meant to seem demonic, but that falls exceedingly short), poor and tired special effects, and a completely incomprehensible plot. Even veteran horror actor Jeffrey Combs of Re-Animator fame can't pull this movie into something watchable, although his sudden turn to the dark side is probably the only good twist in this terrible film. One almost wonders whether Yuzna used some sort of blackmail material to convince Combs to be in this dreadful flick (with an interesting pair of sideburns to boot).<br /><br />Faust... says nothing new about the natures of good and evil or the entity of the devil. In addition, it borders on pornographic with its senseless sex scenes and downright offensive with its portrayal of sexual abuse. Barely redeemable.
