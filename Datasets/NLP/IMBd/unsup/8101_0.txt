Four British actors in pursuit of the increasingly evanescent formula that gave us four weddings. It's made enjoyable by the elan of the actors who are, in general, used to doing more weighty things.<br /><br />The big surprise is Ray Winstone, a foggy character who fulfils the role of a shrink, listening to Joe Fiennes whining. Nick Hamm keeps it moving along though, weaving the relationship threads together competently enough whilst Hollander and Sewell give pat representations of their character-tropes. Joe Fiennes is rather good in this sort of genre but I liked Monica Potter best of all, the American chick stuck on the end of the hook for the big US theatre going fish. Unremarkable but inoffensive. 4/10
