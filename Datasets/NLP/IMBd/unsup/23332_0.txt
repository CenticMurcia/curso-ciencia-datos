I just loved this movie! Like Ashley Olsen said in an interview, "it has something for everyone"! It is a movie which should appeal to everyone between the ages of 8 and 80! It has child-like fantasy aspects to it (with lots of special-effects included) and it has more adult overtones and undertones as well. They couldn't have made a better movie (IMHO). If you love Ashley Olsen and Mary-Kate Olsen and their "brand" of comedy you will absolutely love this movie! It has everything a great movie should have! It has more adult "themes" than their past movies but it was all very tastefully done. It contains nothing inappropriate for kids to see. You should see this movie at least once (or twice) because it is absolutely awesome! Rick Morris
