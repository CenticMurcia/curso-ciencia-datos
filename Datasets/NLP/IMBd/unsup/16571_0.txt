I am loathe to say something this negative, but must. One of the worst movies I ever have been dragged in front of the VCR by my fiancee to watch. It is not enjoyed but endured, especially, I would think, by males - as you will see for yourself (or, I hope, not). What was Robert Duvall thinking when he agreed just to go through the motions for this dud? And Julia Roberts?? The one note of hysterical she maintains throughout is not acting. At least the scenery in Beaufort, S.C. (also the location of "Big Chill") is interesting. Overall, what a disappointment.
