I saw this movie first about 40 years ago when I was 5 or 6 and all I could think of was how much fun it would be to head off to Sherwood Forest to be a Merry Man -being a girl and living in America put that right out of the realm of possibility ! But I have loved the film and Errol Flynn ever since. Just traded in my VHS for the 2 disc DVD and all I can say is WOW -- The color is so rich and bright, the extras are outstanding which includes trailers, cartoons, and an excellent documentary on the history of the Technicolor process. The plot and Errol Flynn are still simply the best. I wonder if Monster.com has any listings for Merry Men jobs -- now with equal opportunity I could apply. <br /><br />
