OK, I'm a big John Waters fan and like any 'Waters fan, I managed to obtain one of his early films.<br /><br />Even though slightly long and very boring at times, It has a JW signature written all over it and is a must for any of his fans.<br /><br />Next point - My main problem with this movie - The pointless animal deaths at the start...Several Chickens are beheaded by a masked man and is obviously to shock the audience by stating that this movie is gross and very 'Trash like'. I don't buy it, and I found this extremely offensive and cruel. And since I am a Vegetarian and completely against (and opposed to) animal cruelty in real life, I find it even more disturbing that someone would want to do it for their art...its completely inexcusable and literally boils my anger.<br /><br />John Waters has gone right down in my estimation as I didn't think he would be like this...If the chicken decapitations were used from stock footage of a slaughterhouse than this would be slightly acceptable (I emphasise on the word 'slightly' as I am against any activity of such sort).<br /><br />As soon as I watched the opening of 'Mondo Trasho', my complete admiration for 'JW and his anti-Hollywood statements' had vanished because he can shock and gross out audiences without resorting to animal deaths/cruelty.<br /><br />I cant seem to find an official site for JOHN WATERS but I would like to email him personally and give him my thoughts on this matter.<br /><br />So, if your aim is to shock and offend...then you have done it John...but at the cost of losing respect from your film fans.<br /><br />And remember John, You are a filmmaker and an artist.... not a barbaric low-life who tortures animals for exploitation.<br /><br />What has this world come to.....I sincerely do ask ?
