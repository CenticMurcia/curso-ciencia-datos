Horrible Piece Of so called "Stylish" film-making from one of the biggest hacks in the Indian film industry " Sanjay Gupta ". Scenes are lifted from Scarface & Lethal Weapon & countless Hollywood flicks while the whole plot plus numerous scenes xeroxed straight from John Woo's classic Hong Kong flick "A Better Tomorrow". The only saving grace in the whole mess is " Sanjay Dutt " else everyone just hams it up. The basic story is of two friends "Baba & Nawab" ( dutt & pancholi =hamster no.1 ) working for the mafia boss "Uncle" ( Ajit = hamster no.2 ). Baba also has a younger brother in a police academy Avi( agnihotri = Hamster King ) who doesn't know about baba being in cahoots with the mafia so in the fashion of " A better tomorrow " he finds out eventually and a divide is formed between the brothers . However before that Uncle is overthrown by a bunch of clowns and Baba goes to jail . Nawab loses his leg when he tries to take revenge. Baba returns after many years in jail teams up with Nawab and takes revenge , sings love songs & makes up with his brother.If you want to have a healthy brain condition for the rest of your life just avoid it like the plague. Please do check out other "Sanjay Gupta" flicks to find out what an unoriginal hack this guy is!!!
