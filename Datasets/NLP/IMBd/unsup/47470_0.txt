This movie is astonishingly biased and is based on the opinion of gang members rather than true fact.<br /><br />The movie basically attempts to justify a murder committed by one of the Abberton brothers, who head the group. It also accuses policemen of starting a fight with gang members when both groups were attending functions at the same location.<br /><br />"Bra Boys" encourages youngsters to leave school and take up a life of dangerous surfing, drug use and crime. The leaders who offer their opinions are ridiculously immature. Its wrong this movie was allowed to be released.<br /><br />The only good thing about the movie is Russell Crowes narration.
