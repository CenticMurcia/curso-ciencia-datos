If you are a fan of any of the main actors, you will like this film.<br /><br />If you enjoy seeing Paltrow pose in refined interiors in expensive clothes, or very few clothes, as she talks through clenched teeth, this is a movie for you.<br /><br />If you enjoy watching Douglas' subtle mastery of the acting art, and lending depth to a character that in lesser hands would be as flat as wallpaper, this is a movie for you.<br /><br />If you enjoy watching Morgenstern sporting medieval hygiene and chewing the scenery, this is a movie for you.<br /><br />If you enjoy lamenting that the always-remarkable Suchet is woefully underused, this is a movie for you.<br /><br />But...<br /><br />If you like movies that are intelligently scripted, plotted, cast and/or directed, this is not a movie for you. Save your time and money and rent the original "Dial M for Murder" instead.
