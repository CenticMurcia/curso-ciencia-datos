The true story of Hiesman Trophy winner John Cappeletti and the touching relationship between his younger brother Joey pulls all the strings to jerk our tears and break our heart. This is a humble TV movie that intends to be more of a study of a brotherly bond rather than a study in Luekemia. Although it succeeds in both. It's a beautiful story that somehow was forgotten as a movie. It's well acted and well cast. These tearjerkers of the 70's were done so well. There was the element of clich√© and certain scenes were just designed to tear our hearts, but it all worked. Worth seeing if you want to cleanse your eyeballs.
