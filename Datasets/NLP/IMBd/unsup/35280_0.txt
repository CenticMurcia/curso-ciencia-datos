A good horror movie should contain at least the following ingredients, suspense, shock, nudity, gore, an insane character, and if you're lucky a good plot. None of it in this movie. The beginning of the movie is worth an 8, from then on it's all down the hill. First of all, the begin credits makes one insane, text, 5 seconds movie, text, movie, text, and then movie finally begins. Almost made me stop watching this movie. Then 20 minutes of boredom, no suspense, no sex (to be seen anyway), no killings, nothing. Would you hire a lodge for the weekend with your girlfriend, while the one who rents it to you stays in it during that weekend as well? Not me. Finally the horror starts, the guy gets tied up, and the girl gets raped. Well, you have to assume that, because you can only hear her scream, sort of, but it is not shown. Not that we need to see such a thing, but it would be nice, if at least we saw the madman shred her t-shirt to bits. None of it. Even worse, her t-shirt gets never stained with blood or dirt, it keeps clean until the very end of the movie. Needless to say that the only one who gets killed is the madman, who claims to be killing people for 16 years already, by the wounded girl. Even the last scene didn't save this movie. No plot, no nudity, no suspense, a bit gore, and just a little bit insanity. That's the real horror of this movie, a complete waste of time. Don't bother to watch it, even it is a rental. Don't say you weren't warned. Shudder...
