The film is set in the near future and Charlton Heston seems to be the only person left on the planet. Everyone else is either dead or a psychotic zombie that cannot come out during the daytime. So during much of the film, cool Heston drives about town in his cool car--rooting for food or blowing apart the occasional zombie. And after a long day of this, it's home--not for a Miller beer, but to hide out in his amazing fortress home. At night, the crazed zombies attack his home again and again, but since Heston would later become the president of the NRA, it wasn't surprising that he proceeded to blow the crap out of the intruders--and do it with great gusto and style. Seeing Heston with a machine gun mowing them down was indeed a guilty pleasure.<br /><br />There's a lot more to the movie than this--including a REASON for the plague that did this to the people and explained why he was immune (something forgotten in the earlier version of this film that starred Vincent Price). In addition, later in the film some hope for the redemption of mankind appears--thought you'll have to see the film for yourself to find out exactly what occurred.<br /><br />This film is rare in that it's a remake of an earlier film AND it's actually better than the original! While not as good as Heston's greatest sci-fi films, PLANET OF THE APES and SOYLENT GREEN, it is wonderful fun. Sure, it isn't Shakespeare or amazingly artistic--just good old fun that is very re-watchable. An excellent and cool film that will please most viewers.
