First, the music on this show absolutely unbearable. It is exactly the kind of crud that plagues popular music and ruins any opportunity for *good* music...<br /><br />Anyway, this has terrible acting and no storyline (which are both fine for a kids show). What really makes this so horrible is that it is absolutely nothing more than the unbearably materialistic fantasy of a 10-year old diva. Not good. Do you really want to nurture such aspirations in your kids? I beg that adults show their children true quality programs, not anything like this.<br /><br />1/10.
