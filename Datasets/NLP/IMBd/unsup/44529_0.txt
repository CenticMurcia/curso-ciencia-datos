What is the point of this movie? Or should I say, is there a point made in this movie that actually has any intelligence to it? Here's the plot...and you're apparently supposed to gain some sort of "insight" from this, but here it is...if you're a white girl from the midwest you better not date black men from the projects or you'll get treated with unkind gestures(ouch!) from black ladies who'll claim you "steal the one decent black man"(oh no she didn't!) in the neighborhood. This movie is stupid. It plays on all the lame stereotypes this society has put on us, and plays on the whole "forbidden" race issue. This movie makes me sick in my stomach.<br /><br />Don't get your life lessons from Hollywood. If you think this movie makes any sort of positive point you need to get a life.
