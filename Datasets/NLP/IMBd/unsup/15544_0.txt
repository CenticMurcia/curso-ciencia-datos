Aquaman is obviously not the most recognised or popular superhero around and yet this show managed to give him a fairly cool edge. fans of smallville will love this, as i did, i would even go as far as to say that the pilot is a better show than the pilot for smallville (obviously the creative team have gotten better since the beginning of smallville) anyway, with smallville apparently coming to an end in a season or two i think it would be crazy for some network to leave Aquaman dead in the water (sorry) solid acting from all concerned and very cool FX all contribute to this pilot being an obvious hit, watch it anyway you can.
