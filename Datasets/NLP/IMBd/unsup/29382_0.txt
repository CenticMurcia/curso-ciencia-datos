I never get tired of watching this movie. I am a die-hard chick-flick fan: fluff all the way, all that meaningless dime-a-dozen stuff. But this is one movie which breaks my mold and I consider a new classic. It's a movie I have to be in the right mood to watch, but it's one that I never get tired of. It's a great drama--romance, mystery, with a spice of humor thrown in here and there, enough to make you smile and lighten up the mood but not enough to make it seem tawdry. Kevin Costner's performance makes the whole thing for me: he spins a great character without becoming bland or stony. Whitney Houston is fairly good as an actress, smiling and charming in her pleasanter days, and obviously her songs are very good--I hope no one will contest that she has an excellent voice (or did; does she even sing anymore?). Watching the little boy, Fletcher (sorry I don't know his real name), was also a treat. He's the precocious-almost-to-a-fault genre, but it was fun seeing all his antics and especially hearing the things he said.<br /><br />I think this movie has gotten a much lower rating than it deserves. The plot is not extremely involved, but I was surprised by the ending. 9/10.
