Hey Scream, you have a visitor. And his name is Leslie Vernon. Slasher movies, at least you can say you got two movies that manage to be slasher and yet parody your hilarious clichés. Just like in the movie scream, you have this movie that basically mocks slasher films but at the same time is categorized as one of them. While it is a parody movie, it still adds its own terrifying elements. Just like Scream..am I being repetitive here? Let's first start off with our crazy man. Nathan Baesel plays the character Leslie Vernon. While adding a slight dark humor in there, there is also something so unusual about him. The rush he gets before slashing away a victim, his desire to do what he was "born to do." In more ways or less, he is like Patrick Bateman in Psycho. The acting is no where near a Christian bale performance, don't think I would compare the two. The whole idea of his character is to really mock serial killers. He let's a journalist group go with him through the process of planning a "slasher night." He can be funny and chilling at the same time.<br /><br />This movie pulls off what scream did o so many years ago. They made a movie which is terrifying and humorous at the same time. That's why Leslie could plan everyones moves..the clichés. But the twist to the movie was nothing I would have expected. We no longer are watching a documentary here, we are watching a real slasher situation. So it goes from mocking a slasher to turning into a pretty scary one! This movie just kept my eyes glued to the screen and I would recommend it to all. If you enjoyed scream you will like this as well.<br /><br />It is one that you definitely shouldn't miss. Give it a chance and ignore the naysayers.<br /><br />Rating: 8 out of 10 stars
