DER EISBAER is the first movie German mega-star Til Schweiger directed, and starred in. Seen when it premiered in Germany in November of '98, I accompanied all the avant premiere buzz surrounding the film and Schweiger's career moves, and even attended one of the premieres Schweiger hosted at the new Potsdamer Platz Cinemaxx. This action drama with a relationship story lived up to all the hype, and exceeded my inflated expectations. If you are a Schweiger fan or a an action drama lover, don't miss DER EISBAER when it comes out on video or if it opens outside Europe. Schweiger has come a long way since DER BEWEGTE MANN ("Maybe, Maybe Not"), and in the process has single-handedly brought German cinema back to the masses after a half century of domination by the high brow author directors (Herzog, Fassbinder, Wenders) who made German cinema synonymous with boredom, and inaccessibility with the masses. Since 1994, Schweiger starrers have broken German Box Office Records consistently. Here, though this film did not break the Box Office Records of the others (including MAENNERPENSION and KNOCKIN' ON HEAVEN'S DOORS), he shows us in more dimensions why he has been the phenomenon of popular German cinema this past decade, and probably beyond 2000. I give DER EISBAER 8 out 10 points.
