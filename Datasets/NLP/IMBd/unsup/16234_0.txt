This is one movie I anticipated above any other. I am a big fan of Thora Birch, and liked Steve Buscemi a lot ever since his brilliant "Trees Lounge". I am also a huge fan of the graphic novel, and all similar comic books. So I waited with baited breath to see this movie. I have to say I wasn't disappointed. All of the edgy black humor and sarcasm of the comic book is translated to the screen, and a lot of care has been taken to recreate the look of the town. Fans of the comic will immediately recognise the images of Daniel Clowes's masterpiece. The darker side of the story, the disillusionment, is all there as well. Thora Birch and Scarlet Johansson play the two girls brilliantly, staying true to the characters of the comic. The cool soundtrack is a big plus too.<br /><br />This film will move you, and make you laugh and cry. Don't miss it!
