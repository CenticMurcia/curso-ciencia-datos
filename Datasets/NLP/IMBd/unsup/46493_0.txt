This movie is very terrible in many ways.<br /><br />First off, the choice of characters is the worst possible ever for a game movie. Chun Li is meant to be Chinese yet you've chosen an actress who has problem speaking the language in the movie (when for example she asks for help which she asked in a terrible accent).<br /><br />Game movies are not really easy to be pulled off along with good reviews, not many are out there. The reason is shown very clear in this movie. The director ALWAYS misses the point of what the movie should be about; I mean fair enough you don't want a movie about Ryu fighting Ken or Bison, and want a Legend of Chun Li, But you could've put a better story in it, or give the movie better actors (I can't believe the acting in this movie). Take Marvel for example, their world interacts a lot of different marvel characters, but when it comes to their own movie/cartoon, they actually make the story relevant to the characters life(e.g just because Bison was the boss, it doesn't mean that Chun Li's life has to be revolved around killing him (which is what Ryu does)).<br /><br />The choice of camera shots used to try and show the story was also done badly. For example when Bison was trying to show the camera that he had a picture of his wife and daughter, which were dear to him; First off, would Bison do this? Secondly, this is very very corny.<br /><br />This movie had made me dislike street fighter. I would highly recommend better actors and directors AND story writers if another street fighter movie comes out.<br /><br />P.S Didn't finish the movie, it was that bad.
