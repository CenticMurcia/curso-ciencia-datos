Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the theatre, there's Jack Hammer. <br /><br />A movie about a Jack, whose drug addiction leads to homelessness, weakness, and murder. <br /><br />He lives as a security guard in a abandoned machine shop after losing his cushy day job to drugs, when his best friend OD's and dies on the street in a bad part of town.<br /><br />He had it all, nice car, a yellow Viper, I wouldn't have gone with yellow, but okay - the great job, but he lacked self esteem, his ego being a little too big for his britches syndrome if you will. He had no real direction. So far it seems a pretty realistic approach, but soon the movie flails like a fish out of water - to become a clich√©, and unredeemable display of stupidity so profound, I am ashamed for the actor who had to play Jack.<br /><br />I'm just gonna get real nitpicky here a second and say - JackHammer was one of the worse movies I have ever seen in my entire life.
