SUDDENLY is an unexpected surprise of a movie. Interesting assination plot with some terrific acting by FRANK SINATRA and most of the cast. NANCY GATES, quite a beauty, is one of the best of the supporting cast. She would later play a small role with SINATRA in SOME CAME RUNNING. SPOILER ALERT: The ending is telegraphed early on. The talk of GATES hatred of guns and not wanting her son to play with a toy one comes to use at the end. I knew it was coming. Another telegraphed scene is when grandpa is talking to grandson about the voltage of the TV and the danger it would be with spilt water. It all comes to play at the end. Too bad this isn't remastered because the current DVD version is an obivious public domain copy. How did this little gem fall into public domain anyway??? See this for the neat little thriller it is and for SINATRAS dynamic performance.
