THE Classic(so far)Surfers' Movie, is "Big Wednesday". It is indeed, total, but realistic Americana as well, transposed to the hallowed world of surfers, who we find out, must some day ALSO, "grow up"!<br /><br />Yet two of the young men in the movie "Grow up," by serving in the Vietnam War, in which one of them dies as a U.S. Marine. Being that "Big Wednesday" chronicles the local California Surfing scene(is it, was it filmed at-around HUNTINGTON BEACH, CA.? If anyone knows they're welcome to inform us, in their review!) between the years 1962-1974.<br /><br />It DOES have a GREAT and a POWERFUL, powerfully ALL-American ending I call it, and that's ALL I'll say, 'bout THAT!<br /><br />(*John Milius is a "Conservative" Director to some, but to me as an albeit "Liberal/Progressive," "Ex" Marine{maybe THAT California Connection, through "University of" ah-hem, the USMC, maybe THAT is what attracts me the NORTHEASTERN Guy, was never much of a Swimmer OR SURFER{at all!! ex-Marine or not, I still do NOT WISH to try Surfing, either!!], but I the "Liberal" do so Appreciate MOST all, if not all of JOHN MILIUS' Film Works!! Well, "Art," which "FILM" IS at its BEST, and "Big Wednesday" is just THAT, "American ART," on Film, true Art can often SURPASS mere TRIVIALITIES, like "Politics," etcetera).
