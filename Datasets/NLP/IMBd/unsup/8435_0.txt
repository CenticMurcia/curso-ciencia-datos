Damnation Alley, 1977 <br /><br />This film follows some would-be heroes as they survive a nuclear holocaust in 1970's America. It starts out at a protected military base that burns down for the stupidest of reasonsÂ—a cigar falls on a Playboy magazine and just happens to be too close to explosive tanks! Then some military guys trek out across the desert landscape that was once America in gigantic armored motor-homes of some sort.<br /><br />Along their way to, um, Albany in New York (which they believe apparently survived the nuclear holocaust unscathed), they cross vast expanses of listless desert and, an abandoned city filled with killer cockroaches, and some rednecks. Each and every shot reeks of continuity issues with bizarrely coated hues which carry little or no explanation. One shot will be all blue-ish, the next, coated in ugly green hues, the next two will be fine, but different contrasts of light and dark, then the next one will be a hue of green with really queer "lightning" in the sky. The whole movie is like this. I mean, this was the best they could do for the post-apocalyptic radiated earth? It's so f*cking ugly! And after a while, on a big enough screen this can get really irritating on the eyes! It also has some needlessly giant scorpions what are spliced into the film in the most obvious possible way. They're purple for no reason.<br /><br />****SPOILER WARNING SECTION**** Eventually, the token black guy is eaten by cockroaches, the rednecks are blown up, a little kid and a woman are found separately, one of the RV's is destroyed, and they find Albany (or something) which not only survived the unexplained nuclear holocaust, but reverted to the perfection of Leave it to Beaver's America. Overall, fairly insipid, and occasionally boring.<br /><br />3/10 <br /><br />www.ResidentHazard.com
