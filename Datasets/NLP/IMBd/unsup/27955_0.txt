This was a great movie! Honestly, I didn't expect anything amazing when I went to see the film. After all, it was created by a couple of newbies to film, so I was expecting to see a marginal film and to say things like, "Oh, what a beautiful baby!" to the new mother. But I was impressed, instead.<br /><br />First, I thought the acting was genuine (I was surprised by how well Neale Donald Walsch pulled off his lead role). The cinematography was beautiful and the story was moving. What more can you want? <br /><br />In addition to being an all-around good movie, the message was powerful but subtle. In fact, days later it was still sinking in and affecting me. I think it was a great introduction to the concept of the Indigo children, for those folks who've never heard of them. And for those who have, I think it was great to see a movie about them! <br /><br />With regards to all the negative reviews, picking on the technical aspects of the film, I say, "Those who can, do. Those who can't, critique those who can." Lighten up! Stop being so negative! Did you learn nothing from this movie?
