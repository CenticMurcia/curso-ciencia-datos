What would happen if the world were turned upside down? What if we were granted complete freedom to do anything we want? The answers to those questions are present in each of the 12 stories presented in this amazing film by surrealist master Luis Buñuel.<br /><br />From the beginning, he plays with his audience, building up our expectations and when we think something might happen, he leaves us stunned and laughing, showing by way of absurdity and satire things we never would have thought possible because of the preconceptions we have demonstrating that we are not as free thinking and open as we thought we were. As he has done in several of his movies, Buñuel doesn't have a narrative thread through the movie choosing instead to connect each "tableau" to the next with the introduction of a random character that becomes one of the main ones in the following scene, creating a random series of events. Also present in "Le Fantome de la Liberté" is Buñuel's recurrent criticism of several things including the bourgeoisie (as done before in "The Secret Charm of Bourgeoisie"), the Church, police and moral beliefs, making quite clear to the viewers how much he dislikes them. This movie is a perfect example of freedom all around, from the scene where a man shoots people randomly and later is sentenced to life in jail but walks out free of the courthouse, to Buñuel himself who has the freedom of saying whatever he wants, however he wants it and in doing so, has given us a fresh perspective. Buñuel's camera work makes us feel that we are ghosts gliding through each moment of a very realistic dream thus achieving the surrealist's main goal of presenting a symbolic and rational dreamlike universe, making this movie a must see and one of Buñuel's finest works.
