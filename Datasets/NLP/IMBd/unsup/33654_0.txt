I saw this movie at the 2000 Philadelphia International Gay & Lesbian Film Festival (PIGLFF). It was a great disappointment. The "film" is actually shot on tape. The quality of the cinematography and sound is very poor and amateurish. The writing and the pacing are poor. By mid-way through the piece at least one-third of the audience had walked out. I endured the whole thing to the end.<br /><br />The film supposedly delves into the tricky area of older man-younger man relationships when, in fact, the younger man is in his mid-teens and the "older man" is in his early to mid-twenties. The older, main character in question is clearly not just attracted to one given young man but, apparently, exclusively to adolescents in general. (As backstory is revealed during the film we learn this has caused problems already.)<br /><br />I'm open to seeing and learning from films that treat teenagers with respect and explore their interests and abilities to negotiate relationships with adults. A gay "Lolita" or "The Graduate" this is not.<br /><br />I would not recommend you wasting your time or money on this. I'm sorry I did.
