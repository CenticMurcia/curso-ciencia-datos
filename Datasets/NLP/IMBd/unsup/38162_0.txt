What a stupid,non-funny comedy! The twins are bad in their characters and the jokes are stupid and vulgar. When starting watching a near movie, you don't have great expectations. But at the end of the movie, you think you were dreaming during the whole time...about two losers who are the twin's bodyguards. That is the story...what about the actors...They are bad too. With only one child, it would be a bit less stupid, but for this one two times more bad jokes. I give it 0out of *****.
