This is a wonderful character study that shows the struggle between mediocrity and art, represented by a brilliant chef's inablity to complete with the slop shop across the way. He is offered an opportunity to show off his talents when the competitor offers an invitiation to Louis Prima to come to the enjoy the food of the great chef. Brilliant performance by Tony Shaloub as the chef as well as Tucci as his more pragmatic brother. Their relationship is a major part of the movie. It is touching and humorous and very compelling. The romantic interests in the movie are aytypical and keep you guessing till the end of the film who will end up with who. Finally the party is full of characters that are all individuls. This is not a hot bang up movie, not for everyone, especial people who like Pizza Hut.
