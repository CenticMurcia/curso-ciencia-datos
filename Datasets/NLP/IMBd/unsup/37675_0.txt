I was hoping the story would have an exciting, real plot. "A man murders people during his sleep". "Someone murders people while another man sleeps and makes him believe he did it". I even agreed on buying hard-to-believe situations or coincidences, such as "he's a suspected runaway murderer BUT his house isn't even looked after by a cop". But what comes at the end of this film will really make you regret you stepped into this. At least, if what comes during the whole film doesn't, already, make you want to walk out the theater, or turn the T.V. off. Nonsensical event after nonsensical event, the director expects to raise some interest in the spectator with a bunch of dead fish, some "nightshot" camcorder pictures painted red, or the lame acting of all the actors (who, by the way, aren't even nice to look at). If it's too late and you have already bought the seats, or rented the videotape, well, you might as well watch it. But you'll be warned: the effort of going through this clearly stupid and ugly movie will not be rewarded at the end, it will be punished because watching it is VAIN and painful (for any serious film aficionado, that is).
