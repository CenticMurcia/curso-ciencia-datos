This is one of a host of films which in the 1970s revived the atomic mutant animal genre popular two decades earlier (exemplified by THEM! [1954]  which also dealt with giant ants and where the results had been infinitely better). By the way, these same insects  though in their normal size  were the subject of PHASE IV (1974) as well; again, that film is superior to the one under review. Unfortunately, the generally low-grade presentation here  accentuated by the open-matte framing on the DVD I watched  and a cast of future TV regulars (mostly playing stock characters) makes it no better than the typical small-screen product of the era! Joan Collins' presence as  what else?  a wealthy bitch, then, gives the film added camp value.<br /><br />The ants themselves are fairly ludicrous creations (marred, to begin with, by being allowed too many hairy{?!} close-up shots), while the use of process photography in the scene where they convene in the sugar factory is very obvious  effectively destroying the intended illusion of the situation! The fact that the townsfolk are eventually revealed as 'slaves' of the giant ant community  after having dissed their existence when reported by the vacationers who fell foul of them on a proposed island resort  links the film with INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (1956) which, incidentally, was about to be remade (the second of four versions, so far!) around this same time.<br /><br />Ultimately, H.G. Wells' ideas in this case seem scarier  and more persuasive  on paper than on film. At least, the thing is entertaining enough while it's on  and I'd still like to check out director Gordon's other Wells adaptation, THE FOOD OF THE GODS (1976), eventually...
