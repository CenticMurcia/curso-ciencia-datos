This is one strange movie, from floating images of Greek statues to flashy images in a picture frame. This movie was not the most entertaining movie to sit down and watch, I had to wake my boyfriend up several times not to fall asleep but it was worth watching if not for the strangeness of the film I would not have enjoyed it as much. Most of the movie is pure nude soft porn acting with a little creepiness thrown in especially the decayed toothed butler that really gave me the creeps, ohhh I can still see those teeth! but if your not into a lot of nudity and your bothered with the whole film spoken in Italian with English sub titles then this movie is not for you. It does however remind me of the movie "Carnival of Souls" in a way that the driver of the vehicle was not supposed to have dies in a crash when he had almost hit a silhouette figure in a white nightgown off the road and soon after a lady had also had an unfortunate accident with a far lesser fate than his. Weird movie though.
