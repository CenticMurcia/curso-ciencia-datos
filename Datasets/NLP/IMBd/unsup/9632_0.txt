Really strong performances by all involved, especially Nick Nolte and Trevor Morgan. But it is James Ponsoldt's meaty script that is really thrilling. The depth of feeling he gets from his actors is good too. I wish he had more than 23 days to shoot, since some of the photography is marginal, but some shots are just beautiful, especially the close-ups of the actors' faces.<br /><br />Mild spoiler: This is a film of the human spirit, and human nature, and the nature of families: especially ad hoc families. And it has one of the most subtle uses of a female character in recent memory (the character Debra).
