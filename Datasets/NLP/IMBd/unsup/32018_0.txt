telling the truth about some people who are are forbidden from loving just because they love who they want to love and not who the society tells them to love. <br /><br />i think people should really watch this film and come to an understanding that NO one can tell some one else who what why and when to love - cause it's a free right - no one is entitled to take from another person. <br /><br />i was disappointed at the end, thought it would end differently felt like an enrage about what happened at the end, i think perhaps it could have had a different ending and still have the same impact.
