If you are interested in brief glimpses of Elizabeth Hurley's nipples you might find this movie interesting. That is the only redeeming quality of this strange movie with an odd, confusing story featuring odd confusing characters. <br /><br />Periodically the story seems to be about to make sense but then it falls apart again as the characters do something else seemingly unmotivated or poorly motivated. While my drama instructor tried to avoid using the word "motivation" because of possibility of clich√© I can think of no word better. There was simply no logical reason presented for the goings on in this film. The motivation is missing. <br /><br />Of course, it was only one dollar in the bargain bin. Perhaps I shouldn't complain too much.
