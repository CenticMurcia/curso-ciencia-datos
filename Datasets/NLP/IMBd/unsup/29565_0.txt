As a follow-up to his wonderful tongue-in-cheek nature-strikes-back horror movie "Squirm", the always original cult director Jeff Lieberman concocted this provocative thriller. It seems that the people who took an acid named Blue Sunshine 10 years ago at Stanford University are all of a sudden suffering delayed reactions. They're experiencing dramatic hair loss, and lapsing into psychotic episodes. Out to seek the truth is Jerry Zipkin (Zalman King), who's erroneously assumed to have committed some murders actually committed by a friend at a party.<br /><br />Lieberman always has a knack for humor in his films, and this is no exception. Here he maintained in me a level of curiosity and interest, although I knew the whole set-up of the movie going in. The movie is marked by some good set pieces; particularly horrendous is the sight of a murder victim shoved into a fireplace. The plot is genuinely intriguing, and Lieberman plays with the conventions of this type of film by having his protagonist *not* be terribly likable, and by having the supposed "villain", a politician running for congress ('Lost in Space's' Mark Goddard) not being really evil at all but just a guy whose bad decisions in the past are now coming back to haunt him. The mood is always kept intense and reasonably creepy, and the director also maintains a snappy pace, with no dull sequences to have to sit through. The picture also has a purely 1970's vibe; hairstyles and wardrobes and of course a climactic disco sequence strongly evoke the era.<br /><br />Future soft core director King is an acceptable if not especially dynamic lead; the supporting cast includes Deborah Winters, Robert Walden, Charles Siebert, Ray Young, Ann Cooper, and Bill Adler. The crazed friend at the party is played by Richard Crystal - Billy Crystals' brother, Stefan Gierasch and Alice Ghostley make very welcome guest appearances, and future prominent film heavy Brion James makes one of his earliest screen appearances as the drunk at the party who thinks he's a bird(!).<br /><br />Other elements adding to the films' creepy feel are Charles Gross's eerie music and the striking sight of the victims in their bald or balding skulls.<br /><br />I recommend checking this out. It's a great early film from a director who always succeeds in crafting well made independent films with a difference.<br /><br />8/10
