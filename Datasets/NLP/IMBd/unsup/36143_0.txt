> After reading the other comments I decided to watch this movie. What a > mistake. The script is full of holes (e.g. Gibbs never reconfronts Stamos > after discovering he's not a cop, Stamos' family protects him even after one > of their own is killed, etc.,etc., etc.). The movie is just plain slow and > boring. Don't waste your time.
