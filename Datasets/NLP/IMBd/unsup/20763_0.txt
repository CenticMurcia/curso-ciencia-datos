I recently saw this film at a screening in Philadelphia and think it was outstanding. Although some of the audio got wild in two spots where there was heavy traffic on screen and where some people started screaming, I think it was perfectly acceptable for a documentary. Someone commented about the film looking like it was shot with a handycam and I think that guy must be blind. Most of the footage looks great. I thought the story was well told and unfolded in three parts, what gay days is... it questioned if events should give more to charity and it ended on a kind of sad note about one of the main characters feeling like he didn't belong in his own community anymore. All together it was a good doc and I recommend it.
