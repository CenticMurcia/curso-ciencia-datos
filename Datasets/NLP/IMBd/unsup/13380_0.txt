This movie is excellent because there's action and also a good story that makes you think about how you live your own live. It's based on a true story that is about a missionary who has to go to Tonga for 3years to preach the gospel.Tonga is a small Island and first he experiences a huge shock of culture. The people there have no money and live of what they can cultivate on the Island and the worst of all, he doesn't speak their language and the minister forbids the people to listen to him.A lot of miraculous things happen to him on that Island.And he has to fight for his love back home and writes her letters in which he tells her not to marry someone else.The story is about true love, faith and a boy becoming a man. It really touched my heart.
