***SPOILERS, IF I CAN REMEMBER THEM***<br /><br />A college roommate introduced me to this unforgettable little film, based on my love for laughably bad movies, and it did not disappoint. Purely a vehicle for slasher T&A, the movie makes no excuses and doesn't really take it itself all that seriously - what movie COULD, after having a man fall off a 15-story building and walk away?<br /><br />To me, the shower scenes were just a softcore running gag, but I suppose some people could be turned-on, by them. It's just funny, for me, thinking about the writers' meeting that must have taken place ('Okay, the story's finished. Now, how do we get all of them into the shower?').<br /><br />The highlight of the film, for me, was the irrepressible Orville coming back from one death after another, and not seeming to hold all the abuses against anyone, when it's over. Favorite scene: Orville pulls the mail spindle he has been stabbed with out of his heart, and uses a stapler to attach a bandage to his chest.<br /><br />Worth the 99-cent rental fee.
