Alright I'm almost not sure where is should start with this movie it was that bad. First of all the acting in the movie was absolutely terribly except for one minute part in the movie where Washington dies, she was the only person who showed emotion when she actually died. And other than her no one else looked like they were taking it seriously. As for the flow of the movie it was at least partly smooth, there were parts where it was choppy but it wasn't that bad. As for how believable the story line was, I'm not ashamed to say that is horrendously bad. There is no way that those secret service men wouldn't have noticed a gun barrel pointing out of the window at the beginning of the movie. Also the chance that the little boy would just happen to be a survivor is so slim that it makes it absurd and it is just obvious that it was a bad plot hole. The endingwhere do I start it was just bad. The whole love story between the doctor and the president was obviously thrown in there just to how a little side plot, and it didn't work very well at all. And just the way the president asked her to come to the white house was so corny and clichéd.
