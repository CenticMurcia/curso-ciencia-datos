Orphans move into big, fancy house made largely of glass. With a couple called Glass. It's all so self-referential.<br /><br />This is a good-looking, but hackneyed and, er, transparent rehash of 'they're-not-quite-dead-yet' thrillers like The Hand That Rocks The Cradle and The Tie That Binds (the latter being directed by Wesley Strick, who obviously loved the idea so much that he reheated the script and submitted it to be used again here).<br /><br />Plot holes can be overlooked, but you can only make so many allowances for so many people doing so many illogical things. Leelee Sobieski is kept drugged for eons in her room and her new school doesn't seem to mind her continued absence. Prior to this she also squanders a million opportunities to escape or blab to the authorities, but instead chooses to make things difficult for herself by only trying to do eiterh of those things when nasty Stellan Skarsgard is around. Meanwhile, her old-enough-to-be-responsible brother appears not to care about her obvious distress and confinement as long as he gets to play video games whenever he likes.<br /><br />Frankly, if you're going to enjoy this hooey you'll need to take your disbelief, decapitate it, burn it, and scatter its ashes over four continents.
