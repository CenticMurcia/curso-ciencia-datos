The only impressive thing about "Down to You" is just how amazingly bad it is. There is no plot, no characters, the jokes aren't funny -- a complete waste of five minutes, not to mention two hours. Henry Winkler is good, but even he can't keep this from being a likely candidate for worst movie of the year 2000.
