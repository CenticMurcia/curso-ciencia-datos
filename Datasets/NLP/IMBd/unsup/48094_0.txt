I used to like Shannon when she was younger, but she seems to become a worse actress as she has gotten older (something I thought was impossible for anyone).<br /><br />This woman is now totally unbelievable as an actress and casting her as some girl next door character just doesn't work anymore (especially when you see how difficult it was for the makeup people to hide the bags under her eyes).<br /><br />The plot was totally unbelievable too and how this film ever got funded is beyond me.<br /><br />I must say that I actually fell asleep watching this and decided to watch the bits I missed simply because I wanted to warn people to stay away from this film.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour and go watch paint dry.
