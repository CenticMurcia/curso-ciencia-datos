Perhaps one of Sigourney Weavers worst films to date, her portrayal of a criminal psychologist with post traumatic stress disorder grinds from the first scene. Sigourney Weaver plays Dr Helen Hudson, the brilliant criminal psychologist, somewhat reminiscent of Denzel Washington's Lincoln Rhyme in the more recent and marginally superior 'The Bone Collector'. She is haunted by the memory of being attacked by a serial killer and has now become the new unhealthy interest of a copycat serial killer. Holly Hunter plays M.J. Monahan, a tough cop with a distinctly unexplored history. A very shallow character who does little to bring the film to life. The film seems to want to explore the two female leads, though it does so with no emotional attachment for the viewer. I sat unmoved during scenes supposedly trying to tug at my heart strings. Only hinting at the contents of their hearts and minds, a token poorly executed sub-plot does little to open any of these doors. A boring, predictable, unimaginative plot married to over-the-top incidental music eventually leads to an equally uninspired climax. I saw the film through to the end, my horror being that I wasted 123 minutes of my life.<br /><br />If you have the opportunity to see this film, don't.
