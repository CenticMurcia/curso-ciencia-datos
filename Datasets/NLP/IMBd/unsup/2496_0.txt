it is mind-boggling to see this short. It reminds me a little of michel gondry's video for "let forever be" by the chemical brothers. I feel reluctant making this comparison though, in a way, because it is evident that this piece of animation must have taken thousands of hours to produce. i love it.<br /><br />the rendering alone shows a mastery of this obscure medium, pinscreen animation.<br /><br />I still have not been able to find a clip of this piece anywhere on the internet. I saw it on TV on a channel in new york called fine arts showcase.<br /><br />If anyone knows where I could view it again, please post.
