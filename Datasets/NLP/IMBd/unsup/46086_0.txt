This is a bad, bad, bad movie. Everything abut it is bad, from the pathetic acting tot he horrid directing, tot eh VHS quality of the film itself to the nonsensical attempt at a plot. It is difficult to imagine anyone spending money to make this.<br /><br />It is, in fact, so bad that it lacks even the amusing badness of such dreadful classics like PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE. In fact, even MST3K's treatment of this film couldn't make it even mildly interesting.
