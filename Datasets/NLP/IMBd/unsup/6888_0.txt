Patrick Creadon's new film is easily the best documentary to come along in years. It simply amazes one that any person could make a film about puzzles that can be so suspenseful, intellectual, and heartwarming all at the same time. It makes you laugh, cry, and pull your hair out, and doesn't give you time to catch your breath before starting this cycle all over again. I haven't cheered out loud at a movie since I was a kid and allowed to do so in a theater. It's one of those movies which you cry to yourself, "God, I wish I could make a movie like this." This brilliant director undoubtedly has a huge future ahead of him and what a way to start.
