I bought the film and couldn't wait to rip open the package and watch it. I love Bernal's acting (he comes by it naturally from his family). But the plot and dialog reminded me of some of the French films of the same genre from the '60s. I kept expecting Deneuve or Tritignant to come through the door. I couldn't watch it through to the end. I admit that I was tired and had just watched, Dot the I (much superior), so maybe I'll give another go, even if only to watch Bernal who never disappoints. This was a forced film in my opinion with a dreadful script, but maybe I should give a second chance. That sounds perhaps a bit pretentious:-) Hugh Corston Quebec City
