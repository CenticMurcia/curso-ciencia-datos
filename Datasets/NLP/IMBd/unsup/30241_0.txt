Yes, I played this game on the sega cd video game console, however I do believe it was originally a computer game. This game was a bit different than the games I was used to playing as in this game you progressed through your quest with really no fear of dying. You just solved the puzzles and moved on in your quest. A nice change of pace to be sure in the days of lives and limited continues and many deaths by way of the mysterious pit. This game has you as a wannabe pirate named Guybrush Threepwood. The name is a bit funny is it not? Well the entire game is a rather funny ordeal as our pirate must navigate many obstacles on his quest to become a pirate and rescue the governor's daughter from the pirate ghost LeChuck. Basically all there is to it, you are constantly faced with puzzles to help you proceed such as getting yourself launched from a cannon, having to buy a boat from a dubious salesman, getting past the dreaded piranha poodles, getting caught again and again by natives on an island only to escape buy the same way as the natives keep putting on more high tech doors on your prison, and touching the most violent beast ever just to have a man join your crew of dangerous pirates. So for a fun and rather funny game this one was very good. For the most part the puzzles are not to hard to figure out, only the one involving the head and maze gave me trouble and it was a breeze once I figured out what to do.
