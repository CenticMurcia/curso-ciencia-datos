This was the most amazing and touching movie I ever saw. I'm a teenager who's mom got pregnant at a young age and she tells me nothing about her troubles as a pregnant teen so I think that this movie was very helpful and inspirational. When this girl got pregnant, she was faced with humiliation and the fact of raising a child but through it all she got to see what was right and I was just touched by this movie. If I ever got pregnant and gave the child up, I couldn't forgive myself but it was good to see that she could be a role model to all teenagers who want or have a baby. The fact that there are people who are trying to have a baby and can't and people who have a baby that don't want it is a fact that everybody should know.
