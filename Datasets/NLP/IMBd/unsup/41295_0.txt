When I started to watch this movie, it was immediately apparent it was not going to be of the highest quality. You may ask why I persevered and viewed the entirety of this celluloid excreta - this film is so bad, on so many levels (acting, script, plot), that one has to keep watching to find out whether the cast and crew can maintain such a ridiculously low level of quality for an entire film.<br /><br />One could be forgiven for thinking that this film was a spoof - its clich√©d predictable script would only need direction to the 'actors' to turn this into a true, but poor quality, spoof.<br /><br />Although I have said this film is dire, I would recommend it - it's so bad, it's entertaining, however not in the same league as Edward D. Wood Jnr.
