On The third of November 2004, Muslim extremists assassinated director Theo Van Gogh because of his inglorious portrayals of their culture and beliefs. Did he deserve this merciless fate? No, of course not. Because everyone in this world is entitled to an opinion and if Van Gogh wished to express his using the medium of cinema, he had every right to it. This "Interview" dates from the year before the controversial filmmaker's death. It's a typical Van Gogh film, entirely set in one interior location and introducing two main characters constantly talking. It actually looks a lot like that other film of his, "06", only the protagonists are now face-to-face, while "06" exclusively featured two people talking over the phone. I admit I started (and continued) watching "Interview" for the most shallow reason possible: the starring of Katja Schuurman. This ravishing Dutch actress has the face of an angel, the voice of a siren and a booty that would even make the most popular Hollywood actress jealous. In this, she plays the part of a successful actress who gets interviewed by some sort of Bosnian paparazzi guy. They constantly argue, play with each other's feelings etc etc etcÂ… The script is tedious and nowhere near original or compelling. Although it probably was Van Gogh's intention, it totally doesn't feel like an artistic piece of cinema, as there's no style to detect anywhere. Not even a bit of exceptional camera-work or memorable music. This is a complete failure and I don't really feel obliged to give it more praise simply because the maker is death. Avoid! Watching a train rush by is more exciting than this.
