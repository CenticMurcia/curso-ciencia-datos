If you have seen a movie where the director has more passion for absolutely festering chunks of horse apples, please contact me. this movie has not only become a personal obsession of mine but my friends and i reference it on a daily basis. our vocabulary has melded around Troll 2. If you haven't seen it...<br /><br />...a family (the Waits') from the city trades houses with a family (the Presences') from the country for a month in the lovely town of Nilbog. The townspeople are billed as friendly but they are nothing short of strung out, overly creepy and laughable rednecks. of course everyone in the town is a horribly inept GOBLIN, despite the title of Troll. In human form they are slow, awkward and can't act. as Goblins, they are smaller, stupider and even more retarded (watch for the GOblin with bug eyes and watch how the flimsy rubber fingers of the costumes shake)if you can make it through this movie without laughing, you'll need a drink or 4. if you love it, come join me and my retards over at groups.myspace.com/nilbog
