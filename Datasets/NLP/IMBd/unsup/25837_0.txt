The director has managed to get a precise picture of the hard knock Stockholm suburban life. The script, which is based on an Astrid Lindgren classic, is catchy, funny and mind blowing. The most familiar and loved actors of Sweden have been brought together in this modern classic, in a Ocean Eleven fashion. <br /><br />The movie starts us of in a high speed chase on foot, and straight away we want to know more about this ruffian. the following scenes really have some pretty and heart breaking moments that leaves no human being untouched. I had to stop the movie and dry my tears from time to time.<br /><br />This movie is not appropriate for kids(23 and under), I still have nightmares and must visit a shrink to keep me calm. I specially remember one scene that gives me the chills........I can only say one thing. A man....and a dead fox!!<br /><br />Stockholm has a major problem with drugs. And everybody is invited. 2 grams of heroin cost less than a pack of Marlboro. So of course every kid run around with chemicals in their veins. <br /><br />In 1993 we had movies like the very sad Schindler's List, the funny Groundhog Day and if we combine these modern classics we get......you know what......SÃ¶karna!! See it, to believe it!!!
