This film impactfully informs viewers of the efforts it took to change history in Massachusetts. I found myself being educated while riding the emotional roller coaster of those events as marriage equality was advanced and people were educated. Regardless of the final outcome of marriage equality in Massachusetts, films like this greatly inform people of what everyday individuals can do to be part of historic efforts towards advancing equality and fairness in our country for lgbtq people. I was inspired and felt better educated on the issues and strategies for moving forward. Many thanks to the filmmakers for making a movie that documents this history and educates people across the country, not just those living in Massachusetts. As such, the film is a call to action, not just a passive documentary record.
