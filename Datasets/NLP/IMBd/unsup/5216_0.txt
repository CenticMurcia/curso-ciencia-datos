Goldie Hawn has never been a favorite, I must admit, but that is all the more reason to catch her in the one performance where she is not quirky, superfluous or silly.<br /><br />The theme of this story has been done before, but thanks to a fine performance by John Heard, the character of Jack Saunders is intriguing and foreboding. John Heard is an underrated actor who adds a somewhat mischievous, ominous and sometimes comical overtone to his roles (You may want to watch him in the earlier 1970's film "Chilly Scenes of Winter", and there was also a film short wherein he portrayed Fortunato, in Edgar Allen Poe's "Cask of Amontillado". He was excellent).<br /><br />Look for Ashley Peldon as the young daughter; Robin Bartlett, who is underused as Heard's estranged mother, and Tom Irwin, as Hawn's colleague from the art museum. The mystery is enough to keep you watching, and overall Heard's performance makes it all worthwhile. 7/10.
