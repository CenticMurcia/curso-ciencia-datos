Chic beauty Faye Emerson (as Dorothy Drew aka "Dot" Burton) supplants hard times as an actress by joining a group of bank robbers. Unfortunately, Ms. Emerson's carefully planned plot to rob the "Central Trust and Savings Bank" of $40,000 goes awry, when her getaway car driver, a young Jackie Gleason (as Wilson), parks in the red. Big mistake. Mr. Gleason draws the attention of a passing policeman, and Emerson is left holding the bag. Love interest Frank Wilcox (as Kenneth Phillips) tries to keep Emerson out of women's prison. Fortunately, he is unsuccessful, and Emerson serves a intermittently amusing sentence, with Julie Bishop (as Myrtle Reed), and other beautifully coiffed women behind bars.<br /><br />*** Lady Gangster (1942) Robert Florey ~ Faye Emerson, Frank Wilcox, Jackie Gleason
