i cant remember the name of the main actor...john?james? anyway he is the one with the short brown curly hair. He has the stage presence of a dead vampire wearing a garlic necklace and charm bracelet. Every time he opened his mouth the words just stunk. I dunno if it was the actual writing or if the fault lies squarely with him but the dialogue seemed amateurish and the little tricks of the trade which helped us to understand his character, seemed childish. It's like we're supposed to be thinking "oh my, wasn't that so very clever" but in actual fact, it gets a "meh." This movie sucks. do not watch unless you wanna be shocked that they make movies like this.
