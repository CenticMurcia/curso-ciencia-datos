This movie is pretty funny. I saw it way before it came out because my friend Geoff has a small role in the film. I got to watch parts of the movie being made and they did a great job. The kid in the van who says: "woah" is my friend Geoff. It's a movie worth seeing. I highly recommend it if you live in Ottawa, Ont. You might recognize some of the locations that they filmed in, such as the Police station. The casting was great, like Mr.knight from the Brady Bunch t.v. show. He is a good actor and a great guy. I give it a 10 out of 10. I may be a little biased though... but that just means you should watch it for yourself and see what you think!
