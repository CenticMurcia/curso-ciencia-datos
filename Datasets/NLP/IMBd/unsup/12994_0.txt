I love this film it is the greatest! Virginia was very sexy as the young unsuspecting student who investigates the murders of people of a murdered black slave who has a hook for a hand who lures his victims with candy but its really wrapped-up razors and then splits them wide open with his hook.I have said Candyman 5 times in the mirror and nothing happened! But it is a great film and the music is spooky but awesome and the setting is rather Silence of the Lambs like, remember Jodie in the garage well it Virginia in the wall of a ghetto building. Very Spooky! But Clever!<br /><br />10/10
