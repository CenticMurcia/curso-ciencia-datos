The Casting was great, especially Merlin. The settings are beautiful and believable which is not the case for most "knight" and dragon movies. The vision of the movie is fluid and only gets slow at certain points, which is totally understandable when considering the task of trying to fit in the whole Authorian legend into one movie. Heart pounding music accompanies exhilarating battle scenes. A must see for any fan of med-evil chivalry.
