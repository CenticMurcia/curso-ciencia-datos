I liked this movie because it deals with the great questions of life. Why do we have to suffer? How much pain and suffering can a man take before he kills himself? And why does the rightous man have to suffer? And also because it shows a lot of friendship and brotherhood amongst the POW's. One of the best films I've ever seen.
