Tacky 1970s version of the I AM LEGEND story and having the clich√©s of the period: angry black biker chick, a groovy group living an alternative lifestyle etc. It also sports an albino zombie gang clad in cowls and sunglasses called the family (something of a nod to Charles Manson's gang of the time). One black member(who with his whited-up appearance looks disconcertingly like Harpo Marx) cannot refrain from some black panther-esquire comments despite it having no bearing on the story.<br /><br />This is a vehicle for action man Charlton Heston but the action sequences are badly staged, not rising above the level of a TV movie. The finale is also anti-climatically shot and whatever effect the director was trying to achieve is undercut by the odd and inappropriate music.<br /><br />Very dated.
