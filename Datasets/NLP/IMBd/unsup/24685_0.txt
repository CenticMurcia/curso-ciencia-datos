I was told at first that this was a typical woman's movie, but I -being male, 17 years old- was still interested to see it. And I loved it. It's a beautiful story about a normal family in London with all their recognizable problems, misfortunes etc.<br /><br />This movie is so powerful because of its reality: especially the casting and dressing department have done a great job to create characters just like you and me (unlike those Hollywood-babes). For example, one of the main characters, Nadia (Gina McKee), is continuously wearing a casual rucksack and that's a thing we would never get to see in an American movie. The acting itself is very natural.<br /><br />Little weaknesses: because the main characters are all part of one family, they are much alike and it was a little problematic for me to distinguish the different characters in the first 30 minutes; composer Michael Nyman seems to have understood the intimacy of the movie with his score but his music is a little too emphatic. <br /><br />Overall, 'Wonderland' is a very gripping movie, it's a little like a soap opera but much, much better - mostly because of the great cast. I highly recommend this movie. 8/10
