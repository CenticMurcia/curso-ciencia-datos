I am a single gay man who never really thought of ever having kids. I think I never considered it an option, but watching this documentary made me see things from another perspective. Never say never. Also just the general sense of love among family is a universal theme in this film, and it made me grateful for the love and support I get from my family. I'm very fortunate to have that. And all those kids on there are also very fortunate to grow up in a loving environment, too bad so many people in the outside world don't see that. Congrats to all the family members who went on the cruise to support their gay family members. I have a newfound respect for Rosie O'Donell. Best wishes to her and her family.
