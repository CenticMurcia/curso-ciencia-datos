My God, where did they find these actors? Not one person in this flop could act. The two main characters (who happened to be firemen) were just plain silly. The dialog sounded as if it came direct from Sesame Street or something like that. The DVD box cover is really misleading, comparing this to The Blair Witch Project. Now that's a joke. Scenes here that were just thrown in, conversations about hamsters, just stupid. I sure do pity the Portage Fire Dept. for allowing their good name and equipment to be shown in this stinker. I hope these "actors" didn't give up their day job and they really should go back to whatever they were doing before they thought they could act.
