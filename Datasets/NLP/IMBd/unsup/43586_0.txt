I accomplished my goal for this semester, I have found a movie which is absolutely god awful compared to everything else I have ever seen.<br /><br />Troll 2, Space Mutiny, Hobgoblins,The Eye Creatures, Night of the Demons, Bogus Witch Project, C.H.U.D 2, Sleepaway Camp, Ghoulies, The Prey, Ghost House, Plan 10....I have seen all of these films and more that I can't remember but NONE come even close to this level of pure trash cinema.<br /><br />The cover gave it away, an oversized box with a bad drawing of a monster and no description of the movie on the back whatsoever. With a one word title to boot, They. It took me a while to find this movie here on the IMDB.<br /><br />The film starts out with people talking about a disease that is killing everyone on the planet. You see footage of people running around, then it cuts to a man walking to a cabin, he talks to his sister blah blah. Then the group lands at an airport after someone warns them not too and disappears.<br /><br />The next hour of the movie is these people sitting in a cabin talking with random images spliced in here and there. The characters look like a bunch of hippies that got bored and decided it would be fun to make a movie.<br /><br />The "action" sequences are just a plane flying and a guy riding a snowmachine. When the guy rides the snowmachine the music track cuts out for 5 seconds then just loops back to the beginning, several times bad editing makes peoples heads jerk around.<br /><br />I have yet to watch Manos : The Hands of Fate, that flick is next on my list but unless you want to brag that you have seen the worst movie in existence do NOT watch this, its a real character building flick.<br /><br />Oh yeah, there is one thing I can't understand, who in their right mind decided to order this film then stock it for rental? Yeesh.
