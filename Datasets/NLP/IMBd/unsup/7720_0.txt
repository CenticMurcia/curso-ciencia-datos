This is the best movie I have ever seen. It still is even though the year is 2005. Mani's talent is proved in this single movie. This movie made him my favourite director. I keep watching this movie at my leisure time. I would have seen this movie at least for 25 times. I remember each and every scene. A great inspirer at times of problems. The story is about how two lovers who struggle for their love inspite of the pathetic situation they are in. Each and every character has acted naturally. They have lived their roles which makes this movie more interesting to watch. This movie also shows that life should be lived to the extent possible and love between a mother and a son is very well shown. Love in its pure form is shown in this movie. This movie is for every age and a good movie to watch with a family. I suggest this as a must see movie. I have this movie 9 even though I could have easily given it 10. Don't miss this movie.
