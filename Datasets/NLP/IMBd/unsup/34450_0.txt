What the hell were the fighting scenes all about in this movie? I like the Matrix, but correct me if I'm wrong but this movie is not set in the Matrix. The fighting scenes are laughable. No gritty drama anymore. It's evident in all the movies in Hollywood now, Bollywood fight scenes where one guy flies around kicking everyone's butts with dumb moves. But apart from that the dialogue was poor, the plot paper-thin, no strong characterization. This is definitely a film which has relied on style over content. Pity there's not much style. 2 out of 10, and I'm being generous.
