In case you're not aware, the original Lake Placid was a movie about giant crocodiles eating people in New York's very own Lake Placid.<br /><br />Here we have the sequel, Lake Placid 2, which takes place in Maine, in a lake that is not called Lake Placid... but let's not sweat the details.<br /><br />After the astonishing success of Lake Placid 1, I can't blame the director for sticking to the plan - 5 minutes into the movie, we find ourselves knee deep in 40 foot crocodiles that have been raised by none other than the sister of the woman who raised the original crocodiles - talk about a family affair!<br /><br />Honestly, I loved the movie - the acting was fantastic, and I couldn't help but feel that I was right there in the action, watching some fool get eaten by a crocodile. And when the small town sheriff shows us all that he is an expert with an MGL Grenade Launcher, well, let's just say I called up my local movie store and reserved ten copies.
