Roger Moore sure shows his versatility as an actor in this film, He play a character though not very unlike his James Bond "persona" physically and intellectually , but quite different than his soave debonair character typical of the bond films.<br /><br />In Ffolkes he plays an eccentric former British Navy diver who is called upon to swart a terrorist attack on the North sea oil platforms. Anthony Perkins also gives an excellent performance as the head of a group of terrorist who forcibly takes control of a supply ship and threaten to blow up some oil platforms in the North Sea.<br /><br />Moore's character is what make the entire film worth watching. He's an eccentric tough guy, who loves cats and a good shot of whiskey, he's also highly opinionated. To the point that drives some to dislike him.<br /><br />Watch this film, It's non-stop action, and excellent dialoge.
