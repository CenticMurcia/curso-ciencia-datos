Whilst other children of my generation were enthralled by Disney movies, I was busy watching a very obscure Swedish gem known as "Peter No Tail." To this day, felines have always been my favorite creatures, and as a wee girl I had a bit of an obsession with them. Yeah. So obviously this little film caught my interest, way back when Stop and Shop (as you can tell I'm a New Englandah), had movie rentals! Not to mention the rarest ones such as this! Peter No Tail is a unique story of a family who want to adopt a cat. The local farmhand's cat had just given birth to a litter of kittens, and he was selling them. But alas, nobody would adopt Peter, the kitten who was, uh, lacking in the tail department. Finally, a family take him in, give him a cute little cap to wear and green bow-tie and everything! It's a cute and offbeat look at how Peter tries to win the heart of the cat community, despite their scoffing at him and his tail lackage (is that a word?). He competes with a nasty cat named Max, and his sidekicks, Bill and Bull, in a sort of athletic decathlon and to win the heart of a lovely feline female. It's a tad bit dated, but considering the fact that it's a 25 year old flick, it's still wonderful today and I still own a copy...somewhere.
