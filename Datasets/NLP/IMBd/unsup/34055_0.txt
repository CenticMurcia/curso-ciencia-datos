This film was so terrible that i actually couldn't bear it any longer, i turned it off. I'm not sure why this film has so many good reviews and an overall above average score, but if you thought it was terrible, your not alone. The acting was awful, the low budget look didn't help and the dialogue seemed to of been written by a child. The soundtrack also seemed completely out of place as they tried to squeeze as many death metal songs in, in an attempt to improve this terrible film i can only assume. What else was wrong with it? Well, what was right with it. A good idea has been sabotaged in a terrible attempt to create what i can only assume was meant to be a film? A plus side of it is, i guess, it gave off a good vibe and i was intrigued,until i turned it on.<br /><br />The premise of the film seemed promising but it failed to deliver and after a while i gave in and turned it off.
