I watched it hoping there was going to be a lot of good quality, wholesome American nudity, however there ended up being nothing remotely redeeming about the film. The least they could have done to make it interesting was to add nudity! Usually a film like this gets by on gratuitous sex, but alas there was none to be found. If you have a chance to see this movie, watch something else instead or just go to bed. If you wish to torture your friends or family for awhile, then put this film on the big screen and watch everyone squirm in their seats with boredom. This film is a poorly done reincarnation of the lameness of a movie such as The Coneheads from the eighties. Avoid it and save yourself!
