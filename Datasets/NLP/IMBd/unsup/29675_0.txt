Having experienced some of the same issues as Mendy, I can tell you that this movie is very well done. It has a great script, and the actor who portrays Mendy is superb. Truly, some of the best acting I've ever seen. Also, too many movies portraying Jews look totally fake. This one is the closest to real that I've seen. This movie made me laugh and cry, and stirred my emotions better than a kitchen aid stirs a batter. It was so powerful that I can't bring myself to see it again. But I'm sure glad I watched it once. I would recommend it to anyone, no matter what your background is. It's a great movie that almost everyone can relate to on some level.
