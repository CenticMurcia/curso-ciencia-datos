I first noticed this DVD in a record/movie shop some months ago. Being a sci-fi fanatic, I was determined not to let this movie slip by me. But of course I didn't want to pay very much for it, suspecting that it probably wasn't great. So, yesterday I found it as a very cheap ex-rental DVD and bought it.<br /><br />Gah. Had I watched this at a friend's place, I would definitely not have bought a disc of my own. Evil Alien Conquerors is a silly and not very funny movie. I stopped watching halfway through and rated it a "2" out of 10. But I went back and watched the rest, and the second half, with Tyler Labine's Croker, was quite a bit better. So I've raised the rating to a "3". Only fair.<br /><br />Labine is funny. His Croker character is very well acted. But it's the only even remotely interesting part of this movie. If, that is, you have a sense of humor. If you don't, you might find this movie funny. Ha.
