I've tried several times to watch this show for more than 45 seconds, just to catch a glimpse of my lovely San Francisco or Ms. Milano, to no avail. Can't make it through 30 seconds. Preposterously poor writing and dialog, absurd situations and plot twists. Takes itself far too seriously to be satirical. Simply horrible. Horrendous. Horrific. Perilously poor. Did I mention the acting? I think revolting is apt. Turns out Ms. Milano is a producer. She's not aged well and her production is a flop. I have NO clue as to how it remained on the air for more than a single season. Some of the cameos I've seen while flipping by the station have been hilarious. Awful. Sickening. Terrible.
