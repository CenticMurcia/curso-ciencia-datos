Wow, what a story! But then that is just about all it is is a story loosely based on real facts, as I perceive them. I was born in 1928. My mother was really smitten by Sister Aimee, and she became from the 1920's a very devoted member of the church. She was the guide for visitors to the temple from 1930's to the 1970's. She worked in the office and did lots of other activities for the Church. Myself, I went to Sunday school at the Temple, and worked with the stage crew in setting up the monthly illustrated sermon settings, and performed in many of them, from the late 1930's till just after her death when I went to the Navy. I even played the kettle drums when the regular drummer did not show up for services. I knew her personally as well as Rolf and his daughter. So what? Well, first of all the producers might have taken a little more care in providing the correct uniforms for Sister and the others shown. I have never seen her in anything other than the white nurses uniforms and capes with the large shield like tie and never saw low cuts to show cleavage. The actress was so far off the natural voice of Sister, she was squeaky and high pitched. Sister to my recollection did not have that high pitch during her sermons. All in all the movie was not that bad as far as it went; although much of the conversations in private must be in the writer's imagination. I remember well the day it was announced that she was dead. Within those who were a part of the Four Square religion anywhere, the shock might be comparable to that on the day JFK was shot.
