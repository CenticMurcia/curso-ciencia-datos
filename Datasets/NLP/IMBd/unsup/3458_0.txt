I have seen the bottom 12 IMDb movies, and I can safely say, this is worst! <br /><br />Some brainless people (most probably the makers of the film) have rated this a 10 out of 10, keeping it above 1.0/10.<br /><br />This is the most pathetic film ever and is only good for recommending it to your deepest, darkest enemies as "the greatest closet horror film ever created."<br /><br />I love horror films, and this is a disgrace. Not only to the movie industry, but to all mankind. Heck--to all life in the Universe.<br /><br />I still have a bad taste in my mouth from watching it 4 years ago.<br /><br />Please do not watch this film, you will forever be changed. And believe me, there is no coming back from this.<br /><br />Prior to watching this film, I had 20-20 vision. I am now completely blind in my left eye. My left hand had been removed and was reattached to my right foot after it was cut off for severe frostbite.<br /><br />Please help me.
