I think this movie is getting unfair treatment.It's not one of the best Afterdark Horrorfest films, but it definitely isn't one of the worst.The acting was actually good and not just horrible like it is in most B-Movies.The script is actually quite new and fresh, for a movie of this standard.It was also very entertaining to watch, and while I did find the ending EXTREMELY stupid, most of the material in this film didn't bother me.It was good, and I enjoyed watching it.The characters don't stick to you like they should, and there were a few flaws with this movie, but no movie's 100% perfect, and you definitely shouldn't sit down to watch this movie expecting to be.I liked it, and it's rating is too low if you ask me.I recommend it if you've liked all the others, because it is a fine edition to the series.
