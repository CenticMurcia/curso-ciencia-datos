I have seen a fair few slasher films and I must say this one was very boring. It starts off looking promising, with some good death scenes such as a mans head being decapitated with a samurai sword and a woman being stabbed through the neck. Later on we get another decapitation which is cool. But none of this is enough to save the film. Whoever directed Drive-In Massacre must not have been a fan of horror films because it doesn't seem like any effort whatsoever was put into it. There's no tension and the storyline is extremely thin. Too much time is spent in the police station talking. Too much time is also spent on a father chasing his daughter that isn't really connected to the main story. And the ending is simply terrible - there is no conclusion whatsoever, just a message on the screen that other people are being killed in other drive-ins in the area. The music was also very annoying - horrible clicking sounds. Give me synth any day! Avoid this film, even if you like slashers. The title makes it sound interesting, but it's just a gimmick. Anything with the word "massacre" in the title is bound to get a horror fans attention, but in cases like this, it's just a trick to make money.
