Although it is not a master piece or or anything; it is good to have many good laughs and just have a good time. "Matando Cabos" is about two kidnappings (among other things) that go very wrong. Mr. Cabos is a ruthless business man who has hurt and taken advantage of many. Everybody hates him. On the same night different people decide to get back to him; but things go very wrong, confusion starts and things get mixed up (very mixed up).<br /><br />The movie is funny from start to finish even tragic things can turn into a funny scene. It's a movie that laughs at the misfortunes of life. It does have some really violent and sexual scenes (not my favorite) but it is part of the way the movie is done. I am not sure if foreigners would like it, it is "Mexican" humor. It's worth the try.
