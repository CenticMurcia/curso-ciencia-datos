The fact that a movie on this topic was made is admirable. I found the opening quarter a little rough (editing, footage choice), and had to overlook some exaggerations and oversights. But in terms of weaving a consistent message with data, dialog, music, and both historical and current video - hauntingly amazing. Whether you believe that message or its implications ... well, that's up to you ... and the movie leaves it at that. Although not directly comparable to An Inconvenient Truth, I'm sure viewers who liked one will like the other. If An Inconvenient Truth was about humanity's reach exceeding its grasp, then this movie is about humanity's reach falling short of its presumption.<br /><br />Sure there are alternatives. I'd watch a video of someone working out the environmental consequences of using coal gas, the political consequences of fighting for oil, or the economic consequences (a measure of ability) of developing nuclear, wind, and solar power. I guess I'd rather believe I have an empty tank and conserve than think I have a full tank and burn - even if the truth is the other way around. I think it makes me a better person for trying, and in my opinion provides a better opportunity to explore the alternatives. Call it inspiration through pessimism. If people continue to burn ridiculous amounts of fuel in a frivolous manner, out of convenience or perhaps poorly planned necessity, shame on us. Since, I'm no better than the average North American on this issue, I'm afraid that this is a lesson we'll all have to learn the hard way.
