This is so horrible yet laughable at the same time. It's definitely worth watching just to goof on with friends. First off, the fact that they never mention the cheap k-mart costumed creatures as trolls (The Friggin' title of the film!!) but as Goblins should already say they were losing the concept quickly. But I guess the fact that the writer had the genius idea of naming the town Nilbog (Goblin spelled backwards) there was no turning back. OK, fine. So they're Goblins not Trolls, then why throw in a Leprachaun mythos by having them all be burned with clover scars and evil green St.Patty's day food? Which by the way when eaten turns you into a goblin. Hilarious scene where the kid prevents his family from eating this food. Hint: Urine for a surprise. <br /><br />This is nothing compared to the actual thing he uses to finally defeat the goblins in the end. I'm gonna tell you, since it's so retarded. It's a friggin' Balogna sandwich!!! What the Hell!!! He eats it, because apparently the Gobbys are vegatarians and just can't stand meat? Whatever.<br /><br />BY the way the sandwich is supplied by his dead grandfather who constantly pops in and out of scenes. Acting is 100% horrible. Story sucks, but funny as all hell!
