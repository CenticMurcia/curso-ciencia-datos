The original Phantasm is such a landmark cult film because it truly bent the limits of the horror movie genre. It blended horror, scifi, comedy and good old Ingmar-Bergman-like surrealism and gave us something no one could have expected. Here, 20 years later, we finally get a worthy successor.<br /><br />Unlike Phantasms II & III (which were entertaining but in a superficial way), Phantasm Oblivion takes us away from the formulaic action and throws us into a bizarre dreamscape where anything goes. Much of the movie happens in a desert setting out in the middle of nowhere (Death Valley). The scenery and camera-work are absolutely spectacular, and the images of desolation make us feel as if we're watching a classic old Twilight Zone episode. I don't know about you, but I love this kind of stuff! From there, the plot takes so many strange twists through the use of flashbacks, dreams and acid trips, that I'm sure most people are left bewildered. But some of the most interesting ideas are introduced. We get a peek into the origin of the Tall Man (with some fantastic acting on the part of Angus Scrimm who finally gets to read more lines than "BOYYYYYY!"), and we learn the significance of the dimensional portal introduced in the first movie.<br /><br />But don't look for everything to be answered straightaway & tied up with a pretty bow, Hollywood style. Remember back to Phantasm I which left us with more questions than answers. In classic minimalistic/impressionistic style, Coscarelli resumes this tradition and gives us just enough to get our brains primed. I wasn't kidding when I compared this to the works of Ingmar Bergman. Maybe even Fellini and Jean Cocteau. Coscarelli and his crew have matured very nicely.<br /><br />Get ready for some great stuff with some of the best one-liners in the biz ("I thought cars only blew up like that in the movies!"). And of course there's Reggie, the ass-kicking ice cream man. Folks it don't get any better. I give it 8/10 which is very high on my scale.
