After the popular song "dragostia din tei" I find out that Romanians are actually good at making movies too? Who remembers "Johnny English". It was a funny clich√© of James Bond and it was extremely funny because of making funny of the established series. We all know other notable parodies. Now this Romanian movie here includes so many parodies that makes you laugh the whole movie. Nazis, cold war Russians, Japanese ninja and of course, James Bond try to get their hands on a magic stone that can destroy the world. With a touch of genius, here James bond is portrayed as a negative hero and the actual hero of the movie is a dumb Romanian policeman called Garcia. You have to see the parts where the policeman, out of crazy luck, wins some fierce fights. The guy is soooo funny! Also I think the same actor plays a woman at the same time. The woman seems pretty dumb too as well as her husband... I think this is the best parody I've seen; go and watch this DVD, you won'T regret it!!!
