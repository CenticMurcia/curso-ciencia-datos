now i would like to say this is one of the best movies i have ever seen. and in being the best, it is also the saddest. I would like to say i cried for an hour at least on this movie, and not how my life relates to it, but on the actually movie and how bad I felt about their lives. and i cried hard. not cried.. i wept.. i wept like a baby. i wept so much and hard that my stomach muscles hurt me. wow. good movie. go see it.
