If I had to select one film to represent Hindi Cinema, it would be Kal Ho Naa Ho. I don't really care if people say this is not the most influential or historically significant film.<br /><br />Kal Ho Naa Ho is the best Hindi Cinema has offered me. I have a special connection with this film and its believable characters especially Aman{SRK}. I regard this as his best role. Aman is the greatest character in the history of Bollywood. The main reason for it is the way he played with my emotions was unbelievable, he made me laugh out loud initially and during the climax he melted my heart and I cried with him. I've never seen and maybe will never see another more vibrant and colorful character. Kudos!<br /><br />The background score is also tremendously strong and emotional. Excellent score by SEL. The music/songs were awesome. My favourite of the lot was the title track sung by Sonu Nigam, which instantly became my all time favourite song before I even saw the film, just listen to its lyrics...Again PERFECT!<br /><br />The story is relatively very simple but the film does a superb job in showing it. People may say the last part of the film is too emotional and not required but I strongly disagree. This film gave me exactly what I wanted...Complete satisfaction. Perfect acting {by all}, Perfect music, Perfect story.<br /><br />In all, A Gem of Indian Cinema IMO and my one and only favourite Hindi film of all time. Enough said!<br /><br />Rating: 10/10
