Brian Herzlinger is a normal Joe trying to 'get a date with Drew Barrymore' in 30 days in this cloying 'Documentary'. Whether this is a stalker's attempt to desperately get a date with a actress he adores, or a clever ploy to jump start some sort of career for Herzlinger (I'm thinking more the latter), the fact remains that whichever it is, te film is manipulative at best and slightly alarming at worst. And if it WERE the former, rather then the latter, all the likability of Brian flies out the window as no matter how charismatic a stalker may be, the fact remains that they ARE in fact stalking someone. And if this movie inspires even one REAL stalker (and as I said before this film is a sham and a PR ploy), but if the film inspires a REAL stalker that would be quite a shame indeed. I can't recommend this film on entertainment ground, I can't recommend it on documentary grounds, and I certainly can't recommend it on ethical grounds.<br /><br />My Grade: D
