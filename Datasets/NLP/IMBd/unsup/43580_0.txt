With a slightly better script, a slightly better cast and a slightly better director (Brian Trenchard-Smith), 'Night of the Demons 2' is an improvement on the lamentable original; but only slightly.<br /><br />As in the first movie, a bunch of teens visit a possessed house on Halloween and become victims of the nasty spirit that dwells within. A plucky nun and a boy with a knowledge of demonology, armed with holy-water filled super-soakers and balloons, set out to destroy the evil. Also, like the first film, the action takes a good 45 minutes to get going.<br /><br />Steve Johnson, who provided the gore effects in the first film, also does the make-up FX for this one, and he does a pretty good job; particularly impressive moments include a woman's tits transforming into demon hands and a wonderful snake creature with a huge lashing tail.<br /><br />And whilst we're on the subject of impressive moments, let's not forget that the film has more than its fair share of hot babes who shed their clothes at every available opportunity. If you're a red-blooded male, and find yourself tiring of the so-so horror content, then the ample charms of Cristi Harris, Christine Taylor and Zoe Trilling should put a smile on your face.
