Three songs in the movie, all very good. I'd recommend the soundtrack, even though I absolutely abhor the movie.<br /><br />Hindi movies have a sort of surreal and supernatural feel, with events that would almost never occur in real life. However, this takes it to the extreme, such as when Ambar insults Nikhil day after day after day! It just makes no sense! Additionally, so many things are left unexplained. How did Ron get enough money for a new house? Why is there this conflict between Ambar and her parents? How come this isn't used or developed? The characters were bovine and completely unrealistic. Near the end of the movie, when Nikhil starts looking for Ambar, random people all over Melbourne just drop everything to look for a pregnant woman in a black/white dress.<br /><br />The use of old jokes, such as the Indian masquerading as an Australian and his wife saying "sorry?" all the time was funny at first, but it became very old very quickly.<br /><br />Finally, why was the movie drawn out with so much unneeded drama? Were the directors and producers trying to meet some length requirement? For example, what was the point of the white woman, Stella, near the end of the film? What about the blood-donation problem that lasted for at least fifteen minutes? Why was Ron even necessary as a character? Waste of time. If you rent it, skip to the songs.
