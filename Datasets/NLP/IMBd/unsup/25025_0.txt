This movie is often considered to be one of Bava's best, and I can see why some would say that. Maybe there's something I just don't understand about the movie that makes me miss the point.<br /><br />The plot revolves around the murder of an elderly woman and the subsequent inheritance grab that ensues. Possibly what is so off-putting about this film is that characters are introduced, and then killed off five minutes later. This isn't so much of a whodunit as much as a whokilledwho. And that's all the movie is: there's no mystery as to who the killer is, because it's everybody, so it's just a matter of who is left at the end. The murders themselves tend to be fairly original, particularly those that befall a precocious batch of horny teens who stumble onto the family estate (anyone who's seen Friday the 13th will see the inspiration for that movie right here). My one real complaint about this movie is the head-scratchingly odd ending, which really ties things up rather nicely, but leaves a rather questionable taste in your mouth. A must for Bava fans, but others may want to avoid.
