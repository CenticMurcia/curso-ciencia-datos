A film about a likeable tramp that loses his beloved dog to the pound. Another loser befriends him and together they fight for the return Of the tramps dog. The tramp goes to high-class restaurants and dances to get his dog Spot from the pound, passing his hat around at the end. He then has to face the bureaucratic robots (people that run the dog pound) to get his dog. I guess me being a dog lover I loved the film very much. It was acted so well, heart warming and a great film for children to know that they have to care for their pets. Just one thing wrong though. I have searched for this video for years and up to this very day I cannot find it. I have watched many films but Dog Pound Shuffle is one of my favourite movies. Naturally not as exciting as an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie but what I term a very heartwarming story about people who care. Definitely worth viewing
