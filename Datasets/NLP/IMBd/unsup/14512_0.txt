It is dreamy, romantic, funny and the characters are easy to like. I recommend this film for any teenage girl or any adult who wants to remember the innosence of those times. Don't miss it! It was just re-released in 2001 on DVD and VHS. I'm waiting for the soundtrack to come out as well. The music is GREAT!.. Just a great feel good movie.
