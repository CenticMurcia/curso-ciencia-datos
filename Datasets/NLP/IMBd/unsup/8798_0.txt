I thought this movie was a good lesson to all of the viewers that when you mess with Jason Yee, you get "yee" butt kicked. As a lean and muscular man with jet black "Beatles" hair, Jason Yee is truly reminiscent of a young, agile Bruce Lee with far superior acting skills. With a plot line that ultimately lands "Derek Wu" mixing with the wrong crowd after returning from a stint in the slammer, Yee manages to steal the show. You can't help being at the edge of your seat, waiting and wanting more from this savage hero. This movie features more than a handful of well-choreographed fight scenes that leave you asking, "How'd they do that?" He is a man with many talents. <br /><br />In Dark Assassin, Yee takes on a less familiar roles as Director/Producer. Yet Yee, always surprising, succeeds in all of his roles like a well-oiled veteran.
