Perhaps I'm biased but this is without doubt the worst film I have ever seen regarding football violence. The most ironic thing about this film is that it is called 'I.D'. The actual period in which it was set is the early 90's, so why oh why do you have 'hooligans' rowing on the terraces? CCTV? Regardless of that why are the 'hooligans' actually wearing club colours, by the 80's everyone was in casual wear and club colours were not allowed. The scenes in the 'rock' with the guy eating fire are totally laughable, what was that all about? (the fire eating I mean). I originally purchased this film on video from a well known chain store without first seeking any kind of recommendation. I must say I laughed and then I winced at was was factually wrong. The landlord of the 'rock' "been in prison", surely he would have lost his liquor licence and his job??? All I will say is that if you are going to do a film about football violence then at least do your research first. Terribly inaccurate film!!!
