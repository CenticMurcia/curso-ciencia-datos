I got this movie by doing a search of Piper Perabo movies, trying to find something as good as Imagine Me & You, which I saw her in. So far I have been striking out. This movie was no help. Perabo is awful here, with a very poor accent and bad acting. That said, there was no one else in the picture worth checking out. The script was bad. The premise was tired. We've seen it all before, done better.<br /><br />But above all, this teen comedy does something that makes all other consideration moot, it is not funny. It's not even interesting! Actually, it is just annoying.<br /><br />A great movie to MISS.
