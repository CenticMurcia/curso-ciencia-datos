Excellent movie about the Cold war. It exposes, little by little, step by step, the inhumanity and constant terror/murder tactics the communist regime in Russia used to maintain itself in power.<br /><br />The same model was followed by the communist regimes in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states once these countries were occupied by the Soviet army after World War two.<br /><br />To people living in Western democracies many of the facts the movie shows may seem unbelievable, but they are completely true.<br /><br />Historians even today cannot agree on the total number of people who lost their lives in the Soviet Union in the '30s and '40s and '50s, but the minimum number everyone seems to accept is 10 million people. Not POW's, not foreigners, but Russians (both peasants and city dwellers) who happened to come to the attention of the KGB due to some comment made while talking to friends or, even better, due to some anonymous letter denouncing them as 'traitors to the communist state'. Their homes confiscated, most of them were sent to prisons or camps (Siberia) from where nobody ever returned.<br /><br />The same extermination measures were used by Stalin and the KGB against American citizens who had emigrated in the U.R.S.S. at the height of the Depression in the 1930's in search of jobs. There is a very good documentary on the subject which airs once in a while on the Canadian History channel.<br /><br />Given all these historical facts, it is grotesque to see today all the trouble the Russian state goes to in order to construct itself the image of an emerging democracy, when its population is just as terrorized and pauperized as it was 50 years ago.
