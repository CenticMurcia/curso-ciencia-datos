This is truly a great film. Well done by all. Writing, production, acting. Incredible!!!!! I want to see a director's cut on DVD of this film!!!!! Busey was fantastic as Joe Wheeler and Sam Elliott, as always, does a fantastic job. His Bucky O'Neill was very well done. We can never have enough Sam Elliott westerns!!! We need more Sam! I give this film the highest of ratings! It is a must see by all! Thanks to the vision of the great John Milius, we have another film that salutes and pays honor to our veterans! Get this film out on DVD right away!!!!! Uncut, trailers, and the Making of...documentary. All the fans are begging for a DVD of this monumental motion picture!
