I saw this as a small child and even at such a young age, this movie impacted my soul, and I've never forgotten it, nor it's title. I had been looking to purchase the movie for years, however, I found it was never released for VHS or DVD production. I find that to be a travesty because if you don't stumble on a channel playing it somewhere, you'll never see it again, and for some of us that has become the case. I've searched AMC(American Movies Classics) Southest USA schedule for the past year, and TMC (Turner Classic Movies) Southeast USA schedule as well on a monthly basis, to see if they are showing it down here. They have not and are not. I found they have a different movie lineup in other parts of the USA, and have shown this up north I believe. I find this heartbreaking. Apparently the SE has been forgotten. After discovering these channels had aired this movie up north last year, perhaps even this year, according to their website schedule, I sent them numerous emails requesting they please bring the movie down here and show it. Sad to say, my emails have gone unanswered by AMC & TCM both, and they never have. Has anyone taped this, VHS or DVD? Can anyone help? Still hopeful...
