"Dirty" Harry Callahan(Clint Eastwood) is back on the streets of San Francisco. This time he goes after radical Vietnam Veterans who want to take over. They first kill the men for a delivery truck, take all the weapons they could use, killing a guard and a cop at the same time. That cop was Callahan's partner. He gets a new partner which he's not too thrilled to have. A rookie female(Tyne Daly) who happens to be slow at first but has a lot of resilience. In order to get the militants they look up to an all-black group named Uhuru. The leader Mustapha(Albert Popwell), gives out information which is helpful. However, the captain and the mayor captured them, and Callahan tells him where to put his badge. I liked it more when he tells his superior about his "mouthwash ain't making it!" What can you say, the captain's a blow-hard, and the mayor is self-absorbed. Both he and his partner go to Alcatraz for the final confrontation, and it took one bazooka shot to stop the leader. This movie was a lot of fun, I liked the part where Callahan took out the crooks at the liquor store, and the last one got his jewels blitzed. This version has more bang for the buck! 5 stars!
