The successful children's writer Claire Holloway (Gabrielle Anwar) is troubled by scary nightmares and is under psychological treatment. While working out watching television, she sees the landscape of the Rose Marsh Farm in the Westmoreland County, and she notes that the farmhouse is linked to her nightmares. She decides to spend her vacation in the farm, which is located nearby a swamp, and she is haunted by the ghosts of a little girl and a teenage boy inside the house. She is befriended by the local publisher and historian Noah Pitney (Justin Louis) but after a sequence of disturbing visions, she decides to contact the paranormal consultant Geoffry Hunt (Forest Whitaker). Together, they investigate the mystery and disclose a tragedy that happened in the farm about twenty years ago.<br /><br />"The Marsh" is a flawed but entertaining chiller quite underrated in IMDb. The eerie story has a bad screenplay that leaves many unanswered questions and never explains what happened with Claire's parents (I believe they died in an accident based in one dialog); or her relationship with the little girl (was she her friend or sister?); how the little girl was murdered (I believe the boy tried to rape her, there are many evidences); why Mercy was taking care of the girls; did Claire live in the farmhouse?; how could she completely suppress her childhood from her memory?; what kind of portal was opened in the room? last but not the least, the incident in the beginning of the Twentieth Century has nothing to do with the plot, is just presented to confuse the viewer. Anyway, disregarding these flaws, this film is above average in the genre. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Not Available"
