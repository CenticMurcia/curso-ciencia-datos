Heavy-handed but well-mounted, this early King Vidor film would have us believe that all that is needed to bring Christianity to cattle rustlers is to win their respect. Vidor mixes sentimentality and excitement a little ham-handedly, as when Colleen Moore regains the use of her legs so she can drag the unconscious John Bowers from the burning church. On the other hand, some of the scenes -- as when John Bowers stands off a herd of stampeding cattle so they won't trample the obvious dummy standing in for Colleen Moore stand up very well. David Butler, later to be a major director of musical comedies, has the second lead and Miss Moore never looked lovelier.
