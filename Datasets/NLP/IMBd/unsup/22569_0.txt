Having read a fair amount about the Holocaust and having visited the memorial in DC, as well as seeing other films depicting this time period, I wasn't sure what to expect. However, I thought this movie was extremely well-done. Robin Williams was perfect in his role as Jakob, a latkah vendor, who pretends to have a radio and distribute good news to other Jews in the ghetto. Both sad and funny, this movie is well worth seeing.
