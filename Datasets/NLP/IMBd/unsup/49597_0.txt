As an avid fan of fantasy and adventure, I had extremely high hopes for Kull. I went in, with the thoughts of Willow (Arguably the best fantasy film ever made), and discovered two things. One, the theatre charged way too much for crappy movies and two, the movie's horrible. Kevin Sorbo plays Kull of Atlantis who joins a noble army and ends being King and also ends up being part of an intricate plot to revive some ancient demoness. I read somewhere that Kull, before its release, was edited countless times from a new director. Well that basically destoys the movie. There were more holes in the plot then there are in the Moon and none of the characters really develops in the movie. Tia plays an unconvincing villain, with little depth, and with cliche lines. The rest of the cast just drags along with the boring and overused plot. The only redeeming quality of the film are its sets. Otherwise I would give it a 1. The movie more than deserves my 3 rating.
