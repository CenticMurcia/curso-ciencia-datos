This film is absolutely awful and a good example of what dire straits the horror genre was in around this time. It's got the stock characters of the bullied nerd and the cruel gang of'punks' that pick on him and an abysmal storyline about a horoscope phone line that kills people; and that the recorded message talks directly to the characters doesn't phase them at all.I had the misfortune to sit through this some time ago so cant remember too much about it, but I suppose that's my point. You may think this is a 'funny' bad film , but in fact its just plain boring. It was dragging on and on at snails pace punctuated by a series non shocking/exciting moments and when I looked at the clock I couldn't believe it had only been on for 45 minutes. I'm always one for sitting out a bad film but decided to cut my losses and go to bed. OK, I know this isn't much of a review as I haven't actually watched it all, but this isn't much of a film either and unless its got the biggest midway change since 'The Jazz Singer' then I can safely say don't watch this film.
