This is one of those films, which if you completely enjoy, is as much fun to see over and over as it was initially.<br /><br />It is simply a perfectly enjoyable and humorous piece of entertainment.<br /><br />The two primary leads, the two young defendants, the main co-stars (judge, prosecutor, sheriff) and the other cast, are all excellent.<br /><br />One of the best features as the story was presented is that every character seemed to contribute to its humor (e.g. the prosecutor, judge, other defense attorney, sheriff, witnesses) as well as Pesci and Tomei. So often in this type of film, there are either some characters/situations which cause lulls in the story, or the writers/directors give all the "good stuff" to the main star(s). Not so here.<br /><br />The many prior comments here have covered the plot line amply. <br /><br />For anyone who may come across this one, if you haven't seen this film, rent it, buy it or see it the next time it's listed in a directory.
