How to make SATURN 3: mix a little ALIEN, a little SILENT RUNNING, a little DEMON SEED and then burn it in the oven. Kirk Douglas and Farrah Fawcett man a space station on one of the rings of Saturn --- for what purpose is anyone's guess. They take pep pills and exercise a lot. Their new-age Eden is invaded by psycho Harvey Keitel who unleashes a horny robot on them. Douglas and Keitel fight and the robot, named Hector, takes a shine to Fawcett. This is a terrible movie. It's surely the worst thing ever directed by the once great Stanley Donen. Poor visual effects and the inexplicable fact that Keitel's voice was dubbed by a British actor add to the movie's overall cheesiness.
