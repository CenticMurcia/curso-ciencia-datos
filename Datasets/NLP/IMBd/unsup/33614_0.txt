Supposedly a prequel to The Art Of War and Art Of War II, the third installment in the "franchise" is basically the same old thing as the others minus any real backstory that a prequel should have. Guy falls in love with girl, girl ends up backstabbing him, some convoluted government plot featuring the USA and other foreign countries, and lots of shooting and martial arts. That's basically it. <br /><br />(But wait, there is a twist to all of this - this isn't a prequel! That's right, it's just a sequel that doesn't have anything to do with the other two movies, with Snipes being replaced by Treach due to his jail time. Yeah.)<br /><br />Liked the DTV sequel to the first Art Of War? Then maybe you will enjoy this one. Maybe. The choreography in the fights is alright, but the shootout sequences are horribly done, and at some points, hilarious. And yes, Sung Hi Lee is in this, but she doesn't show no tatas. So yeah, this Art Of War doesn't have any tits. Anyways, eh, acting! Yes! It is as you'd expect. Passable and at some points pretty bad. Treach is the doing the best hip hop expression he always does, and the supporting cast was eh, passable. Overall, heed the aforementioned. Only see this depending on your enjoyment of Art Of War II. Anyways, I will finish my review with a meaningful passage from Sun Tzu:<br /><br />"STOP QUOTING ME IN MOVIES GODDAMN IT."
