A film about the fight against the traps of past, the search of gestures sense and about the truth like puzzle. A story about the dreams, guilty and death. A strange travel in the days of a past who may be yours with the nuances of other person. The interpretation of Ryan Philippe is impressive. Powerful and subtle, it create the forms of fear and hope, touch of reality and rebirth of events. The subject is old and the science to build a new image of theme is impressive. Ambiguous and clear in same time, game and dramatic discover of yourself, bones of recollections and dreams in the cells of lost life, love as ridiculous fragments of lost pictures, a wife, a brother, a car accident, some words. And the rooms of a hospital, the details of ambiguous sin, the details and the faces in a huge mirror. <br /><br />The life as possibility. The rules of a sin. And the sleep in far year.
