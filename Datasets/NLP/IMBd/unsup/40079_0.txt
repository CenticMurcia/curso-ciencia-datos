Possibly the most tedious war melodrama ever made. Long, empty scenes. From a long, empty script. Cate Blanchett is an interesting looking woman, no doubt. But I think about half the running time of the film was composed of close-ups featuring her amazingly limited acting range: from nervous all the way to tremulous. After about twenty minutes, I just grew tired of looking at her. And in this film, she's about all there is.<br /><br />Not one moment of this whole tortured mess felt genuine. But, hey, the scenery was great. So one has to give France AND the second unit its props.
