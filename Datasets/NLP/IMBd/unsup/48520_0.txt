Recap: Jane is an aspiring actress. Nah, check that, Jane is a girl who tries to get some acting jobs between smoking weed. So why not start the morning with a fresh batch? And then accidentally eat a lot more? Not a good way to start your day if you must make an audition, pay your bills and pay back your dealer. Jane sincerely tries to save the day, but she is just horrible at it. And high.<br /><br />Comments: Anna Faris is cute, sure, but having her stumbling through an entire movie with her mouth open just doesn't make a great story. Or movie. And basically, that's the entire idea. Jane's fumbles get her from bad to worse consistently, and I just wished she would learn to hut her mouth.<br /><br />Having read some comments about it, many (note, not all) that think its great seem to have one thing in common. They seem to have personal experience of using drugs and overdosing on weed. And that might just be the trick, maybe you need to be stoned to appreciate this movie.<br /><br />The movie does have a few bright moments though, mostly in Jane's visions and comments to them. Some scenes were actually funny. But way to few and too far between to save the movie. And Jane couldn't keep her mouth shut then either (yes, this really disturbed me).<br /><br />To conclude, this movie was really horrible. Danny Masterson's talent is completely wasted as he has an annoyingly small part just looking angry. And yes, he does one more thing, but that's just distasteful. I really wonder what made him agree to make this movie. I haven't seen much if Faris' other work, but what I've seen is that she can do much better than this. Wouldn't surprise me if everybody involved is ashamed of it today. They should be.<br /><br />2/10
