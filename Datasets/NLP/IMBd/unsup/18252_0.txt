In the final, wonderful shot of QUEEN CHRISTINA, Rouben Mamoulian directed Garbo to think of absolutely nothing as the camera slowly zooms in on her perfectly lit face. The result is that the viewer projects a multitude of emotions on that face. It seems that Louis Malle must have given all of the actors in Pretty Baby the same direction! If I had had any emotional connection to the story of a 12 year old whore, it might have worked; unfortunately, i really didn't care, and so the results were downright dull. The sole survivor is Susan Sarandon, whose magnificent eyes pour out emotions like a waterfall despite her lack of facial expression. Pass this film by; it's a dud.
