An African expedition intends to collect animals for zooery, which angers animal rights advocate Glenn Morris (as Tarzan). Eleanor Holm (as Eleanor aka Ellen) adds femininity to the casting expedition; of course, she catches Mr. Morris' eye. Morris, like Johnny Weissmuller, was an Olympic star; he looks great in the loincloth, but doesn't play either the Weissmuller or Edgar Rice Burroughs version of the "Tarzan" character very well. Ms. Holm was also an athlete; and, although she swims and cavorts wonderfully, she can't lift herself out of a shallow pool! Hedda Hopper (as Penny) and Cheetah (uncredited) provide support (and are supported). "Tarzan's Revenge" provided filmgoers with second-rate Tarzan fare, during a nearly three year wait between Weissmuller movies. <br /><br />*** Tarzan's Revenge (1/7/38) D.
