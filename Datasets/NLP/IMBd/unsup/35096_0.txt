The ugliest cast in the world squares of against blood worms turned ravenous man killers by lightning strikes. A Richie Cunningham lookalike travels to a southern swamp to meet up with his hot babe that looks a lot like ...well, Richie Cunningham. She's got a busted bean pole of a sister who acts as bizarre as she is ugly. They have a haggard mother who catches the vapors every 12.5 minutes and they all live next door to a worm farm(that figures)which is run by a skeleton named Mr. Beardsley and his hired hand Roger. Roger is a bonafied piece of work, a hulking dim wit who gets to blubber immortal lines like, "Weee hooo itsa gunna be a soooprise!" and "Uh huh uh uh now you gunna be da wormface". The movies best line though is handled by the stereotypically oblivious and prejudice backwoods sheriff. This gem of a character fornicates in his own jail cells and bullies our wimpy hero every chance he gets. When he threatens our flannel clad Richie Cunningham he says something along the lines of "You wont even get youself a phone call....cuz all the phones is dead!" I tell ya folks you gotta see and hear this brilliant script writing for yourselves. I almost forgot to mention the action and suspense scenes. When hero burglarizes a dentists office you'll be on the edge of your seat and later when he gets beat up by a flying sheet of plywood? Man oh man! You'll actually be surprised that for all the riffing Squirm is not even as close to ridiculous as the premise would make it sound. As far as the "nature goes icky bingo and turns on mankind" genre goes you could do way worse than Squirm. I do however dare you to find a movie with a more unattractive cast.
