Who wrote the character of Hasan into the plot? Thats the hammiest performance ever from anyone - the actor looks like he is out of a school play - no, I take it back - I have seen child actors perform with more intensity in school plays. <br /><br />And who cast Peeya Rai Chowdhuri? She definitely needed Rita Koiral to dub for her shrill voice which made it hard to understand (and along with that forced accent) three quarters of what she was trying to say. <br /><br />What was the director thinking when he put these two amateurs in the team that had Soumitra Chatterjee, Victor Banerjee and Mamata Shankar in its revered cast ? <br /><br />And then the beer. You think there will be a sober moment, but no! everyone was drinking and driving and was making merry throughout the time that would not pass as fast as I would want it to, but my friends kept assuring me this will get better. <br /><br />The only scene that was an original was Apu washing his hair instead of his mouth after throwing up in front of the girl he was trying to charm and that too, right before they started having that mouth-to- mouth kiss. Interesting ... but it would really have helped to spread the word on hygiene had Apu washed his mouth before kissing this chic.<br /><br />And then the title soundtrack - could it not have been lifted from George Michael's 'Faith' to that extent? Did it not suffice that Mr. Tagore's songs were completely twisted into the new generation theme tune?<br /><br />Bong Connection failed to connect with me but maybe in some weird ways, there are taxi drivers who happen to have two girlfriends and a relaxed life while driving cabs to make money and maybe there are white American wives whose only job is to deliver drinks to her husband and their guests from morning.<br /><br />Oh and why was everyone so bitter everywhere? Guess the alcoholism was not helping cool any of them. Perhaps next time Mr. Dutt should use some marijuana instead of beer and chill the characters.
