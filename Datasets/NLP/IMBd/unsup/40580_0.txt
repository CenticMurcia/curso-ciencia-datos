"Falling Like This" is a jiggle-cam no-budget indie loser not worth the time. The flick has no story, no point, no purpose, no moral, no message, and comes off like a bad class project. What is supposed to be a slice of life flick about a couple of rebellious teens goes something like..see the kids take a bath, see them drive a truck off a cliff, see them play darts and look at the sky and drink beer and get busted and hang out and pitch a fit and go to juvi and...yada, yada, yada. If you want to watch amateurish films, there are much better amateurish films than this on late night t.v.
