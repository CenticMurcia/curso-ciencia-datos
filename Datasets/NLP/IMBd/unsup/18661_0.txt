i absolutely loved this movie. i especially loved the scenes when they were trying to work a scene. i've been in many plays and watching those scenes was like deja vu. if you haven't seen this movie, you must. it is a movie for the actor. if you've never acted in a play or anything at all, you probably won't appreciate it as much.however, if you have, it's an absolutely orgasmic experience. this is what i would consider a diamond in the rough movie. you won't hear about it unless you search for it. towards the end of the movie, it does tend to skew from the facts. it starts to show more contemporary acting, instead of using the acting style of the time period. honestly, if this does not bother you, watch this movie.
