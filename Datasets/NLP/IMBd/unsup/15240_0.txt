I've watched just about everything there is to watch for the last 25 years and this is my favorite out of all of it. That's saying something.<br /><br />Out of all of the televisions shows that were canceled well before their time, the cancellation of this show makes me the angriest (firefly is high on that list as well).<br /><br />I have never had a stronger sense of connection with a work of art. It speaks to me. It speaks to my soul.<br /><br />Bear in mind that I was in high school about the same time that this story takes place, I am about the same age (and gender) as the show's creators, and I also grew up in the same area, at least the same area as Judd Apatow, the executive producer. I am also a freak and a geek watching a show that is basically a love letter to freaks and geeks. In many senses, I am the target demographic. Not only that, because I am smack in the middle of Generation X, I am very very rarely the target demographic, making times when I am the target demographic extremely special. This is one of those times.<br /><br />I know, everyone and their brother is head over heels in love with this show and my glowing praise is just a single drop in a sea of glowing praise. It doesn't make a difference. I love this show and will always love this show. I will scream it from the mountain tops.<br /><br />I love this show.
