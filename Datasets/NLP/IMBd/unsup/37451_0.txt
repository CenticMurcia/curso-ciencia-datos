I have seen this movie about a week ago.And I can honestly say I never seen worst movie in my life!!I wouldn't recommend it even if it's the last movie you have.The plot is simple and I was able to make up what is going to happen next, and you know what I was right.I'm not going to write anything about the story itself because there is nothing to write about!!The one thing I'm going to say is that this is the first movie I couldn't stand and turned it off before the end!!Actors are trying very hard to make it work but there is nothing they could do to save this movie.For real, even if Bruce Willis,Al Pacino or Jack Nicolson were playing one of the main characters I wouldn't gave it one more star.
