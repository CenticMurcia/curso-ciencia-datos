It was wonderful of Fran Drescher to open up her spectacular Malibu home to hold a reunion for the much loved,and never forgotten characters of the hit sitcom The Nanny.Although Fran still has that somewhat annoying,thick Queens accent,her appearance has dramatically changed since the Nanny.However,with long straight black hair,and style still in tact,Fran Drescher makes the 40's look fabulous,and was the gracious host for 'A Nosh to Remember' A must-see for all fans of the Nanny. All actors from the Nanny were present except for Daniel Davis (Niles the Butler) who unfortunately couldn't make it.His absence was noticeable too.The stars had a meal together on the balcony overlooking Malibu beach,as they reflected on memorable moments from the show.It was a real treat to see Maggie,Brighton and Gracie all grown up and it was obvious that the actors truly formed long lasting friendships during the series that remain in their hearts.It was wonderful to see the cast all together again,and great to see hilarious and 'special' Nanny moments relived again.
