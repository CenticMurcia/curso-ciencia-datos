This movie was so important to me as a teenager. It was very empowering. I have visited New York City several times now due to my interest that was kindled by this movie. I started looking for it on DVD literally 2 weeks before it was released and was thrilled to find it available. A reunion of some sort would be well received I am sure. They are making me submit at least ten lines so I am filling those up with more accolades for the movie, I love this movie yeah yeah yeah. <br /><br />The soundtrack is amazing...I have it on cassette and have recreated most of it from Napster. Hello Robin and Trini where ever you are..thank you.
