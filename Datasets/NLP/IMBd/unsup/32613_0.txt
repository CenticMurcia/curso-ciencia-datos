watching this film on video, it made me wonder "my god, could ANYONE give his money to see it at a theather???!!!" i mean, who on earth would do such a thing?the scenario is simply so out of any possible reality, the man with the chopped finger sits and STARES all the time, instead of doing anything any man with an actual chopped finger would do! all the money they spent on making it should be givven back to the viewers for standing this suffering!THAT CANNOT BE CALLED CINEMA!
