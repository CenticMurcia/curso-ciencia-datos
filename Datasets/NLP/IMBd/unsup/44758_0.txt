I also received this movie in the mail as a kid and did like it. I came to this site to prove a point to people because these kids in my home town recently decided to start their own "gang" call "The Butter Creamers" i almost died laughing when i heard this. They think its cool and I tried to explain to them how that name is already taken by a hallmark film from my childhood so here i am.<br /><br />My favorite scene was when the old woman fell down and needed help. It reminded me on the "Help I've Fallen and I Can't Get Up!" Life Alert commercials.<br /><br />Enjoy the film!
