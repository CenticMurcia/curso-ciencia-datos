I saw this film at the Asian American Film Festival in San Francisco. I think this new director has a future in film-making. To put up a first feature that is not plot driven or is not a formulaic comedy looking for easy adulation definitely took guts on the director/writer's part. It meant that he was willing to put money on the line (mostly his family's) to make a film that he believed in rather than one he knew would break even or make a small profit.<br /><br />I haven't read the other reviews but seeing that the average was 2.2 when I first brought the rating up was kind of shocking. Then I saw from one of the more recent reviewers that it was sabotage and I can only believe that that is the case. This is deserving of a rating in the 7's. Pay no attention to the 2.2 - that is a fabrication.<br /><br />If I had to articulate why I liked this movie, which is really a character study more than anything else (and I love character studies - maybe it's why, in fine art, I like still lives, too), it is because it is so true to the characters. There is a review below which says it is like watching a polaroid that never develops. I actually think that might grab the essence of my thoughts, too, but to me that is positive criticism whereas that other reviewer is using it as a negative. It's positive because that conception is the way life is and there is no real need for it TO develop. It is a snapshot of a point in time of the lives of these 4 characters and that, to me, is enough as long as it is done with quality.<br /><br />I was not sure why I liked the movie at first: the dialogue is simplistic, there is no real plot to speak of, and there are no special effects (which I have really come to detest in movies anyway). Afterwards, I realized it was because the situations that the characters were put in and the way they responded to those situations was so true. It wasn't hollywood-ized or contrived in any way. Of course it helps that there were some interesting and intriguing characters along the way (especially Charlotte/Darcy). I was kept rapt by the action because I wanted to find out how each character would respond to each situation presented and, in every case, it was so natural and easy and, most important of all, believable, that it was gratifying to watch. That is a testament not only to Eric Byler's direction but his writing as well.<br /><br />I hope Mr. Byler doesn't sell out and that he continues along this path. It renews my faith in movie-going that young directors are able to create films like this. This is not a perfect movie but it is certainly cast in the right direction. I hope to see more from this director and I suspect I will not be disappointed.<br /><br />
