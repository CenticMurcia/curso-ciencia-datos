Combat Shock (1986) is a hard-hitting, disturbing film with some very strong scenes, it's about a young man called Frankie who fought in the war, and now hes living back in New York in a slum of an apartment, with his girlfriend and deformed baby!!! Frankie has no job or money to support his family and he also owes money to the local drug lords, Frankie is in a bad way for sure!! We follow Frankie around as he starts to go crazy with visions of the terrible sights he saw in Nam, he wanders aimlessly and thinks about turning to crime in a desperate bid to lead a normal life!!! Combat Shock is actually a Troma film, and it's definitely one of their best, but be warned there is various violence and gory images throughout the movie, and the climax is very disturbing and horrific, be warned!!! I give this movie 7/10, well worth a viewing.
