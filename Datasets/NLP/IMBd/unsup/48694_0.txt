The special effects again are superb but this is Finding Nemo in reverse i.e the parents get taken away and Pi (Nemo) is left behind, if you haven't seen Finding Nemo you will like it.<br /><br />It becomes very clear at the beginning of the film what the plot is and takes a long time to reach the end!<br /><br />There's is nothing new or nail biting in this one and there is no humour at all, which is very disappointing.<br /><br />All in all very disappointing as a follow up movie to Shark Tale which there really are no similarities with it should have been called Finding Nemo 2 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
