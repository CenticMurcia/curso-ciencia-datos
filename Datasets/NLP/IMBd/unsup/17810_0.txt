awful......just awful. For a start the digital video camera is not a steadicam, and even if she was joking ITS NOT FUNNY!! the script consists of stolen Cannibal Holocaust lines and images with the main part being a swamp of incoherent crap that only the most messed up mind could comprehend and think is slightly decent. this film also contains some of the lamest picture in picture effects I've ever seen. with its token 80's porn soundtrack and English dubbed over English this film has made me realize that some movies need to be sunk below a 1 grade on the voting scale. and for some strange reason everyone keeps talking to the camera even the people that aren't in the jungle i.e DIGBY. this film makes no sense what-so-ever as the start of the movie portrays the jumping of time between past and present-i mean seriously WTF?!?! to make it even more awful is the 2minute appearance of the German priest that introduces us to the guide Garcia. (with the wonderful crash zoom intro). the acting was great..............for a low grade cheesy basement porno. to sum this movie up in a few words let me travel back "3 mouthes ago"<br /><br />awful.....just awful!!
