Movies like this... I don't know. Usually I don't watch this kind of movies (ahem... I have a few more odd movies in my collection), except when an actor that I like is in it. Just like this one. Tom McCamus is a very talented actor, and in a few weeks of hanging around on the internet with Tom McCamus fans, it's hard not to become one yourself. So, I'm game. <br /><br />They say that this is the movie that got Tom McCamus his role as Mason Eckhart in Mutant X. Tom McCamus plays Dr. Clerval. According to me a mixture of Adam Kane (because of his arrogance) and Mason Eckhart (just.. the voice, the glare, the movements... wow).<br /><br />The lightning is great, the acting is magnificent, especially by Tom McCamus. That man can do a lot with just one look or the tone of his voice. The 2 other actors, Lucy Akhurst and Stephen Moyer are so and so. Stephen Moyer's character is just... annoying and Lucy Akhurst plays the role of the tormented and lost Schiller well. The soundtrack is neat, and the movie shows that you can do a lot with one subject only. <br /><br />It got me on the edge of my seat all the time. I loved it.<br /><br />The weird thing is that the movie hasn't been released on DVD overseas, but in a small country like Holland (and Belgium). (Come on Fireworks! Release it already the proper way!)
