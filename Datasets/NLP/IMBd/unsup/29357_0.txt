I saw this on the box a couple of weeks back, one of BBC2's occasional late night horror showings. It appears less often than Hammers output or other more famous British horrors so it was a first time viewing for me and I enjoyed it a good deal. The plot is pretty neat and the setting is ace, with treasure seeking archaeologists heading to an accursed island where murders have recently taken place. Predictably enough, they are not alone... The alternate versions listing for the film mentions that the film was somewhat trimmed for its original release which is unsurprising, since the film has a nice amount of bloodshed for a British film of the period, as well as some nudity and even a spot of entertaining thrusting sex. Fortunately its gets shown uncut on television and though it doesn't have any spectacular content, its still pretty toothsome stuff. Sadly the writing and acting aren't much good which makes for a few moments of unintentional humour, with Gary Hamilton perhaps the worst acting wise and Robin Askwith and Derek Fowlds (Bernard from Yes Minister and Yes Prime Minister) the best. The opening 20 minutes, before the expedition is underway, are the most striking, with colorful touches and a slightly wacky approach that the film later loses, though there is good smattering of creepy moments and everything mounts to a pretty fun finale. So all in all its no classic, but with attractive women, a good mood and an ample dose of neat and sometimes even shocking moments, its a worthy piece of old fashioned and shonky good times, worth checking out for British horror enthusiasts or 70's low budget lovers I'd say.
