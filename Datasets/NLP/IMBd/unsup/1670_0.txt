What an excellent film. I was rather surprised, it being one of the few Fred Astaire musicals I had never seen and recently reading some adverse comment to the effect that it was for the completist only! Heresy, I say for this is possibly Ginger Rogers' best performance and for that matter one of Astaire's best too. She is fresh faced, funny and very happy to dance. He seems spontaneous, sings and does not show off like he may in some other films of his. Also, mercy me, I didn't know that Irene Dunne had a voice like that. Perhaps it seems odd that she should be singing a lullaby but never mind she signs it beautifully, two or three times and as for the famous rendition of Smoke Gets In Your Eyes, worth as they say the price of admission alone. As well as all that we have the costumes. Some splendid, some silly but what a variety. Interesting that the most sexy one is considered inappropriate but |I found it difficult to properly work that out with this being a 30s film supposedly set in the 20s. Anyway all good stuff. Tremendous entertainment.
