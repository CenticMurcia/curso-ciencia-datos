William Nigh directs this early 40's madcap comedy. Morey Amsterdam's screenplay is cleverly funny and somewhat witty. The 56 minute film is fast paced with hardly a scene wasted. Newlyweds Webster(James Dunn)and 'Jackie'(Florence Rice)spend their honeymoon in an old country home. Along with a nervous chauffeur(Sam McDaniel)the couple meets the town's executioner who has a fixation with nooses. Even before getting to settle in; a coffin arrives carrying the former owner and the spooked couple call the police. When the Police Chief(Jim Toney)arrives it is discovered the coffin is now empty. Before this situation can be dealt with along comes the believed "deceased's" next of kin and a gang of jewel thieves trying to find a fortune in diamonds hidden in the house. This all becomes fodder for Police Chief Bagwell's attempts at writing pulp fiction. Dunn's stupidity is somewhat funny; but McDaniel(the chauffeur)steals the show. Also in the cast are: Robert Bice, Eddy Chandler, Robert Dudley and Tony Ward.
