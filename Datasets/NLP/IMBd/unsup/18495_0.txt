1920's man snacks the 90's world in the face with great throw back one-liners and style. I found the premise of this movie very comical. It offers a mix of the old black and white films style meshed against modern day morality. I thoroughly enjoyed watching Johnny Tweenies interact with modern day thugs. How would Jimmy Cagne fair in modern day gangster land? This movie,in my humble opinion, would most likely gain acceptance with an older crowd, such as early baby boomers, like myself, in that we remember the great black and white films where special effects were absent and acting was paramount. A bit wacky, but still a nice little throwback. Relax and have fun with this movie.
