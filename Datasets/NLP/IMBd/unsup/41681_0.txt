most embarrassing example of careless editing/shooting i've ever seen for a studio release.<br /><br />the boom mic is visible in at least 30 shots throughout the "film," nullifying the effect of some admittedly-creative camera work.<br /><br />as the entire theatre murmured and snickered every time the mic dangled in and out of the frame, i couldn't help but wonder how any exec (let alone antonio banderas) could allow such an oversight to go to release.<br /><br />typical "dangerous minds," "sister act 2"-type clich√©s...<br /><br />but what do you expect, i suppose.<br /><br />the pace of the movie is curious, as it lingers in some dull spots, yet fast-forwards ahead, turning rookies to professional-calibre tango dancers in about 8 minutes.<br /><br />yeah, yeah...my girlfriend wanted me to see it with her.
