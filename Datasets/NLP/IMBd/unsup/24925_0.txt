I saw Song of Norway as a child, in all its magnificence, in 70mm with 6-track sound. I saw it every time it returned for "morning shows" (until the print's color had well and truly faded) and have never forgotten it. The last time was more than 25 years ago. I cant understand why so many people find it "awful". Or maybe I can --- it demands a certain "innocence" and a surrender to sentiment that most adults today are uncomfortable with. What's not to like? It has Grieg's soaring music, stunning cinematography, decent unpretentious acting, gorgeous locales and a certain epic "sweep" sadly lacking in today's soul-less blockbusters, which seem false and contrived in comparison. I believe it was available briefly on DVD in an edited and utterly execrable transfer that did no justice at all to the film's visual and sonic glories. But who has the rights now? Will they please PLEASE restore and release this lovely film on DVD (and perhaps even Blu-Ray) in a presentation worthy of posterity?
