"Pound" may be the funniest movie ever made. So far as I know, it's not available on DVD or tape. But if you get a chance to see it, by all means do so. The usual cast of brilliant Downey character actors deliver some of the edgiest lines ever to grace the screen. As with "Putney Swope", its only drawback is that the audience is laughing so hard it may be difficult to hear the dialog.<br /><br />Antonia Fargas, in a track suit, stars as The Grayhound. As he reminisces about his Florida racing days, a winner of the Tampa Tropicana ("Brang home the bacon, I did."), we see two other "dogs" furiously masturbating in a corner. One says over his shoulder, "Excuse me...but I need to give myself a quick jerk." Downey's son, Robert Downey, Jr., appears in the movie at the age of three or four, as a puppy. The brilliant dialog, delivered by a brilliant cast, make this an ideal movie for anarchists. Republicans may not get it.
