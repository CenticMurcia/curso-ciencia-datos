Robin Hood, Elizabeth and Essex, They Died With Their Boots On -- add these to this movie, and you have a great combination. Errol Flynn was always so handsome and charming. Wish he could have lived forever. It is so wonderful that his images can be preserved in these excellent films.<br /><br />Yes, Don Juan was the great lover. He also had to be a great politician, what with dealing with kings, courtiers and husbands. If I were a movie director, and could get Errol Flynn to act for me in a leading man role, I know I could get a great performance out of him every time. RIP, Errol. You were the best.<br /><br />12/10
