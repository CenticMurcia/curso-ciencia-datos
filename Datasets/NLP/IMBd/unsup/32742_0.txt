Well, my husband and I are both avid EARTHSEA fans - fans of the books, that is ... this mini-series was so horrid, it was almost funny. The only resemblance to the books was the names of the characters and the setting - other than that - the storyline was trashed. MOST of the characters were badly miscast and only bore a lightly tainted resemblance to the characters created in the books. If you have NOT read LeGuin's Earthsea Trilogy, you might enjoy this mini-series **MIGHT** since you will have nothing to base your disfavor on besides stiff acting and predictable plot-line... If you HAVE read the trilogy, PLEASE do yourself a favor and watch something else - or re-read the books - or take a nap - anything! It left such a bad taste in my mouth, I'm going to have to RE-read the books myself, just to be able to return to an untainted version of Earthsea. bad, bad, bad
