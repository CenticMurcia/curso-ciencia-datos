I attended the Gala presentation of Arcand's Stardom at the Toronto Film Festival last night and was so disappointed I felt myself getting angrier and angrier for wasting my time through this cliche critique of the supermodel world.<br /><br />It was unoriginal, uninspired and totally uninteresting.<br /><br />I am repeatedly dismayed by my fellow Canadians who champion this sort of crap just because it is Canadian.<br /><br />If you hated other films like Cronenberg's M Butterfly, Egoyan's Exotica, Whale Music, and other Canadian films that were over-hyped, well....you can add this to the list.<br /><br />It is a stinker and deserves the Raspberry.<br /><br />No point in outlining the plot -- it's so predictable and one-dimensional. I'm too embarrassed to introduce you to the characters which never develop, are cliche stock characters portrayed by a series of displays of incredibly bad acting.<br /><br />Ouch.
