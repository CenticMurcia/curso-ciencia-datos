I love this spoof of alien movies. The cast was excellent, especially Craig Peck as the nerdy guy who knows there is something out there. He had the best lines, and even though at times he was a little too winy, he was the most likable of the bunch.<br /><br />In this one ALL the lead actresses take their clothes off, and two of the guys too (I could have done without the hairy ass shot).The alien creature was very funny looking, not scary at all, the effects were somewhat poor, but I still love this film.<br /><br />It has something that appeals to me, I don't know if its the girls (they all are so hot) or simply because is a very funny film.
