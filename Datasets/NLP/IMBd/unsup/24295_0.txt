Hilarious, hysterical, violent, satire.. These are just some of the words I use to describe Robot Chicken. I love the style of Robot Chicken, how it uses stop-motion animation and turn it into something random and violent. I love how it satires movies, and sometimes recent events.<br /><br />The only thing that would make me offended by the show is if they made a parody of Hurricane Katrina, but I still wouldn't stop watching the show. I love how when someone screams, their eyes are wide and their mouth. It goes good with the show. I also love how people in the show seem so violent for absolutely no reason such as the Flintstones sketch. It was so random how Fred killed everyone for no reason. I also love the sketch of Scooby Doo and Jason. It was just so funny, also in the end when Velma loses her virginity to him.<br /><br />I recommend this episode if you love shows that satires everything. I also recommend it if you like random violence on shows.
