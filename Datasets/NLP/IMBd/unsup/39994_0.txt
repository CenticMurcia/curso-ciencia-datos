This is my first review ever, what a way to start where no one has posted anything yet so here it goes. without knowing much by the DVD cover i didn't know what to expect even though it said "in the vein of dawn of the dead, Shaun of the dead as well as other zombie movies." so i said hey why not it's only $11.00, but after viewing it i think i should have waited a little longer. <br /><br />The story involves a group of friends going to Mexico to surf at an abandoned beach, getting their they find no one is there, so what do they do strip down and surf and have a sex filled week (more on the line of a teenage boy surfing through porn) you get to see the only girl you want to see topless. later when one vanishes they look to find his video camera lying on the beach (farther away then he dropped it.) to see something grabbed him, and try to figure out where Colin's brother went to, then the rest of the movie is pretty much a tale of terror where Javier and the girl with him (forgot name) get information about the past of the beach by a store clerk, where this man and followers lived on the beach and prayed to god for (I think) entry, they never ate real food just what the tide would bring in until one day he brings food and everyone devours it, then they realize he was bringing children from town, well they get man and do a horrendous act by placing him in the sand with his head out and cut his eyelids off while facing the sun, as he was there he prayed for help, but got the wrong religious man, but took the offer so he could take revenge on anyone who comes near his beach. when the corpses of fellow boarders come back to life they do what "kill" which isn't much of a climax, after a few die only two are left to leave and fight off the dead (which is choppy by how the camera is moving so fast to catch all the action)none the less once they leave on the dirt bike which was left there they meet the pact leader to decide there fate. <br /><br />This is a well put together movie with a decent amount of blood, some nudity, and it's a zombie flick but the bad thing is it gets old fast they all have the mind of a 12 year old, with to much sex related humor, and the acting is so-so, its decent but not a must maybe a rental instead.4/10
