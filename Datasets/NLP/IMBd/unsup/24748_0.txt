We have a tendency here in the United States to homoginize prisoners with grey or orange jumpsuits, given them a number, and put them into a regimented lifestyle outside of society. By doing this we forget that they are too human as we are. Carandiru is literally a world within a world. Full of its own characters. All aware of but able to be a part of an outside world.<br /><br />In this world, there is not direct control from state imposed leader. The prisoners find their own leaders and make their own rules.<br /><br />So, this is Carandiru, a Detention Center in Sao Paulo, Brazil. It was built to house no more than 3000 inmates, but at its peak held over 7000. This film is based on the story told by a doctor who, every monday, went to the prison to provide free medical care. In October of 1992, a riot broke out. The police were called in. In the aftermath, 111 prisoners were dead. That the simple history.<br /><br />The story is almost in told in 2 parts, the first about the prisoners, and about life in the prison. The second part is the storming of the prison by the police. Although it flows pretty well, the feel and sytle of the film seem to change in the second half. No longer is it about the characters, but what is happening to the prison on a whole. The characters become bystanders.<br /><br />The film portrays the characters as they are. They are not judged for what they have done. They are just shown for who they are. The doctor, who in a sense tells this story, made a point not to pass judgement for what they did.<br /><br />Overall, the film is incredible. When i saw the film, the director was avialable afterwards to answer questions of the audience. He provided some interesting insight to how the film was made, and the world of Carandiru. In December of 2002, after all the inmates were tranfered, Carandiru was demolished. That is the final sequence of the film. 9/10
