Some films have it all. This doesn't. It opens quite ok, a bunch of friends gathered for a wedding. But very soon the movie hits the unthinkable level. I like strange movies, but they have to be somewhat logical, to the characters at least, but there are too many unthinkable, unbelievable actions taken in this movie:<br /><br />** SPOILERS BELOW ** READ IT, DON'T SEE THE FILM<br /><br />1) The robber "Hamlet" has to rob the bank on his friends wedding day. Stupid, unnecessary, risky<br /><br />2) When Buzz comes storming in, he removes his hood, and the two guys uses their real names. Stupid.<br /><br />3) The other guys drop by, no other person attempts to enter the bank, only these guys, although the bank is full of people. Unlikely.<br /><br />4) The helicopter pilot all of a sudden gets his hands on a Lynx? My god, he is a lunatic who got fired from the army, no chance in hell is he gonna get his hands on an army helicopter!<br /><br />This movie sucks, and I regret staying up to see it.<br /><br />
