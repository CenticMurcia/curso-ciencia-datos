Continuing on with my very slow motion Johnny Stockwell Film Festival (i.e. i see one of his movies every few months)...<br /><br />Hmmm... obviously someone had some wild idea for a movie, managed to attract some naive and gullible investors, found some actors who were in desperate need of a paycheck, and voil√†, this came into being!<br /><br />I'm writing this review as i watch this movie. I'm about a third of the way through, and so far, i have absolutely no idea what it's purpose is supposed to be. None of it has made any particular sense.<br /><br />About the only thing i've really enjoyed is that demented skull motorcycle helmet that Johnny wears. I liked that. It appeals to my deranged sense of humor.<br /><br />And i've recognized "Charlie" (Don Opper) from the "Critters" series. Which leaves me to wondering where Ug is.<br /><br />OK... i'm now a little more than half way through and i'm still clueless as to what it's all about... I've already seriously contemplated turning the movie off because it's so dumb, but i continue on despite all odds to be true to the concept of a Johnny Stockwell Film Festival.<br /><br />Well, i made it to the end credits. As far as i could understand what all the hubbub was about, the baddies were doing Our Heroes wrong. Our Heroes got cranky about that and taught the baddies the error of their ways.<br /><br />I'm not sure, but i may have perhaps seen that plot done in possibly another movie or two. ;)<br /><br />I can't realistically recommend watching this to anyone. It's pretty awful. I watched this from a commercial DVD that apparently was made from a VHS transfer and the VHS tape had degraded badly. Everything was pretty blotchy and fuzzy. Maybe if the movie had imaging that was crisp and clear, it might have been at least a little more bearable. Or, more likely, probably not.
