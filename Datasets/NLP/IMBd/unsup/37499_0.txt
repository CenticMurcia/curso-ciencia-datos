If only The Mists of Avalon had the production resources that Merlin I & II did. Merlin's director should stick to Mutant Ninja Turtle films, and stay away from deep mythological tales. No one should foist this on their children, unless they honestly point out its' major flaws. <br /><br />The Lady of the Lake and Morgan Le Fay can easily be understood as more complex than in this fiasco of a film. Nothing wrong with humor, but this is just plain silly. I really hope that people read The Mists of Avalon (the film couldn't hold the story since it was Hollywood- produced, rather than British) to counteract the bizarre way the stories of Merlin, Arthur, Guinevere, Morgan and the gang are drawn in over-simplified black and white in this 2-part film. All the female characters are either really bad, or good - and dead. <br /><br />Like I said, the only value here is what $$ could buy in effects, costumes, etc. It gets a 1/10 for that. I don't understand why Neil, Carter & Rossellini lent their skills to such nonsense. As the last line in the film says: "This is the end of magic". Thank goodness, this must mean there won't be a sequel.
