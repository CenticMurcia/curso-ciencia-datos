This movie is worthless. You can tell it is a unfinished movie. So they added lots of nudity and flashbacks from American Streetfighter 1 to make it a full length movie. But even with all the added on stuff, it still only runs 72 minutes long. It has nothing to do with the original American Streetfighter, which was a good movie. Not even hardcore Gary Daniels fans should waste their time.
