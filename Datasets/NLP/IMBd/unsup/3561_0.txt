As a Christian I do not really care if Jesus was black, red, brown, white, or any other color. But to suggest that he was persecuted because he was black is not only unfounded (it is not in the Bible), but it is ludicrous. He was persecuted because He was the Son of God: God in the flesh; and to suggest that the motivation was anything else, including His race, is to undermine and dilute the entire message of the Gospel. It is a slap in the face to anyone who believes in Christ. The only aspect of His ethnicity that is pertinent is the fact that He was Jewish: because, according to prophecy the Messiah was be of Israel and to be king David's heir. Jesus came for all mankind and to save all ethnicities and races. He was persecuted and killed for who He was, and not for the color of His skin.
