Where to start? This is my first "review" here, so I apologize if I start to ramble. I saw that SOMEHOW this movie was receiving good review scores and had to come put a stop to it. All in the deed of saving your souls, of course.<br /><br />First off, this movie is even worse than Inferno. For those of you who follow the series like I do, you'll understand just what this means. Yet again, the movie has nothing to do with hell, demons, pain, or psychology. Like Inferno, it again POORLY relies on some kind of "inner mind struggle." Granted, this might be a cool concept but it is just done so wrong.<br /><br />The movie is almost impossible to watch too (not just because it sucks). It's one of those ridiculously stupid "flashback/dream sequence" flicks. You know, where you're watching for 10 minutes, the character wakes up, takes a couple steps forward, then wakes up again 10 minutes earlier. It then tries to piece together the amensia of the main character through flashbacks, but these scenes never add up to any kind of plot/insight because yet again you don't know if the character is dreaming or if it really happened. The flashback never really progresses futher either. Let me just reiterate: I know that previous statement might sound like a good concept (and it could be) but it just was not put together well at all.<br /><br />Gore? There really isn't any. You get a pretty cool lobotomy scene at the beginning, but that's about it. A couple more people die, but it's not violent, gory, or interesting. And yet again, since the character decides to keep dreaming the whole darn movie, the people that die are alive in the next scene.<br /><br />Concerning Pinhead, I really have no idea why Douglas Bradley still does this crap. Like Inferno, he's reduced to nothing and has no thought provoking lines at all. What ever happened to his perfect speeches in Hell on Earth or the best scene in movie history: the mock crucifixtion? To be honest, I turned off the movie with 15 minutes left, so maybe he gets something out of his mouth at the end, but I really didn't see it happening.<br /><br />Cenobites? Again, unless they come out in the last 15 minutes, you see one in a 5 second flash sequence and the other for about .2 seconds.<br /><br />Well, I'm probably running out of space, so I'll sum it up. This movie sucks. It is a blasphemy to anything the Hellraiser series was. The Lament Configuration opens hell and you die, not you open the box then have a headache for an hour and half. It is OBVIOUS that the writer and director of this movie had only seen Inferno when they made this garbage. The only two lines that hearken back to previous flicks I'm sure was just told to them by Ashley Laurence. I mean, there's even little things like Pinhead pulling out one of his nails and there's no maggot at the end (sorry to keep referring to 3, I love the series up to 4). Pinhead has no decent dialogue and the Cenobites are inexistant. The story is stupid, utterly confusing and being smart does not help piece it together any better. Ashley has the leading name in the title credits and is in the movie for about 5 combined minutes. Getting her back really could have made a great movie, but they completely wasted her (she's only in those damn flashbacks which are pretty much the same scene over and over). Shame on all the people that made this movie and I plead all of them to have nothing to do with the next 2 that have been greenlighted. If you possess any intellect at all, do not even rent this movie. If you're one of those people that would give nonsense like this a 10/10, then I just feel sorry for you.
