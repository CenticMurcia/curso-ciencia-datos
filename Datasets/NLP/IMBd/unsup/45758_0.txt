This movie is about a killer who shows the torture that ends in death life on the internet: the more people watch, the harder the victims are tortured.<br /><br />Of course, millions of people log on and watch.<br /><br />That concept isn't too bad, however, where this movie goes horribly wrong is that each torture is displayed and filmed in detail. You get to see it almost like the people in the movie that watch it over the net. So, WHAT THE F? People giving the movie a good rating are as SICK as people who log on to this site in the movie.<br /><br />Movies like this should not be made. To make a clear statement, please do NOT watch this movie - but vote on it: give it a one. We have to stop this kind of sick movie making as soon as possible.
