On a weekend hunting trip two firefighters Alex Kerwood and Wayne Higley stumble onto a mysterious burial site.They dig it up and find the skull of an ancient horned creature.Big mistake!Suddenly the unleashed monster starts killing people in a small American town...OK,I'm a pretty tolerant guy when it comes to low-budget indie horror,but "In the Woods" is bad to the bone.The script is lifeless and dull,the suspense is non-existent and the action takes place in the woods for only 10 minutes or so.The DVD proudly claims "Creepier than 'The Blair Witch Project'".Yeah,right!Avoid this piece of cow dung like the plague unless you want to be bored beyond comprehension.
