Horrible, Horrible movie. I remember watching this movie as a kid and sorta liking it but then again I was 10. After visiting this movie at a later point in my life I realized how bad this really was. The story is about a boy(Bobo) who was separated as a baby from his millionaire father by falling out of a sled in the woods. Oddly enough, he's then raised by wolves who for go any natural instinct to eat him and instead decide, collectively to raise him as their own. Years later, he's found by this cute researcher who takes him, finds out his mother and brother are still alive and attempts to return him. Now, Bobo's brother is set to inherit all his father's money instead of only half if his brother isn't found by his 30th birthday. Naturally, his brother doesn't want him return. There then comes a extremely boring section where we see this researcher trying to educate Bobo. Horrible, not funny, and inconsistent. Not only that but it seems as if the crew of the film were trying to be seen in this movie. I could count at least three occasions where I could see the boom mike on the screen and at least one occasion where I can see the camera man on screen. But whatever, even The Godfather had its mistakes. What bothers me more is the fact that the comedy seems contrived and Bobo's mental state seems to shift around in the movie. At one point, he's a bumbling idiot, the next moment he's arguing a case in court and then he's back again to being the idiot. Do not see this movie, see something like the Big Lebowski to see a good comedy. This is garbage.
