If your tastes run to movies requiring attention and thought to unravel, Trinity may be for you. If you want car chases and explosions, go elsewhere. Even when there is an explosion during Trinity, we see it indirectly, reflected in the eyes of one of the characters.<br /><br />Set in an alternative present or near future, Trinity's world looks like ours but it isn't. Trinity deals with the aftermath of genetic experiments directed by a Dr Clerval, an aftermath resulting in the deaths of people followed by the disappearance of Clerval.<br /><br />"Clerval" is the name of a friend of Dr Victor Frankenstein in the original novel.<br /><br />Agents Brach and Schiller are sent to investigate a distress signal sent from the arctic research station formerly operated by Clerval. They find one person there, a man who looks like Clerval but who claims to be his clone, not Clerval but "of him", possessing some of his memories, but not all. But is cloneClerval telling the truth? Nearly the whole of the movie deals with the interaction of these characters. Bach and Schiller both have personal agendas beyond assigned duty. It is difficult to know who and what to believe. All three characters carry emotional burdens involving the others, bringing them into constant and sometimes violent conflict with one another. The isolation of the research station creates a claustrophobic atmosphere that none of them can readily escape.<br /><br />Elsewhere, Trinity is listed as having a run time of 120 minutes instead of the nearly 80 minutes as released in Holland in autumn 2004. Trinity is known to have several different versions. It would be interesting to know just what was omitted in the present release, and how the other versions differed. It would also be interesting to know why the movie was completed in 2001 but not released until 3 years later, and then only in Belgium and Holland.<br /><br />9 double helices out of 10
