Poorly cast, uninteresting location, amateur storytelling. <br /><br />This is one of those movies that crams in all the back story just as it is getting to the resolution. <br /><br />You can imagine the writers scrambling to think up an explanation for their ghost.<br /><br />Not original, unsatisfactory payoff, and some scenes with a waterfall that I guess takes takes you to a separate section of the forest that is otherwise inaccessible.<br /><br />I will say that the special effects surprised me, in as much as they seemed much more accomplished than any other aspect of the movie. <br /><br />I like B-movies, exploitation, horror, and trash, but I wasn't into this.<br /><br />The ghost was supposed to be Native American but looked totally Asian.<br /><br />The picked very uninteresting woods to film in.
