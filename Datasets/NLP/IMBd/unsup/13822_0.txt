"Melvin and Howard" is one of those maybe-true-maybe-not stories. Working class Melvin Dummar (Paul LeMat) finds along the road a scraggly old man (Jason Robards) who may or may not be Howard Hughes. When Hughes leaves Melvin a sum of money, Hughes' family fights it.<br /><br />Yes, it sounds like a rather plain story, but director Jonathan Demme knows how to make it interesting. Mary Steenburgen won an Oscar for her role as Melvin's wife Lynda; she adds an interesting dimension to the film, confused by her husband's unexpected fortune, but doing everything possible to keep her life together. Quirky, but something that you won't want to miss.
