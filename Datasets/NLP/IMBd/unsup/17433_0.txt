Not a bad little Japanese horror flick, this, but while it is creepy and disturbing I must say that I felt rather lost trying to keep up with or figure out what was going on. Seems that wherever spirits go when they're dead is full, and the spirits remain on earth, lingering in the shadows and around corners, always just out of sight. Or so it seemed to me, and this may not be the actual idea. As I mentioned it is a bit hard to follow. Still though, it has a certain creepiness and gloom about it, a sense of dread, that comes across rather well. It seems to pole vault from one scenario to another though, and I will confess to being totally lost sometimes. A good look and feel to it though, and a scene with a low-flying plane on fire that then crashes out of sight is particularly eerie. I suppose a second watch might reveal more to me but we'll see, I reckon. I wouldn't say don't see it, just be prepared to pay close attention, I guess. 7 out of 10.
