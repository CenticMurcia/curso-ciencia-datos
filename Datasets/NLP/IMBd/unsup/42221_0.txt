I'm in the minority on this, but I really disliked this film.<br /><br />I generally like to watch Harland Williams. Typically, he's a fine straight man, but sometimes, his dry wit shows through. In Rocketman, however, he has allowed himself to be reduced to sophomoric antics worthy of any SNL reject (and I say that with all due respect) and appears to belong in a Rob Schneider movie.<br /><br />Quite frankly, this was too painful to watch. The character wasn't funny. He was pathetically moronic...sad...not funny. This has been heralded as awesome, and hilarious, but neither is this funny, nor is it awe inspiring. It's just stupid, with no redeeming qualities whatsoever.<br /><br />I was not entertained, nor was I amused with this film.<br /><br />It rates a a 1.2/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
