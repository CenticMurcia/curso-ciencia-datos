Either I wasn't paying enough attention or the plot was too smart for me, but I just couldn't understand what was going on in this movie most of the time. Problem is, it's not good enough in other aspects to warrant a second viewing by someone just to get everything straight. Long, muddled and unengaging. (*1/2)
