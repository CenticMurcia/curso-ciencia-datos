Jim Carrey is awesome. Ace Ventura is such a well made movie. The script is great, the acting is great, but Jim Carrey is the best. He just has this way of knowing exactly what to do to make you laugh. What gets me the most is the little stuff in the movie that you might not see the first time. Somebody'll be talking and Jim will be behind them just being himself and it's hilarious. Great, great movie.
