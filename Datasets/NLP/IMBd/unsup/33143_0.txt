I LOVE James Dean even though I was born 15 years after his death. I think he was a wonderful actor, an amazing person and someone who would have gone on to do great things. I've read his biographies, I've watched the movies he was in and I've found out from interviews what he was seemingly like in "real life". But I was so disappointed in this movie and I feel he deserved to have a better movie made about him. This movie didn't tell us anything we didn't already know and they didn't go into details ... the kind of details that we'd have wanted to know about. People in his life who were a pivotal part of his life were just omitted from this movie and it was just like this ... they took a wonderful man's life and shortened it in an hour and a half. James Dean's life was worth more than an hour and a half. And the guy who played him didn't look enough like James Dean. It made watching him very difficult because it was hard to believe. At one point, he looked like someone off of revenge of the nerds. The guy was also too tall to play James Dean. There was one scene where everyone was standing together in a bar, and he was the same height as everyone else. James Dean was short ... like 5'8 or 5'9. All those guys could not have been 5'8 or 5'9. I was just really disappointed and I wish that they could make a movie that was more 'real' to his life.
