I got a free pass to see this at the Vancouver premiere which was pretty cool with a red carpet and paparazzi with the stars which I had no clue Vancouver ever had before. While I'm not a Tarentino fan this film was along those lines with great colorful characters, snappy dialog and interesting visuals. <br /><br />It starts off great with a music video of the star Sonnny Westwood played by Silvio Pollio which really sets the tone off well for the film. The film goes by very fast with lots of laughs and Silvio Pollio and Joe Cortese who is a freaky producer have great comedic chemistry. All in all I recommend it to anyone who is fan of film.
