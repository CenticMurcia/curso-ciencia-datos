This is another one of these incredible animated shorts that was done with painstaking patience, taking a lot of time to do just one frame, and then doing thousands after it to make an eight-minute movie. In this case, it's thousands of tiny steel pins manipulated one frame at a time. In the world of art, you may know this as "pointillism."<br /><br />We see a landscape and then a painter. The painter's artwork almost blends into the country scene he has painted. He then steps into the painting. At that point, we see - this is my guess - the area slowly go back in time to what it might have looked like thousands of years ago. This constantly shifting landscapes animation, done in black-and-white, was very eerie. <br /><br />Later, we are back to modern times. At that point, we see a house and a neighborhood change over time and that part was the most interesting to me.<br /><br />This is a haunting animated film by Jacques Drouin and I would interested in reading more about the story he presented here. The movie was part of the DVD "Leonard Maltin's Animation Favorites From The National Film Board Of Canada.
