I'm a sucker for flying films. If the flick is about airplanes or pilots or other aircrew, I'll probably have seen it before I'm finished watching movies. Honestly, if it's got an airplane in it at all, whether or not it is really an integral part of the movie, I'll watch it.<br /><br />So there I am, in line at the theatre those many years ago, ready to see this new film about one of the most dramatic events of the Second World War: the return to base of the first US Army Air Force bomber crew to complete a 25-mission tour. This was a true event in a war where a new crew's life expectancy was six missions. The cast sounds first class - it is, they're great - and well, there are airplanes!<br /><br />So the movie has begun and there are those typical faces that haunt you from photographs of the real war - young, energetic, so hopeful of their future - you know the type. The producers have done a great job showing that this was a war of mostly boys and very young men who, if they survive to grow up, will grow up much too quickly. And those airplanes! Yes, I know that there were only five real ones and that most were not the correct model, but let's face it; when there are so few left of the thousands built, you take what you can get and be happy for it. It is very good to see even those five flying together again.<br /><br />But then there is the dialogue. I'm afraid I found it a little turgid at times and the attitudes (and language) somewhat anachronistic. I have war vets in my family and none of them admit to speaking like that! Well, they could be lying... In any case, it is a movie adaptation and one should make allowances.<br /><br />The big disappointment for me, however, was that they took a very dramatic, historical story and trivialized it with some very shallow characterizations and fictitious situations pertaining to the famous last flight. Okay, again, I understand that it is a feature movie and not a documentary recreation, but really, wasn't the true story dramatic enough? Ultimately, it a silly movie that stands as a mundane bit of film making, and not a particularly good war film at that.<br /><br />Enjoy this movie if you like, but if you want the real drama (not to mention the real story) of the last flight of the Memphis Belle, have a look at William Wyler's superb, riveting documentary.
