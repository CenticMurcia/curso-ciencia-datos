Possibly the worst movie I have ever made myself watch. The supermarket near my office recently had a stack of DVD's for 97p and the cast list caught my eye and parted me with my money. Tim Healey has the sense to get despatched early into proceedings but this woeful vehicle for Michael Caine and Edward Fox doesn't let them off so soon. I note that the director's children appear in this and that none of them have found a great deal of movie work since. Although this only cost me a very small sum of money, I will never get back the almost-2 hours it took me to watch this rubbish. I'd send it to the local church jumble sale but some other poor sap would have an equally unfulfilling afternoon, even if they only pay 10p for it.
