I saw this movie for the first time only a few days ago. Being a Beatles fan, I was always curious but hadn't the opportunity to see this. Well, it isn't the best movie ever, nor the best musical, best documentary etc.. It's a Beatles movie, and a very good one. Sure they argue, there are times when they seem to just "do nothing" and let the hours pass, but still, when they play... It's almost as if the world stopped, all troubles were forgotten, just for the sheer magic of their music. And sometimes we can see them having fun, and it's all worthwhile. After all, a very good movie for music fans. Say what you will, they are THE BEATLES!
