With a recipe like that, you'd think that this movie would be watchable, but no, the story and director butcher the premise.<br /><br />This movie isn't even funny, its just dull. To add to the poor acting, awful dialog and insipid story, the director lets a lot of cheesy special effects sequences run on for well past forever. I guess in 1980 these were state-of-the-art so he wanted to make sure that audiences were wowed, but in 2006, its stilted and boring.<br /><br />There is no reason to watch Saturn 3 -- the story makes no sense (why does the killer even bother going to Saturn 3? why? why would he do that? he's insane but not that insane), the sets look cheap, the sound is cheesy, etc... etc... etc.... It has been deservedly forgotten because it is wretched.
