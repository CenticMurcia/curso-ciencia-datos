I love Alain Delon and Jean Gabin and french cinema. So I was high on expectations when i began this film. It's good. It's a simple story, that moves organically and is well photographed and acted....it is not a typical film....and hence needs a bit of time to get into the mood of the film. But it's a stirring story and gradually you understand and get emotionally involved in the characters. And you feel Oh my God....this is dangerous, tragic. I hate comments that reveal the complete story....no...but i loved the character of the vindictive cop. A guy i hated... The end of the film reminded me of Kieslowski's A short film about killing. For those seeking entertainment, watch the Alain Delon thrillers featured in the DVD extras. This is a serious film but it's eminently watchable and has a powerful underplayed drama. <br /><br />The actors are a treat to watch. I love Jean Gabin, though i must confess, i've only seen him play the old man.<br /><br />He'd have been as stupendous when young. His face is a landscape of stories.<br /><br />The ideal double bill would be this film, followed by Henri Vernuil's Any number can win...with the same principle cast. <br /><br />Since i'm from India, I must add here that we have our own Alain Delon here....Saif Ali Khan. A handsome intense actor who is right now very happening. <br /><br />Not a date movie for sure but a good film nevertheless.
