First time director, allegedly ... first movie, allegedly ... ridiculously small budget, allegedly ... Either someone thinks I am very gullible or movie-makers all over the world should think about making church on Sundays a regular practice ... alternatively, they should spare themselves countless hours in AA further down the line (when directors and their movies like this become common practice) and quit now!!<br /><br />We live in a particularly distressing age of movie making where the most basic aspect of any movie, THE STORY, has fallen to the wayside. Nowadays stories (when they are not biographic or lifted directly from already successful books) are unimpressive at best. Montage is either stroboscopic or lethargic and cinematography is either "periodic" or over zealously "hand-held". Let us just say disenchantment with the silver screen has set in. However, I am always optimistic and sometimes it pays off and that pay off in 2005 came in the form of Thomas Ikimi's "Limbo". A conceptually and literally dark and pensive, quasi-thriller, which unselfishly and also uncompromisingly dives head first into moral debates on life, human nature, free will and religion. Rather than risk going so far into how impressed I was with Thomas Ikimi's "FIRST" cinematic effort and end up looking like a groupie ... all I will say is I am counting the days until the release of his next feature and with Ikimi's discovery of a rare diamond in Joe Holt, the wait for his next offering also seems endless. !!! BRAVO !!!
