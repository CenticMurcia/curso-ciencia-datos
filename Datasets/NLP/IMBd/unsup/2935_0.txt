Its not often you see a movie go from completely serious war film to sci fi time travel to comedy and then somehow manage to keep its war film story intact that you're anxious to see how it all ends.<br /><br />the movie follows two sides: one army whose orders are to deliver a nuke and the other army determined to stop them and try to get the nuke away from them. As luck has it, a comet nears the earth and causes a time rift sending the two groups of soldiers back to 1572. The two sides are now in confusion as to where their nuke has gone to and how to return home.<br /><br />While in years past they're robbed by what appears to be a common thief, but then they all realize the person is General Lee, a famous general who kept Korea from being invaded by japan. The war film now becomes a comedy, trying to find different ways for Lee to prepare for battle, and how modern weapons can somehow be carried over to ancient times. Meanwhile, the brilliant scientist might have found a way to travel home given the comet's time cycle is 433 years, but what about the Nuke, and who win wind up victorious in the oncoming battle against the barbarians that threaten the lives of them and General Lee? Its very gripping and leaves you wondering what the outcome will be.<br /><br />The movie would have to be considered war comedy mostly, as the clash of different things in time is what most of the humor focuses on, but its not just that. Some moments like the big battles are very intense with bloody sword fights. The story is great, and while its got some serious moments, its easy to follow and anyone can enjoy it. Go to see this if you're looking for something different and new. Its an original and clever idea thats pulled off nicely.
