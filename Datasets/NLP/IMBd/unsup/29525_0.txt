I don't watch a lot of movies but by accident tuned in "Love Thy Neighbour" on Sunday. Lately I end up tiring of movies and don't watch the complete show but I was pulled into the story and found it intriguing. I enjoy a good suspense but usually am freaked because they are too graphic or beyond belief...I found this story realistic and scary enough to put me on the edge of my seat without going beyond my scope of endurance. One part I found particularly unnerving was the idea that we are all looking for a secure place and that the actual threat can come right from within. I was satisfied with the resolution of the story and found the conclusion plausible and not contrived. All the plot tied together in the end. I would recommend this movie to my friends.
