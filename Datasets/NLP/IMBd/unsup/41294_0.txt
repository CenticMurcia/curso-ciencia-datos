The quality of direction, acting and script made a possibly worthwhile plot into a disastrous movie. The BBC in their wisdom gave it a re-run tonight and I can't think why. It is not worth even one star. There were glaring continuity errors including (in a different sense)the fact that the previously annoyingly gabby punk kid didn't say a word during all the time he was being held loosely captive by the baddie. She (the baddie)would actually have made a great Rosa Klebb in a Bond movie, but in this film had to cope with bad lines and execrable scenes. She was so quick to plunge the needle into so many of her later victims yet she took so long in her attempt on the heroine that the lift doors open. There was a glaring continuity error with the President's tie. All-in-all not a movie worth the candle.
