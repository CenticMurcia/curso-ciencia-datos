Loved it! Could watch it time and again! Great production value...fast editing, music, etc. Loved the cast. Want to buy the DVD if it's available! Carly Pope and her best friend are both good actors. I haven't seen her in anything else, but would like to. I see that Brian Austin Greens new sitcom is sort of a take off on this movie. But Brian plays the opposite role - the bad role - in his sitcom. I think he plays a better nice guy. The producers and directors did a great job with this one! I think many girls and women can relate to this story. Not being noticed when we are young, and then blossoming and getting the guys attention later on.
