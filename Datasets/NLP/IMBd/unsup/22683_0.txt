Having no previous knowledge of the directory Higuchinsky or his history, I didn't expect much from this movie judging by Netflix's rating. What I found however was a pretty hip piece of independent youthful film-making that kind of blends the 80's, 90's and the future.<br /><br />It reminded me of a hard core version of Takeshi's Castle (AKA Most Extreme Elimination Challenge).<br /><br />Eleven unwitting participants are thrown together into a city wide game in which they must split up into teams and make it across the finish line before their time expires. Each is fitted with a wrist band that reveals their location and time remaining. Removal of the wristband results in a lethal injection. Groups are intercepted along their route by henchmen. Proximity of henchmen is detected and signaled by the wristbands.<br /><br />A kind of real life D&D, treasure hunt, survivor, laser tag, reality TV spoof.<br /><br />This movie has the appearance of a student film or home made movie. It looks like it was shot on video tape and transferred to film, however the acting, special effects and gags are just as good as any American teenage slasher comedy, except is has the coolness of a video game, urban anime and Japanese game show all rolled into one.<br /><br />I really liked it.<br /><br />=Game Over=
