This was an amazing movie that somehow managed to make me laugh and cry in the span of an hour and a half. And if I'm expressing outward emotions, it must be amazing. Seriously. Everyone should see this movie, I don't care who you are. All the actors were wonderful in their roles and Jensen Ackles once again worms his way into the heart of every girl on the planet. Clea Duvall is wonderful and really makes you care about her and relate to her. After this movie, you kind of wonder what fronts you've been putting up for the rest of the world. David and Mark have created a wonderful film for everyone to enjoy and Betsy's screenplay is just absolutely brilliant. Even ninjas love Ten Inch Hero! Oh, and pirates, too.
