Never mind the Jack Black act of Tyler Labine or the Ben Afflack slash Toby Maguire act of Bret Harrison, Rick Gonzalez as the straight man steals the show. This is hands down the funniest, most witty, sometimes scary and dramatic 15 hours of TV show you'll ever experience. You will fall in love with the characters; they are believable and they grow on you. The plot is like a demented soap opera. Satan is diabolically lovable. The villains are X-File worthy. The love relationships are charming. The acting is fine and the direction, ah, the direction--you'll wonder why this isn't being played on the big screen in theaters. It's all there, nary a flaw. I had a REALLY good time watching season one of Reaper. Can't wait to see more.
