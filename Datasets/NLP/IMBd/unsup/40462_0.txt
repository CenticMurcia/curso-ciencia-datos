"Cliff's Notes" of the series. Not a new chapter, not a new side plot, just a distillation. Despite being a redux there are long silences. It frankly spoiled the series for me. It felt more like an essay than a movie; rather than chronological development it was as though a point was made and evidenced and then moved on to the next point - I much preferred the chronological growth of the characters in the series. I do not feel like I understand a single part of the series any better. In fact, this feels like the "bonus features" pointlessly added to "new editions" just to entice me to buy the latest "collectable" version of a movie. In short, I want my money back. Don't waste your time. Watch the series before you watch this "movie." If you've seen the series, watch something else before you watch this "movie."
