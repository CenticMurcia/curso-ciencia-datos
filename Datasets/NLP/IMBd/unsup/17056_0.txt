For fans of 1930's Poverty Row, the very presence of a storm-battered mansion elicits a pleasant feeling, and makes otherwise unforgivable flaws within the film bearable. I've never seen an "Old Dark House" movie I didn't like, but some are definitely better than others. Case in point: "One Frightened Night."<br /><br />Starting with an ingenious credit sequence, the movie consistently offers an awareness of its own cliches. This refreshingly tounge-in-cheek-attitude - along with top-notch acting and pacing - make it a superior product. Everything seems to click. I recommend this as an intro to Old Dark House movies. 10/10.<br /><br />
