Bride Wars (2009), I potentially thought this movie could turn out to be one of those quirky, funny, well thought out and acted comedies that occasionally come out of Hollywood. To be honest that is the only reason I agreed to accompany my Girlfriend to the movies to see it.<br /><br />However my enthusiasm was quickly suppressed, and I realised early on that the movie might actually turn out to be like so many other, forgettable, overly sentimental and almost pointless comedies that Hollywood are also famous for producing.<br /><br />What didn't I like.<br /><br />Well its not very funny, there is pretty much ZERO laugh out loud moments in the entire movie. From start to end.<br /><br />The men the two lead (and talented) actresses are marrying are cardboard cutouts with ZERO character development and thanks to that are totally unlikable. How can we care about their individual engagement's and marriage's if there is no bridge built between us and them.<br /><br />The "War",or more like the "playground type spats" are also extremely disappointing. No originality or real fun attached to anything they do to each other.<br /><br />The "I could see it coming from 10 minutes in" ending, the whole Brother/potential failed marriage issue, once again completely unoriginal.<br /><br />I also couldn't quite get it round my head that two life-long friends that plainly love each other could actually be so cruel to each other.<br /><br />The WTF moment....the dance off scene, what were they thinking?? Cringe cringe and lets all cringe again.<br /><br />I do however agree that both Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway (particularly) are fine actresses, and are both very pleasing to the eye. The scene in which they "make-up" is actually quite touching and well acted. Shame about the rest of course.<br /><br />Overall a pretty poor effort at a romantic comedy. The fact there is no romance and no comedy probably explains why.<br /><br />Its not a complete car crash, but its a very empty film which I'm sure I will quickly forget I actually seen. Then one day I will spot it in the TV listings and have a vague memory of watching it.<br /><br />Hopefully this is only a one time bad blip on Anne Hathaway's otherwise impressive career to date. As for Kate, well lets just think about a new agent, bad movies are becoming part of the course for her career as late.<br /><br />3/10 Watchable....but only just. In my opinion not for shelling out cinema prices to experience. Leave this one for viewing via TV, rental or bargain basement DVD prices.
