This movie is definitely not what the previous summary made it out to be. Trust me. And if you don't just see the movie and than I know you will trust for the rest of your life. I know Anil Kapoor's acting is far better than most in Bollyhood but this movie was purely made on the fact that the title of the movie would appeal to the mainstream Indian movie goers. But I am sorry to say, actually, why should I be sorry, I did nothing wrong. This movie's plot is not original at all. And when Ms Sen puts her relationship with her soon to be husband on the line and tells lies to the police to save her boss, Anil Kapoor, who would think something like this can actually occur in real life. But anyway this movie was poorly done and put together. This goes to the director and the editing crew but the person to blame is probably the producers who wanted to sell the title, My Wife's Murder, that they put out garbage like this for the whole world to see. Well, can't really blame these producers when the rest of the bollywood producers are also doing the same except a few who I will list later. My whole reason for writing this response was because i read the previous one and I completely disagreed with it and I wanted to warn people it would probably be a mistake seeing the movie. And the list of producers and Directors that are on my A list are as Follows: Mani Ratnam, in many different languages has proved that he is what Stanly Kubrick was for the Hollywood cinema. try to get a hold of his old stuff like Mouna Ragam with Ravethy. It also deals with husband and wife issues (1985) also get Dilse if you have not yet. Best movie ever. Nothing is more realistic than that. and the music A R rhaman provides are like tunes from haven that has been sent by god as a gift to all music lovers. This years movies of the year: Sarkar Kya Kool Hai Hum Menai Pyar Kyu Kya No Entry Salam Nameste
