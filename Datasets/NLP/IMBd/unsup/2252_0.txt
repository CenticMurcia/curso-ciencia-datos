This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Despite the sex and nudity the plot is ridiculous, the actors are mediocre, and the script is so bad that it verges on the involuntarily funny. <br /><br />The plot reminds of certain films by Almodovàr, but unfortunately Julio Medem is not Almodovàr.<br /><br />The sex disappears after one third of the story. Paz Vega is certainly beautiful and we see a lot of her (especially naked) but she can't save this awful mess. Avoid like the plague.
