Okay, so they reunited MOST of the original cast. So what? The result is still a second rate sequel with poor animation, and worse music. I especially loathe the ridiculous lines fed to Robin Williams as Genie. His character was completely overdone from a plethora of excessive costumes to interjections that really didn't belong. Just don't expect to see the magic from Williams' original performance. Let's focus on the positive: The story itself does have intrigue. Aladdin decides to search for his missing(?) father and finds him as the leader of a band of theives. He hopes to change him from his treacherous ways, and well... Watch it to find out. Jasmin's singing voice is the very talented Broadway veteran Liz Calloway (back from "Jafar" and most recently heard singing as "Anastasia"). As a whole I must say that "King of Thieves" is an improvement from "Jafar" and we can't be too critical toward a video aimed to please children in the 4-9 range.
