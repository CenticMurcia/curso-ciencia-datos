it sucks. I suppose this movie is a good knee-slapper for a late night with nothing to do but honestly, what was the director thinking? Two people are dead within the first 10 minutes of the movie, one, this Yuka character never has any significance ever again in the film. The sister keeps coming back for no reason and the Mariko(?) never showed any reaction to all the crazy things that were happening. Detective Sakurai despite being a famous actor did absolutely nothing! Who were the little girl and her mom? What was everything? What happened to all the people? Why is the big question I'm left with. Also, what's up with Sayaka appearing in the end just in time to do NOTHING??? Yet another pointless, I don't even know what to call it. Oh yeah, and the spider man thing is because the daughter for no good reason had spider hair.
