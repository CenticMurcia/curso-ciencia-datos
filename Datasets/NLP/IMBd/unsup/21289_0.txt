The film Cilantro y Perejil is a good example of a film that has more to it than meets the eye. Although the film is full of clich√©s that could possibly happen throughout many people's lives, the way in which the film is presented has a funny twist to it that sets it apart from most of films about marriage and monogamy. In Cilantro y Perejil the main character's sister, Nora, is constantly interviewing people for a project, therefore making it a film within a film. She catches many moments that would not usually be in a typical romantic comedy that adds a very different element to the film.<br /><br />Also, there is a psychiatrist in the film that throughout the scenes gives his commentary and professional advice about love, marriage and monogamy. His wording and personality add as a comic relief to the film and keep things interesting for the viewer. The director does a great job of making the viewer experience the same emotions as the characters through all of the down to earth and awkward situations that happen in day to day life.<br /><br />The film is worth seeing for anyone who has a sense of humor and an interest in seeing the dynamics of a less than perfect marriage, and all that goes along with it.
