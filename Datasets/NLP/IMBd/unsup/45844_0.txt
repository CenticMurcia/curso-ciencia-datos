MISSING IN ACTION is one of those "God Bless America!"-themed, war-mongering movies made after the Vietnam War in order to cash in on the newfound pseudo-patriotism of the average American citizen (just like what happened after the September 11th attacks). It is your typical action vehicle, made in the wake of films like RAMBO: FIRST BLOOD, with all the thoughtless racist overtones you'd expect. Chuck Norris's performance here is pretty much the exact same one he's always delivered, but as anyone who's seen a Norris flick knows, that's NOT a good thing. Come to think of it, Norris's character Braddock is the most shallow, underdeveloped role I have ever seen him play. It blows my mind to think that this was a box office hit, but then again, we Americans seem to have a pension for paying top dollar for moron-entertainment. Bottom line: MISSING IN ACTION has absolutely no value whatsoever (entertainment, artistic, or otherwise), and should be avoided at all costs.
