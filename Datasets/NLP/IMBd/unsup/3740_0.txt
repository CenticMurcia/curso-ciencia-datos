I was living in Prescott when The Zoo Gang was being filmed. I lived right down the street from the main filming site. The club that the Donnelly's tried to take over was an old Checker Auto Parts Store before they closed it down. The Hotel that was across from that was the Hassayampa Hotel. That is where the other kids got on top of the roof and cheered everyone on. Across the street from the Hassayampa was the old Library, I used to go to that Library when I was a little girl before they built the new one. Down the street from there was the Marina Movie Theater. I watched many movies in that Theater. The hill that they take the motor home down on is Elk's Hill, we used to sled down that hill when we were kids in the winter when it snowed. We used to skate in the Plaza by Bucky O'Neal in the square. My fondest memories in Prescott are around the time that this movie was being filmed. I had a couple of friend's that were extras in the movie. So, I know this movie personally, I am a native of Prescott. I thought it was cool to actually know people that got to be extras in it.
