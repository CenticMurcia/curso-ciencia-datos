This movie is one of the worst films I have ever seen. First, It has absolutely nothing to do with white noise, so why name it white noise II? Second the acting in this movie was sup par. And the 'special' effects, as in a bunch of mentally deranged monkeys were hired to do them, were just way too ridiculous and overdone! The movie starts off with potential and then horribly crashes. There is no sense of time in the film, and it feels like everything happens in a disorganized flash of mind numbing ridiculousness. Random black and white people who are supposed to be ghosts pop out of nowhere for no reason whatsoever to harass Abe(the main character) for who knows why! Once Abe learns that the white light means that the person is going to die, he decides to save people. So the first people that he tries to save is a bum. Who is probably the stupidest bum man you've ever seen. Seriously I bet that if you let bums see the bum scene they would tell you that the bum in the film was obviously out of his mind and deserved to die too. The second person he tries to save, is the most crotchety and annoying stupid old man you've ever encountered. Seriously if your car breaks down on the road and you need to go under it to fix something you put out flairs AND YOU DON'T LAY DOWN WITH YOUR LEGS STRETCHED OUT INTO THE LANE!! If someone tries to help you, you don't call them a freaky metrosexual.<br /><br />Also, why would ONE person saved from death need to then go on and KILL MANY people? It just doesn't make sense! It doesn't balance anything and its ridiculous.<br /><br />EVERY transition in the film is either some random cross, upside down cross,a random Jesus painting or a fade out of the main character with a random cross, upside down cross, or a weird Jesus painting in the background. The connections to Lucifer are ridiculous, I don't even understand the point of any religious connection or the need for any religious connection to this film.<br /><br />Basically if you want a very warped tripped out movie that takes ideas from white noise, poltergeist, the exorcist, pulse and blends them all together to make the most incoherent jumble of random crap with loud noises and a team of mentally deranged monkeys special effects guys this is the movie for you.<br /><br />Bottom line, don't watch this movie unless you're trying to ruin your night/date/relationship with your in laws etc , because after seeing it you'll feel like you wasted your life, and the people watching it with you will wonder if you're on crack.
