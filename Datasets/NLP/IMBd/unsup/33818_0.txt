I can say the most positive thing about The Toxic Avenger is that it knew what it was. Sure, it's a horrible, horrible, incredibly bad film, but at least unlike other top worst movies of all time, this one knew it was meant for B-Movie status. Or at least for some midnight views or drinking games.<br /><br />For someone who has not seen a singe "Troma" film ever, until last night, I was pretty shocked on the lengths these directors and writers went. From the extreme homophobia, to vehicular manslaughter while drinking and driving and actually shoving a shot gun into a toddler's face. I'm guessing this (1986) was far before the PC-movement or they simply wanted you to turn your brain off. Sure, you would have to turn off your senses while watching, but as much fun as some of the movie was, it was hard to ignore the blatant disregard for taste/humanity.<br /><br />Yeah, I mentioned some of the movie was fun. It was, only because it was so over-the-top in its bathroom humor and bad special effects/voice-overs. (Man, that Toxic voice-over was hilarious, though I never knew if it was one of the jokes.) I didn't, however, mention the deliberate misuse of transporting toxic waste because it was an obvious set-up and part of the overall camp of the movie.<br /><br />Nerdy, nerd, nerd Melvin's the janitor in charge of the mop at a gym and is getting picked on. Why? Because he's misunderstood? No, because he's such an exaggeratedly bad form of geek that makes Napoleon Dynamite look like the captain of the football team. And he should honestly never be let out of his house for his own safety.<br /><br />At any rate, he sort of works by mopping and goggling the bimbos until a plan is hatched to rid the gym of this eye sore by humiliation that turns into him leaping out of a window into, you guessed it, toxic waste. From there, this Frankenstein's Monster with a brand new voice and body seeks out justice for whatever reason you can think of. But, this is not a Batman vigilante. This one not only has no conscious of murder, he slaughters.<br /><br />I could say this is where the movie gets silly, but that was from frame one. No, this is where is where the movie gets sick and turns more horror. Sure, there are more comedic, intentional or not, moments, but they layered on the gore and violence and some of the oddest characters lifted right from Garbage Pail Kids cards, and no, I'm not talking about mutated characters. These were the humans.<br /><br />I honestly can't recommend this movie to anyone other than the midnight-movie, drinking (or other forms of controlled substance) or lovers of bad movie groups. I will say though this movie is obviously set up as a comedic fun-ride and not to be taken seriously for a second, the underling messages of homophobia and violence against kids still is very disturbing.
