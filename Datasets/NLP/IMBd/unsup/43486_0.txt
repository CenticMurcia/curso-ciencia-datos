Mainly notable as Bela Lugosi's only film in color (he's actually quite good as a magician), it's narrated by a corpse (could it have influenced SUNSET BOULEVARD [1950]?) - however, judging by the absurd split-second flashes to the body on the morgue slab every once in a while, the film-makers apparently thought the audiences constantly needed to be reminded of this novelty! <br /><br />I really wanted to like this film because the central idea (a woman with a guilty past fears for her life in an institution) and some of the imagery (especially the green mask motif) were intriguing enough. Unfortunately, the plot development was extremely muddled - with new characters introduced from time to time but subsequently given little to do (chief among them Angelo Rossitto as Lugosi's deaf-and-dumb but, by the latter's own admission, bad-tempered dwarfish sidekick). Besides, it establishes situations - for instance, Lugosi's long-time grudge with George Zucco - that are ultimately left hanging in the air and which it never bothers to resolve or adequately explain, that one's attention is bound to wander throughout. Add to this the inane comic relief provided by Nat Pendelton as a dumb cop (who is even less appetizingly involved in a romance with the household's ordinary and inevitably frightened maid) and Douglas Fowley as a flustered reporter (who has no purpose in being there at all but has a ditzy blonde in tow for good measure) and it comes as no surprise that the end result is so flat and poorly done in all departments!! <br /><br />P.S. Here's an interesting (and hilarious) review about the film which perfectly encapsulates its various shortcomings - the author seems to bear a particular grudge against the title: http://www.scifilm.org/musings/musing125.html
