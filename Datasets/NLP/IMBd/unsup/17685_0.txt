I just finished watching this movie on VH1 Classic, and I'll definitely be getting the DVD tomorrow. Fantastic documentary loaded with interviews with mostly pertinent people. It is well written from a more intellectual, anthropological point of view, but not so high minded as to alienate anyone.<br /><br />At the end of all this, in the last scene, the writer-director sums up his conclusions, and is followed by sound bites from the various musicians' interviews. This is played over a lingering shot of a crowd at a metal show, moshing, fists pumping in the air, devil horn salutes flying. And playing behind it all is Metallica's Master of Puppets, first the quiet intro - leading into the various movements while the sun glints through the knotted mass of arms. It's a fantastic moment that ties up the entire film and leads into the closing credit sequence that runs up the screen as Metallica's magnum opus builds its inevitable head of steam.<br /><br />The final analysis was something to the effect of 'either you get it or you don't'. I'm a lifelong metalhead, myself. My impression was that they got it, they understand the soul of it and explained it perfectly. I can't say if it will change any minds, but it's a good thing to watch for those of you getting ready to pass judgments.<br /><br />Good for headbangers and for the metal-curious.
