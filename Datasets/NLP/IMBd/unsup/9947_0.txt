"Ivanhoe" is one of the best historical movies I've ever seen! I would recommend this to anybody because it's full of romance and adventure. I didn't like the ending though, only because Sam Neill's character didn't end up with Rebecca (Olivia Hussey), which was really sad. <br /><br />I don't know what else to say besides the fact that I fell in love with this movie after I saw it the first time. But the fact that they portrayed Rowena as the beautiful girl that everybody was supposed to like was kinda depressing. Between Rebecca and Rowena, I think Rebecca stole the movie because of her courage and will to help Ivanhoe even though they have different backgrounds. So if you have read this, go out and buy the video.
