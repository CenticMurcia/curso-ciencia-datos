What a waste of time. I got in for free, went in with very minimal expectations (I expected a mobbed-up version of Space Cowboys), and still left the theater aghast at the pointlessness of this movie.<br /><br />What I got was a comedy with NO laughs (okay, one very small one), a plot seemingly written on a napkin (by a drunk whose seen Goodfellas too many times), and probably the worst performances in the careers of every person in this movie.<br /><br />I expected a lot more from the writer of my favorite comedy movie (Kingpin) and sitcom (Rich Jeni's Platypus Man), but I guess Barry Fanaro ran out of ideas a long time ago. Aside from The Whole Nine Yards, not coincidentally another supposed "mob comedy", this is the worst movie I've seen in the last 10 years.<br /><br />Please, I beg of you, don't see this movie, you will thank me.
