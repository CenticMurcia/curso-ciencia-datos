Haunted house films in general don't go down well with me at the best of times, but when the haunted house film in question is as boring as The Hearse, you can guarantee it's not going to be a winner! The film is absolutely what you would expect it to be - and nothing more or less, which ensures that the film is constantly dull. We get fed the common haunted house plot - basically, a woman inherits a house from her aunt but, believe it or not, her aunt was into witchcraft - blah blah blah, and then strange things start to happen. The woman starts seeing things, there's strange noises etc and someone in an old hearse begins 'menacing' her. This basically continues until we get to the end of the film. The film wouldn't have been quite so bad if we'd been provided with a bit of eye candy, but while she's not ugly - lead actress Trish Van Devere really didn't do anything for me. As you'd probably expect, the film tries to be a bit clever at the end, but true to form with this film it just turns out be a disappointment. I can't really be bothered to say much more than that about this lackadaisical movie - my advice is simply not to bother with it.
