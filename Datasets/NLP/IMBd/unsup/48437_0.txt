The East Side Kids vs. Bela Lugosi. The East Side Kids a group of "lovable and funny" juvenile delinquents are sent to a camp to help straighten them out. There also happens to be a killer roaming the country (called "The Monster") right near where the camp is. Around this time Bela with his companion (midget Angelo Rossitto) move into a spooky old house near the camp. The Kids end up in the house and strange things start to happen. Could Bela be the Monster?<br /><br />Pathetic. There's no real story and things are never fully explained at the end. Lugosi gives this his all but there's nothing for the poor guy to work with. It's real sad to see him reduced to doing crap like this. The East Side Kids aren't as annoying as I thought they would be but none of their jokes are funny (I groaned aloud at a few of them). Nice to see Rossitto but there's no reason for him to be in this--he doesn't even have a word of dialogue! Running about 60 minutes this is at least an hour too long. Boring, senseless and unfunny.<br /><br />I give it a 4 for Lugosi and some of the East Side Kids WERE kind of engaging.
