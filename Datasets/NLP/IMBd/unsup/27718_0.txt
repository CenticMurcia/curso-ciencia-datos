FROGS (3+ outta 5 stars)<br /><br />It's been called one of the best bad movies of all time... and far be it from me to argue with that. A bunch of spoiled rich twits in a secluded mansion in the Floridian wilderness pay the supreme price for years of pollution and the despoiling of nature... as nature's creatures (frogs, snakes, lizards, spiders, alligators, leeches and... snapping turtles?) conspire to kill them off one by one. Nature photographer Sam Elliot happens by and takes on the role of hero, protecting the women and children from the onslaught. I loved this movie when I was 12 years old... and I still have to say that, next to modern movies of this type (Anaconda, Arachnophobia), Frogs is still the champ! If you want a good, cheesy horror movie (and can stand the sight of all the creepy crawly critters) then you can't go wrong with this. The leech scene still disturbs me a bit... not so much for the gross-out special effects... but for the realistic sounds of distress from the actress (doesn't look like it would have been much fun to film this scene).
