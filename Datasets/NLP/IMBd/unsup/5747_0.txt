That is indeed a fine description for this film which stars The Ritz Brothers mixing their comedic hijinks with Horror icons Lionel Atwill and Bela Lugosi. A young Patsy Kelly is also on hand. The story concerns a villain known as The Gorilla, who may be a human criminal or really an escaped ape no one seems to know for certain one way or the other, threatening the life of one Walter Stevens (Atwill), who hires three bumbling detectives (The Ritz Brothers) to protect him. Lugosi meanwhile plays Stevens' butler Peters and generally appears just at the opportune (or is that inopportune) moment to scare the willies out of and arouse suspicion in The Ritz Brothers detective characters Mulligan, Garrity and Harrigan. Who is the Gorilla? And why does he want Walter Stevens dead? The answer may not be what you expect...honestly I thought this was harmless fun and much better than most make it out to be.
