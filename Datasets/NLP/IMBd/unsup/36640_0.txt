'Trail of the Pink Panther' (1982) has gathered much talk about its lead star Peter Sellers, who died two years before the film was released. One might ask how is this possible. Simple, director Blake Edwards took footage from previous Pink Panther films along with new footage to make a story. One will also ask the question whether these deleted scenes can really last for 90 minutes, and they'll be right.<br /><br />The film follows the story of when the famed diamond 'The Pink Panther' is stolen once again. Inspector Clouseau (Peter Sellers) is again called to solve the case, and at the same time driving Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) insane. But Clouseau plane goes missing. The film then shows a reporter (Joanna Lumley) talking to people who knew him best.<br /><br />The first half which Sellers is in excels (even though one can easily tell that all his scenes are just deleted scenes), but once he's gone, every goes downhill. Joanna Lumley is god-awful, giving an annoying French accent. It also seems a bit pathetic to recycle old clips from previous films. However, David Niven and Herbert Lom help the film a bit.<br /><br />While the film has many problems (actaully many), it's a good piece of Comedy, and also a nice tribute to the late great Peter Sellers.
