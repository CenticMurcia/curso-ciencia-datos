I just watched this movie on The Sci-Fi Channel.<br /><br />I found the premise of "EPOCH" interesting, but NOT enough to fully enjoy it. If it had a higher production budget, better Special F/X, A-List actors (such as Tom Cruise or Brad Pitt or Harrison Ford) a top rate director (such as Steven Spielberg, and a better movie title, then maybe this movie could've been put on the list as one of the Science Fiction classics.<br /><br />David Keith, Ryan O' Neil and the rest of the cast are just NOT to pull this movie off.<br /><br />Hopefully, in 20 to 30 years from now, a director and some really good actors will do a remake of "EPOCH" and make it great.
