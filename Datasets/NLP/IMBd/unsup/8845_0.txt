I never intended to watch this show in the first place because I thought the name of the show was ridiculous and I don't particularly like Brooke Shields. Well, this series pleasantly surprised me. Kim Raver is fantastic, Lindsay Price is uplifting, and Brooke Shields is growing on me. This show balances comedy and drama effectively, and maintains a realistic tone while delving into the hackneyed fairy tale scenario of working businesswomen. The overall concept of the show is not fresh, but delving into the fictional lives of three strong women is refreshing all the same.<br /><br />Just a warning: the pilot leaves a bit to be desired, so watch the next few episodes before you make a decision. I was slightly disappointed with the pilot because Brooke Shields was over-acting and the casting choice for her husband seemed random to me. Also, Lindsay Price's character started a relationship with a billionaire so quickly that it seemed even more unbelievable than a story line like that normally would.<br /><br />Nice additions: Sarah Hyland as Wendy's daughter, Robert Buckley as Kirby, Andrew McCarthy as Joe Bennett, and Wendy's assistant (I can't find his name).<br /><br />When it comes down to it, I wouldn't be watching if it weren't for Kim Raver. She's the backbone of the show.
