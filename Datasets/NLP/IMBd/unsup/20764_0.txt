I've been to a few of these kind of pride events and think this film does what it sets out to do, it shows them for what they are. Nothing more, nothing less. I personally walked away from the film thinking that Rob Labby was foolish for risking his own money. After seeing this movie my partner and I went online and donated to our local GLCC, so if that's what it was about it worked for us. I read in an article online that 20% of the profits are going to gay charities, so I don't know why some of these comments talk about making a buck off the film. 20% of anything is much more then I would've expected, especially from a movie that's kind of a pet cause film. I'd watch the documentary again and suggest you rent it.
