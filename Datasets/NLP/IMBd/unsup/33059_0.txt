A teenage boy (Aames) and a teenage girl (Cates) are lost in the desert but eventually find their way to an isolated oasis, where they fight off illness, desert bandits, and growing lust for each other. Okay, so it's a rip off of BLUE LAGOON, an excuse for the two stars to run naked and presumably titillate viewers with the sight of their young, nubile bodies.<br /><br />Now, God knows Aames and Cates are young and nubile. But there is a price to pay for the sight of them running naked: you have to sit through one of the worst movies ever made.<br /><br />I actually saw this on the big screen, and I can report that about fifteen minutes into the movie people began to leave, talking loudly about what an incredibly bad movie it was; those of us who remained were treated to an increasingly mind-numbing boredom so ponderously heavy that we were shocked into immobility. No amount of teen age nudity could make this turkey watchable. Miss it!<br /><br />Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer
