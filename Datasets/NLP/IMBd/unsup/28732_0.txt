I've never read the books but after this movie I'm ready to take a trip to the bookstore. It did feel surprisingly rushed though and I hope this is at least a trilogy from the way they ended it which was also a bit confusing for the audience. There were some questions that hopefully will be better explained in the books. The main being the ending seen of all the kids grown up then going through the wardrobe again as children. Action packed and heart warming. Teaches us the importance of family, friendship, and not being in such a rush to grow up and stop believing in the unbelievable. Over all a high 10 out of 10.
