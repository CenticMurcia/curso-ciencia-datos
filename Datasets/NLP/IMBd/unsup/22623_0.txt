this version aired in the 80's when i was just around 10 years old, i remember so well watching with my mother and loving it so much because we had the soundtrack with Robert Goulet singing...he kissed my mother at a concert in Edmonton when she was a young girl...tragic that the world only knows the gene Kelly version...he is not an issue, just the whole movie, all dancing and the singing is weak. i wish CBS had not destroyed the original...someone must have taped it on one occasion...please let us know if we discover one! the record is really very good and Peter Falk one can never go wrong. funny that made for TV can be so much better.
