If you like confusing flashbacks, good cinematography, competent acting and like to solve puzzles, this may be the film for you.<br /><br />The problem with this production is that after you take the time to solve the puzzle you realize that you've been been conned.<br /><br />There really is nothing to do this other than the idea of showing a part of New Orleans that doesn't revolve around Mardi Gras, Bourbon Street, romance or the conflicts between cajuns, blacks, rednecks and old plantation owners. Once you get past those things you realize that New Orleans is just a regular city with good and bad qualities but just a little flashier than Cincinnatti or Louisville.<br /><br />The story, if you can call it that, revolves around a promising pro golfer who got bounced off the tour because he wanted to search for the "meaning of life" and decided to drink along the way.<br /><br />The "way" brings him into a relationship with two sisters who he went to grade school or something with and a possibly closet gay attorney, Jared Harris. who has also fallen victim to the evils of drink.<br /><br />Oh and his late father was of course a groundskeeper at a wealthy country club which the two sisters are members of.<br /><br />There are some scenes of him Campbell Scott, our hero, running to find a train constantly blocking his path across the tracks and of course a "seer" commenting that "another will be along" when he misses a ride on the trolley. And of course when he does get across the tracks he finds himself in a flophouse with the "po folk" and is rescued by one or the other of the two sisters.<br /><br />Then the attorney may or may not have been killed so the local police naturally think he may or may not have done it for the insurance money.<br /><br />Make sense so far? Well there are also two escapees from one of Jack Kerouac's bad dreams who are also suspects and a family friend who is a drug dealer with guilt feelings. <br /><br />The writer threw those characters in to make a gullible viewer, like myself, think this was an art film and had some kind of deep meaning.<br /><br />David Lynch often does that too as witness the success of "Blue Velvet".<br /><br />But be advised I gave this a 3 out of 10 only because the photography is very good and the cast obviously needed the money and tries very hard.<br /><br />If you are worried about your 401K monies or your bar tab, don't rent this.
