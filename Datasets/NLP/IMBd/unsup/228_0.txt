I had the good fortune of a teacher lending me this in high school. It may be the best documentary ever. Two British film makers traveled to 25 countries recording pieces of music and then fusing them together via laptop, and the results are a stunning fusion of world musics and editing. If that weren't enough there's interviews with artists, scientists, religious scholars, mystics, authors (Kurt Vonnegut and Tom Robbins, actors, activists, prostitutes, people on the street divided into twelve chapters "Time, Confrontation, Sex, Masks, God, Faith, Blasphemy, Unity, Death, Money, Inspiration, and Happiness." Each is broken up into a song, to it's easy to watch in pieces or all the way through. Inspiring music, concepts, and message, should be seen by anyone with an interested in anything. One of the best films ever made.
