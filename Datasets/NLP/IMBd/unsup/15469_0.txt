This is my favorite film in existence! I love it heart and soul! The wilderness shots are inspiring, the story is exciting and full of adventure and freedom and the music is exquisite! I'm am unbelievably furious the soundtrack is unavailable!!!! Meredith Salenger is captivating as Natty, an undaunted tomboy who runs away (from an unbearable landlady) cross-country to find her dad, who is logging in the wilderness of Washington State! Set during the Great Depression, she rides the rails and scrounges for food. Along the way she becomes comrades with a beautiful wolf, who protects & aids her, and meets up with a young, savvy hobo, played by John Cusack. She finds plenty of adventure, as her father, who was forced to leave her under the landlady's care until he had the money for her passage, is devastated that she has run away and possibly been crushed by a train. I love this movie with all my heart, so I hope you will watch it and then write the record companies DEMANDING a SOUNDTRACK be released!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
