I just watched the DVD of this movie and loved it. A doesn't-take-itself-to-seriously romp of a true story about basketball point shaving in the early 90's. Krumholtz is fantastic (as usual). Ernest Dickerson does a great job. And the script is sharp. Big props to FX these days for doing some colorful stuff. If your interested in seeing a made for cable movie that attempts, and often succeeds, at doing something special... check this one
