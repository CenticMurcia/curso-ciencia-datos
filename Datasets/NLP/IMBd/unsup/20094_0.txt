Yeun Woo-Ping inspired movie madness. This film, especially its R2 DVD English dubbed version, is the funniest kung-fu movie I've ever had the pleasure of watching. Do not take this film seriously as it certainly doesn't.<br /><br />Plot revolves around an evil falsatto shaolin master who has the ability to contro his 'invincible armour' by locating his weak spot in a certain part of the body. It's simply ridiculous... One of the most amusing demonstrations of the ivincible armour includes someone jumping from the second storey of a building directly onto the stomach of a super hard dude...<br /><br />You must see this...
