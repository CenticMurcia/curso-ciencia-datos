This movie was perverted, overly violent, and horribly acted. I can hardly consider it a B- movie. You couldn't help but hate the two so-called "good guys" about as much as you hated the "bad guys." The entire time Eric Roberts' character was taking part in all the crimes and murders alongside the mobsters, sleeping with countless women, and you even find out that he killed his former partner and it really is not explained why other than "he was in the way." Plus, the storyline is dark, depressing, and grimy and it contains a sex scene worthy of HBO late night. The only good part of the movie was the ending, and I mean the ENDING like when the credits were all done. If you ever see it on TV, turn it off immediately before you want to kill yourself.
