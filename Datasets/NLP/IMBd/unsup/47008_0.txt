It has an interesting idea and concept, sort of, I will give it that...however it is *almost* completely unwatchable. I will watch almost ANYTHING, and even I had to admit - its a seriously god-awful film. The sound doesn't match the video, which is rather unnerving to begin with. There IS decent nudity early on which wasn't *great*, but did help some, I guess; without that, I would have been much angrier that I spent almost two and a half dollars to see this. To be honest, I couldn't even watch it to the end, it was that bad, and not even in a 'so bad it's good' way. I feel like the "one star" rating is really a star (or two) too many. These people owe me over an hour of my life back. I'll forgive sitting through the dressing room scene, but thats as much credit as they're getting from me, and probably more than they deserve. I think that, in the unlikely event that someone actually PAID someone else to see this tripe, the person who was paid would still be getting the raw end of the deal. I wish I could UN-see it, and I cant.
