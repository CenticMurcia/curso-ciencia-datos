I absolutely despise this movie. There is not a single laugh. You'd think after having respectable names from the field of comedy that this hunk of junk might actually be worth something. Not a chance.<br /><br />I can't believe that Kevin McDonald and Rodney Dangerfield didn't provide any good ad-lib to make this movie work somehow. The guy who wrote and directed this garbage should be put on death row for making them follow his brain-dead script. If this movie went completely out of print and no one ever heard from it again, the world would be a few steps closer to being a better place.
