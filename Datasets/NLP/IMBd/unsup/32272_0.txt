I have seen the movie and i can say that this motion picture is pure Croatian all thought money gave many all ex republics of former Yugoslavia for production of same.I know same of readers of this will think that i loved Serbian former politics but that is not true and this is not politics that i am writing about.In the movie you will see all the god and the bad things about the former homeland, beginning is full of the beauty of Yugoslavia and the end is going with the beauty of Croatian islands same can say OK it was nice but this is nice too it is far smaller but it is beautiful.OK never mind i like all ex republics but why going beck? may-bee because it was good for living? if you ask me i do not know.
