I discovered this awful flick on imbd by accident while doing a search for Ken Russell's "The Music Lover". When I read the "storyline" (a generous characterization on my part) for "The Opera Lover" I recalled seeing it (or portions thereof until I turned it off in agony) on probably the same late night cable channel another reviewer did. This flick should really be picked up by MST3K (Mystery Science Theater 3000) as one of the really bad movies the poor souls are forced to watch as they drift endlessly through the cosmos.<br /><br />The acting...be that as it may...is laughable and wouldn't even cut it for 3rd rate community theater. The "tenor" and star of the joke is an overweight trucker who rediscovers a lost love (I'm guessing it's a spoof of an opera diva) when she comes to town during an undefined concert tour. Along the way we see the "star's" family trying to fill in the blanks while they stumble through this tedious waste of film. The only somewhat...tolerable...character is the alcoholic dad who mumbles unintelligible words of encouragement to the star struck son. Yes, it's a mishmash of an undertaking to say the least. If you're a total masochist and/or related to the would-be actors then by all means watch it.if it ever emerges again on late night TV. If none of the above, save your time and watch a Petticoat Junction rerun; you'll find it infinitely more professional and still worth a chuckle.
