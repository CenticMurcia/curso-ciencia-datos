<br /><br />This worthless collection of anti-military cliches is so bad that it actually makes Battlefield Earth look good by comparison. It demonstrates that the writers and director were completely ignorant of nuclear weaponry, military procedures, and even basic geography. One of the very worst movies ever made.
