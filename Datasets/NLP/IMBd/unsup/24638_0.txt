I read an in-depth article about this series in either "Filmfax" or "Outre" and it stuck in my mind - I had never heard of the series before. When I saw "The Very Best of One Step Beyond" DVD on sale for about $6 - I thought why not buy it??? I have never regretted it. I don't know whether the standard of television is so abysmal now but I have seen half the episodes and apart from 2 (The Aerialist with Mike "Touch" Connors and Yvette Vickers and "The Ordeal on Locust Street" - just my own personal view) they are all winners. Some of the standouts for me :- "Night of April 14" with Patrick Macnee - about a couple that are going on their honeymoon aboard the "Titanic". The host then talked about a book that had been published in the 1890s about a ship called the "Titan" that could not be sunk<br /><br />- it was very eerie!!! I must say that all the shows are based on real life occurrences. "The Return of Michael Campion" with Patrick O'Neal - about a man that holidays on a remote island - yet all the locals know him and dislike him!!! That show was a talking point all the afternoon - how could that happen etc. "The Vision" with Pernell Roberts about a group of soldiers in World War 1 that see a strange glow in the sky. I have read of a few different people who saw the same glow in different parts of the world at the very same time. "The Dark Room" with Cloris Leachman - about a strange man that consents to be photographed. "Echo" with Ross Martin, about a man's murderous past that catches up with him. Joanne Linville was in a couple and made an impression. "Delusion" starred the lovely Susanne Pleschette and "The Visitor" has a young and very handsome Warren Beatty.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
