This is an ultra low budget indie horror film, refreshingly old fashioned and well made for its kind. Some of the settings were atmospheric and the acting was pretty good (although the main villain is kind of stiff he's suitably despicable). I rather enjoyed the leisurely pacing, although it gets more frantic (and goofier) in the last fifteen minutes. The girls were cute and charming and capably acted. But the most unusual aspect of this film is that it's a feminist statement in disguise! It's all about how scum bag "artistes" manipulate gullible young women by holding the lure of fame and fortune over their empty little heads. I was pretty surprised to see this kind of social comment in a cheap indie horror movie --- although that didn't stop the director from showing enough young female skin to keep the fans happy!
