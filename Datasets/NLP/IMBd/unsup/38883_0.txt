Not to be confused with a 2002 movie starring James Coburn.<br /><br />This is an insult to him, and his last piece of work!!! Movies have to have unique names! Is that so difficult. I'm giving a bad rating just for this fact! <br /><br />Aren't there enough words in our vocabulary?<br /><br />It really does a disservice to the earlier film of the same title if it is not a remake.<br /><br />It's confusing for the viewer and may take away potential income from the previous film.<br /><br />SAG requires all actors to have unique names, why not the same with movie titles? Is it so difficult, Richard Dean Anderson had to stick the "Dean" in because of the existence of Richard Anderson, known by many as Oscar Goldman on Six Million Dollar Man. Let us not forget Bill Macy from "Maude" and "The Jerk", still a cut up in his 80's, , and William H. Macy frequent David Manet collaborator. Jeff Dranetz
