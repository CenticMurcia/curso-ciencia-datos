Spoilers (not that there was much to spoil)<br /><br />Hard Men often threatened to be quite good but never was. Ross Boatman was the pick of the actors & I thought the main three were all ok.<br /><br />The problem with the film was that the first ten minutes set up all the characters & a plot, but then that was it. Nothing new was introduced from then on, either via character or plot. Consequently, all we were left with was the group arguing amongst themselves & inevitably shooting each other until only one was left for the remaining hour & a half.<br /><br />4/10
