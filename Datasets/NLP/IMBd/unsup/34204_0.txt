I have never felt moved to write a movie review before... but this was so bad and such a total waste of time that I feel obligated to warn others... just as I would if I knew the plague was headed our way...<br /><br />The plot (well, what plot, really?) was insipid, the acting was horrid, the dialogue inane... And it wasn't in the least bit scary, save for a few (very few) momentary snatches of startle reflex. About the only good thing I can say about this movie (and it is a stretch) is that there are parts that are so bad that the campiness of the scene or character sticks in one's mind... but unfortunately rather like a fish bone in one's throat! The only reason I even finished watching the movie is that I have some issues with OCD in certain venues, and one of the weirder (and in this case maddeningly inconvenient) manifestations of this is that once I start a movie, I feel compelled to finish it... although, on this one I almost threw in the towel. My wife had the good sense to roll over and fall asleep after the first 15 minutes, the fact of which I am certainly envious.<br /><br />Avoid this movie! Seriously, it has nothing remotely worth your time to offer... My wife and I wanted to see it in part because we just returned from our yearly vacation in Maine, and we hoped to see some Maine scenes in addition to watching a good New England horror flick around Halloween. But dear reader, trust me when I tell you that this movie is one fat BUST and if you decide to waste your time and dollars on it, you can't say you haven't been forewarned!
