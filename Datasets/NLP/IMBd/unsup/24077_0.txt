The first "real" Hitchcock film leaves a lasting impression from the atmosphere - a killer (rape is, of course, not mentioned) is on the loose in London. Most of the action takes place at night, and the plot is centred around a family who struggle to make ends meet, and so take in a lodger. Hitchcock once said that he liked to make films with a contemporary setting because he could understand the minutiae of the character's daily lives. This is reflected in the realism of the family's situation.<br /><br />Many people comment unfavourably about the soundtracks on most DVD releases of silent films. Unless it was specifically intended to go with the film, I always turn the sound off - don't let some arbitrary piece of music spoil your enjoyment.<br /><br />"The Lodger" and "Frenzy" stand at either end of the director's career, both with "Jack the Ripper" style plots, and both set in London. Both contain bravura technical shots - famously in the "Lodger" there are the glass ceiling and the staircase. We have an engaging plot, good characterisation, and innovative visual storytelling. Hitchcock really did start as he meant to go on.
