Ram Gopal Verma strikes gold once again as debuting Randeep Hooda stars in this absolutely breathtaking movie! Full marks to the acting of Randeep, Chunkey Pandey and the others. Good music too although the editing and directing is not up to the mark. A story highlighting the success of a middle-class man in the dark side of society. From a mechanic in Dubai to a gangster in Mumbai, D portrays the idealism and expressions of an average-Joe in the underworld. Jealousy, suspicion, murder ....... this movie has everything. The background score and the only 3 songs in it gets the audience enthralled. Rumours have it that this movie actually depicts how the International Don Dawood Ibrahim came to power.<br /><br />Overall, a must watch for RGVs fans.
