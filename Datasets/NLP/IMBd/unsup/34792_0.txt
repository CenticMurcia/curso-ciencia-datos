When radio singer Lee Bowman refuses to renew his contract, talent scout Jack Carson ventures out to look for a new star. He finds Doris Day - a significant improvement! The story is similar to "A Star Is Born". How Ms. Day goes undiscovered for so long with such a striking voice is not convincing. Day is a single parent (in the film, it is stated that she lost her husband during World War II), which helps set up the film's highlight - a cute dream sequence for her son features an animated Bugs Bunny. The soundtrack isn't exceptional, but Day performs the songs well. "My Dream Is Yours" is colorful and routine. <br /><br />**** My Dream Is Yours (1949) Michael Curtiz ~ Doris Day, Jack Carson, Eve Arden
