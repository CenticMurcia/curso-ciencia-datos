Just when you think you are in a for a predictable story with predictable characters, the film makers start to turn the world and the characters upside down and inside out. With blind alleys full of red herrings, what seemed so simple becomes a tense, scary and genuinely unsettling film. I sort of, but didn't quite, guess what might be happening but the journey felt as real as it could be. I think it's a first film and if so, it's pretty impressive. If you just want straight horror with blood, bodies and cardboard characters go and see a Hollywood horror film. This is different. The location slowly turns from a beautiful faraway beach into a place that feels as spooky in the bright sun as an old churchyard at night.
