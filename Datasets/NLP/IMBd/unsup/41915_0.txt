OK, I need to make a disclosure first: This movie is just plain camp as far as i can tell. The plot is highly UN-original, and the characters appear to be conceived in caricature. The script seems almost to have been written in the mid nineties judging by the production design and the references. In fact, the first time i saw it on TV i thought it was 6 or 7 years older than it actually was.<br /><br />But, gosh i just cant put my finger on it, the film actually draws you in. Perhaps because i'm of the same age. Also, it works if you watch it from an outsider's standpoint. Here you get a glimpse of the shallow, self-centered reality that LA and much of the US is infected with. As noted previously, the cast plays its part in that over-the-top way common in cult or camp. And it works! Frankly, the script couldn't support anything more.<br /><br />Yet, I end up caring for the characters and their story.<br /><br />Entertaining if you watch it half conscious or sleepy, a bright and fun piece of culture this is.
