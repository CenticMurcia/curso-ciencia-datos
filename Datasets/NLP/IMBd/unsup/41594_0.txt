I hate almost everything about this film. What the hell were people thinking??? They actually cast an old fart and some kind of bird to play two teenage boys who want to go on a shag-athon in Ibiza!!! They look older than Kevin's bloody parents. All of this is made even worse by the 'kids' overdone mannerisms, talk and clothing which are not funny, but plain stupid. All in all I'd have to say that this makes films like Dude where is my car? and The naked gun resemble the works of an intelligent and funny person. The only thing in this film, that looks as if it had been done carefully is the selection of supreme birds that Kevin and Perry can drool over. I'm not sure this deserves a point, but heyÂ…<br /><br />1 out of 10<br /><br />post scriptum: I realize that is sort of a prolonged sketch and that therefore a chick and an old fart play the teens, but as a film that sort of crap just don't work! Apart from that it just ain't funny.
