This is horrible, even for a children's movie. The animation is much too cartoony for a story this dark, and the voice acting is so bad not even John Huston's Gandalf can save it. The Rankin/Bass Hobbit was a good children's movie, Ralph Bashki's animated Lord of the Rings was a hugely ambitious project that didn't quite work out, but this is just garbage. The songs are terrible, (unusual for a Rankin/Bass production) the plot makes no sense at all, and worst of all, the elves look as deformed and hideous as Gollum. There is absolutly no reason to see this, it's not a "so bad its good" movie like The Hobbit, it's just bad.
