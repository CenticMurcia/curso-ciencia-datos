I loved this movie! It was like watching my own life as a boy and as I still am, with imagination and the integrity to stand up for what you believe in and not let anyone take you down!<br /><br />A boy is separated from his family believing that some one cares about him and there are people trying to track him down, both the good ones and the bad! <br /><br />About the movie: Very fun and entertaining! Mild, VERY mild! content that might offend some people, but based upon what I see in most movies these days if a movie could even be rated as "G", this one should!<br /><br />Please remember that August says that he can hear the MUSIC which is every sound that he hears! (everything he can understand!!) This is important to get the meaning of this movie and get the best feeling out of the climax!!!!
