When this shows up, I watch it, never seeming to remember that I've already seen it. It's very predictable. It's implausible. It's forgettable.<br /><br />The cast is good. I always get a kick out of Sydney Greenstreet. Humphrey Bogart was a good actor, though I am not a slavish worshiper by any means. Alexis Smith does OK, as she always did. And Rose Hobart is an excellent, cold villain as the wife who -- well, I won't give it away.<br /><br />She is too unpleasant. Why would the two of them still be married? She is an incessant nag and a scold, with never a kind word to say.<br /><br />And once we learn that Greenstreet is a psychiatrist -- it's pretty easy to write the basic plot outline oneself.
