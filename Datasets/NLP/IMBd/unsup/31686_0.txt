I am 56 years old. I normally do not care for "children's movies." Even as a child I did not care for children's movies. My movie heroes were adults.<br /><br />However, this movie is one the rare exceptions to my stated preference.<br /><br />Nanny McPhee is a wonderful movie. Though it is a children's movie, the script is written so that it can be enjoyed on an adult level. It reminds me somewhat of a cross between "Miracle on 34th Street," "The Wizard of Oz," and "The Parent Trap,"(the one with Hayley Mills). It is funny, poignant, mysterious, supernatural and fanciful.<br /><br />Here are some other things I enjoyed about this film: <br /><br />1. It treats its audience with respect. Unlike most of today's films (which assume movie goers are idiots) it presents a story with a logical beginning, middle and ending, so that if you accept the world it creates, that world can be followed to its satisfying conclusion.<br /><br />2. The children act like--children! No mini-adults here, who are filled with all Macully Caulkin knowledge and wisdom so that if only--if only--the adults would just simply listen to them--why then, the world would be a perfect place where everyone would just get along so well together. No, these children need direction, love, understanding and discipline, and those themes are ones this movie explores.<br /><br />3. It is literate. The script writer, actress Emma Thompson, uses language in a manner designed to communicate rather than to just make a bunch of noise while pretending to say something while saying nothing. <br /><br />In conclusion, I earlier stated that I do not care for most children's movies. (Oh, there are exceptions--"A Christmas Story" comes to mind.) So, if I say it's good, believe me, it is good.<br /><br />I have purposely not revealed much of the plot. Go see the movie and allow the plot to reveal itself to you. You'll be glad if you do, and you will have participated in a truly satisfying movie going experience. I promise. Cross my heart and hope to die.
