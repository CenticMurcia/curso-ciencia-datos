Unlike many of the screwball comedies of the 1930s, this one is a bit different because it is both funny AND excellent social commentary. The film makes fun of the cult of celebrity as well as the fickle and short attention-span of the public. The film begins with a cute scene--as a foreign potentate is being honored at a fancy dinner. However, the "celebrity" turns out to be a hoax and the reporter responsible (Frederic March) for promoting this fake is demoted by the newspaper boss, Walter Connelly (who, as usual, is very funny in a supporting role as a blow-hard boss whose nerves are frayed).<br /><br />Later, March is able to convince his boss for one more chance, as he convinces him he has a new and TRUE human interest story the newspaper can promote--a pretty young lady dying from radium poisoning! The lady turns out to be wacky Carole Lombard and just before March shows up to interview her, she finds out from her dopey doctor (Charles Winninger) that he was wrong in his diagnosis and she will live after all. March does NOT know this and innocently promises to take Lombard to New York and make her a celebrity. Well, as Lombard's life in Vermont is pretty dull, she doesn't tell him the truth and goes to the big city to be wined and dined as well as being given the key to the city!! It all snowballs very quickly into a nationwide obsession with this "dying" woman and at this point it's too late to tell the truth! <br /><br />This is only about the first 2/3 of the film. How all this is successfully resolved without them ending up in prison is for you to see for yourself. Also, if you are interested, this was later remade by Martin and Lewis as LIVING IT UP. I personally preferred the 1937 version because of its excellent acting and fast pace. Not a great film, but a very good one that's sure to please.
