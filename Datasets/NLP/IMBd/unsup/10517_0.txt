I should have seen it at least 3 times on my cable. Something attracted me that kept glued to the film till the end. The human value with its high and low at the war time is well depicted. The performance by the cast is excellent. u will find yourself involved into the story much as the story goes ahead. The baby is so cute, and they have made it to act so nicely. Not a fun time film. but a film to be spend when u feel like watching a good one. A film sure to be not missed out. u will like it for sure. special mention the actor deserves. u could find his eyes speak the most. the fear for the child's life, and the last scenes were really shot nicely. the song the mother sings towards the end of the film when the terrorists keep killing the travelers does not only make the child to put into sleep, but am sure your viewers throats would have become harder.<br /><br />~mothish babu~
