Right from the first line you know that you are in for a bad experience.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is truly awful and it beggars belief how the people responsible for this disaster could allow such bad delivery of lines.<br /><br />There's a surprise just before the opening credits that should give you an idea of whether or not you are going to enjoy this film. I won't spoil it for you, except to say that I laughed out loud where I should have been shocked, thrilled or perhaps scared.<br /><br />The overall movie felt home made and the kids left the room to play after 20 minutes of the most tedious 'action' Avoid this movie if at all possible - it's dull, poorly acted and you don't even want to KNOW about the 'swashbuckling sword fights'!!
