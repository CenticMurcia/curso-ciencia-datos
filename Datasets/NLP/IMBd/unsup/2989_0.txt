At times a little slow, but an above average TV drama with thrills and suspense. This psychological passage is about a private eye(Mark Harmon) and the woman(Mimi Rogers) who hires him to find her missing husband(Cliff De Young). Very watchable and personally I liked this a whole lot better than PROOF OF LIFE(2000)which is more or less the same story. Harmon is cool without trying to be macho. Miss Rogers is flawless and to die for. In support: M.Emmet Walsh, Paul Gleason and Michael Boatman.
