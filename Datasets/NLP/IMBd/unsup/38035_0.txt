As a fan of "Chinese Hero", it is very disappointing to see this movie. These are the reasons: 1.Acting is very very bad.<br /><br />2.Story doesn't have anything to do with the original comic. Except the characters are in this movie.<br /><br />3.Special effects are very very bad, except the scene with the swordfighting with water.<br /><br />4.Story is very very boring...<br /><br />5.It's directed very very crappy, totally not interesting. Bad usage of flashbacks.<br /><br />6.Fighting scenes are too short<br /><br />7.characters lack any depth. No personality...nothing...just saying their lines.<br /><br />8.It was DUBBED!!! $^&%#@&(#@&^@#%^*<br /><br />Even though stormriders was a bad movie, at least it was entertaining.<br /><br />It's a shame they released this movie. The TV-series by ATV were much better.
