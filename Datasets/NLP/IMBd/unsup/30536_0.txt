In London, the aspirant actress Eve Gill (Jane Wyman) and her friend Jonathan Cooper (Richard Todd) are fleeing from the police in her car to her father's boat two hours far from the city. Eve has a crush on Jonathan that tells her that a couple of hours later, his mistress and actress Charlotte Inwood (Marlene Dietrich) had come to his apartment with her dress covered of gore and telling that she had killed her husband. Jonathan decided to go to her apartment to bring a new dress for Charlotte, but her maid saw him in the crime scene and called the police that are chasing him as prime suspect. Eve's father Commodore Gill (Alistair Sim) lodges Jonathan at his house and the man destroys the dress that is the evidence of the murder. Eve decides to investigate by herself to prove Jonathan's innocence and gets closer to Charlotte, working as temporary maid. Meanwhile Detective Wilfred Smith (Michael Wilding) that is in charge of the case befriends Eve and they fall in love for each.<br /><br />"Stage Fright" is a delightfully naive film of Alfred Hitchcock and the last in his British phase. Jane Wyman performs a naive wannabe actress that decides to investigate a murder with her eccentric father and unravels the truth. Marlene Dietrich is the manipulative actress and singer for whom men fall and are capable of anything to be with her. Romance and humor are present along this suspenseful story in this minor movie of Hitchcock. This time, the cameo of Alfred Hitchcock is on the street, the pedestrian in London that crosses Eve. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Pavor nos Bastidores" ("Funk in the Backstage")
