Um... Duh... Ah... Who needs ten lines when one will do? Now let's see... One... Two... Three... Almost there. Now here it comes! Hang on to your seats because it's a real spoiler. At the core of this film lies the profoundly disturbing revelation that can be best expressed by the following: I looked into it, and after a few minutes I realized that it was too deep for me. There! Nothing new. Been there, done that, and you and I and the endearing people of Minnesota do not need to be reminded by some artsy-fartsy indie film-maker that we are all just a bunch of dumbass fools. <br /><br />Still not enough lines for submission?! I give up. What does one have to do to have one's opinions heard? Beat a pithy insight to death with a redundancy of words? Redundant? Now that's this film in a word.
