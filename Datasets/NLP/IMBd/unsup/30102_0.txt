Honestly, this show has some of the worst acting I have ever seen. I hate every character (except Jack, but he can be really annoying at times.) The plots are so ridiculous and drawn out it almost gets so extreme that you want to throw up. Not to mention it's boring as hell. Wait, wait, there's maybe two or three action scenes in an entire season, in a show that is labeled "action." Seriously, there is no action, horrible stories, and absolutely ridiculous acting. If you want to watch something good and original, watch LOST. Now that is a quality show.<br /><br />L O S T<br /><br />Owns!
