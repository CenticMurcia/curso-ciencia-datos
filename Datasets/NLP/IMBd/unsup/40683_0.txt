I heard that Ikki Tousen was a great anime and that it was based off of Romance of the Three Kingdoms. So I thought, "Hey, it can't be this bad, can it?"...Big mistake there. Plot: The show is about a girl named Sonsaku Hakufu, a total stupid spoiled whore, who has the spirit of Sun Ce. Anyhow, she's destined to unite the school just like her counterpart seven centuries ago. Lastly, every kid is an expert fighter. No joke. EVERY. SINGLE. KID. And the fight scenes...don't get me started. All they do is just fight, sudden attack, girl loses 99% of her clothing, someone wins. And the characters are laughably bad. There's Ryofu (who has the spirit of Lu Bu) and is a total SLUT. No joke. Nearly every girl in the anime has boobs the size of a house...seriously, what the hell? And not to mention Hakufu has a worthless cousin named Shuuyu Koukin who says he can fight, but he can't. And the dub sucks. By sucks, I mean Mortal kombat annihilation sucks. Really, everyone in the dub sounds like they are either on crack or are unemotional. Really, it has three seasons, but it's not worth watching. And also, it makes even ROTK and DW look bad. I swear, this anime is just simply Mortal kombat meets hentai. I wish I could give this a -10 out of 10, but I can't, so I'll give it a 1/10.
