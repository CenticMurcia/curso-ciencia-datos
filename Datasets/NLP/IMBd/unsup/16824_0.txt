I had heard about this movie from Harry Medved's fantastic book THE FIFTY WORST FILMS OF ALL-TIME, as it is one of the 50. Because of that, I probably had a slight predisposition to dislike the film--though I liked it more than Medved, as it was not even close to being that bad! But, I could easily see that Medved's recounting of how the film was made would conspire to make a poor movie. Apparently, Alfred Hitchcock was the director of this film, but Charles Laughton was both the star and owned the production company. Apparently, again and again, Laughton ignored his director and instead of a subtle or believable performance, he was shrill and bellicose--looking nothing like the great actor he was in some of his other films. In fact, I noticed in several of his early films, Laughton yelled his lines and over-acted terribly and without a director in firm control, I could really see it impact the film. Plus, apparently, in disgust, Hitchcock pretty much gave up on the film and quickly completed it so he could leave England for Hollywood. If this troubled production in any way contributed to his decision to leave the UK, I just don't know.<br /><br />Apart from the overacting by Laughton, the biggest problem is that I expected a mystery or suspense film. But, as the "secrets" of the film were revealed in the first few minutes (duh--it was pretty obvious that young Maureen O'Hara had walked into a nest of vipers), there was no suspense or mystery at all. Like the silly nose that Laughton wore throughout the film, the movie just seemed fake and silly--just not bottom 50 bad--maybe bottom 250!
