Life can be tough when you are a resurrected French vampire maiden. Especially so when you crave a constant supply of ready fresh blood. Fortunately the vampire in this film has her trusty blood-sister to help her out and keep those bothersome American tourists away from the castle. Overall this is a fairly typical Â‘Salvation Films' release with the mandatory candle lit atmospheric scenes. Worth a look, I reckon.
