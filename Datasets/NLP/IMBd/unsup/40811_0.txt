While I'm not a fan of this kind of humour, it is testament to England's ability to produce quality programmes that is echoed the world over.<br /><br />Even though I haven't seen the American version of this show, and have no wish to, it does beg the question, why can't American TV execs watch a British comedy without saying "that's a good programme, very popular, lets do it ourselves" And ruin it. Not that this programme needs ruining since it did it, itself. But alas, I am clearly in the minority, this show has stood the test of time with countless re-runs on BBCtv, UK Gold, and while I stand to be corrected, even on Paramount Comedy. So credit to the actors in the show!
