I gave this movie a 9 because as much as I did enjoy it there were a few things that didn't completely make sense. However it was a good movie. I am not a Christian, but I saw this with my mom who happens to be a Christian and both of us greatly enjoyed it. Drew Fuller (Black Sash, Charmed, and Army Wives) was brilliant I think that he really showed his range in the film. Abigail Breslin was great and she and Drew had great chemistry as did Drew and Ali Hillis whose great performance I think was lost in the shuffle. All in all, the cast was great, the acting was great, the script was...well, it could have been easier to understand and it was good, and the directing could have been better but I suggest that everyone sees it. The Ultimate Gift is a really great feel good film and whether you are 8 or 80 you can appreciate the message that the film tries to get across.
