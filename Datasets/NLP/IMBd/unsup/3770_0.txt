This is certainly an interesting study of a psychopathic killer and of the man who sets out to track him down after his fiance disappears mysteriously at a gasoline stop in France. It is known in the English speaking world as THE VANISHING and was remade in 1993 with an American cast. Without revealing the startling denouement, one cannot explain the most attractive aspects of the film, which is the detailed study of both tracker and killer that occupies most of the last half. The unsatisfying part is that while we see many details of these two men's lives, we are given little insight into their motivations. We have to "piece it out" for ourselves. That's probably what the director wanted. Madness and curiosity are obvious motivations, but not really enough. With these cavils, I will still say that SPOORLOOS is at once terrifying, gripping,...and, well, amazing. It is well acted but poorly photographed and edited. One suspects the director is of the sort who doesn't regard these things as important.
