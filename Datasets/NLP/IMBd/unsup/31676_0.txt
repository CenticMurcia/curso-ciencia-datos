Emma Thompson did a phenomenal job with the screenplay for this movie. It was a charming story, with lots of dry wit. The cast is marvelous too...all of the children seem "real" and not too cutesy. Emma herself, as the title character, is calm and funny at the same time. It certainly doesn't hurt that Colin Firth plays the father! (I'd watch him read the dictionary). Kelly MacDonald is also marvelous as Evangeline. And I need to mention Angela Lansbury (who wore a marvelous fake hooked nose...it took me a few minutes to recognize her)...she is also very funny in her role. Lots of great supporting characters, too, like Celia Imrie, Imelda Staunton, Derek Jacobi, and Patrick Barlowe...any fan of British cinema will enjoy the cast.<br /><br />This is a great family movie, though toddlers will be bored...older children will better understand the humor.
