This looks like it was made by film school dropouts if that film school was in kindergarten. Bas Rutten is the only reason I would check this out and even then I was embarrassed for him to be associated with such incompetence. I expected some decent martial arts action since Bas Rutten is an all-time great fighter (Pancrase, the Ultimate Fighting Championship) and Insonato is also a martial artist herself but this movie can't even deliver that. If you like Rutten do him a favor and don't watch this! Anyone who gives this a good review obviously did not watch it or was involved with the production of it because no sane person who is familiar with television or film could find this at all acceptable to spend their money or time on.
