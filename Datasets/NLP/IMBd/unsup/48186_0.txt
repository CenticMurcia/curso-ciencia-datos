This may be the worst Women in prison flick i've ever seen. The movie is wall to wall sex and after a while it stops being a Women in prison movie and just becomes a softcore (slightly hardcore) porno.<br /><br />Now i don't necessarily object to softcore films, but when i watch a WIP movie, i have certain expectations. There are certain genre conventions that should probably be followed. Most of these films have a slightly teasing nature about the sex and most have much denser stories than this one. This is not a genre where plot is all that important, but the story here is weak even when you keep that in mind. There is no story at all. It's just a series of scenes with lots of nudity. The acting is terrible, the characters are all weak and predictable. There is very little humor... The film tries to be funny, but fails utterly. There is very little action, it just meanders from one sex scene to another. It's just pure drudgery once you get bored with all the sex and their's so much of it, that won't take very long.<br /><br />The director of this film is one of the blandest i have ever seen. There is no sense of visual style, no atmosphere. All the lighting is flat, all the editing utterly conventional. There is nothing interesting about the camera work and most scenes play out in a boring, predictable fashion. The pacing is horrid... It's basically shot with less artistry than most porno films. It's lacks any sense of style at all. <br /><br />As a softcore film, I suppose it succeeds to some degree but it's almost too mean spirited to be erotic.. As a WIP film, it lacks any pretension of underlying substance or plot, and the film doesn't benefit from the absence.<br /><br />Watch "The Big Bird Cage" instead to see how these movies are supposed to be made. It's full of fun and interesting characters, has a much more substantial story and while there are fewer sex scenes and less nudity, what's there has a greater impact than anything "Bare behind bars" has to offer. Even a film like "Emmanuelle in prison" which is only a middling effort in the WIP genre, is still ten times better than this one.
