I didn't have great expectations, so it isn't that ruining the experience for me, but Arn - Tempelriddaren failed to engage me in any case. I haven't read the Guillou-book, but the story seemed so simplified that I fear the book is the same. Let's hope not.<br /><br />The best thing is the photography and the scenery. This is good, and believable.<br /><br />The worst thing is that the film is extremely slow, even for persons enjoying slow films. The film is trying some times to be witty, but mostly fails.<br /><br />The main actors are not very believable, but are too caricatured. They are impossible to like, except perhaps a couple of the older supporting roles. Even Arn as a kid is not charming. Maybe he is supposed to be a bit stupid, growing wise. The trouble is that Arn never grows to look wise, not even bearded in the holy land.<br /><br />All the women in the film seems to have scarred upper lips (maby something they had a 1000 years ago (?!?) and the films love scenes are unbelievable childish.<br /><br />I'm afraid to say that this film was a great disappointment. I give it a 2 out of 10 as it would give some romantic story readers good value. If you're looking for action, look elsewhere, or actually anywhere else.
