James Woods hams it up beautifully as the "cop" with a REAL bad attitude, and Charles Durning adds a nice touch as his police buddy.<br /><br />Over the top, overacted and hard to believe, but pretty damn fun to watch, with one of the greatest "smack you upside the head" endings I've ever seen in my twenty-six years on this planet. Check this one out and have a good time.
