This a pretty suspenseful tale. It has some great heavyweights. John Payne (The Restless Gun) plays an ex-con who is set up in a robbery. He must infiltrate the lair of the bad guys to clear his name. It seems like an insurmountable task. There is a nice covey of bad guys who are not traceable because they wore masks during the robbery and never saw each other's faces. Payne is kicked around by the cops, the villains, and by society. He hooks up with an aspiring female attorney who is unwittingly connected to the crime. While the conclusion may be a bit unsatisfying, there are some neat tough-guy scenes as the crooks position themselves to get their hands on the loot which is being held by "the big guy." Jack Elam is great as the nervous, almost spastic first victim. He wears his paranoia on his sleeve and his nerves get the best of him. It was a lot more than I expected.
