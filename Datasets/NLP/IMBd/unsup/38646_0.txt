First and foremost, I find it incredible that back in 1995 this film got an 18 cert in the U.K, and films like Straw Dogs or the Texas Chainsaw Massacre were still being refused.<br /><br />I saw this film in 1995. It is a film I would never choose to watch today, but as a 15 year old I was curious about its content, and was constantly in search of shocking horror films. This is not a horror film. It is not a documentary. It is a collage of gross video footage of people having their lives ended in brutal fashion. The people behind the cameras are probably as sick as the people conducting the executions.<br /><br />Maybe some of the people who were executed had been fairly tried and found guilty of terrible crimes, but this is not explained in the 'film'. And even if it was, would it really make any difference?<br /><br />I have read some of the other comments on this film, and find it laughable that people have praised its content, and have even suggested it be used for educational purposes! This film tries to justify itself as exposing mans inhumanity to man. No, this film is for shock value only, and I suspect that most people who seek it out are na√Øve thrill seekers, or just plain sick. I was a member of the former group!<br /><br />If you want sick blood and guts, get your kicks from a horror film, and when you leave the cinema you can be safe in the knowledge that you have just been shocked and exhilarated by the skill and genius of a special effects and make up team.
