This really was a wonderful movie. I was just a child when all this was going on and don't remember the newscasts about it. Later, I watched it with my Mom and she told me she knew some of the people involved. The things that William Bradley did were awful, but it is a true story and people are sometimes evil, without a reason for it. As far as anyone claiming this story and movie are made up, I suggest you look up Main Line Murders on thecrimelibrary.com. The entire true events of this movie are on the website I just listed. Also, if you want more information about other crimes this website is the most reliable and the best resource I have found for doing research on becoming a Forensic Psychologist.
