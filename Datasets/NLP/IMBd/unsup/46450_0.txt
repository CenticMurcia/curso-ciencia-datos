I recently rented this film having been a fan of Sam Bottoms ever since Apocalypse Now but what terrible mistake I made. This film about a worn-out hooker trying to go straight (very original, right?) is so poorly made, it's definitely one of the worst independent films I have ever seen. The acting, especially by the lead actress Jade Henham, is atrocious, and it looks like the director (if there was one) just pointed a camera on her and followed what they thought was some kind of interesting life of this character. What they didn't realize is that her character is simply BORING! There's not even any eroticism in this film as the box would have you believe. Stay far, far away from this film!
