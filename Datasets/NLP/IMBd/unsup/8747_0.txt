I caught this last night at the Phoenix Film Festival. There was a lot of good buzz going around about it. The recommendations were definitely justified. Fresh writing, good pacing, family friendly and an excellent cast. Peter Stormare is a great Suspicious Character, and who wouldn't want Dina Meyer as a love interest. This entertaining movie contains all the typical elements of your basic movie plot, but the interaction of the hero with his audience (us) what could have been cliche comes off as fresh. In some ways the audience is like a conscience which may cause us to reflect on our day to day actions, or may cause some to become paranoid (what if someone is watching me all the time).<br /><br />Overall I really enjoyed it and recommend it if it plays at a festival near you.
