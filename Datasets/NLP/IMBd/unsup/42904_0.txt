This film starts off cheesy but I expected that. What I didn't expect was the salute to fascism at the end off it. First, the Christianity was WAY out of line and over the top, then the celebration of executing people for speaking out and not conforming to the "norm" as defined by society, complete with marching companies and a victory march musical background. I sincerely wish that I had come to this site to read some of the commentary on this before I shelled out good money and two hours of my life for it. I don't know what the producers were thinking but just about every ultra fascist theory and doctrine was extolled and celebrated. The only thing that they didn't do was execute some gay people for "failing to propagate" or something. It's not worth extending my thumb to give it a thumbs down. The sound that you hear is Robert Heinlein rolling over in his grave! What a sad place this franchise has come to.
