The very best scene in this movie takes place about a half hour before the end. It's the final dance pageant. It's worth it to rent this movie and fast forward to this finale as it is truly electric. It belongs in a *much* better movie.<br /><br />You see, I slept through all but that final scene. And I missed absolutely nothing. I payed attention enough to want to strangle nearly every character in the scenes when they aren't dancing.
