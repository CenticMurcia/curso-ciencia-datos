On 28 February 1986, the Swedish prime minister, Olof Palme, was assassinated in Stockholm. The assassin has never been found. This movie tells the story of how the killing _might_ have happened, without pointing any fingers at who were pulling the threads. Swedish policeman Roger Nyman is promoted to the Special Branch/Secret police. He stumbles across the information that an international hitman is in Sweden. What is he up to? As Nyman uncovers the chilling truth, his investigation is ignored, if not directly hampered by his superiors.<br /><br />The movie shows an interesting and vivid account of Sweden in the mid-eighties, and in a way accuses the Swedish general public of allowing an atmosphere to arise, in which the assassination became possible. But it also works as an exciting thriller, even if you have never heard the name Olof Palme before. A cross between "The Day of the Jackal" and Oliver Stone's "JFK" springs to mind. This movie deserves a larger audience than, as a Swedish film, it is probably going to get.
