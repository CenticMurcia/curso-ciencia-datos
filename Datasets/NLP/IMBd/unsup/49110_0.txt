I enjoyed watching this documentary, which was essentially a list of left-wing personalities beating up on Fox News and Bill O'Reilly. Their point was that Fox is not objective and pushes a right-wing agenda.<br /><br />The film was interesting and I liked hearing about the internal memos they were able to put together. The confrontation between O'Reilly and Jeremy Glick was also interesting, and I had not seen that before to the best of my recollection.<br /><br />The documentary is flawed, however. Flawed primarily by a low budget (the editing and graphics are very amateur), but two major problems come to mind. First, it is clearly aimed at a liberal audience. While this will make the target audience (including me) happy, it will teach them very little. Most of the facts are not shocking to those on the left.<br /><br />But more importantly, the film sets out to show Fox News bias. It succeeds in this, but also shows us an intense bias of its own. I do not feel any facts were altered or left out, but a "documentary" with thirty or so prominent liberals talking about Fox without a single pro-Fox person to make a statement seems very poor. Had a few Fox people been interviewed, the film would have been much stronger. Why attack something that can't fight back? But it's not a bad film, and you should see it before Bush leaves office and the film loses relevance. I saw it for free as a free rental to go with "Amelie", maybe you might consider the same.
