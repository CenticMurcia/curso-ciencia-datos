This thing doesn't even try to be funny. It's not tragic. It's not comedy. It's not anything. It's one thing for a movie to try to be funny and miss the mark, but this waste of celluloid doesn't even try. There is literally not one single line in this movie worth remembering. No setups. No punch lines. No antics. Nothing. The whole movie tries to ride on Chris Rocks goofball character but he doesn't actually do anything but sit around, get high, and jabber about nothing. Ice Cubes character is as dull as a doorknob and as flat as Kansas. I've seen wallpaper that was more entertaining than this waste of perfectly good oxygen. It couldn't have taken more than five minutes to write assuming it wasn't made up on the fly ("OK. You guys sit there and ...uh... smoke a joint and.. uh.. I know! Talk about booty or something!!"). It's a good thing Chris Rock found Rush Hour. If this movie had set his career he'd be doing standup at an Elks club in Indiana.
