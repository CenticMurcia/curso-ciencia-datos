Speaking from a tweener's own experience, I found this movie to be an absolute waste of my time.<br /><br />I spare no expense in saying that there was nothing redeeming about this movie... not to mention, an overabundance of poor, no... abominable acting "talent." Everyone says that this has gay references and stereotypes all around... they're not kidding.<br /><br />The point I'm trying to get across is simply this: I'm thankful that no one had to endure this treatment in high school... especially when it's portrayed so poorly! Regretfully, I can't give this a zero with the stars, but I can in numbers! 0/10
