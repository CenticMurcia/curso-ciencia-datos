After the awful Foreigner & Out for a Kill I had this movie written-off before I'd watched it, thankfully it turned out to be much better then recent efforts.<br /><br />Lots of action, sometimes a bit overkill (how many people were shot!). I don't know if Seagal is continuing to make Eastern movies now but this was all the better for it!<br /><br />What was with the car on the front cover of the DVD though? Did I miss that part? :)
