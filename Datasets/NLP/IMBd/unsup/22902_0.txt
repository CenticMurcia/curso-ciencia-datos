This movie left a very bad taste in my mouth (bad pun intended.) The characters were uninteresting. The story went nowhere for me. Some times goofy is funny, but this over the top attempt to follow the "zany" antics of pizza delivery men couldn't hold my attention. I'd give it 1/2 star out of 5. The writing was weak. The direction was vacant. The acting was so-so. Overall I would not recommend this to anyone out there unless you like throwing your money away. I guess I would say this pizza movie should have been kept in the oven a little longer. I am a huge fan of independent film , but this film was in a word boring.
