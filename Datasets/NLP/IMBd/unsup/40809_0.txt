This is as mistaken as a comedy ever got towards thinking moviegoers seeking a few laughs required an elaborate plot (or any plot). There is no scene involving Paul Newman that is funny or interesting. I just didn't care if he repaired his marriage and understood why his wife wouldn't want him back. His character is a doofus. The movies merits and fun have nothing to do with plot or star power. If you're distracted by the snooze-inducing plot, you might miss some funny situations and lines in the middle. The Hansens are a very funny idea especially considering the timeframe; the further development of the anti-hero to the point where they even cease being physically attractive.<br /><br />The 60s anti-establishment viewpoint is eeking into absolutely establishment movies like this. Newman reasons his way to a now untrackable blow-up for unknown reasons. Whenever a laugh is needed you can be sure gay men and women will provide an easy punchline. The combative Lyndsey Crouse subplot is wrong-headed in every way. To see Jill Clayburgh young, playing this dumb, horny role is strange and unpleasant. Michael Ontkean plays a constipated pretty boy. <br /><br />God the 70s were hideous. Awful sound recording/mixing and really ugly technicolor process.<br /><br />Dozens of sports movie tried to recapture it's success. I love the movie Bull Durham but I had no idea how much of it's vibe Ron Shelton stole from this. Bull Durham is a virtual reshuffling of scenes from Slapshot.
