STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />Street cop Soldier Kelly (Lorenzo Lamas) gets worked up at being unable to take the drug dealers off the streets and ends up massacring a whole bunch of them (as you do...) He ends up being committed to a mental institution, where a sexy psychiatrist tries to evaluate him, but he manages to break free and teams up with wise cracking black guy Speedboat (Larry B Scott) to go after the big time dealers and save his sister from the scourge of drugs.<br /><br />This prompt sequel to unforgettable STV action film Snake Eater has the same lead star, later Renegade star Lamas, and follows much the same formula as the first film, which is to say it delivers much the same results. The acting is wooden, the plot completely nonsensical, even for something so basic, but if you want some simple, undemanding action nonsense, it may deliver the goods. On the other hand, you may just want to stay out of the pit. **
