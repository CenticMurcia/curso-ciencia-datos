Lay the blame for this one where it belongs: with the filmmakers. In his first at-bat as a movie star, Joe Lewis shows glimpses of some genuine acting ability. Unfortunately, director Pintoff (whose resume, I see here, reads like a season by season who's who of forgettable television shows) wasn't up to the task. JAGUAR LIVES! looks and feels more like a travelogue than anything else, with establishing shots of internationally famous landmarks and reel after reeling reel of home-movie style sequences that add up to nothing at all in the end. Allow me to belabor this point: Lewis, the first full contact heavyweight karate champion of the world, apparently took his acting lessons as seriously as he does his martial arts- and it shows (again, briefly, in glimpses). I remember liking his next film, FORCE: FIVE, better than this one, but I've been unable to find a copy of it (this one I found at Netflix). Lewis fared no better than in JAGUAR LIVES! in DEATH CAGE- but, even there, he demonstrated some acting ability. That his career wasn't handled better by those entrusted with it is nothing less than a crying shame.
