Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer (2003) has to be Nick Broomfield's best film to date. Aided by the phenomenal camera work of Peter Watkins' protégé Joan Churchill, the two film makers capture the final days of convicted murder (and madwoman) Aileen Wuronos. Nick Broomfield put his heart into this project. He tries to delve deeper into the shattered and hateful psyche of Aileen (whom he has interviewed in the past) and continues to search for answers. I liked this documentary better than his previous one with Aileen. The photography and depth is so much better. Will Mr. Broomfield and Ms. Churchill find the answers that they're looking for? How will Aileen react to them as they try to interview her again? Why does the Christian right wanted this woman to die so bad? To find out you'll have to watch Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer.<br /><br />A great film from Nick Broomfield. I just enjoy his film making. He should do more documentaries and have the ones he's already made released in the United States. Broomfield and Churchill make an awesome team! I have to highly recommend this movie. Even if you don't like documentaries you'll enjoy this one!
