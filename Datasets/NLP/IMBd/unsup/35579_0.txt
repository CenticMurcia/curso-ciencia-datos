A music student, Kate Martin begins to personally investigate when her ex-husband, Mike becomes a suspect of attack upon a neighbour, Anna. Although Mike is definitely a primary suspect both Kate and Detective Sergeant Turner, who is officially in charge of the case, think Dr.Steiner, a lesbian teacher of not only Anna but also Kate, may know something important because she was the last person who met pre-attacked Anna. But out of their sights the attacker goes to the hospital where Anna is admitted... Although I admit it is truth that almost non-human movements of the masked attacker are, at least in some scenes, very weird and even horrible, it is difficult to say this film itself, of which visual and musical atmospheres are very similar to those of WHEN A STRANGER CALLS, is very good. This is partially because the whole story is so horizontal that there is no space for audience to enjoy his or her own detectiveness, and partially because the character of Sally, who helps Kate to investigate, is a meaninglessly non-stop talker and badly adds not well-organised half-comical quality to the latter half of the film.
