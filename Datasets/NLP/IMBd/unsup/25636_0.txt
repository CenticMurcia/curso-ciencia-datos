Sleazy, campy spaghetti sexploitation/horror gem that's a lotta trashy fun. The beautiful Mariangelo Giordano struts her bare box around as does every other woman in this thinly plausible supernatural giallo about a comatose boy whose scientist father has given him telepathy and telekenesis in his altered state of consciousness.<br /><br />The women in this film are mostly gorgeous and great to look at naked. There's also some very campy effects illustrating Patrick's (the telekinetic one) use of his mind's eye, a lame score, and about four really nicely gory deaths of the sleazy variety--including a bitchen power window death and the implausible spit through the snatch scene. Recommended--8/10.
