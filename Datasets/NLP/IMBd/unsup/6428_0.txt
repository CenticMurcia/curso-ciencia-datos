I caught this on cable and had absolutely no preconceptions or expectations, having never read a review or checking IMDb. I saw it had Tommy Lee Jones in the cast, and that made it a must-watch movie for me. At first, it seemed like a gripping crime drama, but quickly started showing its true colours. This is a movie about, not the U.S. Army, but the Hollywood Army; that is, the Army as Hollywood has seen it since the 60's. It takes the stereotypical, screwed-up Viet Nam vet, and puts him on steroids for the new century. Having spend 28 years in the Air Force, and having friends serving in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other fun spots, I have some idea what I'm talking about. Here's what I learned about the "new" Hollywood Army (HA), as opposed to the real, U.S. Army (USA).<br /><br />- When you retire from HA, if you were a military cop, they let you keep your badge. And active duty ID card. In the USA, they take the badge and give you a retiree card. <br /><br />- Having spent a career as an HA cop, if you're chasing a Hispanic suspect, you will shout every racial epithet you can think of and then beat him senseless as soon as you catch him. The USA hasn't eliminated prejudice from the ranks, but has done a pretty darn good job of trying. Unless you lived through the barracks riots and de facto segregation of the 60's and 70's, and seen the difference now, you really can't believe how far we've come. <br /><br />- In the HA, power corrupts, but Army power corrupts absolutely. The HA, realizing there's no easy way to take Nintendo-generation kids and turn them into effective soldiers, strips away their humanity and turns them into stone-cold emotionless killers. So much so any soldier can take a good friend, chop him into little pieces, burn the pieces, and then go out for a bite of fried chicken. The USA is a far cry from the Boy Scouts, but I guarantee that your average soldier has a far straighter moral compass than your man-on-the-street American. Yes, Abu Ghraib happened, but it was an anomaly, not business as usual. <br /><br />- HA soldiers do drugs. Every last darn one of 'em. It's considered odd to expect that anyone doesn't. They try to avoid hard drugs, at least when outside of a war zone, but otherwise, jokin' and tokin' is de rigeur. In the USA, there are still drugs, but there is on-going program of random testing, and if you do drugs you *will* get caught. <br /><br />- Returning HA soldiers are ticking time-bombs, just waiting to go off. It's not a question of "if", it's "when". In the USA, there is indeed post-traumatic stress and its consequences, but it's a problem that's treated, not ignored or swept under the rug.<br /><br />I could go on, but that gives you the gist. On the plus side, Tommy Lee Jones gives a tremendous performance, and for the first time I realized just how good of an actress Charlize Theron truly is. Susan Sarandon is thankfully relegated to a minor role with minimal screen time. The overall message here, however, is despicable. It's an anti-Army, hate America kind of movie. It's amazing that so many reviewers here think this reflects reality. They obviously haven't been in the military, and are probably the kind of people who would cross the street rather than say "good morning" to somebody in uniform. Jihadists everywhere will love it; anyone with a shred of patriotism will find it to be total crap.
