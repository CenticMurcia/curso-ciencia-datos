This was a terrible movie. The stories are over-dramatized and what is supposed to be scary just ends up being lame. The sound effects are too loud too, so it's hard to hear the actors sometimes and you miss parts of the story. I don't even know what to say about the visual effects, except this looks like a home movie made by children. Additionally, if you need a story line even remotely realistic, you're not going to find one here. There is just no way to rationalize any of it. Once you think you've made sense of it, something happens that contradicts everything and the facts never come together.
