George Romero himself (the man whose take on zombies has helped redefine the fright film for the past four decades) put it best: "It's not about the ZOMBIES, man!" Filmmakers who don't grasp whereof he spoke make movies like DEAD HEIST- movies that usually boast some impressive, though often no-budget fx (or even- as in this case- some great zombie "crowd" scenes), but very little in the way of character or story upon which to, say, hang a review. The internet, at present, boasts a veritable plethora of such shorts. In fact, there are five "winners" (picked by Romero himself) included among the DIARY OF THE DEAD extras. Like GANGS OF THE DEAD, DEAD HEIST has its moments (including some decent actors trying to make the most of bad writing, as well as some sometimes surprisingly competent direction), but the one thing both movies have in common is a lack of character(s). Let this be a lesson to those of you who would follow in Romero's footsteps: It ain't about the ZOMBIES, man!
