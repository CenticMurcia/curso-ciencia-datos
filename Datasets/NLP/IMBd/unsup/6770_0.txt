I sat down to this film not knowing anything beyond what the trailer depicted...and I had only a vague memory of that. Is it a drama, a comedy, a what...? I can honestly say that I think the answer is yes. To all. It's the most honest, solid, watchable film I've seen in a long time. Nothing seemed forced, gratuitous, or pandering... it's just a well told, and acted, human story. Neither a magical, nor let-down ending...unless one would count "I wish more films could be made this well" as a let down.<br /><br />So, that's my opinion, which doesn't mean much...unless you are like me, and enjoy the quality of a film more than the franchise future possibilities of one.
