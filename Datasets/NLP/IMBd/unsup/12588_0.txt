Regardless of what anyone may say,this is a fun picture from beginning to end. EVERYTHING WORKS, from an aging Errol Flynn, Alan Hale as his sidekick, a witty script, great action, a young Raymond Burr as a sword fighting (!) bad guy, to one of Max Steiner's best scores. Some may say Flynn was in decline, but have to rank this up there with his best; it does not drag anywhere: kudos to Vincent Sherman as director---he keeps it going. The love interest--Viveca Lindfors--is properly stoic because she cannot get him at the end and they both know it. The aging Flynn's other trysts are romantic and humorous like Cary Grant (although Grant's were cosmopolitan not swashbuckling)in his last pictures. The king s played properly ineffectual; the main villain is wonderfully evil---and correctly dispatched at the end. Flynn is no "wussy" and stands up to every challenge. That's another reason this film is so good. Relax, watch, and enjoy.
