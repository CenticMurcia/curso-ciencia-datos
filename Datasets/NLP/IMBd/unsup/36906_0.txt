If you think this is how America truly is, then you're so naive. Where do the issues about poverty, the economy, deficit, high taxes, inflation, and racial injustice come in? Surprise, surprise it's never featured here nor is it EVER talked about!<br /><br />We see some amazing direction followed by actors acting like real Joe schmoes reading from a script who display their pleasure with this grand country as if we don't have problems, because this propaganda would rather have us ignore the problems because it's much better to just watch this comedy and forget our misery.<br /><br />Smart people will really dislike this and will see right through its act, as I did. Is it UnAmerican to see right through this propaganda? It's Unamerican to pretend we have no problems.
