First off, Nia needs to lay off so much makeup. That's mostly what I was noticing, and our TV is not that big. With the new HD and digital technology no amount of makeup is going to erase the fact that you are not 25 anymore. Move on. That aside, this has to be one of the most disappointing movies ever. The premise is okay and some parts were not too bad: Over-qualified fish out of water story, and "girl" meets the man of her dreams, but there were so many clich√©s and stereotyping I was cringing within minutes. Was any of that really necessary? Or the fact that within 4 days a group of strangers becomes a family. That can happen, but the sudden turn-around of a few of the characters was not believable. And the sub-plots were contrived. I knew immediately that Dreyfuss had lost his wife, and I even got the plot that he would not only be the one who makes our heroine See the Day, but will have some minor disaster strike him. Please. This could have been SO much more.
