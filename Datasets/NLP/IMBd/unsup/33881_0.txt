More resemblant of a '70s TV cop show, this revenge flick from Dorothy Ann Puzo [and this is her only attempt at celluloid, praise God] is truly wretched.<br /><br />The always-excellent Brad Davis stars as a cop out to avenge his father's murder [at the hands of Jonathan Banks]; femme-almost-fatale Sharon Stone is the only other reason to watch this.<br /><br />0 of 4 NiroStars <br /><br />
