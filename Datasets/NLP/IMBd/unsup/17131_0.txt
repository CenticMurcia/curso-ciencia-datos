First this movie shows that money is not very important to create a movie. The story and the thriller takes you from the beginning to the end. The stories powerful characters are two kids this makes the intention powerful. Both kids are very shy and kindhearted. The story consists of determination, money, love, friendship and the family. <br /><br />I live in Ankara capital city of the Turkey and I also went to Kutahya before. The point of view is very very good. The life in the villages is like that. These are for real I heard a lot of stories like that. This movie is describes for my grandfather's generation very much. All the persons who are in my age know a lot of stories like that for our parents childhoods. For example my father gives this movie may be 9 out of 10 :) The cinemas takes his attention very much I think. <br /><br />Not much more to say about movie. Watch it pretty good. I like it very much I think every one will...
