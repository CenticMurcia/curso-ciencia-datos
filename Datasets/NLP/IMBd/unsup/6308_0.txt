Neil Rosengarden is the composer of We Don't Make 'Em Anymore. Not Nicholas Hollander.<br /><br />Would someone who knows how to change this and has the time to do it take care of this please? It's so complicated. I am Neil Rosengarden and am the 100% composer of We Don't Make 'Em Anymore, and if you want to verify it, check it at BMI. Thank You!!!! Okay, I'll add more lines of text. What kind of text would you like? Yellow rose of text as? Text the A train? I need to get off the computer now. I have to write some more songs, okay. Don't make me come back here ever again. Thanks, it's really been fun.
