<br /><br />Let's be honest with ourselves. Did we truly expect Mary Kate and Ashley to become Oscar winning actresses overnight? No, of course not. So I'm really surprised to see so many people commenting on the girls' acting ability and unoriginal plot. But we've known for years what they're capable of. Cute, but corny, movies is their calling and they do it well. While I would love to see them stretch their wings and blow us away with fantastic comedic performances, they're not quite there yet. But New York Minute is fun, it's sweet, and it's what we all should have expected. I recommend it to the tweens and other youngsters who will get just what they expect. Maybe the Twins' will someday surpass all the sceptics' expectations, but let's not be surprised if they don't.
