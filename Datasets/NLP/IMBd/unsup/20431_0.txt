i have to say i loved the first film of the GOAL! series, the sequel is also very good but not as good as the first.....<br /><br />The film shows how all the fame and fortune of playing football for one of the worlds biggest clubs can get too your head, his girlfriend and he fallout and she goes back to England and even at the end we don't know where there relationship will go (although me and some of my friends agreed that they will get back together)<br /><br />In the end David Beckham scores the winner for Real Madrid (With Munez and Harris getting the others) against Arsenal to win the Champions League Final 3-2!<br /><br />This film was really good, but not as good as the first in my opinion, can't wait for the third one to come out!
