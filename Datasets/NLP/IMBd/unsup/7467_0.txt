Despite what you may think, this movie is not a Michael Bay parody. It makes fun of three of his movies, but they do not make fun of his style or his personality. Camera work makes no attempt to emulate Bay's DPs and most of the jokes are from the scripts of his movies.<br /><br />Get one thing straight people: Michael Bay does NOT write his movies. If you are cheesed off why don't you blame J.J. "I made Alias and Lost" Abrams? He is as much responsible as Michael Bay.<br /><br />Sadly, the screenwriters of Bay's films are often overlooked. One day Akiva Goldsman will be killed once someone realizes he wrote Batman and Robin AND won an Academy Award.<br /><br />There is one great joke in the movie which parodies one of the best lines in The Rock. If only the rest of them chose to go that route instead of making Ben Affleck and Matt Damon jokes.<br /><br />Lastly, the short film is about 5 minutes long. The first 30 seconds is the worst logo for a movie I have ever seen and the remaining time is spend on credits. The film truly shows off better than anything the talent of some people's home special effects. They look down right horrible, but still better than flash animation. I don't know whose idea it was to use shoddy special effects, when Bay actually uses some great ones. At least, the sets are amazing.<br /><br />Does this film make fun of Michael Bay or Jerry Bruckheimer? Sadly, no. The film uses corny jokes and a poke at America every now and then. It's no better than if the director looked at the camera for 5 minutes and said: "Hey, isn't this funny because I'm making fun of stuff you hate?" Lame jokes get you nowhere, Mr. Moniot.<br /><br />Bomb.
