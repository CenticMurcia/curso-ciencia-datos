Kasten is a first timer. It shows. He has no handle on how to pace a story nor how to create sympathy with characters. Things happen in this film for no reason other than to further the plot. Characters themselves never rise above the one dimensional and the acting is wooden. A brief 30 seconds of Alice Cooper is the only redeeming feature. Having seen an advance screening at a film festival the words 'Straight to video' spring to mind.
