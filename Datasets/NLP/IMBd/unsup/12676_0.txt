You will not be lost if you want to see a film that will have you laughing. After seeing there stage show at PARF I had to buy the DVD to see what it was like. I found the story wonderful and funny. The jokes can be enjoyed by all. The romp threw the world of Don Juan and Miguel is a never ending tale of excitement, laughter, and wonderful music. Also all the different act that you might see at a Ren Faire make appearances and it is wonderful to see old favorites and to get to enjoy new ones. This is the must have DVD for any person who loves the Faire Life, but also the perfect DVD for the average person might play to keep the kids quiet in the house during the rain or on a long road trip.<br /><br />Buy it and let your regular day become a Faire Day.
