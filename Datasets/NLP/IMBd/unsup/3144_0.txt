The marketing on this film was terrible causing many to pass it by when first released. The previews were completely misleading as to what the film was really about. But for those of us lucky enough to stumble upon it one way or another, we few were rewarded with what should be considered a classic. It is beyond me how this film has been rated so poorly. I can only imagine that many of those voting have not actually seen it. That is a true shame. I personally consider it a solid 9 and easily deserving of being ranked among the top films of all time. If it had been promoted more accurately in its original release, or if those voting would actually take the time to view it, I believe it's rank would reflect this. I had to vote 10 in an attempt to compensate for the error of others.
