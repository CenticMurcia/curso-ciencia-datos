"You know you're not really Peter Pan, don't you? This is only a dream. When you wake up, you'll just be Peter Banning - a cold, selfish man who drinks too much, is obsessed with success, and runs and hides from his wife and children!" What if Peter Pan left Neverland and grew up? That is the premise behind Hook, when Captain Hook kidnaps the now adult Peter Pan's children and takes them back to Neverland. Peter must go back to Neverland to rescue them, but he doesn't remember how to be a kid which makes defeating, or even fighting, the dastardly Captain Hook difficult in that fantasy world.<br /><br />There is a lot to be said about the importance of family in this movie and the relationship between a father and his children. And there are some jokes that will be understood better by those of us who are already adults. But my children also really enjoyed this movie-they found it funny and never found it boring.<br /><br />It has a lot of action, colorful bright sets, wonderful performances by Dustin Hoffman (Captain Hook), Bob Hoskins (Smee) and Robin Williams (Peter Pan) and a "fun" tone that makes this enjoyable for the whole family.<br /><br />I've watched this many times and like it more every time I see it.
