I had seen "Frogs" years ago when I was a kid. To say the very least, I didn't really enjoy it at all. I was only 10 years old or so, and, well, the film isn't exactly wall-to-wall suspense and blood-boiling action.<br /><br />I recently decided to revisit this film after seeing it in a bargain bin for a little over 5 dollars. I picked it up, and watched it as soon as I got home. And I must say...<br /><br />Still not all that good.<br /><br />I'm not saying the film doesn't have any redeeming qualities. Sam Elliot is good, and breezes through the material. While granted, he is an actor who deserves better, he treats the role with respect. Ray Milland is good in the few scenes we see him in. He plays an rich invalid and doesn't have a whole lot to do except bitch at his unloving family.<br /><br />The death scenes leave a little to be desired. Although the title of the film is "Frogs", those particular amphibians don't take any lives. Instead the bodies pile up once the snakes, alligators and other swamp nasties attack. And check out those unending shots of bored looking (Do they have any other look?) frogs eyeing on as other animals kill the unknowing victims.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you love bad movies, have a go at this one. Compared to some other stinkers that have been made over the past 50 years, this one looks like a masterpiece.<br /><br />I'm giving it ** (out of four).
