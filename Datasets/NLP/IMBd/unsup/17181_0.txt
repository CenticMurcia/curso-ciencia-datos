Tony works in a mannequin factory in grimy NYC. He has this strange sexual attraction to the mannequins. One day he brings home a head from one of them. In his spare time he uses binoculars to spy on topless women sunbathing on the tops of buildings. Then he walks into womens apartments (in this universe no one locks their doors), kills them and has sex with their bodies (not shown). There's also a ton of pointless female nudity which has nothing to do with the plot.<br /><br />There's nothing wrong with showing women dressing and undressing--this is an adult film after all and it has its audience. But when you throw in violence and necrophilia it gets pretty sick. Thankfully the killings themselves aren't that bad--only two are shown and they're just strangulations. That aside the film is painfully dull (I fast forwarded through most of it) and no reason is given for Tony's actions. There's very little dialogue and the guy who plays Tony actually isn't a bad actor. But this is a slow, sick and deadly dull movie. A 1 all the way.
