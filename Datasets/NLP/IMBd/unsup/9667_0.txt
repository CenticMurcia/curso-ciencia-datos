Okay so I saw this movie last week and from reading reviews and what not I was expecting it too be painful to watch. Not at all! I thought it was funny and I saw no negative stereotypes whatsoever I've read something saying the plot was all over the place...umm no. If you pay attention you'll get it. I have A.D.D. and it wasn't challenging for me.I'm a fan of Sofia Vergara and I thought she was hilarious. Roselyn Sanchez and Jaci Velasquez were also great and they really worked well together and with Eduardo. I must admit though I also watched it with commentary on and its even, their super funny and you can tell they really enjoyed each other. Its entertaining!
