First of all, the battle of Poltava is very far from the center of this movie, so the international title is very misleading. Second, the story sucked. Big-time. Two french noble mens, one on the Russian side and one on the Swedish side, just for them to meet and settle at the end? Ridiculous.<br /><br />All the foreign characters are played by Russian actors, and the foreign language is done by voice over, which is done really bad by the way.<br /><br />The clothing is historical incorrect, with the officers on both sides looking like the Napoleonic offers during Waterloo. I guess Oleg Ryaskov got some inspiration from Sergei Bondarchuk's Waterloo. Except there is more than 100 years apart from these two battles. And for example, the Swedish attack wasn't lead by Karl XII (because he was wounded and couldn't lead Sweden in battle), it was lead by Carl Gustaf Rehnski√∂ld. I could go on and on about historical incorrectness.<br /><br />The sound effects are the same throughout the movie. There is this exact same sound every time someone stabs another, and the guns all sound the same.<br /><br />This is not a movie worth watching in my opinion.
