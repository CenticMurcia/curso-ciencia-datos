The writing wasn't bad. The direction and editing were. Camera tricks to simulate the surreality of the events was gratuitous, gimmicky, and simply didn't work. It just came across as cute. It interfered in the flow of the movie by interjecting technique over substance. Too bad, it could have been much better.
