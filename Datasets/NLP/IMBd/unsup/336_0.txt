Many thanks for the producers of this show for providing intelligent adult entertainment for adults. The language is harsh but funny and for most people it will add to the enjoyment. If you have an open mind you will enjoy the bad language as part of the show (watch the scene between Al & Mr. Wu "discussing" the stolen drugs which had me roaring with laughter). Great scripts and great acting make for great entertainment and the camera work is also excellent. I have just finished watching the first series on DVD and it is easily one of the best TV series I have ever seen. Great stories all the way though. Can't wait to catch up on Series 2 & 3 on DVD.
