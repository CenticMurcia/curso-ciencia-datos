The movie was horrible! they had many intolerable items in the film that was disrespectful to Sikhism, for example in a song they changed a portion of a holy hymn to suit the needs of the movie! that is not allowed in the Sikhism religion. Sonny Deol should have known better than to make a film like this. You might say it was for the sake of comedy, but it was way overdone, and inappropriately shown. this movie is horrible, and not even that, the guy stabbed some girl on her stomach, and she died 2 seconds later! That is not possible, the person would bleed to death for way more than 3 minutes! This movie is not worth anyones time, i don't even know why i am reviewing this p.o.s., well later...<br /><br />Ps.The Movie Sucks
