All movies require the "suspension of disbelief," that elastic band around our rational minds which allows us to get involved in fiction while knowing it isn't real. Some movies pop the bubble of disbelief through bad acting, poor script, bad editing, or myriad problems.<br /><br />After the bubble pops, you realize you are wasting time sitting in a dark theater.<br /><br />Pacino can make a recipe for soup sound interesting, but even he did not have enough magic to transform this terrible movie. The problem was the script and its many fantastic plot problems. We can live with some stretching of credulity, but there must be some way to make sense of a story. This story makes no sense. The plot breaks down when we realize none of this could actually ever happen.<br /><br />I have admired Ms. Sobieski in many prior films, including one of my favorite films "My First Mister." She is extremely talented, and sometimes reminds me of Helen Hunt. She is wasted in this film and plays the least convincing character. Bad directing and terrible editing combine to make this the worst film I have seen this year.
