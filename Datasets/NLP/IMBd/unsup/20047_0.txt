'Playing for Time' starring Vanessa Redgrave first aired in 1980 and is based on a true story. A true story teaching the lessons of intolerance and the horrors of the Holocaust. In much the way Sharazod (the mythical wife of a King) would save her own life each night by telling her husband a story but never finishing the tale; in 'Playing for Time' the inmates of a death camp play music for the amusement of the guards thereby escaping extermination. But this is no myth it's a very real means of survival for desperate inmates. <br /><br />'Playing for Time' is a great movie but gets a little boring. I found myself playing a video game instead of paying close attention to the movie.
