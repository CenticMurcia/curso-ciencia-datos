This movie is awful...it makes one blow chunks. I just rented this as I'm a Horror movie fan and this piece of Garbage is just that garbage. The plot was bad,the acting terrible,there was no gore,suspense or real thrills. If anyone out there just rents horror movies on stormy,dark nights to get scared as I do...avoid this film as you will not get any thrills from it...makes one appreciate the fast forward button on the VCR. Its a big turkey...need I say more. I'm not one to criticize films or nothing but this one stunk. The deaths were faked and predictable....my cat shadow can out act the actors in this flick. Is this the only work Yvonne DeCarlo(The Munsters)could get. Lets just say if I was an actor in this turkey I would not want to put my real name or my name on the credits. This is one of the worst films I've ever seen...we can't forget Howard the Duck. I think that ones got to be the worst one out there but this ones up there on that scale.
