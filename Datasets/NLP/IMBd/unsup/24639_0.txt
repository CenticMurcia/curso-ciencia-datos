The Waterford, MI gent pretty much nails it. Oddly, he mentions the one episode I have been itching to see (again) for about 30 years, the one with the glider (?) pilot...the concealed deception...and the glider returns...horrors! That's the episode that led me to recently buy the 50-episode DVD set for short money.<br /><br />I live in Sault Ste. Marie, Ont. I wouldn't have seen One Step Beyond were it not for WKBD Ch. 50. The station was part of our basic cable package for several years (and isn't any longer, sadly). God Bless Channel 50. Would never have seen "The Ghoul" w/o TV 50, either or Outer Limits, or all those "Creature Feature" flicks! (I'm 48, feel like 12 here). Those were The Days, IMO...<br /><br />One Step Beyond was on at 11 p.m., and I missed way more episodes than I saw. I bought the "50 of the Best" DVD on E-Bay and have watched about 46 of them so far with my wife, but the episode I want - as I suspected when I received the 4 discs - isn't among them. That's okay. I'll find it eventually, though I'd like to avoid buy all three seasons separately to do it. Got to have them all. I love that show. It more than holds its own against Twilight Zone, yet the comparison truly is apples-oranges.
