This is without a doubt one of the worst films I have ever seen. Even among what has become a gay ghetto of bad films, and even overlooking the shodding editing and cheap production values, Eating Out takes the cake for most inept screenplay and direction in recent memory. I was absolutely insulted by this concoction and am baffled by some of the glowing reviews here by what appear to be members of the gay and lesbian community. I imagine the film will get some attention as it stars Ryan Carnes, who just made a splash as the gay gardener on ABC's hit Desperate Housewives and the kid is undeniably cute and charismatic, but I felt sorry for him here as he is exploited by the film's director and producers. He and another actor have the most gratuitous nude scene in recent memory. It's the sort of scene that gives gay cinema a very bad name. Avoid this film at all costs.
