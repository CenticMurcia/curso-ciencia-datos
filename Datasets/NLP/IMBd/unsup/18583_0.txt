Bad acting, stupid scenes and rediculous monsters. That sums up this nightmare. The whole concept of the woods is a joke. There are only about 10 minutes that you see these idiots actually in the woods. And when they did go to the woods, these firemen actually want to dig up a grave so that they maybe help the police locate a body? Can anyone say STUPID!!!! And in the first scene, there is a house on fire and these firemen are fighting the fire and trying to rescue people in the house. Come to find out, the lady and the baby both die in the fire, which really bothers Alex. The dialogue on the back of the firetruck when Alex is upset to learn the baby died. "Gee Alex, those things happen". Gee Alex? Haven't heard Gee anything since the Bradybunch. The acting only gets worse. Another example. Fat ass man sees the devil-dog coming. Instead of running out of the building, he unlocks some type of closet and jumps behind some good old cardboard boxes. Yeah, them boxes always protect you from monsters. This movie sucks ass big time. Please don't waste your money and your time with this crap.
