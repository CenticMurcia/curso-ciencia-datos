A poor script was brought even farther down by horrible acting, especially on the part of Corey Sevier (unfortunately the main character). The girl who played Doris was decent but disappointingly had a minimal role. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. This movie was a waste of money. The cast and crew seemed likable enough as people but should probably consider finding another field to work in. The blonde foreign girls were gorgeous but that was all. They could have benefited from some better accent training. This movie was hard to sit through. I wanted to leave after the first two scenes. Corey really made a badly scripted movie even worse with his complete lack of acting skills.
