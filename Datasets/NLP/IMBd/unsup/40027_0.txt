I was very disappointed with this rather tame offering from Amicus. The script was okay about a curse put on the family of Fengriffin, but it covered territory seen before(most notably in Doyle's The Hound of the Baskervilles). Stephanie Beacham, newly married, arrives at her new home. As soon as she gets there, she begins to see a painting play mind games with her, a severed hand, and a multitude of strange deaths occur whenever she asks someone to explain the secret her husband is hiding and why a woodsman lives nearby. The first half really drags by despite these "horrific" images we see through Beacham's eyes. Thankfully Peter Cushing arrives halfway through the film to add some boost - but it just isn't enough. The end result isn't a bad movie nor a good one or even a really interesting one. The setting is decent enough with gardens, antiques, and other period specialties, but the illogical story, the lackluster direction, and the mediocre acting all portend a rather dull ride. Cushing as always gives a good performance and really is all I can really recommend about the film aside from some small roles artfully played by Patrick Magee and Herbet Lom. Beacham isn't great, but in her outfits that push her bosoms up - you probably won't mind terribly much. If you can take your eyes off her chest long enough(no small feat) you will see she has little range. With a better story and this cast, so much more might have been possible.
