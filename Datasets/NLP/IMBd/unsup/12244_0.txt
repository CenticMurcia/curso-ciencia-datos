Having just finished visiting Thailand myself, I too had seen a lot of falangs walking around, intimately, with these young girls and even boys. I had not realised that these Thai boys and girls were probably prostitutes as I just innocently thought they were probably couples. How wrong was I! While this documentary received a number of negative comments on how "shallow" it is, I seem to think that this documentary aims not to point out the problem, but as a reminder of how we, visitors and guests to the country are exploiting its resources negatively.<br /><br />Thailand is a very beautiful country and I visit there quite often. I do things like shopping, eating and sightseeing. My last visit was filled with fun and joy with my friends, just doing shopping and indulging in the delicious food.<br /><br />I don't agree with the British interviewee in the documentary that Thailand is a country for men. I enjoyed Thailand as much without any "use" of the sex trade.
