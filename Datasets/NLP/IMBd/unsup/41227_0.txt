I saw Strength and Honour last night. I expected a lot and was let down. I walked out of the cinema talking about some faults it had. I slept on it and when I woke up I realised that there was so much more wrong with this film. I think it was the worst film I saw this year. It is set and filmed in Cork, Ireland (my hometown) so I really want to say it was amazing. It was just a massive letdown. It wasn't even a movie that was 'so bad it's good/funny', it was just a horribly acted, poorly written piece of clich√©d rubbish. I applaud that the 1st time Director Mahon has put his heart and soul into this and I must admit the film is beautifully shot, but how this movie got produced is beyond me. I think that he should get some help with writing from a Hollywood veteran because his idea was good. I hope his next film about Brian Boru starring Leo diCaprio will be much better. This film simply deserves the Razzie for worst film(for being oblivious to how bad it is) and worst performance(by Madsen). Madsen is a great actor, but this role was not for him. It pains me to say it, but Strength and Honour is a stinker that should be avoided at all costs. I hear there's a sequel in the pipeline...but I have a question...why?
