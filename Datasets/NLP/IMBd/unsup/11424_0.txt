The screen icon is a police detective with a difference in this very moody and formidable thriller from writer / director Richard Tuggle. He portrays Wes Block, a loving and responsible father on one hand, and on the other a sex addict with a yen for prostitutes. He's on the trail of a sex murderer, and realizes that he's really not too different from this deviant.<br /><br />Tuggle illustrates the darkness inside many of us quite literally in this movie, to which anyone who's seen this can agree. There's even a line to that effect spoken by a minor character. It's definitely a daring project for the actor, who's solid and believable as always; he has an especially potent scene where he trashes a room in rage and frustration as he realizes the consequences of his actions.<br /><br />The movie doesn't play out as one might expect. There's not much of a sense of urgency, even as the bodies pile up. It takes a real psychological approach as we witness the deterioration of our central character, who at least gets a strong female character to relate to as Genevieve Bujolds' role is introduced into the plot. She does a creditable job as well, creating a kind of moral center and giving the movie a solid anchor.<br /><br />Eastwoods' own daughter Alison plays one of his two daughters in the movie, and she's very good, foregoing any sort of "cutesy" routines that child performers can fall into. Also appearing in a supporting role is Dan Hedaya as a fellow detective, although he's a little under-utilized.<br /><br />The killer himself is barely established as a character in the film, seen almost exclusively in the act of stalking and murdering his victims. We learn almost nothing about him, he has barely any dialog, and the end reveal is very fleeting, making him quite a mysterious entity indeed.<br /><br />The jazz score and the location shooting in New Orleans add a highly appropriate and engaging amount of flavor, and there's a great climactic chase lit by a helicopter.<br /><br />It wasn't altogether satisfying for me, but it's an intriguing and steamy thriller and is certainly worth a watch.<br /><br />7/10
