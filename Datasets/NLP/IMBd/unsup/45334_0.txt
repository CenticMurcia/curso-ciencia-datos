A news crew goes out into the English country side to interview some people. They are making a documentary about a virus. Suddenly everybody has the virus.<br /><br />The movie is presented in the form of a documentary. In this aspect it shares a lot with Cannibal Holocaust, Blair Witch Project, Rec, and Romero's Diary of the Dead. Of all these, The Zombie Diaries most closely resembles Blair Witch Project.<br /><br />The movie starts well, then gets worse, and worse, and worse. Whilst it is attractively packaged the The Zombie Diaries is a low budget affair with no original ideas, a poor script, and bad acting.
