Why do I keep buying these (admittedly, incredibly cheap) low-budget pseudo-sci fi movies? Because I hope that somewhere in the big pile of crud that is Hollywood (or whoever produces these things), a pearl or a gem will prove to exist. But does it ever? Actually, yes. But it is extremely rare.<br /><br />This movie is yet another disappointment. In many ways it actually isn't bad. The characters act fairly believably, and except for the ending, which is something of a letdown (yes, *another* one of those), the basic plot isn't too terrible, all things considered. But, for one thing, the execution of the potentially interesting material is boring. Several plot elements are missing (like, what does the Nephilim themselves actually look like?), and the titular swarm hardly plays any role (well, it's the threat they have to stop, but it just isn't in the movie very much). The looks of the actors are somewhat generic; only Amanda Welles is an attractive exception. To be fair, the bad guy isn't that bad, either (I mean, he's *bad*, but he's not bad, IYKWIM!).<br /><br />Note: The Nephilim are not aliens, but some Earth life form from ancient times that has re-awoken (or something). Also: Billy Sabbath isn't "brought back to life", as in awoken from the dead; he was simply drugged and then revived. There's no supernatural element.<br /><br />Overall, it was better than I'd feared (though certainly not the gem I'd vainly hoped for), but not by enough to lift it out of the mire of tedium. One wonders why this movie exists, but at the same time I have to say it wasn't anywhere near laugh-out-loud terrible (though some people seem to think so). The worst thing was the ending, with a dull, dull car chase that didn't go anywhere. Also, the whole thing about Sabbath's son could have been handled far more poignantly.<br /><br />I rate this movie 4 out of 10.
