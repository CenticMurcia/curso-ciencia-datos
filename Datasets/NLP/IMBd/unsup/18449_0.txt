I think cartoons have a better chance of saying things uncensored than cinema. This toon was made during the war at a time when noir movies were rising fast. What this does is take the children story we all know and update it so it would fit the logic of modern society. And this is where its genius rests, Tex Avery manages to pose a number of questions only in seven minutes: why does the wolf behave so erratically, why does he fall so stupidly for the dame, who wins at the end: the exploited nightclub dancer, the suicidal wolf or the libidinous grandma? All these questions would have felt moronic when I was eight and simply enjoyed it as a cartoon. But it's amazing to see something so simple achieve such a level of complexity. And the animation per se is pretty good to, one of the best of the period
