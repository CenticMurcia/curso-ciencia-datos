Lucky guy, this Eric Brown. <br /><br />First, he gets de-flowered by Sylvia Kristel (Emmannuelle herself) in "Private Lessons", and then is floored by the charms of Sybil Danning in this movie. <br /><br />Talk about being born under a lucky sign.<br /><br />Observant people will tell you that only Danning's scenes give this flick any merit. And they're right: as predatory as ever, Danning exudes sex and sensuality as a college professor (only in Hollywood) who tricks student Brown into killing a relative so she and he can run off with her inheritance. Of course, someone else is knocking off everybody left and right....<br /><br />I'm sorry, you care about the plot? Well, don't. This is not a plot-driven story, as if you haven't figured that out already. If you can't figure out who is doing the killing, get a new hobby. Or better yet, just concentrate on Sybil. <br /><br />Maybe even think about how lucky that Eric Brown guy is.<br /><br />One star. Anyone who is a Sybil Danning fan will tell you: fast-forward through everything else but her in "They're Playing with Fire". Otherwise, you'll get burned.
