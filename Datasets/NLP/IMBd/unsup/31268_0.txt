This movie was so funny I was laughing from the beginning to end, but I almost felt bad at times for chuckling hysterically at such edgy subject matter. Should I feel guilty for saying this is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen? Am I going to hell for that? But how can you not laugh at a retard erotically bathing a blow-up doll or the tragic death of a bum during an episode of roadrage? Why do so many people have trouble laughing at such things? Maybe they should have a drink with West and spend a night in a motel with him, Nancy and Art.<br /><br />The only critique I have about the film's story is that it is not the easiest to understand or get at times. It isn't entirely mindless like you would expect given the plot and subject matter, like Jackass, Wedding Crashers or Anchorman are. Maybe that is what the directors Harz and Kennedy were trying to do, make you think a bit? I surely did.<br /><br />Watch '?' with a strong stomach and an open mind and prepare to laugh!! 9 out of 10.
