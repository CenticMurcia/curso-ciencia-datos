I've always wanted to see this movie but never got round to it. Being a "foreigner" I never really got to grips with the whole Watergate thing. Now thanks to this movie I have and wish I hadn't: the whole thing is extremely boring. It does not make for exciting viewing. eg the final denouement is told to the viewer by a typewriter screen. Doesn't that demonstrate that the material is clearly non-cinematic? A very disappointing movie. I can only assume that people rate it highly because of the significance of Watergate rather than the actual movie. 4/10
