This bond game is pretty good because: The mission's are pretty good they are most of the time fun and sometimes hard and challenging to complete that can be fun sometimes. The cars in this game are good the car mission's are pretty fun to do. The voice over actors are good. The way bond looks is pretty good but would have been better if they made bond look like one of the actors but who cares it is still fun to play. It also has lots of action in it and the graphics are pretty good as well. This game is really fun so rent it or buy it some time because it is pretty fun to play.<br /><br />Overall score ******* out of **********
