First of all, the film is very interesting and thought provoking. That being said, it does resemble Office Space a little bit. I say that because a lot of it takes place in an office and it's like we are watching it from Milton's perspective. Those are the only comparisons. I have just watched this movie, and I like it very much. This is the kind of film the movie theater's have been missing. To go back to my summary title, I think that Christian Slater's performance in this film outshines anything else he's done. I am a big fan of Elisha Cuthbert. She is good in this as well. However, Slater's performance is something to see by anyone and everyone. I almost forgot that is was Slater playing the part of Bob. Slater has never left the building!
