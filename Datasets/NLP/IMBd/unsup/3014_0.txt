This movie is so slow and pointless it was painful. I love David Bowie, but his music has been RUINED for me. How is it that all these wonderful actors can come together to make such a painfully slow and meaningless film. The story is caught, no, LOST, somewhere between the yellow submarine and PBS on PCP. Maybe downers. This story is slow, and never did gel. Who was the son, why did he come, what was the point of their relationship? Is this an insult to Jacques Cousteau? What inspired this film and why was it made? It is so disappointing to see filmmakers make one smart film and think they have more clever stories in them to tell...there is nothing clever about this one. his worse film even. In the end, I had to walk out.
