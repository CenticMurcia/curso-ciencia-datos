I can't believe people - married/single/in significant relationships could not relate to this show!! This is the real deal with a couple sparklers in hand to make it shine. As much as us 'women' would hate to think we had a 'Jake' as our spouse, but realize we may have a 'Mickey', but really want to kid ourselves to think we could always roll over in the AM to see our 'Doug' - wake up and smell the 'monkey coffee'. I am married, with kids, a woman who had a career and gave it up for family and can still relate to the 'Mickey' character. I think people trash this show because it really does make them look at themselves in the mirror and ask yourself 'am I really happy with the choices I've made?' You then realize you are happy with what you have...you just have to remind yourself a couple times out of the day. I was totally disappointed when this show was cancelled - and hope somewhere down the line it will come around again. People may not want a 'Everyone loves Raymond' life - who can relate to that image of marriage, anyway? - Yikes.....
