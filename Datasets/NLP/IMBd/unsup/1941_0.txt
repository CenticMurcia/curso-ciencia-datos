I love the first Jaws-film. That is probably the best film ever done and this is the second sequel and I like it, some of the effects it`s very bad but the film is pretty entertainment. The acting is pretty good and the sharks looks great. This time is the biggest shark ever, a real monster. I hope I will see this film with 3D-effects sometime.<br /><br />Rating: 6
