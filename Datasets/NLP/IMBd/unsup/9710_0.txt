Bonnie Raitt does not mean much in England and I can never figure out why. There are fans, of course, but she never seems to achieve the profile she deserves. Maybe her music is too American (it is, of course, but thats no bad thing). I love her second only to Joni Mitchell. This DVD is knockout-she genuinely loves what she does and does it supremely well. That love of her music it comes through in this stunning live performance. She is surrounded by musicians to die for. I was on holiday this year when she appeared at a nearby venue-it broke my heart-I have yet to see her live-but this concert is a wonderful second best!!
