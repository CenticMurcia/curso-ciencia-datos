A couple of foreign office clerks are very bored at work and their attention wanders.<br /><br />The 1950's never look like much fun to me. Give me a time tunnel and the 50's wouldn't be the first number I dial up.<br /><br />With a modest budget and a bit of nerve this series looks back with nostalgia on this buttoned up decade. Where a bit of peroxide and hint of stocking sent the boys wild -- I bit like today now that I think about it! This is fun and I love the way McGregor plays the virgin office boy. Not that he wasn't a bit younger back then.<br /><br />A fun bit of TV fluff although like most of Potter's work it goes on too long.
