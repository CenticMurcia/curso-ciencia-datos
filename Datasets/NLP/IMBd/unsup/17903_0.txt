Sorry- I like Soderbergh and Clooney, and this idea was a good one. But, unfortunately, politics in the US is no longer a laughing matter.<br /><br />This is a good idea which may have worked in the days of James Stewart ("Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"). That was 56 years ago. Recently, there was a televised champagne party wherein Dick Cheney was roasted by his fellow admirers and sycophants. I doubt this will be televised mass market, as most Americans will not find it mildly amusing.<br /><br />Lobbyists and corporate lackeys are not mysterious or interesting;nor are they a source of amusement. <br /><br />They are now the status quo, and anyone who isn't aware of this merely needs to tune in to Bill O'Reilly for the latest pablum bought and paid for by the PR spin machine. <br /><br />This is sad, and the fact that even a creative innovator like Soderbergh cannot find a better creative slant to educate Americans is discouraging.
