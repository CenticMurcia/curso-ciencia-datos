This movie amazes me. When I first saw it in the theater (if you have seen it you won't believe I just admitted that) I was 8 years old and it was so cool at that time. I had not seen it since, until a few months ago when I caught it on cable. Wow, this is a bad movie. It gets hig camp value in that you get to see Joan Collins (in the movie she admits was her worst acting experience) dive into a sick, gross, murky swamp. Just watching her face you know she wants to be eaten so she can just go home. Lots of cheesy special effects of normal ants on mini models, very obvious. The ant queen part is semi creepy, but the ultra 1977 wardrobe is too distracting to really notice. If the special effects had pulled through, this may have gone on to greater cult moviedom, unfortunately it is just a bad movie. Now, if only someone reworked it and made it today, I bet Joan Collins is still available.....
