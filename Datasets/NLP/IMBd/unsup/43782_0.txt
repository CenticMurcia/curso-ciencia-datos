Really not a lot of horror going on in this one, however from what I see of other reviews this was just supposed to be a horror remake of a crime classic and it shows. There is one truly scary scene in this film and it involves the young lady in the pool, but other than that scene this film falls into a long line of horror movies from the 70's and early 80's that had potential, but were defeated by to much talking and not enough horror. This one starts out with a young lady and her boyfriend (I think it was her boyfriend) having some sort of accident where they end up being invited to some mansion where a whole crowd of people are assembling in the hopes of being named the successor to some guy who is dying upstairs. Funny, this very guy is the one who invited the young lady and the gentlemen to his home and he seemed just fine when he invited them. So on to the house where people, other than the pool victim, die in rather uninteresting ways and a new heir is on their way to being chosen. At one point the girl and guy try to get out of the situation, but the town seems to have a hold on them or something, you can not get away from this situation all that easily. Near the end though there is very little horror to write home about and the crossbow scene just punches that point home that this movie just is not really a horror movie at all
