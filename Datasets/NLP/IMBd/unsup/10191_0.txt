Laura used to live at this orphanage and when she grows up, she starts to prepare it for some disadvantaged children. She adopted a boy, Simon, with her husband Carlos. Simon has some friends that are not real and at first Laura plays along with it but there comes the ghost story. The first part of the movie is slightly scary but as the movie goes along and things happen, this movie turns into a huge mystery.<br /><br />No one knows what happened to Simon but when the truth is revealed, it comes as somewhat of a tragedy. I really liked the scary scenes and they weren't too sick, macabre, or heart stopping. The scenes were just perfect and they blended right into the whole mystery. I think that this is a mystery and a horror movie at the same time.
