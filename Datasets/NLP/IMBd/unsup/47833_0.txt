Okay first i want to say even if i'm a Turk i don't like these type of movies but still i wanted to say a few things.The first movie 'Dünyayı Kurtaran Adam' was a total disaster everyone in Turkey makes fun of it because it was made seriously as a sci-fi movie and they stole many things from Star Wars.But the second movie is a comedy.Now the MOST important thing in a world class comedy film is to make EVERYONE on the planet laugh,but it doesn't mean that you have to make everyone laugh to make an ordinary comedy movie,i read that one commenter said that its not even close to funny,now i'm from turkey and believe me there are MANY European and American movies people from here don't laugh at and there are many movies you people don't laugh at,this films aim is Turkish population because Turkish sense of humor isn't same with the others,actually EVERY countries sense of humor is different with other countries so MY OPINION is that it doesn't make sense to say 'not even close to funny' to a 'comedy' movie that isn't in your country because it may not suit your sense of humor but people here liked it not very much but still they liked it,so please make your comments on comedy movies according to these things..i'm sorry if my English was bad..
