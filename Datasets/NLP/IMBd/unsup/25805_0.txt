To say the least, the first 30 minutes is certainly awesome, considering the premise: what would you do if the end of the world was fast approaching. While I liked the movie overall, the impending scene where people were trying to set up a dispersal sight was a bit unrealistic and far fetched. But besides that scene, this movie is certainly one that hangs on to you. While some of the moments were rather strange and surreal, the impending desperation that falls on Anthony Edwards' character is quite interesting, considering he has no need for monetary wealth. It's a good little movie to watch in the middle of the night (which is when I watched it) and certainly one that is worth a repeat viewing.
