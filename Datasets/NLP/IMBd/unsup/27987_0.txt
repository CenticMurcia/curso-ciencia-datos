As Quintin Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction" shows, a story can be told in severals points of view. Each person in the story sees it in a particular way and acts accordingly. Salma Hayek looks great and proves to be more than a pretty face. You can't say what makes this movie so great. Maybe the story, maybe the actors, maybe the director, maybe all of above. Any attempt to summarize this picture is useless. You must watch it.
