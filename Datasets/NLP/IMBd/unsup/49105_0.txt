This is by far the most awful movie I have ever seen. Not a single scene made at any sense at all, everything was rushed and confusing, no one explained the world of the story besides "there's a war going on between night watchers and day watchers". The picture was out of focus all the time, the music was really distracting.<br /><br />Every detail in Nochnoy Dozor we have already seen, most of the times much better. I'm talking about Lord of the rings, the Matrix, Blade, Constantine, the X-Files, Star Wars ... This movie is not independent or new and I definitely won't watch its sequels.<br /><br />Why did it get so good ratings and reviews? Must be because it's a Russian production ...
