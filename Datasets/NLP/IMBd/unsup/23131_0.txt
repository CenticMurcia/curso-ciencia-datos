What's so different about this romantic/fantasy dark comedy is it that uses the British (and European at that - it was set in Euro 1996) enthusiastic obsession with soccer as a backdrop, and thus provides an emotionally dramatic fantasy setting of 'what ifs' and anticipation for the main drama of quirky romance. The football (complete with stock footage of England's National Team in action) and essence of the atmosphere stay true to the intended settings' accuracy and makes for a great opportunity to play off the characters via their differing interest in the British National Sport ensuring that the characters brim with a level of anticipation of each others' next direction that mirrors the results of the team they barrack for, the 3 Lions of England. The relationship between Neil Morrisey's and Rachel Weisz's characters sparkles because however quirkily their attraction as lovers fleet on and subsides off at different times, one gets the feeling that Weisz is partly a fantasy (there are storyline elements that also drop hints of this) for Morrisey's pint chugging bloke (not too unlike the concept in Fever Pitch) and that his and the nation's fantasy of success for their Football team mirrors their relationship. Every ecstatic victory in the football world is a progressional step for their relationship. Sadly, by fate, it all ends up as a case of unrequited passion. A fantasy dream that was great while it lasted. Both for the team, and ergo, for Morrissey's character, Martin.<br /><br />Overall, i'd say watch this one if you loved Fever Pitch, Mike Bassett, or An Evening with Lineker, although this one should be appreciated for its strong acting performances by the female lead rather than the male.
