John Travolta, Rene Russo, Gene Hackman, Danny DeVito, Dennis Farina, Delroy Lindo, James Gandolfini. The only name that mattered was on the signature of their checks as distributed by over rated director Barry Sonnenfeld. Now, I have no ax to grind, and watched this at home twice over 12 months to ensure I wasn't angry at the world the first time. No, I'm just disappointed that I wasted roughly an hour and a half (twice) waiting for this diarrhea to gel into a reasonable movie. How can you expect to have any suspension of disbelief belief when the dialog sounds like it's written by idiots like me? There were a few instances where a funny line should have been inserted as when Gene Hackman was reduced to eating through a straw, but all that was uttered by our leading dud was, "suck hard". That line sums up the movie experience
