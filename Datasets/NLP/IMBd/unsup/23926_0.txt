"Radio Days" is Woody Allen in his element. It's chock full of funny anecdotes and quirky characters lovingly told. Mr. Allen is a narrator reminiscing about his childhood in New York during the late 1930's and early 1940's. He connects his stories with the music and programs heard on the radio. He not only shows how the radio played a part of his fictional family's lives but goes behind the dial to tell the stories of the radio performers themselves.<br /><br />Mr. Allen strives successfully to place the viewer right in that time period. His attention to detail is superb.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.
