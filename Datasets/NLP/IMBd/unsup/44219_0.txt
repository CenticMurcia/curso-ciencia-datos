Words can't describe just how bad this movie is. I don't care that they probably spent about a buck fifty (that isn't in thousands by the way) on actually making this movie. This movie is just bad bad bad bad. I'm not sure you could find a more tragic waste of your time than watching this movie. Well, except for maybe if you watched Lust for Frankenstein. Watching both movies as a double-header might actually incite you to serious thoughts of suicide.
