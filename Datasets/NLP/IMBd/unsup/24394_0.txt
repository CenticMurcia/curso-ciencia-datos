This is a wonderful account of the events leading up to the departure of MacArthur from the Phillipines. Parts of it are told in narrative style which lends a historic credibility to it, but the main focus on the movie is the hardships that our service personnel face when placed in tough situations. The primary characters are the Army nurses, with powerful leads played by Colbert, Goddard, Lake and Britton. Two male characters, one by TV Superman George Reeves (long before his red cape days) and one by Sonny Tufts who lends a humorous, homespun aspect to the storyline, are welcome additions.<br /><br />As with any US movie made during the Second World War, the Japanese are portrayed as a murderous, evil, unscrupulous enemy. These Japanese are faceless, however, showing up only as shadows in one scene. One of the frustrating parts of this behind the lines type of war is that you never see the enemy, only the mechanism with which he delivers death.<br /><br />Veronica Lake, in what seems to be an early "goth girl" performance, shows us what it is like when women get too close to the front lines.<br /><br />Want to see what war is like, not on the front lines, but behind the lines at bomber targets? Watch this movie.
