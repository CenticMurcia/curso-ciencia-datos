Saturday night, time to catch a DVD. We were pretty much settled on "Walk The Line" until we saw this. It had Tom Green, it looked like a "comedy" so we went this way. I obviously knew "Walk The Line" was slightly more acclaimed, but I was in the mood for something light and easy.<br /><br />"Bob the Butler" is all about Bob (Green), a terrible employee who's tried a stack of jobs with little success. He comes across an ad for a butler course and decides to give it a go. While doing the course he receives a request to babysit (one of his old jobs) and gives it a go. He does well so the mum decides to hire him as the butler. From here we can work out what's going to happen and the plot plays out exactly as you'd expect.<br /><br />Terrible movie, even for the genre. An all over the place, poorly laid out script with Green way out of his comfort zone. It was sad watching him play this role. The kids were OK but that was about it. Don't waste your time.
