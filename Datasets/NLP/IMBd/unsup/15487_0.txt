I really like Cue Ball Cat. The violence admittedly is excessive, that I am used to, but there are one or two parts that are rather unbelievable. Yes I am talking about Jerry getting an 8 ball rammed into his bottom(ouch!). Still it is hugely enjoyable, thanks to the fast delivery of the gags, the beautiful animation and the fun music, three elements that I expect to make a Tom and Jerry cartoon work.<br /><br />Tom is funny, there have been cartoons where he is a little stupid but I love him for it, and Jerry is sweet, dastardly yes but sweet. The cartoon is delivered at a breakneck pace, that can be a problem sometimes but I didn't mind it that much here.<br /><br />Overall, violent but as I have said, very well done. 9/10 Bethany Cox
