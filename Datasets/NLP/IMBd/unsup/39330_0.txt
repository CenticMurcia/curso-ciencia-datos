Playing the new English teacher at an Italian college full of prankish boys, Edwige Fenech looks incredibly beautiful - perfection in the form of a woman. We just want to look at her on the screen, but these annoying trying-to-be-funny people keep blocking our view. One teacher has poor eyesight, the gym coach is clumsy, one student's father is a millionaire posing as a poor man, he also has a mistress, and a fat assistant....seriously, does anyone care about any of this? (though at least the mistress gets naked twice). There are perhaps 2-3 chuckles here and there, but most of the "comic" material is lame slapstick. Another movie to be watched in fast-forward mode.
