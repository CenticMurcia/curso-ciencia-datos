This film was one of the made for TV movies that used to be so popular back in the 70's that are almost never seen now. A small cast made up of two very fine actors i.e. Eli Wallach and Robert Culp play research scientists at a small Polar station that the previous inhabitants of met with bad fortune. An entertaining thriller that has a touch of science fiction and mystery in it.
