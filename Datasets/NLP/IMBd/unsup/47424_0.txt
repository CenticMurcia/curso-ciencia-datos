My Take: Despite the all-star cast, this is a formula disaster movie with too much clichés and not much thrills.<br /><br />Released at the tail-end of the disaster movie craze of the 1970's (which might have already ended in 1979), Irwin Allen's WHEN TIME RAN OUT is more of an afterthought rather than a comeback as it was intended to be. Allen made a spectacle of himself with epics like THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE and THE TOWERING INFERNO which popularized the lucrative genre. But with flops like CONCORDE: AIRPORT '79, it's clear the genre has overstayed its welcome. But apparently, no one told Irwin Allen, who went on to make this movie. Not only does the title say it all, WHEN TIME RAN OUT also came out the same year as the disaster movie spoof AIRPLANE!, making this film more embarrassing than it is.<br /><br />WHEN TIME RAN OUT has all the usual elements of a typical 70's disaster movie: an all-star cast caught in a major calamity. But WHEN TIME RAN OUT is much more routine than usual. The film also feels more like a TV soap opera with elements taken directly from Allen's other disaster movies. The film opens with the same-old row-call: Paul Newman is an oil drill foreman who falls for advertising exec Jacqueline Bisset, who was offered an engaging ring earlier by millionaire William Holden; James Franciscus is the owner of the island's hotel who refuses to believe the upcoming threat, while not exactly being faithful to his clueless (read: foolish) wife Veronica Hamel. And there's more where that cam from: Hotel employee Barbara Carrera refuses to marry her fiancée Edward Albert, Ernest Borgnine is an old cop in pursuit of convicted crook Red Buttons (who repeats his goofy jogging routine from THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE), and so much more. I know disaster movies are part-drama, part-adventure movies, but even when the drama takes backstage to the action, the film disappoints with some really cheesy effects and not-too-exciting action scenes (the overlong bridge-scene comes to mind).<br /><br />Though some hate to admit it, I'm quite fond of the 70's disaster movies, especially the one's by Allen. I liked his first two blockbusters, but I also liked his lesser efforts like THE SWARM (at least for camp value). And if there's one thing I know about Allen is that he never fails to entertain. WHEN TIME RAN OUT is quite a disaster in more than the sense of the word, with tedious subplots and some horrible special effects. But then again, no one does "disasters" like Irwin Allen.<br /><br />Rating: ** out of 5.
