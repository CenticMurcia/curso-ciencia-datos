This is more than Bollywood. Madhuri Dixit is versatile as Hema Malini, Aishwarya Rai, Rekha & Sridevi. Just like in Devdas, she has performed excellent as expected in this movie after a period of R&R.<br /><br />The music, choreography & actors were excellent. The young love in the acting performance was excellent... Laila-Magnu. The young actors playing those characters real love was romantic in the Bollywood way & as in Romeo-Juliet way.<br /><br />The director showed that even when a man is "jilted at the alter", he can forgive his love even after 11 years apart.<br /><br />The weakest directing is that Akshaye Khanna could have been more romantically challenging. His role was very short. In the ending, it wasn't solid but dull. With the end though, it was nice to see everyone happy but making the whole villagers look gay (happy) is so unrealistic. A grumpy old man or woman should have added some real comedy.<br /><br />The evil man turned out not to be a strong villain. But then this movie tells you more about the society & how they think or will say. The directer showed the real dilemma of a young girl's love for her life & happiness, her best friend's obedience to her own husband, the villager's harsh branding words & insults, and a middle-aged couple whose marriage was getting boring. These are real life reflections in every country. This director showed it all in one film & Madhuri Dixit acting showed that although it looked like a defeat, you need to try your best, get up your courage & face your demons whether it be 10 years ago or 5 years ago. This is not a documentary, but read between the lines and see what the message is.<br /><br />Some songs were not so interesting but the best of all is the finale dance Ishq. Madhuri Dixit put the flexibility in her dancing that makes you wish you could dance like that.
