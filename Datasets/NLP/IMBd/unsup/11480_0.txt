what are a cartoon! but why in the 80's? And why the name heavy metal? Naked women in a cartoon and action and humor, amazing, I bet the heavy metal 2 sucked since it wasn't like the first one. Can you believe in one scene, they showed that kid's penis. Ew. The boobs. oh yeah but the penis, ew. It was kind of cool how they mixed it with a suspense, drama, musical (by music they must mean by the heavy metal bands in the 80's) horror, fantasy and sci-fi. the woman in the beginning who had sex with that man, why did she have to die?!! For a cartoon character, she's thick. Also the part when she fell asleep in the cab, you could see that blue thong and the sex scene, INTENSE!!! big ass titties, a lot of hair on her penisless area. Big nipples to don't forget. nice black lip stick. If I were a girl, would a still enjoy the movie? (Because there was nothing but girl nudity and one scene male nudity) The ass and the penis. For the women, the boobs an vagina. for god sakes please make another. Anyway, I wonder if it was previously rated x in the very late 70's because the thing came out in 81. Maybe R? come on. NC-17 could be good. Is X only a flick rating or also a movie rating. I was wrong. It's a movie rating also. Scarface (in the 80's) was previously rated x go to mpaa.org and see for yourself. I'm the first kid (in 2006) to probably see heavy metal. Sex with robot, sex with woman in control, sex with double crosser, a criminal with something thousand rapes. remember that part? good times. They only played it on Direct TV once and then it doesn't come on anymore. Why? They play flicks like at 10:00 or 11:00 (Which I don't watch. I only know the name because when I change the channel to the channel it's on, it'll show the name) I'm gonna call them and ask them to put it back on direct TV.
