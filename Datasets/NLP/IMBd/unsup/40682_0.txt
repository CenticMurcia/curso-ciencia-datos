Fellini exposes his great attraction for the clowns and the world of the circus first recalling a childhood experience when the circus arrives nearby his home. Then he joins his crew and travel from Italy to Paris chasing the last greatest European clowns still live in these countries. He also meets Anita Ekberg trying to buy a panther in a circus.<br /><br />The overrated "I Clowns" is the weakest movie of Fellini that I have ever seen. This documentary is an absolutely personal and boring homage to the clowns and the world of the circus. Maybe Fellini had had a great satisfaction in this tribute since the theme was his childhood obsession; however I found it extremely painful to hear and watch after thirty minutes. If this documentary was a short, it could be more watchable. My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Os Palha√ßos" ("The Clowns")
