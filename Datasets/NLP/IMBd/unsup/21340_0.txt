There after it gets worse for every minute.<br /><br />The actors are most likely better in an ordinary high schools drama class, than the ones they cast for this movie. The children was alright though, but the adult actors.......<br /><br />The actions of the characters are so stupid that you think a 5 year old have scripted it.<br /><br />Well you can say it started so well and ended very bad. I hope this instructor never makes a movie again.<br /><br />In many really bad horror movies you at least ends up getting some good laughs. Even this failed here.
