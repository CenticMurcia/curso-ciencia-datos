Totally gripping; the story weaves between ancient myths and legends and present day reality. <br /><br />The characters are engaging, the acting is great, and the special effects are phenomenal.<br /><br />I was reminded what special effects are really for - used right, they really bring a story to life, enhance it, engage your imagination and convey more than could be done any other way.<br /><br />This film stayed with me for days. Full of depth, wisdom, action and adventure. a must see.<br /><br />(I also recommend the "making of" that accompanies the movie).
