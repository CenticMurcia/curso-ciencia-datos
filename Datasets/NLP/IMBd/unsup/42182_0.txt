This may be perhaps the greatest example of "All-Star Cast, Poor Movie". Because the whole movie is voice-over, it's a pleasant surprise to have another character walk onto screen, say a line of obscene dialog, and then you exclaim, "Oh my God, that's _________!". The real core of this movie's demise I feel was that there was too little to work with, and that flaw had been realized. You can tell for the most part it wasn't at all rushed, and most of it was seemingly carefully plotted out... but there just isn't enough you can do with only so much footage of penguins walking around.<br /><br />Alas, most of the comedy is in Bob Saget's typical stand-up humor, and the voice-overs were very properly cast. In some places, the humor dried up, and you would feel as though the movie was trailing on. However, when a new voice or new action that the penguins did came on screen, it was a pleasant laugh.<br /><br />All in all I could say you could skip this movie entirely, but I'm going to have to say you should see it, anyways. It's a mark of progress to show how far Mr. Saget has come, and how willing he is to go out on such a limb. Sure the movie overall is a failure, but it should certainly be seen as a concept that could spark a series of newfound home video comedy.
