I was surprised by how terrible SPRING BREAK was. I wasn't expecting much. Just the usual T&A flick from the 1980s but SB was even below that expectation. The entire cast is not known to me. I doubt any of them had careers after this. All in all, a total waste of time. SB is a real step down for director Cunningham after making the now classic FRIDAY THE 13TH.
