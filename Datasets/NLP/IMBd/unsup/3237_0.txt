Honest speaking, this movie is really bad, however some awful movies are somehow very attractive and possess some kind of mysterious charms, and this Mighty Peking Man is one of those movies. This is a Hong Kong version of King Kong, who is able to change his size according to each scene, which is miracle! I laughed a lot from the beginning to the end. Samantha is gorgeous and love scene of Johnny and Samantha is very memorable with awesome music, "Could it be I'm in love? Maybe~" I wonder if the director was serious about this movie or he actually intended to make funniest comedy of the decade. Anyway, I really love this movie and if you are reading this and you haven't watch Mighty Peking Man, run to the nearest video shop and grab it. If you can't find it there, try the furthur video shop! It's worth it. Finally I would like to thank Quentin Tarantino for brings back this movie to life.
