The quirky title and description in the theater as a black comedy were somewhat misleading. There is the occasional laugh, but I would not classify this as a comedy, even a black comedy, although there are elements of a black comedy within.<br /><br />I will probably need to revisit this film sometime soon to see if it stands up, or even improves on a subsequent viewing. The acting is fairly good, and I think that the direction is not manipulative, which I appreciated. But, the characters were somewhat incomplete for me, and the writing good but not top-notch.<br /><br />To me, the film was most interesting in the resonance of the main characters, especially that of Wilbur. Wilbur is, ostensibly, one of the more selfish characters you're likely to encounter, though I guess he has his allure to the opposite sex. It is interesting how this character just seems to grab the attention and love of all those around him, and he seems to just use and bring down everyone else. His brother, the epitome of selflessness, is not developed enough for my liking, and I could not get a true handle on Mary's character. Yet, the movie earns points for attempting to present three-dimensional characters who you care about. I rated it a "7" on this site, and thought about bunmping it to an "8".
