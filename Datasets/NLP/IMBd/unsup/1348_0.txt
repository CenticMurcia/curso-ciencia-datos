How many bad reviews have I read of this movie? Way too many... I decided to see it anyway since I'm one of Alicia's biggest fans. By the way, if you listen carefully to all of the dialogue in this film, you will probably notice that this is her most personal film to date. I won't go into all the details, but there are a few reasons I know of why she rewrote a large chunk of the dialogue. First, the plot is original, as far as I know of. The first fifteen minutes immediately kicks into overdrive with everything happening at once. The soundtrack, too...love it. She picked that out herself, too, and made great choices. Benicio steals the show once again, but Alicia and Christopher aren't far behind with their performances. Oh, and Mr. Walken is a little spooky in this movie (as expected?), but don't think of him like that in real life. Emily T. Hope is by far Ms. Silverstone's most magnificent creation to date, topping Cher Horowitz and Darien Forrester. Emily is nothing like Alicia, and that's a huge sign she's the greatest actress on the market today. I suggest you watch this film just to learn a little bit here and there, despite the slowdown in plot during the middle and Brambilla's lackluster action sequences. Well, except for the only car chase in the film...a classic. So, how 'bout a part two?
