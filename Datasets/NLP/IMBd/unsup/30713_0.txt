I love this movie!!! Not even though it is cheap and rough-made but BECAUSE of it. In a Big-Budget-Box-Office-Seller this story would not work.<br /><br />Combat Shock's style is very aggressive and direct. The way of telling the story is very slow. There's no beautiful cinematography. The story is simple. The actors are not very pretty.<br /><br />Nevertheless it worked. It is very disturbing!! A good-mood-killer!!! But why are we watching movies??? Not to see!! But to FEEL!!! I want to cry, to laugh, to get shocked or to disgust. I want to feel that, what the actors seem to feel. Even if they feel bad. Most movies with a "just-want-to-entertain"-intention are a waste of time. Last but not least they will bore you.<br /><br />This movie doesn't!! If you're able to watch a movie without counting goofs or discussing the cheap F/X it will be a journey into the land of hopelessness.<br /><br />In the latest movie directed by Buddy Giovinazzo ("No way home")he had more money, a better crew, an excellent cast and better technical conditions. And it became a good movie. But the strength and roughness of Combat Shock has gone away.<br /><br />Sometimes it is better when a director has no money.<br /><br />
