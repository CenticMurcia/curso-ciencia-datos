I completely disagree with the previous negative review of this film. It is one of the better Holocaust dramas I've seen, as it portrays what a modern American Jewish girl goes through as she experiences the Holocaust in a vision/hallucination: what is better, knowing or not knowing what is happening, as events unfold? Certainly there are some liberties taken with the exact nature of this vision, and how she experiences actual historical events, but I think that had this film looked slick, it would have taken away from the raw experiences the film depicts.
