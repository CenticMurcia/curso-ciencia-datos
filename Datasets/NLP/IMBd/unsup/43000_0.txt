just saw the movie, and after viewing it i must say i found it to be utter garbage. What a typical Hollywood fluff piece. This film is a disgrace to the memory of Darby Crash and The Germs. If anyone wants a good insight into the Germs, please read the book, Lexicon Devil, The Fast Times and Short Life of Darby Crash. Shame on you Roger Grossman, Shame on you Michelle Baer Ghaffari for making this mockery of a film about the<br /><br />greatest punk rocker, and greatest punk band there ever was.<br /><br />To Shane West, stop living on the coat tails of the late Darby Crash. You are NOT Darby Crash, nor will you EVER be Darby Crash, so stop pretending to BE Darby Crash. Stick with acting. In my opinion, The Germs,(as a band), died when Darby died. For the remaining Germs to be out touring with Shane West as the singer is nothing short of appalling and disgraceful. RIP Darby, your true memory lives on in your music and in the hearts and minds of those that loved you.
