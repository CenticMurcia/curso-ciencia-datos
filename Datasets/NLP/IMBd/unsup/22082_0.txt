Satyricon is less a movie and more a series of complex images and actions. It is too long and tedious at times but ultimately fascinating. The costumes and the sets are spectacular, and some of the sequences are immensely entertaining. But, then again, the sequences are the problem. I first learned of the film while studying Latin and therefore was aware of the fractured nature of the original work and was prepared for the same in the movie, and while some of the action is provocative a fair amount of screen time is just, well, rather dull--its hard to follow and has no translation to modern times or sentiments, still through all the meandering there are moments--moments that are visually stunning, inspire awe, and feel like nothing from this world.
