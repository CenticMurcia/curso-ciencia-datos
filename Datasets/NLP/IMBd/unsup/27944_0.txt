The movie basically consists of a couple of teens telling each other stories with a story running in the background. I have heard people say the stories where weird,unbelievable and unrealistic. But that is exactly what they were supposed to be! I liked each of them except the last story with Aftaab Shivdasani (he sucks!)!<br /><br />If you like to read bizzare and dark short stories , you will enjoy the movie.<br /><br />For once, stars are just characters, and not the USP of the movie.<br /><br />
