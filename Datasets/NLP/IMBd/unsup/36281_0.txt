I'd thought I'd seen the worst after open water but Hostel wins that honor hands (or stumps) down.<br /><br />I bought this turkey after browsing the blurbs and pics on the back of the case. Looked to me like an organ for sale/black market thriller/horror possibility -- perhaps due to the surgical garb in one photo. Not. It will not become a part of my collection -- ever.<br /><br />There is no plot. Nothing believable. No chance for a thriller. Nothing to hold you engulfed in the moment along with the characters. Law enforcement would shut down an operation (no pun intended) where kids from wealthy (or not) families just disappear wholesale in big bleeding batches. No care is taken in the selection of the unfortunates, anyone is fair game. The only requirement is that you be mindlessly horny (never question why the perfect 10 has to have you) and extremely naive so much so that it goes beyond belief. The rest is just hack and slash oh yeah, and saw.<br /><br />So, it is just gore for the sake of gore. Pretty sick and in the end just sad. I should add SORRY to the list; sorry that I got SUCKED in (there's another addition) to buying it based on the cover art, hype and names attached to it. Needless to say I am more careful now.<br /><br />Next week I'm going to take my mini-DV to the local butcher shop to see about filming a sequel. Cluck Cluck Moooo.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and save your bucks for something better (anything). And shame on you folks for just going for the boring gore JUST for the (like you don't have enough) money. I'd have given it a zero but one is the lowest. 0 out of 10.
