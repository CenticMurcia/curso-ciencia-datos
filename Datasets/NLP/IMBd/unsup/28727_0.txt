This movie does one of the best jobs of following a book I have ever read. The best character in there was Edmund, played by Skandar Keynes. He portrayed the character exactly as I pictured him being in the book. His development was right on the mark. The other kids were great as well and I hope all four end up with wonderful acting careers. His dynamics with Tilda Swinton were commendable, especially coming from such a young actor. I would love to see Skandar Keynes and Tilda Swinton in a project together. Tilda Swinton was another wonderful actress in this movie. She gave the White Witch more dimensions than what appeared in the book. The scene where she gives Edmund the Turkinsh delight was one of the best in the movie. Tilda Swinton steals that scene when she welcomes Edmund onto the sleigh and really makes him believe she will make him king. Her scene in the castle throne room where she looses her temper with him makes us see her true wickedness in a startling way, as does the scene where she slaps him. Like previous posters have said, her icy stare is such a good touch. James McAvoy is another standout in this movie. He demonstrates his versatility as an actor. To see him perform as a faun in this and then watch him in "The Last King of Scotland" in one of the most powerful roles I've ever seen is amazing. He is another one I hope to see more often. The changes made to the were great for the movie. The subplot with Maugrim and his pack of wolves was a wonderful addition, especially with the dynamics between him and Peter. Changing the character of Susan into a much stronger young woman was also appreciated. In the book she was a much weaker character.
