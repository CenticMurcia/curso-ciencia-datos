I watched this in my Foreign Films class. Taking place in an isolated community of Scottish Bible Thumpers, Breaking the Waves stars a young, clingy woman who must have sex with lots of men if her husband is to recover from a horrible accident. In the end, she gets raped and dies, and the husband makes a full recovery. <br /><br />Before going on, it is important to understand the movement this film was part of. This was one of the so called "Dogme 95" films. A group of directors got together and set up a cult like group where all films produced had to follow a strict set of rules, such as no tripods, no unnatural lighting, on location shooting only, etc. <br /><br />In an artistic sense, Breaking the Waves was a good, emotionally challenging film. However, I, being somewhat Spock-ish, do not like emotionally challenging films. All the hardship and mental pain makes me sad. (In a bad way. I don't understand why people ever see sad movies, if sadness=displeasure and happiness=pleasure)<br /><br />So...ya. I don't like emotions.
