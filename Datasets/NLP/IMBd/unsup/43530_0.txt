First of all, no offense to anyone, but I hate politics. All the trailors made Yuva seem like a deep romance--yeah, definitely wasn't that. Being a movie that revolves around Indian politics, I wasn't very engrossed in the movie. Even then, I have enjoyed movies with a similar storyline such as Lal Salaam and The Legend of Bhagat Singh. There was just so much unnecessary violence in this film. There was an effort made to shoot the movie to give it a more realistic look, but it was totally screwed up. Abhishek was very irritating. Poor guy, looks like he's never going to have a hit movie. Rani was fresh as always. Ajay Devgan was, well, Ajay Devgan. Esha was barely noticeable. Vivek and Kareena were great. Their story was the only part of the movie I liked. Music was good. Badal, Finaa, and Khuda Hafis are awesome. Kabhi Neem is decent. The other two tracks are good for just background music.
