My English is not so good, sorry for that. I liked the music in the film a lot and was searching for ages for that song with the words "january", "Journey" and "feather on the ground" in it. Now I was waiting and watching a second time just to get the music and well, I have it as a film snippet but don't know anything else about it. One of your comments was very helpful, thanks a lot. (also to the others of cause, smile)<br /><br />I lost and sorry, I wanted to write a comment but so much English and register again and again... <br /><br />Forgive me please and maybe one good soul may help me to find that song. Is it from Fisher too ? The Song is played while they had the party.<br /><br />All the best and thanks in advance, really<br /><br />cheers
