I rented this loser because it mentioned Campbell Scott, who I admire very much as an actor, and New Orleans. You can always be sure the aura of the town of New Orleans can recall many Tennessee Williams plays of substance. This movie, written and directed by Mark Gibson in 1999, ain't the same.<br /><br />A golf pro, ousted from the profession due to boozing it up, and we never know why, comes home to a mish mash of people and events. He strikes a friendship with a gay lawyer, or is he gay, who's out to swindle his insurance with a fake suicide. Unfortunately he too is a drinker and from there the plot goes awry. Scott, playing the golfer, seems more interested in a white dog that travels the streets and the graveyards. What this dog is supposed to do, no one knows. Maybe he was off the set of White Fang. Anyway, things occur, very puzzling things, that make no sense at all. Also in this mixed up plot are two sex starved sisters played by Laura Linney and Laurel Holloman.<br /><br />I finally gave up on this and fell asleep. I give it one star just in respect of Campbell Scott's attempt. See him in LONGTIME COMPANION. He's so much better in that.
