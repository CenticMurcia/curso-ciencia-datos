LICENSE TO WED (2007) * Robin Williams, Many Moore, John Krasinski, Eric Christian Olsen, Christine Taylor, Josh Flitter, DeRay Davis, Peter Strauss, Roxanne Hart, Grace Zabriskie, Mindy Kaling, Angela Kinsey, Rachael Harris, Brian Baumgartner, Bob Balaban. Vapid, sit- com-y high concept comedy about a young couple's nuptials being put to the test by the bride-to-be's family minister (a surprisingly sedate Williams) who proves to be a holy terror in the process. Woefully unfunny screenplay by Ken Barker, Tim Rasmussen, Vince Di Meglio and Wayne Lloyd and underwhelming direction by Ken Kwapis (who has collaborated with Krasinski and his THE OFFICE cronies  many submitted to this mess to boot  previously, with such higher hilarious results).
