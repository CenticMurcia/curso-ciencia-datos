This is perhaps Cary Grant's funniest film (I'd rank it a hair behind "Arsenic and Old Lace") The rat-a-tat dialogue has rarely been so perfectly timed as between he and Rosalind Russell, who delivers the definitive caricature of a 1930's career gal. And Ralph Bellamy's hamhanded nice guy was so effective that his name became synonymous with that type of role. Amazing that he was ever taken seriously afterwards. The writing is superb, better than most any dialogue you'll hear today. And Howard Hawks directs the whole shebang at just the right pace and tone to keep it all together.<br /><br />The story is pretty simple. Russell is Grant's ex, and she's come back to see him at the newspaper he edits and she used to write for to inform him that she's getting remarried (to Bellamy) Whew! Meanwhile, Grant decides to win her back at the last minute, sucking her back into the newspaper game by tricking her into covering the last day of a man on death row. Can't tell you what happens, you'll have to watch for yourself.<br /><br />If this all sounds a bit familiar, but you know you haven't seen it, there were several other filmed versions of the play this was based on, "The Front Page". The Matthau/Lemon version was okay, but avoid the painfully unfunny 80's version, "Switching Channels" with Kathleen Turner and that Superman fella.<br /><br />Veddy veddy funny. It makea me laugh. 10 out of 10.<br /><br />
