"Leila" is so awful it's painful to watch. The DVD I rented had all the zits and dust of the original film. The video was contrasty and grainy as if the film was "pushed" for speed as most indoor scenes were poorly lighted like a really bad noir. The color was off, the English subtitles were poor translations and blurry, the sound was awful and the voices on the "other end" of the phone conversations sounded like they were standing next to the person on screen, etc. The story was simple and didn't have to be any more than 1.3 hours but the film ran for a boring almost two hours owing to dawdling and filler. The plot was a no brainer which is blown way beyond any common sense with characters who are so stupid they do things like have a "fast of speech" which seemed like a euphemism for "not talking because I'm upset" which, of course, would create relationship problems and does which is why it's factored into this stupid film. Etc. Etc. I could go on. Long story short, don't waste you time on this awful film. If you're into Iranian, there are many better flicks out there from Iran. (D)
