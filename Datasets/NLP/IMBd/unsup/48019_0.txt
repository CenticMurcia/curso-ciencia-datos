I didn't get this movie, even after the end. This movie is about a lady that lives with her rich father and hates him because of the way he treats her and the fact that he doesn't understand her. She then is kidnapped by two lovers and a Japanese man that listen in on her conversations and look through her window. Why they kidnapped her I have no idea except for the fact that her father is rich. She is tortured and soon becomes brainwashed into believeing the fact that her father does not care if she is missing even after viewing news coverage about him looking for her and offering a reward for her return. As time passes, the lady cares less and less of her chances of returning home and desides to stay and live with the kidnappers and falls in love with the Japanese man. they teach her how to rob banks and kill. This part becomes corney to the sight of seeing her from being rich to robbing banks. Eventually the police come looking for them and she is then caught and put into prison for two years. Her father tries to frre her and takes her back home but she still does not love him. I will not reviel the ending but it leaves you with a "oh, thats it". sence of feeling. This movie is boring, dull and slow.
