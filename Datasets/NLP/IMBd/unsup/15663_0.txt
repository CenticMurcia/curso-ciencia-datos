The Three Stooges has always been some of the many actors that I have loved. I love just about every one of the shorts that they have made. I love all six of the Stooges (Curly, Shemp, Moe, Larry, Joe, and Curly Joe)! All of the shorts are hilarious and also star many other great actors and actresses which a lot of them was in many of the shorts! In My opinion The Three Stooges is some of the greatest actors ever and is the all time funniest comedy team! <br /><br />This Three Stooges short is a very good one. This was Curly's last short but he did a good job. Vernon Dent, the very lovely Barbara Slater, Theodore Lorch, Symona Boniface, Helen Dickson, Johnny Kascier, Emil Sitka, Al Thompson, and Victor Travers are in this one. I believe the beautiful Christine McIntyre is also in this with a believe it or not very dark hair color! There is a remake with Joe Besser called Pies and Guys which is pretty good. This maybe Curly's last one but its a good one to watch!
