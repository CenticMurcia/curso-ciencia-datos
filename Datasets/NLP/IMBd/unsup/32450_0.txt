This is a low-budget little drama written by Ed Wood Jr. focusing on what can happen when parents don't make enough time to spend with their children. Paula Parkins(Jean Morehead)is a spoiled little rich girl. Her father(Arthur Millan)is the editor of the local newspaper and her mother(Barbara Weeks)is a social climber. At night Paula and her friends dress as men and rob gas stations. They attack young lovers parked in lover's lane and actually sexually assault an unlucky/lucky guy. Of course all the mayhem that develops and progresses will turn to tragedy. Drive-in movie fare. Other players: Theresa Hancock, Gloria Farr, Lee Constant and Timothy Farrell.
