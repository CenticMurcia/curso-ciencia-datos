This is a fairly average film, with some suspense and some humour. Eric Stoltz, who is very talented, is not given enough to do. Lori Loughlin is very good. James Spader plays almost certainly the most evil character of his screen career. Also the blondest - he resembles the love child of Dennis Hopper and Marilyn Monroe. That is a simile, not a rumour! <br /><br />I would have given this 5 points, but I am deducting 5 points for the execution of the chicken. There was nothing in the credits to imply that this scene was faked.<br /><br />I am, however, replacing one and a half points because at least the film makes the link that people who are gratuitously cruel to animals are likely to harm other humans. I replace a further one and a half because the heroine fights back.
