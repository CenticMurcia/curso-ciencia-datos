I can't believe the film director and producers would allow this movie in theaters with the microphone showing above the actors heads during the entire movie. My granddaughter was very disappointed. We should receive 3 free tickets from 20th century fox for this shameful movie experience. How many sports stories can you write with the same theme over and over. Losing team needs a coach. Some has been coach is hired and by some miracle they turn the team around. Guess what? the team ends up in the finals with the opposing coach a buffoon and bully. Where have we seen this before. the public needs to boycott these movies.
