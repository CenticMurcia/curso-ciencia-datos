Look, I'm not going to kid you. This Italian flick (originally a TV mini-series) is really bad. But maybe the fact that I saw this on a rainy Saturday afternoon put me in the right mind-set. This film ended up reminding me of those old-fashioned monster movies I used to watch on local access TV stations when I was about five years old. The fact that the movie seems subdivided into three specific sections also helps give it that "Saturday Matinee" feel. The first third deals with the mysterious Yor stumbling upon a tribal village. Next, Yor and two companion villagers embark on a quest out in the great prehistoric wastes. Finally, the film does an about face from caveman fantasy to sci-fi when our heroes encounter a galactic warlord type who lives in secret on an island. Actually, to achieve maximum impact, you could watch the three sections separately, with cookie and soda breaks during the intermissions. Or I suppose you could just read a good book instead.
