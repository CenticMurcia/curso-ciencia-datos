A couple of laughs, mainly due to the evil baby doll and his vulgar one-liners and even Dollman himself (Thomerson) gets in on the laughs. It's Halloween night and the Dolls are trying to use the 1 ft. tall Ginger as a host for Satan to be reborn through. It's up to Brick Bardo, aka Dollman, to save her and kill the Demonic Toys.<br /><br />A horrible mess of a script, crappy acting (excluding the always great Thomerson) and garbage miniature effects.<br /><br />And at just over an hour in length where the best scene has an evil foul-mouthed Baby Doll tries to have sex with the foot tall Ginger while he makes Dollman watch, it just really makes you wonder what the point to this whole mess of nonsesne even was.
