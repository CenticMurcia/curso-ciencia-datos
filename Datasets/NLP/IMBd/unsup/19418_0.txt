Another non sense film with a very weak plot and an old Steve McQueen, which acting was just acceptable. The film as such shows a violent hunter who is not really doing his hunting for justice. It is boring in general and no message no morale as such in the film. Simply another waste. Good to see again the former Kunta Kinte (LeVar Burton)of the series "Roots".
