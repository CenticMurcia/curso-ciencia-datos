An aspiring film-maker finds a notorious snuff film director and begins interviewing him. His interest quickly turns to fascination and obsession, getting closer and closer to direct involvement in the productions, including cleaning up the bloody remains. But murder isn't the only thing to be worried about... the ghosts of the dead are turning up on film and will not suffer quietly.<br /><br />I entered this film with mixed expectations. The few reviews that had surfaced seemed to be polar opposites: one batch praised the film as one of the best unsung films, while the other accused the praisers of being a part of the crew and puffing up the film with false reviews and ratings. Needless to say, this left the impression in my mind that this might not be the best film I'd seen in a while. My fears were squashed, thankfully, within five minutes of putting in the disc. It's no surprise this movie was nominated for Best Feature, Best Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actor (John Savage)at the Terror Film Fest.<br /><br />Set to a heavy soundtrack, this film is packed with plenty of quality murder, and a chilling performance from veteran actor John Savage, playing the snuff director, Vic. As soon as he speaks, we're sucked in, perhaps horrified but also morbidly curious... murder for profit... on film? Tell us more, Vic.<br /><br />While not flawless by any means, this film shows a strong sense of vision and direction from director Doug Raine, and I expect we'll be seeing more of him and 110 in the Shade Productions. With an interesting third act with Bronson Pinchot (Cousin Balki from "Perfect Strangers", or "The Langoliers")... you must see this film.
