I don't know what went wrong in the making of this film, but it is one of the most unimaginative, preposterous and generally boring films I've seen in recent years. A clear rip-off of the "Alien" series of films, except with lower quality acting. I have no idea how they got big name stars like Curtis, Baldwin, and Sutherland to volunteer for this travesty of a film.
