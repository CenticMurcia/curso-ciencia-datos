first and foremost, I'm an American. i live in the united states. yet for some reason I've become slightly obsessed with British culture, movies, literature, music and whatnot. my favorite film would have to be trainspotting, and lock stock blew me away. unfortunately, 24 in London did not. in fact, it had a reverse affect, inducing sleep. horrid horrid horrid everything, from the ridiculous dialouge to the plot that had more holes in it than a mesh t-shirt. there was virtually no plot, and literally no main character. i felt cheated by the end of the movie, cheated by the fact that I've lost a precious two hours of my life i could have spent reading a good book. rubbish, please don't fall victim to this movie, and anyone telling you otherwise needs to seriously reconsider what they are thinking.
