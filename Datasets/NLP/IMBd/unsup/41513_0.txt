god where to begin, i can't think of a single positive thing to say about this movie. I watched it while sick, and it just lay there, so i thought, "why not?" I thought wrong I somehow kept expecting someone to straighten up, and shout "JUST KIDDING!" or Darth Vader leaping in and start killing things with his light-saber, god that would own, but no. It was nearly halfway this crap-fest that i realized that not only are they COMPLETELY serious, they actually manage to say all this stuff with a straight face, no matter how retarded the dialog gets.<br /><br />I tried, i seriously did, but i can't recount any part of the plot without curdling into a corner while crying, as my brain tries to exit my skull by digging it's way desperately through the back of my head, writing the script down on paper would summon chtulu, dropping the script in holy water would cause the water to boil, it is seriously THAT bad.<br /><br />*possible spoilers start here*<br /><br />So yes, the dialog sucks, marines are apparently trained to wield two nunchucks at the same time, the scientist had both a gun and a sword, and apparently the skill to use both. The redneck marine kept changing the way he limped every three steps. The vampires at the end where not only completely lame, but also ancient beings still dress in long flowing capes. And the armor the main character made, seriously, what the hell, at what point in bio-engineering does a scientist learn how to create kevlar armor?<br /><br />*spoilers end here* <br /><br />so yes, everything said and done, this crime against humanity and intelligence should NEVER be watched, you will never regain the time you spent watching it, and at the end i see that the only possible purpose of this movie, to absorb and destroy small slices of life.
