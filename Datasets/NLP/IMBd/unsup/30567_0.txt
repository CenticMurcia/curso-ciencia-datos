''Yami no Matsuei'''or ''Descendants of Darkness'' is a manga and anime series created by Yoko Matsushita with a shonen Ai/Yaoi content. I personally think that this is one of the most dramatic and romantic stories of all times, and look, I am not exactly an Yaoi worshiper. I hope that Matsushita continue with the manga, because it sadly remains on hiatus since 2003, and the manga is FAR superior then the anime series. I just think Tsuzuki and Hisoka are so damm cute together! Tsuzuki is my favorite, but even the villain,Muraki, that is a very bad guy, cannot make me hate him,because without him, many awesome moments would never happen. By the way, one of the things I love in this story is the fact that it alternates between very violent scenes, with others who are very sweet and light-hearted.
