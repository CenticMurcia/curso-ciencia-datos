Adapted from Wendy MacLeod's play with almost no apparent changes for better or worse, director Mark Waters penned this screenplay about the incest between a Jackie Onassis-obsessed girl and her obliging brother.<br /><br />From start to finish, the air is filled with intellectual dialogue like "What?" and "I don't know", including the padded repeating of several lines like "What do you do all day?" - five times in a row, that one. The acting is small-time all around except for the appealing performances of Genevieve Bujold and Tori Spelling as a spooky mother and waifish fianc√©, respectively. Sometimes interesting dark comedy has occasional eerie moments if one can get past the JFK assassination 'parody'.<br /><br />Pretty good title, anyway.
