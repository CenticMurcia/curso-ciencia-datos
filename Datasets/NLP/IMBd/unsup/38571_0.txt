I saw this movie this noon, and a few, if not many questions, popped out of me. the tag line of this movie was something like "nothing can ever silence the true evil." So it is implied that Jesse Mowatt was the true evil. Then how about the warden? He was something of a sadist and an evil, wasn't he? In the scene where Jesse controlled the warden with his will power and made him commit suicide, it is like indicating that the warden deserved it. if the warden really do, then Jesse Mowatt was doing something good, and it is not up to a "true evil" to do something good, if the story wanted to make a clear story.<br /><br />Well, what can I say? It is not a impressive movie, even with all its scenes obviously aiming to create sensations, like a worm in the bloody brain, so on. It is a movie that after seeing it , no one would be thinking about it any more, like plain water, after you drink it, you only remember that you drank it, but with no memory of how.<br /><br />besides, the characters were left unexplored. how big an influence had Mowatt's father left on him? how did Mowatt change from a human to a demon? we were told but not showed. one credit though, the acting was great.
