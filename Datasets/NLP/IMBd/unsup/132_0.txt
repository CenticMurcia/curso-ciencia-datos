Nikita Taylor is not a good girl.She's a heroin addict who participates in robbing the pharmacy.It ends up badly and she's the only survivor.She's sentenced for life for shooting a policeman.But one day she finds out Nikita no longer exists and she has to work as an assassin.Things get more complicated when she falls in love with a cashier.Nikita is an action thriller directed by Luc Besson.In 1993 John Badham made an English version called Point of No Return with Bridget Fobda in the lead.In the French version Anne Parillaud does a great job as Nikita.Jean-Hugues Anglade is terrific as her boyfriend Marco.Tch√©ky Karyo is brilliant as Bob.Jeanne Moreau is wonderful as Amande.Jean Reno is fantastic as Victor the cleaner.We all remember his outstanding performance also as a cleaner in Leon (1994), a Luc Besson masterpiece.The restaurant sequence looks quite awesome.She has to make her first assassination on her birthday.And the job she does with Victor, and he wastes all those bullets on those men and gets shot.I wish Luc Besson could come up with stuff like this some day again.Nikita is a great representative of the action genre.
