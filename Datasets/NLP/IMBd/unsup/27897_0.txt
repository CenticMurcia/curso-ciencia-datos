This movie is the best. It will keep you laughing through the whole movie. Adam is really great. But to me the funniest guy was Ben Stiller, the guy in charge of the old folks home. When he is alone with Gramma you know he will keep the laughs coming throughout this film. If you don't think this is really a good movie see it again and notice a whole bunch of little things. They are really funny. Even Shooter Mc'Gavin is a hoot. But the funniest part of the whole movie is what happens between Happy and Bob Barker. I won't tell you what but trust me, you won't be disapointed with the result. 8/10
