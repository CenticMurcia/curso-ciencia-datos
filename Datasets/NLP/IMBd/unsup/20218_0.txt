It was already clear that dancing is a great substitute for self-hating activities like smoking, overeating or filling up an ex's voice mail. It should follow that dancing can replace hate itself. The makers of RIZE have given us an infinite gift demonstrating this. What a rare and beautiful way to spend two hours. It makes you want to turn to the person next to you, and just take care of them. The dancing and sheer creativity and heart in this movie are something to behold. There are stars born, and people to fall in love with. Keaton Simons & Morgan Simons let me know about Dave LaChapelle's photography years ago. The only way to describe the visuals in LaChapelle's videos and films is sheerly courageous. Don't just see RIZE. Live by it.
