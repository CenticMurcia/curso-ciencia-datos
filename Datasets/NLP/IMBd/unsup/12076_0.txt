Don't wait for this film to come out on DVD. It needs a really big screen and a full 2.35 aspect ratio. Viggo Mortenson gives a strong if albeit muted performance, Omar Shariff has more charisma than any man deserves, a beautiful score by James Newton Howard, and a magical movie moment in the last few minutes of the picture made this a must see flick. Too bad it was overshadowed by the Gibson picture, hopefully it will make it back in home video. If you ever craved adventure without it resorting to comic book formula, this is your picture - at least for now. 8/10 downgraded for some pasteboard bad guys. Kudos to Joe Johnston for his best directorial effort.
