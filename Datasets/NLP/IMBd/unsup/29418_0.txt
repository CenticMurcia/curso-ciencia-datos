Antonio Banderas plays a rich Cuban man in the late 1800s-early 1900s, who orders a mail order bride (Angelina Jolie). Unfortunately, she turns out to be a load of trouble.<br /><br />Horrible adaptation of a great book ("Waltz into Darkness" by Cornell Woolrich). There's some beautiful set design, exotic locations and good acting by Banderas and Jolie. None of that can compensate for the leaden pace, horrible script, laughable performance by Thomas Jane (who appears drunk most of the time) and annoyingly jerky direction by Michael Cristofer. Also, why does this take place in Cuba? The original novel is set in America.<br /><br />The only reason to see this tripe is for a very steamy sex scene between Banderas and Jolie within the first half hour. After that, tune out. ALMOST worth sitting through for the real stupid ending (different from the book).<br /><br />A waste of talent.
