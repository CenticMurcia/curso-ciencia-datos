I found this movie to be a great introduction to the Indigo Chilren. The key being an introduction, there are many other resources available for more detailed information about the Indigo Children. Filmed on a small budget of donations (approximately $500,000), everyone involved did a wonderful job. Actually going to a movie theater and seeing a movie, (with popcorn for breakfast), that was Spiritually based in theme was a genuine pleasure. I could easily look for "something wrong" about the movie, yet I choose to SEE otherwise. Thats my choice. My guests and I are already looking forward to the next film. We all totally enjoyed the movie.
