Its a sad day in Hollywood when important media events are exploited as soul vehicles for Academy Award Nominations...It is very sad to see the most conspicious consumers in Hollywood pretend to have a heart to place a Golden Statue on their Mantles in the name of Art and Intellectualism...Film is the avenue to the consciousness of the world we live in...My Hope is that people run out of the theatre and cringe in dismay at the abysmal performances of a technological facsimily of Acting this film gives its audience...Hollywood should be disturbed at what is considered good Acting among its elite and rein in the obvious exploitation of story, plot and heart...This is truly a disappointing and non-academy award winning film.....................
