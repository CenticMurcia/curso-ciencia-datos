the smokers is a film that tries to convey an angst ridden coming of age movie based around the lives of three young girls. it does so through dramatic overused cliches, sub-par acting and laughable musical accompaniments to "enlighten" the viewer when to discern the dramatic moments. <br /><br />a truly painful movie to watch. the three main characters are deluded into a demented idea of sexual revolution consisting of trash talk and violence against men. none of which tries the simple idea of self empowerment. by their views guns and fear are the only weapons a woman can use to gain a standing in the world. all in all the film had a happy ending because the dumbest girl who started it all died.<br /><br />II you feel too good about yourself and would like to waste 1and a half hours of your life (that you can never get back) this movie should still be penultimate on your list ... cause nobody can hate themselves this much.
