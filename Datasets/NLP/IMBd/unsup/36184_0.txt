Warning: this review MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS. But there's a good chance you're not going to want to see it anyhow.<br /><br />This is a boring movie. Exactly why one of the characters had to find a doorway out of a waxwork is beyond me because it would at least have ended the movie quicker. <br /><br />What happens is a magician invites six teens to his wax museum, which houses waxworks of scenes from famed horror films like "Dracula", "Frankenstein", "The Wolfman", "Return of the Living Dead" and...........*drum roll*..........."Little Shop of Horrors". The scenes have one character missing and the teens are able to enter the waxworks. For each waxwork, there is a sequence based on the lead-up to whatever the waxwork represented. At the end of each sequence, the waxwork is completed (using a nice edit that is the only thing I can applaud in this movie). With that premise, the film could have been A LOT better<br /><br />Unfortunately, one of the waxworks is, as I mentioned, based on "Return of the living Dead" or some other zombie movie, and there is only one thing you can do when faced with a horde of zombies. Pity. This movie could have been over a lot quicker.<br /><br />As you've gathered from the above review, this movie was a disappointment and not worth wasting the $4 on in the rental store
