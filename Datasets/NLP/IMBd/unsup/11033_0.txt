I first saw "Outrageous!" on Channel 4 in 1985,I'd read a glowing review of it by Danny Peary in his "Cult Movies"book,so I was all prepared and taped it.I really loved it,and it has become one of my favourite films ever.Unfortunately the tape I recorded it on was'nt very good quality and it snapped.I thought I'd never see it again and even wrote to C4 begging them to re-show it.Luckily I got a VHS copy from the US,but it really is about time it got a DVD release,maybe with some personal recollections from surviving cast members,especially the delightful Hollis Mclaren. It would take so much more than 1000 words to say what this film means to me.It really transcends its medium and is a lovesong to friendship,warmth,humour and Tallulah Bankhead. As Danny Peary wrote,the films title should'nt be "Outrageous!",but "Courageous!".<br /><br />Update: The DVD, yaaay!! But no Hollis MacLaren on the commentary, which is a pity. Never mind,still an absolute delight to see after all these years.
