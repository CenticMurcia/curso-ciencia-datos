A genuinely funny and thought provoking film, with a number of surreal elements, and a lot of humour. The leading lady is always wanting to eat and announcing a meal - with shades of Bunuel's Discreet Charms - and there are very funny jokes dispersed amongst the film in the most unexpected places. It is very off the wall, and although others have said that it has disjointed dialogue etc, that's what's intended, and it is more like real life in a remote Cote d'Azure fort with such an odd bunch of people would be.<br /><br />It's great - well worth a view. I saw it on a plane with English subtitles, and am now searching to see if I can buy it on DVD with subtitles.
