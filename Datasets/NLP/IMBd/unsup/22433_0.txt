I was surprised when i watched this movie, it wasn't as bad as i thought it would be in fact it was quite good. well it's quite a Jaws Rip off but hey - it's a lot better than some other shark movies for instance - "Tintorera" which was a complete waste of time. i was also surprised when i read that it was released as Jaws 3 in some countries when it hit the theaters, well it is better than Jaws pt 3 and 4. one thing that i like with this movie (spoiler warning) is the ending - right about after the sharks death - when they all get safety on land just before the end text is coming and the sad music is appears - it reflects sorrow, evil and even madness, and the survivors gets into the car - it is a great scene probably the best in the entire movie (according to me). the movie also contains crappy and dumb scenes, but hey - doesn't every classic cult flicks do ?. the shark looks part of better than in the Jaws (a little but not much). it has a great opening too (spoiler warning) - a guy vanished on his windsurfing board, a little bit rip from Jaws 2. the movie is a very like Jaws in someways - there is a guy who looks just like Robert Shaw and same job. well i like the movie, it is my favorite "Cult Classic" - if you should see a better shark movie that Jaws 4 - see The Last Shark. can't wait for it to get an official release, i only know that there is an bootleg but with Japanese text on it. another info (just for fun): it was released in Sweden as "JätteHajen - Vindsurfarnas Skräck".<br /><br />7/10.
