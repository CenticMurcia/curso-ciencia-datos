I love Barry Sonnenfeld as a nice crazy director, although all of my friends dislike a lot of his work but I've always loved his distinctiveness and advanced capabilities in not too many movies like (Men in Black - 1997) or (Wild Wild West - 1999) or as a producer of the brilliant TV-Series (Secret Agent Man - 2000). Yes, he is not one of the greatest NOW but I think he hasn't had the REAL BIG chance to prove that he could be one of the immortal fun makers.. BUT HERE ..It's simply his worst.<br /><br />I want to know indeed what's in here to be watched ??, where is the plot ?, what's about ?, and what's the beauty of it (if there is a beauty in it at all ??!!). I've read that John Travolta after he came back to life by the force of (Pulp Fiction - 1994), he was agreeing to whatever Quentin Tarantino strengthened to him !!..and I'm not sure about Tarantino's kind of taste !! So it's nothing unusual to have a movie by Travolta like (Get Shorty) ! <br /><br />Not only because the stars in it I've watched THIS for 3 times !! But mainly to understand why on Earth they made it ?? It's not a crime comedy and of course it's not a thriller (like you will read in the column of genre at the main details page in our very site !), and it's not originally a drama with meaning ! <br /><br />So who's Shorty ?, and why would we get him ?? OH it's a complete waste of time with a lot of "after the strange success of Pulp Fiction's ego or false confidence" which produced very empty movie like this.<br /><br />The only thing that have been saved and deserved watching was : the scene in which Rene Russo takes off her clothes and we get to see her long beautiful legs and her colored panty as well !! Plus that other scene where Bette Midler tempted Gene Hackman.. Though unfortunately both of the 2 scenes had been deleted from the movie by our censorship !! So for me, watching that movie was nothing but searching for something which's non-existent, and I mean fun ..by every sense of the word.
