A great sci-fi film and a good cast and music from David Bowie excellent special effects make this film a must to view and have myself seen over 50 times at least surely this must be released on DVD likewise night of the comet also starring catherine mary stewart and is equally a great film.it seems that the best cult classics are always the last to appear on DVD. An excellent soundtrack also help this movie along even though its not needed. At around 90 minutes this is one sci-fi film to look out for.... The David bowie song ashes to ashes is heard at two pivitol moments in the movie and indeed makes the movie that much more enjoyable.
