I am watching it right now on TCM. It has been digitally restored and a new soundtrack added. The music is excellent. I was sure it was 'period' until I saw the credits, which are rolling as I type.<br /><br />Marie Prevost is amazing, she dominates every scene in which she appears. Her expressions and body language are astounding. It helps you understand what silent movie acting is all about.<br /><br />This was a Howard Hughes production. I believe the picture is longer than 60 minutes, though.<br /><br />The University of Nevada at Las Vegas is credited with this restoration project. They did a great job. I love this movie.
