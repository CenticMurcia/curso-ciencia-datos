I first saw the movie and I liked it, not that much, but it was entertaining (I haven't read the manga, so I couldn't enjoy the movie like others did). People had told me that the manga was a lot better and that I'd probably enjoy the series much more.<br /><br />I don't read manga so I decided to check the series out. The first episodes were pretty good so I continued watching them and... by the time I was half way through, I couldn't stop watching them. The story was so well made that it had absorbed me in an addictive way.<br /><br />The music is actually pretty good too and... after purchasing the Special Edition, I have to say... the English Dub is horrible. Stay with the Japanese version with English subtitles, you'll enjoy it a lot better that way.<br /><br />In resume: a must see even for non anime fans, extremely addictive story and... stick with subtitles, the dubbing will kill the whole thing. (And I actually liked the fansubs better than the official subs, they were a lot more detailed and had nice explanations for very interesting things).
