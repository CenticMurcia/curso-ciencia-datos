it is a tired excuse for film making when directors, writers, actors and actresses come together and make a 'harrowing', 'powerful', 'grim' movie about drugs, sex and whatever else they care to throw at the screen. Other movies that come to mind are the recent precious and the ribald Monster's Ball. They pretend to loath the ugliness of the reality they present but in actual fact revel in it. This movie is just such an example of worthy bourgeois film making passing itself off as insightful and profound. If anyone care to watch a film by sensitive film makers involved in telling real stories about real people with real problems, without the unnecessary dressage of actresses and their inflated personalities, check out anything by the wonderful Ken Loach (British) or the Dardenne brothers (Belgian).
