I was disappointed, given the talent involved. We have a right to expect better. In it, a cop (David Caruso) investigates the brutal, ritualistic murder of an art dealer, and finds the murder weapon has the fingerprints of his former lover (Linda Fiorentino), a beautiful psychiatrist who is married to his friend, a powerful, corrupt lawyer. It could have been good. Fiorentino gives as good a performance as is possible under the circumstances, and the film is well-shot on location, with haunting background music. But the story is wallows in sordid behavior and it doesn't make a lot of sense. And the solution to the murder is tacked on to the end, as if an afterthought, and it doesn't make a great deal of sense, either. The audiences certainly weren't impressed, and this film damaged the careers of everyone involved. Indeed, it nearly deep-sixed David Caruso's career, as he left "Hill Street Blues," at its peak of popularity to appear in this film. Too bad!
