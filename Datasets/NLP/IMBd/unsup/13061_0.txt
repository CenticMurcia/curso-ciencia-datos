This movie never went anywhere. There was little point to this movie. The dialog was painfully boring. Andie McDowell was the only good thing in the movie. Her character seemed more natural and less forced. Dennis Quaid's character had annoying mannerisms and an irritating way of talking. Greg Kinner's character was all over the place. There was little or no cohesiveness to the character. Toni Colette who I LOVE was basically a non-entity in the movie. Her best dialog and acting came within the first 15 minutes of the movie. It sucked me in and made me want to see what happened...but NOTHING really ever happened. The movie also jumped back and forth between current time and 1988. This was supposed to show the beginning and end of the relationship. But there was very little explanation, and didn't even help move the movie forward. I wouldn't suggest wasting your time on this movie.
