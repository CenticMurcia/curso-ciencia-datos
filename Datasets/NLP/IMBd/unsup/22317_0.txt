'Red Dwarf' took a little time to get into focus. But once it did there were few shows that matched it for hilarious sketches. The dynamic foursome of Lister, Cat, Rimmer and Kryten were too good to miss. Each represented one particular vice - sloth, vanity, pride and stupidity.<br /><br />Every week the Grant/Naylor writing team concocted some of the most bizarre situations that nevertheless still had some foundation in science. Some of the lines were priceless, but the timing was also important and the team must take full credit for their part.<br /><br />The blokes-in-space format worked wonderfully. Unfortunately; somebody somewhere decided that it was no longer politically-correct for men to have fun by themselves any more, and a former girlfriend of Lister's found her way into the script. A comedienne might have fitted the bill, but instead we had a straight actress trying to do 'blokish' humour, and it fell absolutely flat. The show devolved into a 'four naughty boys constantly chastened by bossy matriarch' format, which seems to be the modern standard-bearer of new anti-male presentation. Each programme seemed to be an issue of sexual politics.<br /><br />The fun was over; feminism had arrived. As Wilfred Thessiger once remarked 'Women spoil everything'. Well, they certainly spoilt this.<br /><br />Attempts to re-make the series will almost certainly fail. It was great while it lasted, but the idea ran its course. If you really want more - watch the DVD's.
