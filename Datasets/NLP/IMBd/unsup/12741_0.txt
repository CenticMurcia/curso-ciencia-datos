In this film John Sayles creates a mood of mystical enchantment where Irish myths come alive in a way that can involve even a hardened realist. One thing that makes this story work is that it is told through the eyes of a young girl - I was able to identify with her belief in the story she tells.<br /><br />The natural setting around Denegal, Ireland, is one of the big stars. The seascapes are beautifully filmed and the extensive footage of the seals is endearing. Is there anyone with soul so dead who does not find seals adorable? <br /><br />One of the greatest values this movie had for me was Sayles' reference to Robert Flaherty's "Man of Aran" in his director's commentary. He said that he had watched that in preparing for the filming of "Roan Inish." That put me on to watching "Man of Aran," which I had never heard of. It provides background, in addition to being a worthy film in its own right. Having liked "Man of Aran" I went on to see Flaherty's "Louisiana Story" which is better yet.
