Indeed people should generally not wait for the same thing if it comes, say, from Hollywood or Europe. In the case of "Love Affair" people should watch opera rather than this genre -- I highly recommend "Carmen" with Julia Miguenes-Johnson and Placido Domingo (1984) -- the epitome of a love affair as immortal as always! Titles chosen by the movie industry have -- alas! -- transcended good taste, and with it, semantic borders: maybe simply by following the pattern of our modern lives where the element of surprise has been discarded and replaced by circadian and pecuniary worries. Comparing Cary Grant to Warren Beatty (in terms of this being a remake) is like putting Berlioz next to Madonna!
