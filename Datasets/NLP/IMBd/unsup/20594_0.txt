This has got to be one of the lowest budget films ever produced in Britain , and considering it`s a British film that is indeed saying a lot . In fact it`s somewhat insulting to consider NOT NOW COMRADE a " film " since as one contributer mentioned it`s a stage play . It`s like someone has gone into the local theartre with a film camera and started filming . The interiors resemble those you`d see in a theartre and you can clearly hear the CLUMP CLUMP CLUMP as the actors run around the wooden floors like you would in an auditorium . I guess some people might be pretentious pseudo-intellectuals and say the film has a self referential marxist theme because of the title and therefore that`s why there`s been no money spent but I`d say correctly that even in 1976 it would have been an outdated British B movie with limited appeal hence no one would want to invest money into it
