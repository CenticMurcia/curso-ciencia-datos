Ang Lee's newest Chinese film is both poignant and shocking. It is this years masterpiece. Lee combines espionage with erotic love scenes, it's not the common pair in films nowadays but it works out for the best. Lust spans over the time line of 4 years in World War II torn Shanghai and Hong Kong. Tai Wei stars (in a near perfect performance) as Wong Chia Chi a young actress who is convinced to join the resistance with friend Kuang (Wang Leehom) to help seduce and assassinate Chinese traitor Mr. Yee (an amazing Tony Leung in an Oscar worthy performance). The film is incredibly detailed as well, and keeps your attention at each detail as well, whether it's mahjongg games with Mrs. Yee (Joan Chen) or a mind-numbing love scene where Mr. Yee tortures Wong Chia Chi like most of the victims he interrogates.<br /><br />The film became widely known when it received the dreaded NC-17 from the MPAA. In the screening I went to though, people seemed more shocked at the only violent scene in the film (that isn't mentioned in the films' rating) than the initially "controversial" sex scenes. The sex though was done tastefully, it was over the top, and it was heartfelt. Unlike most R-rated films nowadays. <br /><br />While watching the film I was also drawn into the wonderful world that Lee created. It had the look and feel of a former utopia that was now a hellish war torn city. It almost gave the feeling that I was there with the people.<br /><br />I can easily see this film getting an Adapted Screenplay nomination for the Oscars just like Lee's previous film the widely controversial 'Brokeback Mountain'. The film is based on Eileen Chang's short story with the same title. James Schamus and Hui-Ling Wang made a great script, the dialog moved the film forward gracefully.<br /><br />Thanks to the MPAA though, a portion of the art-house audience won't be allowed to see this film. Take my word however, this film is worth getting a fake I.D. for.<br /><br />I give it a 9 out of 10
