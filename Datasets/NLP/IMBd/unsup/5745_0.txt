Enjoyable little flick that's pretty entertaining and often quite funny. the whole cast was good and were all very likable, and it's pretty well made. it had a good blend of horror and comedy and it also had a nice little twist at the end that i didn't see coming. Once again this film clearly benefits from the presence of Bela Lugosi, and The Ritz Brothers were amusing. The Direction is solid. Alan Dwan did a solid job here creating a nice atmosphere and moving it along at a pretty quick pace. There is no gore. The acting was good. Bela Lugosi does a great job here as The Butler and i wish he had more screen time!, still the film benefited a lot with his presence. Al Ritz, Harry Ritz, and Jimmy Rits have there moments and were funny at times. Anita Louise did well here with what she had to do and had decent chemistry with Edward Norris.Patsy Kelly does okay here, and all her screaming was hilarious. Lionel Atwill is great as always and did awesome here. Edward Norris did an adequate job. Overall i enjoyed this and i recommend it to you *** out of 5
