George Lucas hit upon a classic theme, 1950's nostalgia in 1973. When folks wanted to forget about being a modern teen, getting drafted, and wanted mindless fun this movie did it. Lucas got this inspiration from his own teen years as he turned 16 in 1959. This meant that while he would later draw on Ben Hur for the Star Wars saga, he first achieved success here drawing on his earlier childhood.<br /><br />The brief introduction of Suzanne Summers & Harrison Ford in this movie were not noticed until years later. Wolfman Jack on the other hand got a great boost from this film and became an icon of his own. Ronnie Howard was already a big name from Andy Griffith. This movie would boost him into the Happy Days.<br /><br />This film is our look into the 1950's age that Lucas remembered oh so well. This film does it so well that you almost forget the 1960's ever happened & we all grew up. The sexual innuendo from this would carry on for Lucas. Chewy, get into there, I don't care how it smells. Just let me turn on that radio dial & spend another night with the Wolfman.
