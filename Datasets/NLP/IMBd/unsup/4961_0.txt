This movie is about a young starving artist lady who's mom buys her a Volvo, but doesn't entirely pay for it. So the lady must make money to keep the Volvo, and at the same time find love.<br /><br />The lady has a fun but stereotypical gay roommate, a stereotypical "dahling" rich mom, and a crush on a boring supermarket cashier (which just seems pathetic not funny).<br /><br />Definitely the funniest part of the movie is when the lady says "oh, what the hell" and tries a phone sex job. The job doesn't work out, but the faces she makes while trying to finish a call are definitely funny.<br /><br />Other parts of the movie involve police officers who help the lady after problems with the phone sex job. Eventually, she and the younger police officer hit it off on a date (sort of like Grand Canyon), but it didn't seem deeply romantic to me.<br /><br />Overall, the movie does a nice job of mixing the trials of life with the joys of love. Enjoyable, but not Citizen Kane.
