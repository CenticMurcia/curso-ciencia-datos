After having watched this movie Dracula III i thought that they should have kept Stephen Billington as the one and only Dracula in the third movie because he gave it that, how do you say?, mystery and yet at the same time he keeps you on the edge of your seat, your heart rate fast and makes you anticipate his beautifully exotic voice. I also thought that they could have put a little more romance into it between Elizabethand Dracula and instead of what happened they could have kept him in alive. I mean if everybody wants vampires dead than why the fascination with them? Well, I think it because they're thought of by all as mysterious and sensuously alluring, but then again that's just me or do other people feel the same too. And by the way Rutger Hauer was a very bad pick to play the role of Dracula for this movie.
