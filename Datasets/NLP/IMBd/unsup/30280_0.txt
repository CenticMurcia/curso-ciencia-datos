just secreted a copy of this from ebay (ka-ching) and the direction, heck, the everything, about this production of this american classic is (insert emphatic swear word here) divine...this is the only version i've seen that holds the humor, the madness, the horrifying irony involved in this story...it is just perfect!...Dennehy Rocks (duh!); Franz Rocks: the whole thing is just WOW!!! so good, man...beauty, art, life--showtime? believe it!!!
