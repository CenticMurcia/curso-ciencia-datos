Joe Spinell will always be one of my favorite actors. There was something about this guy that made him fun to watch, not to mention the fact that he was one of the most underrated actors in the business. The problem he had in his career was that he never was offered good scripts, especially leading roles. He had the talent, but the industry was sour to him. Here he had a chance to make a really good horror flick but failed miserably. Had this movie been a really brutal, in-your-face gore flick, he would have succeeded and possibly gone onto better gigs. Unfortunately, the opposite happened and after this garbage he almost vanished completely and never got another chance.<br /><br />Score, BOMB
