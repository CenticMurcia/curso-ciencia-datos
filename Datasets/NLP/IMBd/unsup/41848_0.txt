Saw this at OUTFEST and the director said he was inspired by John Hughes and the teen sex comedy genre. It seemed like he was inspired more by television sitcoms, though. The script and the dialogue suck but the actors are pretty good and they're able to make most of it palatable. Unfortunately, the basic premise is just really uninspired. <br /><br />There is a phone sex scene which IS really well done, though, and it feels like the rest of the movie is just a sloppy construction designed to frame that scene. There's a really bad scene where four people play two pianos at a party - it just goes on and on forever in the most unrealistic way, and then you realize that the whole interminable scene was constructed to set up a punch line that is only mildly amusing. <br /><br />The thing that keeps you interested in the movie is how cute the actors are... overall, a forced, boring movie where you get to see the exploitation of two cute/good actors' genitals for five seconds. 4 out of 10.
