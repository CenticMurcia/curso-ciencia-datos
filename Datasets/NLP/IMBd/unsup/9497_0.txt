While there are a few weak plot points, this Asian movie is a powerful singular experience into the extortion of young girls into prostitution focusing on one young, innocent girl and the prime male mover behind the scenes whose performance is one of distorted excellence. How the girl gets into trouble, her boyfriend's convenient disappearance in the storyline, the haphazard escape resolution can be mostly ignored for the more intriguing and subtle harshness of the movie, the avoidance of graphic sexual content for more qualitative subtlety. The ending somewhat questionable in terms of the lack of character transition, does provide some fascinating questions regarding loyalty, Stockholm syndrome and such. Seven out of Ten Stars.
