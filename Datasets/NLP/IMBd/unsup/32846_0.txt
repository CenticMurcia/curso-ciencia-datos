The movie was presented in order to "educate" the public on the 40 year gang epidemic amongst the black youths of our Los Angeles society. It was, in short, a failure. The inability to show the true cause of gangs (i.e. the gangsters themselves) was flabbergasting. Yes, they were able to eloquently throw around the term "disenfranchised," yet had no clue as to why these characters chose the streets. It boils down to this: Money, power, and (perceived) respect. Nothing more. Racism did not start this problem. Slavery did not start this problem. Their absentee father did not start this problem. There is an easy, high school-level word that can describe gangs perfectly. That word is opportunism. They brought this movie forward to an extremely gullible and impressionable public who believes whatever they see on TV and they failed to show these black gangsters for what they truly are: professional victims. "Nothing is my fault." No accountability. "It's the white man's fault, it's the Cub Scouts' fault, it's the policeman's fault." The "I did not create this, it was created for me" idea is tired and hackneyed. Black people are disproportionately represented in prison? 28%? Perhaps if they decided to stop committing crime in this state, the numbers might even out. Why can't we have a documentary that simply reports the facts, with no agenda? Why must we perpetuate this myth that the black man can do no wrong? That, somehow, it's someone else's fault? I watched this movie in order to gain a deeper perspective when it comes to the gang culture. Instead I just found myself wading in the deeper-than-usual B.S. Congratulations and thanks a bunch. My opinion of (and my hope for) the blacks youths of L.A. has officially faltered.
