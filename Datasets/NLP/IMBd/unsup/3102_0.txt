Gremlins probably is under rated, but it thourougly delivers when your looking for a comedy and a bit of tame horror(theres hardly any). Even though the little critters are evil, they are very likeable and the people who created them did a fantastic job in designing them.<br /><br />And in the end, after you watch it, you really will wonder if thats a possum or gremlin in the vent ;)
