That it is possible to find so much signs of life in a cemetery is something striking in the carefully composed film of Heddy Honigmann. And so much consolation in beauty is also something I'll never forget from seeing the film. Beauty in the form of art, but also in the form of mementos left for the beloved death ones. Human voices telling stories are in this film sometimes as beautiful as a piece of music by Chopin!! Most of the characters in the film are very special and at the same time you feel a connection with almost all of them, as if they were your friends telling you a personal story while you're sitting with them in a park. Forever should be in the cinema for a long time, as long as all my friends can see it, and as long as they can tell their friends to see it and so on and so on...
