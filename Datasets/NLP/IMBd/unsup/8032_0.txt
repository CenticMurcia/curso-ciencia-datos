This movie features one of our American working-class heroes. It is perfectly ironic that he was an Aussie. What a lesson for those considering immigration restrictions today! <br /><br />This film should be required in all secondary schools worldwide. Bravo Ian Ruskin and Haskell Wexler!<br /><br />Combining drama and theater with historical footage, this film brings to life the tumultuous times when working people in America made a great leap forward. All such movements require leaders who can make others believe that their lives are worth so much more than what some boss is willing to pay them for their labor.<br /><br />Indeed, there is Strength in Unity. An Injury to One is an Injury to All!<br /><br />Buy this DVD; get it on the air in your community.
