This gem of a TV movie has the Boris Karloff stamp all over it and together with usual atmospheric lighting and production bestowed upon a British TV thriller it makes for compelling viewing. It is nice to see that after a long and successful film career in the US that Mr Karloff decided to return to the land of his birth and make not only this film, but also others like 'Curse Of The Crimson Altar' which were shown on the big screen in the late Sixties and which are now shown regularly in Britain on television.<br /><br />His performance in 'The Veil' is up to his usual standard. What is particularly interesting is the many characters he plays in this film. He tackles them all - the weird, the wise and the perfectly normal. Robert Hardy too should get a mention for an early performance which showed the promise of what was to come in British television. By the way the year is either 1963 or 1964. I used to know but cannot be sure, now.
