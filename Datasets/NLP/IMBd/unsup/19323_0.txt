Once again, SciFi Channel delivers a movie that in the trailers is billed as a monster movie. But when you watch it, "King of the Lost World" ends up being a ridiculous piece of excrement about a plane that crashes somewhere in the Amazon, and the people's attempts to get the plane in good working order again and head back home. Terrible. The teasers about giant flying reptiles are lame. You only see the pterodactyl-like creatures for about five minutes in the whole movie. You also see one scene of killer scorpions, and then some "King Kong" ripoff giant gorilla stops by at the end of the movie to stomp on everyone. They even rip off the fighter-plane scene from "King Kong," as five or sex jets inexplicably appear out of nowhere and shoot at the ape, then just as quickly disappear, never to be seen again. The remaining hour-and-fifty-minutes features people trying to get the plane to work and white folks dressed up as indigenous tribal people who want to use the castaways as sacrifices and try to engage the doomed flight's women in lesbo-erotic behavior. The ONE saving grace of this movie is that the pseudo-pterodactyls gang up on the pseudo-King Kong at the end. But this movie deserves lower than a 1. I can't give it anything lower in the vote window, but I can give it a 1/2 out of 10 here. Horrible, horrible movie.
