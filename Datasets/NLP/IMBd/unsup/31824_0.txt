Pardes was a Hit movie from great director Subash Ghai. It tells the story of a girl from India, who has a arranged marriage with a guy from America. She gets engaged to him and travel to USA, and realises her fiancé is not a nice person. This is more of a woman's point of view based movie that stars Superstar Shahrukh Khan. He doesn't give a great performance as he usually does. This is mainly because the movie is more based on Mahima's life. Mahima looks very sexy and gives a fairly good performance. Her character is a little immature, which doesn't impress me. There is a scene where she is asked to sing a song in front of many people including her fiancé and in laws, but she see's Shahrukh, leaves the stage and runs toward him. She is suppose to be a village girl so it is acceptable. I'm sure not all village girls are this immature, not to understand, its bad manners and disrespectful to do this. Apoorva plays the Fiancé in a pathetic performance. His character has no realism, there is a scene where he starts a fight in the club with a American person. He starts talking to him in Hindi in a dreadful looking scene. Poor music and the movie does get a little slow at time. The ending looks rushed and unprofessional. Overall not such a bad film.
