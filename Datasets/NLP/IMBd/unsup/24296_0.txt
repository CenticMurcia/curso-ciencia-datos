I love this freaking comedy! It is the most funniest Adult Swim series since "The Boondocks". I love the "Transformers-Optimus Prime dies of prostate cancer" skit. I love the "The Robot Chicken Half Assed Christmas Special" last Christmas 2007. I really love "The Robot Chicken Star Wars Special". My most favorite was the "I'm so happy cause I'm a Gummy Bear" skit. You will be rolling around the floor laughing until you pee your pants. Watch this show and you will be satisfied...with constant laughing.<br /><br />Warning!: This cartoon may have some inappropriate scenes in their skits like the ones I mentioned above. This Adult Swim people. Not Nick, Jr.
