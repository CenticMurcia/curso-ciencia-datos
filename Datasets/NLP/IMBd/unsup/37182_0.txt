As a big fan of the original Susan Cooper series, I had some hope for the movie. Naturally, I was expecting some adjusting, and to not be AS satisfied as with my original read, but the degree to which this movie let me down was a surprise.<br /><br />As an adaptation, I found there to be a distinct lack of magic found in the original story. It deviated perhaps a little too far from the original plot, and included some extra sub-plots related to the family life etc which really did it no favours. Additionally, if they are hoping to work with the rest of the series- which is doubtful- they've shot themselves in the foot with all the plot adjustments, and by losing much of the legends etc involved.<br /><br />As a movie on its own, it was, to be honest, boring. The script was flat, and featured far too much repetition. I can only handle hearing Ian McShane bellow "YOU ARE THE SEEKER" so many times. Much of the film felt rushed, without adequate explanation, leaving many an 'eh?' in the air. I felt Will Stanton was miscast, but Christopher Eccleston was definitely a highlight.<br /><br />Overall? A big mess of a beautiful piece of writing.
