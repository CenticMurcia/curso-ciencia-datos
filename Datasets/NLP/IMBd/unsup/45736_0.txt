An interesting cast: - Tom Sizemore - Interesting character actor Dennis Hopper - Malevolant screen genius Steven Seagal - Entertaining grim reaper with ponytail<br /><br />And this is how they were cast: - Sizemore - Undercover cop, troubled alchoholic with(out) dead family. Avenging partner who looked like he had been a cop for all of two minutes, but was still able to offer cryptic life-affirming advice to Tom (who looked twice his age). Hopper - Northern Island terrorist with a part time accent. Seagal - Hint of Jamaican, with pony tail.<br /><br />The film editing leaves you thinking you fell asleep during large periods of plot development (blink and you'll miss it, or sometimes they just won't show it).<br /><br />The three main characters drift in and out of scenes, they start talking to each other somewhere in the middle of the film. Seagal looks tired and wants to be put out of his misery for turning up on set. Hopper is unstoppable, no amount of bad script stands between him and his pay cheque. Sizemore is steered through each scene.<br /><br />I fell asleep the end and was only disturbed from my slumber by a lot of banging going on (guns or bombs, or guns and bombs).<br /><br />If only Hopper had killed Sizemore and his partner at the beginning, then this film would have been a lot shorter.
