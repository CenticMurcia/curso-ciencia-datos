I remember waiting in anticipation for this series to start. Always a fan of his, I knew that his show would be a little different and more entertaining, (read: less dry), than the offerings that were available. I thought "The Pat Sajak Show" was the worst new talk show by the way.<br /><br />He held the traditional talk show stage with a few differences. He moved about his stage with ease and with the same style that people are expecting from him.<br /><br />He differed from his contemporaries by only focusing on 2 guests per night. Let the viewer see and hear more about his guests than other talk show hosts at the time.<br /><br />The only low-light of his short lived program was a despicable, rude appearance by Corben Bernsen. He came in straight away criticizing Chevy and, in the worst mannered ungrateful way, gave back his appearance gift he thought was cheap, and marched off the stage.<br /><br />Others view this program as terrible. I believe it is because Chevy is unique in his talent. And, it is some of the more simple and base forms of entertainment. To some people, he's too staid in his style.
