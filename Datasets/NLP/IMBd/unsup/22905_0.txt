This disjointed tale of the strange (sex) lives of strange people is amusing, nay hysterically funny for about ten or fifteen minutes as the oddness and non sequitur nature of the story telling and cheapness of the film bombard the viewer in an almost overwhelming barrage of weirdness. Then the film begins to drone on as we settle into naked old people, the violation of stuffed bears, and cross cut sequences that don't really add up to much. Whats the point of all of this? Your guess is as good as mine. I'm some how of the opinion that the point of the film is simply to push buttons for good or ill, and push buttons it does. I have yet to meet anyone one who's actually made it all the way through the film, most abandon it somewhere along the way as simply too much to take. Film as endurance test? perhaps. I for one suspect thats probably the case with out humble director trying more to put one over on his audience rather than enlighten them. I of course could be wrong, but with out some sort of guide to the true "meaning" we're left to deal with the shock visuals which is all anyone will probably talk about anyway. For those who want want disturbing images and don't mind them wrapped in a boring confection.
