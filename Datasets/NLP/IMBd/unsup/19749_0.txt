I don't go a lot of movies in the theatres, but when this one came back out after being nominated for a pile of oscars, I made the mistake of assuming that it would be a great movie.<br /><br />I can safely say that this movie was the worst thing I have ever seen. (of course I have yet to sit through Plan 9 from Outer Space)<br /><br />I kept waiting for some sort of story to emerge that I could relate to on some level, but that never happened. But I waited through 3 long hours for it... and I still don't know what the movie was trying to say. I didn't care about any of the characters, and was actually just bored and little disgusted with all the bloody violence.
