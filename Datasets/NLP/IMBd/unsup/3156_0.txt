I love this movie. The young actor to me was a young Sherlock Holmes. Nicholas Rowe as Sherlock, was human, respectful, humble, polite, wise and treated Watson like a brother not like the combative relationship in Sherlock Holmes 2009 and 2010.<br /><br />This Sherlock Holmes was not showy he was just a normal inquisitive guy who had instincts about certain crimes and went to the Lestrade/police with them. Sherlock was in love in this movie. Like the other movies this one had things that were not believable but more believable than 2009 and 2010 with their metal robots and ships. The special affects where great when victims experience the effects of the drug when shot with a blow gun. They saw thing like statues come alive and skull etc very scary. Watson's experience after being shot with the drug were funny. A stone opened at the cemetery that had shelves with all kinds of pastries. The pastries started jumping off the shelf,on to the ground talking to each other. They were all different sizes and shapes with big eyes and some pastries started shoving other pastries in to Watson mouth cherry cream and all. Really humorous . There wasn't a lot of fighting in this film until the end. It was like one of the Indiana Jones movies with the cult members running for their life and the building falling down.<br /><br />This is one movie that did not disappoint me.
