I must say that this is one of the best films I've seen in my life. It proves a great movie does not need to involve violence and sex... Plus, it makes you appreciate all the gifts you've got in your life. If Hollywood (and by these I mean the movie business) had more films like this one, it would have a nice positive impact on our poor and damaged society.<br /><br />Maybe it doesn't have outstanding special effects, or a main-role actor or actress who deserves an Academy Award, but the plot it's so great, that makes you analyze your own situation and feel thankful for what you have and realize you're missing a lot of nice simple great things of life... and it even makes you want to be a better person!<br /><br />Totally recommended for the whole family!
