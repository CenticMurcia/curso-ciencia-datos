From a lot of the reviews I've seen here and elsewhere for "Night Shift", Michael Keaton seems to get most of the credit for making the movie entertaining. Well, he is great but few people are giving deserved props to Winkler's performance. Sure, he is a little boring and plain but that's the nature of his character. I related more to him than Keaton, whose wild antics and personality are fun and not too over-the-top. A nice balance is struck between his craziness as Bill and Winkler's calm, yet clumsy and likable Chuck. Appropriately enough, I am finding "Night Shift" an excellent viewing for the night time, particularly as I am settling into bed. Not that it bores me to sleep, far from it...but it's more fun to watch in the evening because of it's setting and premise, NY morgue employees-turned-pimps who do it all at night.
