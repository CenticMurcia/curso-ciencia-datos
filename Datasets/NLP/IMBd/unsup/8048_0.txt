A doctor and a young lady(beautiful Rita Calderoni)have just been involved in a car accident.The doctor leaves the girl at the accident scene,and runs off to a spooky castle for help.He enters the castle,and finds that it's inhabited by some laughing ghoul(most likely Satan himself).Later,the young lady goes looking for the doctor,and eventually finds her way to the same castle.However when they meet again,they find that they haven't met each other,they have meet their doppelgangers.Luigi Batzella's "Nude for Satan" is a great piece of sleazy trash.The special effects are jaw-droppingly awful(a monster spider especially comes to my mind!)and the dialogue is horrid. Still there is plenty of nudity to satisfy fans of Italian sleaze.Rita Calderoni is naked pretty often and her lesbian scenes are suitably sensual.A must-see for fans of Italian sleaze/horror!
