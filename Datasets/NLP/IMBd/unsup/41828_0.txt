This film looked promising at start: it showed the matter of fact violence perpetrated by a boy carrying automatic gun. I thought for a second that finally someone would talk about the extent of this aspect of child abuse in Africa, where there are so many unscrupulous thugs who supply children with weapons, and let them kill (and be killed) at will.<br /><br />But then it quickly turned into a typical Hollywood production, with a typical for the "progressive" Hollywood left-wing agenda, which can be summarized very simply as: the UN and the International Court are noble and good, and they matter. To me, this idea defies reality, and the movie that promotes it is ridiculous.
