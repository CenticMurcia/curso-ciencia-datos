Wow, I just saw it on DVD, and I couldn't stop laughing.<br /><br />The scene when the father is stuck "in" the reporter... it was so over the top and insane and funny, that I think I just peed my pants.<br /><br />Who would have thought, a movie that talks about: incest, rape, bullying, with insane black humor, that promotes family values...<br /><br />I'm surprised so many people didn't get the humor/meaning of this movie.<br /><br />You have to go beyond the violence/sex to understand it, like any Miike's film.<br /><br />Unique, extremely funny and disturbing.<br /><br />8/10
