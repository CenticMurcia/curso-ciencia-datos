This film is a penetrating look into the underworld of prostitution and crime in Korea, but it is much more than that. It is an examination of the psychology of obsessive love, and also fate, or at least, of fateful decisions.<br /><br />A beautiful college girl is set up by criminals after she "rejects" the bizarre and violent sexual advance/attack on her by a deviant pimp. Later on, a trick to frame her might have as easily not worked if she hadn't been so impulsive, but on the other hand these criminals may have an uncanny sense of people which develops as a survival instinct.<br /><br />I won't say more in order not to spoil the film for those who'd like to go see it, but I recommend it very much. By the way, there is a lot of violence, so it's not for the squeamish by any means.<br /><br />
