My wife and I saw this movie when HBO or Cinemax broadcast it sometime around 1982. We still talk about it.<br /><br />My wife's boss also saw the movie in her home at the same time, and it seems that all of us were just too tired or lazy to get up and change the channel (this was before the days of wireless remotes for cable).<br /><br />The movie is SLOW and just incredibly B O R I N G! <br /><br />But then, like a steam engine pulling a long train, the movie starts picking up speed. By the end of the movie, my wife and I were on the edge of our seats. We later found out that my wife's boss had the exact same experience.<br /><br />I'd love to see the movie again, but it seems that the slow first part of this movie has turned so many people off that few people have seen the whole thing, and therefore, there's virtually no demand for this nail-biting, on-the-edge-or-your-seat story.
