Michael J. Fox plays Dr. Benjamin Stone, who is on his way to Beverly Hills, where he has a well-paid job waiting.He takes a short cut to avoid the traffic jam but hits into a fence in a small town called Grady.He has to do 32 hrs of community service at the hospital.In Grady he meets all these people, like Dr. Aurelius Hogue (Barnard Hughes), Hank Gordon (Woody Harrelson), Mayor Nick Nicholson (David Ogden Stiers), Nancy Lee Nicholson (Bridget Fonda), Judge Evans (Roberts Blossom) and the most interesting of them all, ambulance driver Lou (Julie Warner).George Hamilton plays Doctor Halberstrom.Ben has all the reasons to leave the town as soon as he can, which is harder than he thought, but he also has one good reason to stay.He has strong feelings for the beautiful Lou.So will he leave or will he stay? Michael Caton-Jones' movie Doc Hollywood is a really nice romantic comedy, and way too underrated, if you ask me.The cast is great.Michael J. Fox is doing a great job in the lead, just like he always does.It was while filming this movie when he was diagnosed with Parkinson's.He was only thirty and one year earlier he was still playing a teenager in a movie.That movie was the third part of Back to the Future, where Mike was of course Marty McFly.Now he's doing much less acting, but still he is doing something.Recently I saw him in two parts of Scrubs, where he played Dr. Kevin Casey.He is great playing doctors and whatever. This movie has lots of good stuff.It has the romance thing working, like in the wonderful dancing scene, and it has the comedy thing working as well, the pig is there to prove that.Doc Hollywood may not be a perfect masterpiece, but it is a movie with a heart.And sometimes, that's all we need.
