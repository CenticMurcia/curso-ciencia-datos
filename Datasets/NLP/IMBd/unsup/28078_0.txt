Why people vote so low ?,i cant see what i wrong on this movie ,i saw worse...,and you have to think also in the back of your head it is a TV movie so that means less money to make that film..,i think they forgot that ,so the film is about a virus that comes free on a plane cash and than you see the results if such thing can happen...,very realistic if you think of the real life now Anthrax ....and that kind of stuff...so...i think people rate it too low they underestimated the script,the crew also was good a few good actors and actresses.
