I saw this recently after seeing Terrance Davies lovely The House<br /><br />Of Mirth, and was not disappointed. Actually, they make a nice little<br /><br />Edith Wharton weekend, if you have a lot of time on your hands<br /><br />and want to feel so good about your own life and choices that you<br /><br />want to shoot yourself. And I mean that in a good way. This movie<br /><br />is beautifully crafted, and features Winona Ryders best<br /><br />performance since Little Women. Daniel Day Lewis has the<br /><br />thankless Edith Wharton male lead role- she wrote best for<br /><br />women- and Michelle Pfeiffer is that obscure object of desire. This<br /><br />film doesn't have the bite and bile that most Scorsese films have,<br /><br />but it's well worth the trip.
