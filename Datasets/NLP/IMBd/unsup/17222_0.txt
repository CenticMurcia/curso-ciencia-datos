At first I didn't believe such a gem could exist. Then, after seeing it a couple of times, I had to admit that the RED NIGHTS OF THE GESTAPO was one of the best films of the genre.<br /><br />The plot is a little confusing, but the emphasis is given on the directing, the acting and the shocking sex scenes. A nazi officer has to bring the 12 most influent german personalities into a "castle" for the week-end. 12 girls are already there, sexually trained to "entertain" the men. What follows is an orgy where sex and violence are king and queen, and a general atmosphere of spreaded madness. The scenes are powerful, the actresses are perfect, and I can't help but raise a couple of cut thumbs up to Fabio...
