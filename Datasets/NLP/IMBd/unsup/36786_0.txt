(r#67)<br /><br />Sorry, but I couldn't enjoy this... at all. The plot went on and on with no focus whatsoever. Whenever it seemed that the movie was going to end, our female lead Abra went into another fit of rage or had a mental breakdown. Ultimately this became insulting to the audience's intelligence as the plot was quite obviously deliberately drawn out and contrived. The subplot about the evil manager of the sausage company lead absolutely no where, and the acting left a *lot* to be desired.<br /><br />The movie is just too pointless and emotionally devoid to be memorable. It is probably not among the worst of all time, or even in the same ballpark, but it's definitely not worth spending money on. I'm going to be fair and say I enjoyed director Ulf Malmros's earlier outing, "Den BÃ¤sta Sommaren" from 2000, but this just wasn't up to par. Avoid.
