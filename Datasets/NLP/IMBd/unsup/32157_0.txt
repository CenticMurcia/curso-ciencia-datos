What the heak do they think they are doing turning 'The Return of the King', a great book by J. R. R. Tolkien, into a giant nightmare of a musical. I myself am a giant 'Lord of the Rings' fan. The books are great and the hobbit was done moderately well. But The Lord of the Rings was done very well. Note that the 'The Hobbit' and 'The Return of the King' were done by the same animation company. The 'Lord of the Rings was done by an entirely different company.<br /><br />I hated the opening sequence at rivendell then the flashback to the story which didn't even start when 'The Lord of the Rings' ended and that was why the movie was made so it could finish the story. If i hadn't read the books i would have been utterly confused.<br /><br />The Ending was just awful. The conversations of the characters should of with out a doubt been omitted.
