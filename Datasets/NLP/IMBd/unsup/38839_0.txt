Perhaps the most unscary villain in existence invades Chicago.<br /><br />When you first get a look at the cumbersome robot who shoots very slow moving laser beams, it's difficult to stifle a laugh. How could anything so stupid be considered scary at one point in time?<br /><br />But the film's badness doesn't stop there. From the "Electronics Department" of the Military, and their semi-serious banter about the technology of their half human, half machine aliens, to the many, many shots containing the inept main characters looking out their windows through the curtains (curtains play a large large role, they hide the fact that there are in fact only two real sets in this film), Target Earth is borish, banal, and most importantly, a bore.
