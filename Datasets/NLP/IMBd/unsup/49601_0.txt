But I do have the necessary ability to switch off reality and overlook the silliness of all the made-up names and fake mythology. This particular foray seemed glossy, glamorous and to promise much.<br /><br />Especially when the wizard shows us the cave full of ancient mummies of dead demons that one imagines are going to come back to life later on. For a starter he resurrects the boss-witch who passes through some great metamorphoses before wisely settling on the form of Tia Carrera. as ever, ineffably gorgeous dominatrix diva. Alas, she didn't get to torment men much and that orange hair-do was a total distraction.<br /><br />Lot of scrapping, well choreographed but not my cup of tea, passing by way of an ice-God's magic breath to a fiery showdown. Then I realise, where are the demons? Mashabasha or whatever her name was had kept harpy-ing on about her Hellish court on Earth but she just didn't deliver. a pity, because the static mummy-dummies in the cave looked very promising.<br /><br />There is one ape-man-thing in a very minor role. Not even a villain, so much as an incidental character.<br /><br />Maybe they mis-spent the special effects budget putting demons off the carte.<br /><br />Is "Kull" meant to sound like "Cull", as in, killing surplus livestock?
