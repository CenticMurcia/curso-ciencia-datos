Who doesn't love Marilyn Monroe? Not me, and not too many people, especially fans of classic movies. Most of us think of lot of her and enjoy watching her performances. I say these things because she sings three or four songs in here in the first 30-40 minutes and it is painful to hear. It's horrible. There is no other word for it. It sets the tone for this disappointing film.<br /><br />Add some incredibly stupid i given to Robert Mitchum to speak and you have - speaking of embarrassing - an embarrassing movie to watch. Despite Monroe, Mitchum, Rory Calhoun and Tommy Rettig (of Disney fame), this is Grade B material all the way.<br /><br />The raft scenes in here were so hokey they take away from the adventure part of the movie. You almost laugh out loud because it looks so fake.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this film but it didn't take too long for them to be dashed. Don't let Marilyn's big name lure you into renting this film.....it's a bummer.
