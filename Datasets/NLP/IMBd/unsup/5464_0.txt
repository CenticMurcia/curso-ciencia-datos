confused writing and direction wastes a promising plot, that would have played better were the sinister not larded with comedy & a banal depiction of the effects of LSD. the muddle that results has the forces of evil (a gang of vigilantes) without irony kill the anti-christ, and a few late-night benders sorting out the symbolism (and on the cutting floor finding a pace) would have done the film a world of good. entertaining; but lost within it was the potential for much more.
