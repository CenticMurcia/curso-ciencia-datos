This was an 'Olsen Twins Movie.' It seems like all of their movies are the same. Twins with different personalities, a basic plot that was probably created by a 5 year old, and a mushy ending with the girls loving each other. Same old thing. They should have just called it "Yep, another movie by us with the same story, but we have different names!" Okay, enough on how they are total repeaters. My favourite part of the movie (besides the credits indicating to me it was over) was when Simple Plan was in it. Simple Plan are one of my favourite bands, but I was really disappointed that out of all of them, there was only one line and that was <br /><br />"Lomax?" said by Chuck. Come on! Really now, and did anyone notice that security was so tight, even though Levy's character had a police badge that he couldn't get it, but Jane got in no problem and the security lifted her right on to the stage? Come on. Once I found out the basic plot to the story I knew how it would end. And Roxy with the the whole Avril Lavigne speech. Lame. I would have given this movie a 1 out of 10, but I gave it a 2 because Simple Plan was there to take the spotlight off of MK and A. Seriously, anyone notice with the more movies they do, the less other characters they have in them? (Barfs in mouth) 2 out of 10
