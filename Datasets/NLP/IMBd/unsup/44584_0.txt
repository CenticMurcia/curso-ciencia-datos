This is the single worst film that I have ever seen in my life. Just to clarify, I do not regularly make this statement and I am not one of those people who sees a bad movie and then calls it the worst they've ever seen. In fact, I can't remember the last time that I said a film was the worst I've ever seen. That's how infrequently I say it.<br /><br />I sat through this film even though around the 20 minute mark I wanted it to be over. Badly. I don't know why, it's just something I always do. No matter how bad a film is, I'll never shut it off without coming to the end. That way I feel that I can make a clear headed and complete decision on what I thought of the film.<br /><br />Well, with Stacy, I can't think of a single thing that was done well. Everything - and I mean everything - from the screenplay to the direction to the lighting, was AWFUL. A note to aspiring filmmakers everywhere: if you're going to make a film, take your time and come up with a story that is interesting and that you can confidently tell. When people rush into things, we end up with dross like Stacy.<br /><br />I'm not going to tell people to stay away from this film, however. It is worth watching simply to see the mistakes that make a truly terrible film truly terrible. At the very least, the violence is cartoonish enough to make you laugh with its over the top depictions of decapitations and gut yanking. That isn't enough to actually entertain you, but you'll come away from the experience never wanting to put an audience through similar visual torture. And the fewer films like Stacy that ever see the light of day, the better.
