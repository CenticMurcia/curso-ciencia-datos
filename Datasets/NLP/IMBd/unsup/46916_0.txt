How else can one explain just how bad the acting/plot/script really are? I had the misfortune of seeing this trash when I was in college, and my test scores immediately dropped by 10 points across the board.<br /><br />Some reviewers here on IMDb have touted the movie's "great special effects." For the budget, I guess they're not bad. It's obvious that, as I referenced in my summary line above, approximately 99.99% of the budget went toward special effects because the film does not contain a single competent acting performance. And honestly, the special effects, even for their day (1990), are not that great. With the amount of latex used, one would think the filmmakers had hired the shock-metal band GWAR to make all the creature models and so forth.<br /><br />In any event, even brilliant special effects cannot compensate for a dreadful script/plot, and abysmal acting. We've seen this story a million times before--usually much more convincingly told. The special effects in this one might hold one's interest for five minutes or so, but after that, good luck!
