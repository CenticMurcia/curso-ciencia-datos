After 20+ years, the characters, the situations, the wise-cracks....they are still funny! The plain faced (matzoh punim) Benjamin Stone seems to meet his demise at several turns in the film only to be lifted out of the mire by his new friend Alan Swann. The dinner scene in Brooklyn is priceless and is surely quoted often at Passover seders. The climactic fight scene in front of a live TV audience is inspired writing and gifted acting working in parallel. Like most movies, it's the small details that you often miss that stay with you. The youngest writer who wears sports coats three sizes too big...the big shot TV star who tries to pacify an angry female staff member by offering to send over several pair of used shoes...the diversion in a restaurant to help Alan steal away with a thug's girlfriend to the tune of "Somebody Stole My Gal!"<br /><br />You cannot miss this movie!
