OK lets start this off with some positive input. If you follow music closely and your into the who's who of music then you will enjoy this. I am into meeting celebs and i like to see how celebs react with the general population...I like The Game and i heard all the controversy over this DVD. i have been waiting to see this DVD since November 04. i heard 50 and G unit's side of the story....now it was Game's turn. i liked seeing the Game interact with fans the way he did..he seemed like a nice guy, he seems like he knows where he came from and shows his fans appreciation. ON the other hand its kind of repeating itself over and over again on the DVD about the beef. The DVD has some funny moments and some serious moments....if you like music and rap you then you should def like this DVD.
