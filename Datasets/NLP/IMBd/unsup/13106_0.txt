This is one of the most silly and, worse, much worse, boring pictures of its time. I need to write about it to exorcise it, delete it from my mind completely.<br /><br />Errol Flynn is cast against type as the stiff and correct Forsyte of the rick and powerful Forsyte dynasty of successful business competing with the old Victorian aristocracy. His brother, played by Walter Pigeon in the part one might have envisaged for Flynn himself, is the dashing black sheep of the family, and they are both in love with sultry redheaded Greer Garson, only Flynn gets to marry her for reasons that were never quite clear to me. Of course, Garson is also loved by the prospective husband, Robert Young, of Flynn's daughter, the young Janet Leigh. Don't ask ...<br /><br />Be that as it may, if only told with a sense of style or acted in a way that made some sort of psychological sense of this mumbo jumbo, 'That Forsyte Woman' might, just might, have worked. But it is so inexcusably heavy-handed and one-dimensional that I now wonder why I bothered to watch it until the end.<br /><br />Behind the cold and uncharacteristic crispiness it is obvious that Errol Flynn, although visibly aged, is still the gorgeous sexual animal that made him an exhilarating screen presence, but he is given nothing to work with here. Garson has her moments, but is mostly just coerced into looking lovely and misty-eyed.<br /><br />It his movie is ever shown on a screen near you, and TCM does make a point of that, be forewarned: don't watch it, do something else with your time, if you know what's good for you.
