This was a story of love, lust, imperfection and redemption.<br /><br />It was very funny at times, a tear-jerker at other times. Well acted. Reminded me a bit of the 1998 film "Woo" though this film was a LOT better. The story remains unpredictable throughout the movie.<br /><br />Definitely a fun date movie.
