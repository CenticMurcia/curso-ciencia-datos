For years, I thought this was called P.J. (not oddly, my own first two initials) and I couldn't find out anything about it. Then tonight I just happened upon a few links that led me to the title. I LOVED this movie as a kid. I read the book and when I saw that it was going to be on TV I had to watch. i was fascinated by this honest slice of life so different from my own suburban existence, yet so relevant because of its universal emotion. I watched it with my father and older brother. When the end came, I was in tears. My brother made fun of me for crying. Then my father, never an emotional guy, told him to stop. He said it just meant that I had feelings. He smiled at me, wiping his own tears from his eyes. It is one of my favorite memories of my late father. In a way, I don't think I want to see this again, fearing that the golden memory will always exceed the reality.<br /><br />If you have the opportunity, and can emotionally stomach films like Old Yeller, E.T. and It's a Wonderful Life, SEE THIS!!!!
