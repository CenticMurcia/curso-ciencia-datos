Yet another stupid, pointless addition to the New York Love & Sex genre. And like all the others before we get all the same scenes and characters.<br /><br />There's the basketball, food, dance, and love scenes; The nosey over protective mother who has nothing better to do than get over involved in her son's sex life and is oblivious of the fact that her child is a grown man; The crazy friends who constantly bug you for a play-by-play; The spoiled slut with the cat and big apartment; The romantic leading man who likes both sports AND art (yeah right); And blah blah blah, more of the same.<br /><br />Oh and lets talk about Mural Strip and how terrible she was in this movie. Why is she the therapist when SHE is the one who needs the therapy??? She was just horrible in unmistakably her worst role ever. Was she ever in anything good to begin with? <br /><br />There are more questions remaining... how can we go through this farce believing they are mother-and-son when they ain't got a glimmer of resemblance?? It's ridicules. And who really gives a shight about the age? The entire storyline/conflict in the movie is that the woman is a few years older than the guy....... oh nooooooooo! Seriously... BIG DEAL, get a grip. If I didn't know she was technically 2 years older I wouldn't have been able to tell them apart in age! Hell she looks better than him anyways. This movie doesn't hold. I've seen it done much better in The Graduate.<br /><br />The leading woman in Prime is named Raffy, short for Rafael. OK... but have you ever heard that name for a female??? Damn, who wrote this? And whats with all the World War 2 references? ...is it supposed to be funny?!!! One more thing, here's my favourite quote from the movie, "I love his penis. I want to make a hat for it." Are you kidding me? <br /><br />How many times have we seen this before? How many times do we have to watch it over again? You won't find anything new and original in this tired, agonizing outing. You'll just get pist off like me! Recommended for serious Uma Thurman foot fetishes only.
