Nutrition-ed with radiation while in outer space, wasps mutate into giant wind-up toys that mimic a groaning sound like motocross bikes after being sent into orbit on a V-2 rocket during an entomology experiment. Jim Davis plays several rounds of pocket-pool before he decides to hoof it across the African wilds to try and locate the monsters so he can destroy them. Barbara Turner tags along looking appropriately concerned, though she isn't much help.<br /><br />Rather empty science-fiction/horror/adventure story bridged somewhat by Davis' narration and Turner's fixedly grim expression, though well-directed by Kenneth Crane for California Studios.
