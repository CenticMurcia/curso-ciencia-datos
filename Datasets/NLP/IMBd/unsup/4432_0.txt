PHANTASM is nothing short of a true classic and one of my all time favorite horror movies. It is one of the earliest horror films I remember seeing and really jump-started my lifelong love and fascination for things that have since poisoned my once innocent little mind and turned me into the crazed fanatic I am today. The film follows a young boy who witnesses some strange goings-on at the nearby Morningside Cemetery. Him, his older brother, and their ice cream truck driving buddy all investigate, and end up getting mixed up in a life threatening nightmare involving some seriously bizarre stuff, such as evil dwarfs that roam around, hiding in the shadows, flying spheres that eject blades which pierce the skull and drain the victims brains. And who could forget that towering, sinister S.O.B. The Tall Man, played brilliantly by Angus Scrimm. Director Don Coscarelli's unforgettably strange independent masterpiece is an absolute must see for anyone who call themselves a horror fan. The movie has it all: gore, some nudity, explosions, a cheezy bug creature, and plenty more. If you haven't seen this movie than definitely do so, or if you have not seen it in a while, give it another go and enjoy!
