This was an absolutely horrible movie. It made no sense, and I'm sure none of the people involved in making this film cared if it did. The acting was laughably bad, and so was the story. The monster did not look scary, and the "twist" near the end made NO sense. It's almost as if someone put a bunch of ideas in the hat for what the twist should be, and it was drawn randomly. Avoid this movie at all costs.
