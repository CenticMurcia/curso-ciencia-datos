I saw it 20 years ago and liked it. I was 15. It was fun because it was a cartoon with violence, gore, aliens getting high and naked chicks with big boobs. I saw it again this year and I thought it sucked. First of all, there has been a lot of adult cartoons in the past 20 years so the shock effect just wasn't there. It is also very uneven. It is basically a collection of 10 minutes not-really-related sketches put together by different persons, and it shows. The animation quality of many of the sketches is below the average Saturday morning cartoon. Pretty bad. 3/10.
