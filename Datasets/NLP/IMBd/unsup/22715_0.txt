This has to be one of the best - if not the best - stand up performance i've ever seen. i honestly cried with laughter from start to finish. I had salt all down the side of my face afterwards. Whether he's talking about going hunting with his father in the woods, snorting cocaine off his mother's dining table or pondering the female orgasm, it's nothing short of spectacular.<br /><br />He really was the Godfather of modern comedy and i can't believe i got to the age of 30 before i found this on late night TV. This is comedy gold and if you haven't seen it yet go and find it, buy it, watch it, and learn how the master won over the hearts of millions with his rude, sometimes crude, always intelligent and masterful art.
