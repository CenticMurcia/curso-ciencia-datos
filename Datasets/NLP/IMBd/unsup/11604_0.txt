I was lucky enough to see this one in the theatre when it came out. Martin Brest is one of the truly underrated directors of his time for comedy - this film just is PERFECT. A great road/buddy movie that is made for adults - more like "One flew over the cukoo's nest" than "cannonball run", really. All the supporting characters are great as well...Witness Dennis Farina talking to his Vegas Lawyer, played by Philip Baker Hall (not the first time he would be a guy in a suit in Vegas named Sidney!), Yaphet Kotto as a frustrated agent or Joe Pants as the shady Bail bondsman.<br /><br />The pacing, dialogue, story, acting, editing are all top notch - I just love this one.
