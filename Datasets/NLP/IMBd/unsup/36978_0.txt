I am appalled by all the good reviews that my fellow USIMDB users have given this terrible, terrible movie. Completely unoriginal, ineptly acted and directed, and incredibly unfunny. I find it fascinating that people like you prefer brainless schlock like "The Waterboy" to an amazing piece of filmmaking such as "Saving Private Ryan." It just boggles my mind how people have no taste. Some people need their art spoon fed to them. If you honestly thought this movie was good, then God help us all.
