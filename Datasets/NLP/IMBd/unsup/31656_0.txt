I am from India and I have never seen any Philipines movie. Without knowing anything about this movie, I borrowed it from library for my kid. <br /><br />I never cry while seeing a movie especially if someone is around. But I could not hold the tears till the end. This is going to be the most favorite movie of my life time. Characterisation and screenplay are too good, that we don't realize that we are getting deep into that movie. My mother does not understand English. But she was also speechless at the end. <br /><br />I thank all the artists involved in this movie for giving a wonderful movie (lesson) to the world. <br /><br />I wish our Indian directors/producers also see this movie and try giving us good movies.
