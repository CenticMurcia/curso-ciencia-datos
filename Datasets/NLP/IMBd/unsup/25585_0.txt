I managed to rent this movie from a local Blockbuster and watch it at home a few days ago, and, while this movie wasn't a comedic masterpiece, it wasn't a bad movie either, in fact, it was actually a quite funny movie at some points. The main cast here (Dave, Norm, and Danny), do very good with the script they are given, and there were quite a few funny lines throughout the movie (Especially when Dave and Norm's characters meet Danny DeVito's character for the first time, as well as a majority of Mrs. Crock's lines.) Overall, if you happen to watch this movie, while you won't get a laugh a minute experience, you won't be disappointed with the movie either, as it's one of those good, funny movies that you could watch to waste away a boring day.
