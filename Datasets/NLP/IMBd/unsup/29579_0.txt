I have to admit I have NOT seen the movie but I want to comment on it. The last comment really trashed the movie. I have seen several of the songs on the smashing EROS International DVD Chart Toppers and they are fantastic. Really hard driving music and dancing. Even if the rest of the movie would turn out to be garbage, these hot songs would be the magic mushrooms on top of the dung hill. Iwould buy or see this movie for the songs alone. But then its the music and dance that I love about Bollywood movies. And while we are at it - check out Chart Toppers - forty five songs - four hours of Indian MTV with no commercials. Char Tppers from Yas Raj films is another excellent Bollywood musical compilation.
