I am a woman of almost 50 years of age. I only saw the movie once and it left such a lasting impression on me. The movie was so beautiful. I have been trying (with absolutely no luck) to find this movie on VCR tape or DVD to purchase. Like others have commented, I too cannot believe with all the terrible movies that have made their way on to DVD why this great movie is not available. To be honest with you I cannot remember it all completely but I remember the basic story and more importantly the "feeling" of the movie. I remember some kind of sequel or TV show or something that followed the original movie. Something about the life of the father and the little daughter. I must have been about 14 or 15 yrs. old when I saw the movie and I do remember being deeply touched. I now am going to attempt to get my hands on the book. I am a real sucker for reading books. The book usually brings out nuances that the movie cannot really show. Although I do remember the movie being very well written and acted. I wish that many of us out here who loved the movie so could unite and bring this to someone's attention that has the power and means to bring this movie to the public. I will buy it and I will tell my friends and family too. Even if it were to be broadcast again of television and I could watch it again, I would be so pleased. I am going to try to think positively and I will keep checking this site.<br /><br />Another "Sunshine" fan
