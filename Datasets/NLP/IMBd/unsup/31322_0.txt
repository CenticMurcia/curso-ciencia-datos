This was the funniest parody MTV has ever done! I fell off the couch laughing! It makes me chuckle, just thinking about it. I'm a HUGE fan of Lord of the Rings and that scene is my favorite in the movie. You don't have to be a teenage boy to appreciate it, I'm female and I still laughed my head off! Jack Black was perfect as the Elf and seeing Aragorn kneeling in front of him was so funny. Sarah's pronunciations of some of the words was a little annoying, but it can be overlooked. If you haven't seen it yet, check it out on the DVD. I'm so glad Peter Jackson put it in as an easter egg, shows he has a sense of humor. It was much better than the parody of Return of the King. Ben Stiller -- not funny!!!! Enjoy!
