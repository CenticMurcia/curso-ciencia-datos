The movie was great as it represent many true images from Egyptian actual life, and when I was watching the movies I felt many f the movie characters are sitting beside me. I liked the homosexual part as it was really good played by Kaled Elsawy and it's really the 1st time in Egyptian movies to show a true human analyses for this strange character, also the dialogue contained many expressive words. I liked the focus on poor student who has been hurt from Egyptian government security agent. I didn't like Yousra in this movie and I hate her voice when she was singing in French and I felt her too boring this time. Adel Imam and Nour Elsherif are not truly connected in the movie and I think it's a director mistake. Ahmed Beder has a short important character and I think he supported the movie to not be walking in confusion drama. Finally I liked the movie and I feel it's great to be seen. Traooka
