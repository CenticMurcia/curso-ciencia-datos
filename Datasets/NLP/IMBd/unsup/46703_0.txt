This is one of the worst low budget movies I have ever seen. The acting is terrible and some of the effects are even worse. Also where is the story line????? The soundtrack however is quite good as the opening song was amazing. However some songs didn't fit the scene very well. Most of the sound effects were repeated.<br /><br />If you like nude college girls this is definitely the movie for you.<br /><br />There is a classroom scene which looks like it has been shot in three different locations that have all been thrown into one. <br /><br />Overall i rate this move very very poor. It comes no where near other zombie films like "Dawn Of The Dead" or "Land Of The Dead".
