Warning: Spoilers<br /><br />Two parts of the movie really irked me:<br /><br />1) When Gwen is trying to seduce Caleb, she says something about him trying "normal" sex first. For someone whose best friend is gay, that seems like a pretty homophobic thing to say, as if gay sex is not "normal," but straight sex is. 2) After the horrible things Gwen has to say about Kyle at the end, Caleb (who earlier professed how much he cares for Kyle) doesn't even bat an eye and still wants to be with Gwen.<br /><br />Gwen is a bad person, the acting is bad, the story weak; it's only good for admiring Ryan Carnes' and Scott Lunsford's hot bods. Just rent it and watch with the sound off.
