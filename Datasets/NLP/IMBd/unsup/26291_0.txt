First half had me laughing out of my seat. Being a Canadian-born confused desi I could relate to all of the humour. The second half of the film was a bit of a letdown as the writer tried to resolve the issues in a quick fashion. I would liken this movie to "Soul Man" where there was great potential but only a "good" movie as a result. Thoroughly enjoyable but could have been a classic!
