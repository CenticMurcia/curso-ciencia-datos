I thought that this new James Cameron's movie was quite different. It's actually a documentary, yet I found it touching. The way they talk about some of the passengers almost made me sad. I really liked the way they show how it was in 1912 and how it is now. How the water did its work. All the machinery and equipment was quite impressive.<br /><br />Although it was a big budget production, it was deceiving in the way that you pay something like $20 to get in the imax and the movie is only 70 minutes long. And the Imax effect was not that great. I did not feel "in" the movie. It would have felt the same to me watching it on regualar screen.
