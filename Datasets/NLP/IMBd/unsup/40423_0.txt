My sister recommended this movie to me because she thought it was awesome but I thought otherwise. I am quite the Shakespeare junkie and I was so disappointed! It didn't follow the real MSND close enough to even be called that! There wasn't enough mistaken identity or confusion of the love triangles and that is what MSND is all about! The passion of the story was never present. Also, the rave was never rave-y enough, the music would always be soft while they were talking or they would be in the quiet room. I was going to give them the excuse of having a low budget film but apparently that isn't true! But Matt Czuchry is still really hot!
