I didn't even bother watching the end. It was pointless. This was a stereotypical teen slasher movie without anything new to add to the genre. In an effort to make up for a poor story and poor acting, the producers and directors give us a full serving of hot young bodies to stare at so that (they must hope) completely miss the fact that the movie is horrible. If all you are looking for is eye candy (and there is plenty of that) and lots of blood then this is probably the movie for you. Of course, you probably enjoyed zombie strippers as well. If you're looking for a GOOD horror movie that is suspenseful and scary, you've come to the wrong place.
