This movie is rated PG which probably warranted. Today's PG films are usually pretty tame but they definitely put the "P" in this rating for a reason. Though they thoroughly enjoyed the "dumb detectives", my 2 young boys, ages 7 and 9, found many of the other characters to be scary and disturbing. Specifically, they found the Lord Morley character to be the most frightening.<br /><br />My 9 year old hasn't been able to go to sleep in his own bedroom for the 2 nights in a row since seeing this movie. He says the images are stuck in his head. My 7 yr old had some issues" with it as well the first night but has since resolved them after considering the whole of the film. <br /><br />Parents might want to preview this film before showing it to their younger children or at the very least watch it with them. This is rather surprising and disappointing for a PG rated film that was written by Tim Conway who was always so very funny on the Carol Burnett show.
