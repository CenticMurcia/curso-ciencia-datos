The movie isn't worth much of my time. It is total crap. I rented this movie because it has Tom Savini listed at the top of the credits and had kung-fu zombies. Savini was in the movie for about 5 minutes. The kung-fu zombie scene was short and poorly done. I should have looked farther down and saw that Lloyd Kaufman was is this movie. The I would have realized that this is a piece of crap Troma movie.<br /><br />It is a piece of crap isn't very funny. My two laughs: 1) Uwe Boll came on before the movie started and said "this movie sucks" and "don't watch it". I started thinking: "I wouldn't trust Uwe's opinion on a zombie film." 2) The police were a little funny when they were framing someone.<br /><br />The rest of the movie was total crap. There were a bunch of cameos from B movie stars and a bunch of bad attempts to intentionally make scenes look unintentionally bad. I was wired up when the movie started from winning a close softball game 15-14, but this movie put me to near sleep within 10 minutes. Do watch it. It is bad.
