as read abut 200 cinemas in Australia in the 60s. Well what a great time is there to be had..and ABNER is the winner of this bonkers musical duo....... As a cold war farce it is there with ONE TWO THREE (as a bookend) and the sly sexual crudity recycled into LOLITA is flat out funny. There is about 100 "whaaah" moments here and guest appearances, berserk clothing styles and cartoon imagery make it ....well .......funny. Mad Magazine behavior and tabloid sledgehammer comedy add to allow any viewer who knows this is STOOPID but masquerading as a political farce will get most jokes..............the rest...well, read the comments from folk who can't connect the flouro colors..... Stubby Kaye is in fine GUYS AND, er, ROGER RABBIT form and it is fun to see his Schick in full flight with several showstopper musical numbers. Kids will roar with laughter and YOU will say...isn't this funny....but a bit rude and WOW atomic weapons too.....
