This movie tries to be intelligent and witty, but totally falls short when it can't decide whether it wants to be a comedy, a satire, a murder mystery...etc. the characters are totally uninteresting/unlikeable, and the entire meandering plot is not only boring and predictable, but unbelievable and frustrating. There is no development with any of the multiple characters, and the brief cameos by angelica Huston, Steve buschemi, and john malkovich cannot carry this disaster of a movie. I was so bored by this clich√© attempt to criticize art school culture, that I was seriously considering turning the movie off halfway through, but I stuck it out hoping it would all come together and actually reach a final destination. I wish I would have turned it off. Watch Ghost World instead.
