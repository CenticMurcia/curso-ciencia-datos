I was just thinking about the two word review for the album "Shark Sandwich" by Spinal Tap from the Movie, "This is Spinal Tap." The review for the album is the same review that I would give this movie. This movie is God Awful. I'd give it a 0 but the lowest you can give it is a one. The director of this movie should be ashamed for such a piece of crap that this movie is. I could write a better movie if I was suffering from total amnesia. Look at the cast for this movie, I have never heard of any of these spares. I could get better acting by watching a middle school drama production. I wonder if the casting director or the director approached any of the actors that were in the first "Bring It On?" I bet they read the script and were like, "No Thanks..." TERRIBLE MOVIE TERRIBLE MOVIE TERRIBLE MOVIE!!!!!!!
