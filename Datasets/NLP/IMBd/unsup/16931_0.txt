Le Libertin, is a French farce about the famous Enlightenment philosopher, Denis Diderot, and his attempts to hide his wickedly atheistic encyclopedia from the church until its completion. This movie is, on the surface, a bawdy, sexy, perverse farce. But beneath this surface, there is more bawd, sex, perversion and farce. But beneath that, there is genuine genius here, the dialogue, humour, acting, eroticism and, most of all, the send-up of the church (it's a shame Islam cannot be so mocked, for Islam now is as insidious as the Church was in the 1700's) is a sheer delight. There is real philosophy here too, not particularly deep, but a millionfold more witty than anything produced by The Matrix movies. 10/10, loved it!
