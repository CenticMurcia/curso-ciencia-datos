One of Surrender's good, early efforts. This is from the same director as Femalien and the two films are pretty comparable in quality. There are several sex scenes all tied around the concept of the main character's trip to a "virtual reality" studio. If the technology shown really existed, the company's profits would exceed those of GM, IBM, Coca Cola and Exxon-Mobil combined. :)<br /><br />A couple of real highlights in the film were the strip club scene and the wet lesbian/three way. But all of the scenes were good.<br /><br />Given the low price and high quality of the video, this is an easy recommendation.
