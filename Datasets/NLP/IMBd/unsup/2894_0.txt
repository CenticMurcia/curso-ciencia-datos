It was so refreshing to see a movie containing real life experiences. No offense to the sci-fi or action heroes of today. We have just become so busy, and fast paced, we forgot the quieter days of yesteryear. When, what you had was just right, and family and friends were most important. The story was something so many can relate to including myself. There were no cell phones, mp3's, DVD's or cars that have the directions right in them. It was a story of trials and triumphs that was very well told. Two thumbs up to the writer. He has a story that is told all unto often today. The acting and the directing were terrific.They put me back to a time of my youth that has been long since forgotten.
