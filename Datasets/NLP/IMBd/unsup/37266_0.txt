Okay, it's obvious that this disturbing exercise in totally annoying any potential viewers was not meant to be a movie or to be viewed by anyone in public, as it states. I too got this cheapy cheap as a double-feature with an additional non-movie. I think the store had only ordered in one or two copies even at bargain bin rates.<br /><br />Yeah, the ending, what was that all about? Don't know if people should really even be allowed to rate this, but I'll give it a full one just for daring to mimic the concept of film, in and of itself.<br /><br />Sort of like if you took a photograph of dirt and hung it up, and called it a painting.<br /><br />Go watch "River's Edge" instead.
