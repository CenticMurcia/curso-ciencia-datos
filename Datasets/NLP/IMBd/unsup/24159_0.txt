A kids' film about the origin of the infamous Loch Ness Monster has the potential for all kinds of fun and wild adventures, given the monster's rich legend and reported shennaigans. <br /><br />Alas, this film's unimaginative creators exploit very little of the potential excitement. <br /><br />OK, so the animation of the baby sea creature is cute and believable. And, there are some fun chase scenes, and a brief bit of lighthearted relief from two shocked fishermen. <br /><br />But once Nessie grows up we only get a few final and very dark glimpses before it abruptly sails off into the sunset. The filmmakers manage to squeeze in a gratuitous boy-rides- monster scene. But, it is too late, and too little for this fractured fairy tale.<br /><br />The contrived presence of soldiers that maniacally shoot rounds of shells into the lake is utterly ridiculous and undercuts the film. The premise is absurd. Loch Ness does not directly link to the ocean. This is exactly the mystique about Loch Ness: it is the isolated home of an isolated creature. <br /><br />That location has no military relevance to WWII. Did the soldiers get lost the way to Dunkirk? One might as well crafted a yarn about deployed soldiers at Niagara Falls.<br /><br />Once again, the producers got preoccupied with the animation and beautiful setting, but let the story flounder miserably.
