Aside from everything, like Dan Aykroyd's dwindling ability to write a compelling story with good dialog, the ridiculous "say whaaa" parts, and Elwood's complete change in character, what grinds my gears the very most, is the poster, it was advertised "Aykroyd, Goodman: They're back in blue" completely disregarding the existence of the great John Belushi.....<br /><br />plus the movie sucked major balls if not for the music, and the kid's dance skills, i couldn't watch it....<br /><br />so very sad, and unfair!<br /><br />OHHH SCHNICKELFRITZ!
