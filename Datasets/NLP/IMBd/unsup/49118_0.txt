Alot of the negative criticism this movie has gotten seems to concentrate on the wigs. Personally I don't think that's got anything to do with why the movie isn't good. The wigs didn't bother me at all actually. Overall I thought the whole production seemed quite serious and it looked good to me and didnt detract from the movie.<br /><br />The thing that puts this movie down is the script and directing. It's absolutely terrible. And I'm not kidding here. It seems like something I wrote back in fourth grade. And the way they try to put humour into it. It's pretty hilarious, not due to the jokes, but due to it being so utterly ridiculous.<br /><br />And it's not particularly true to that age either. I mean people didn't call the plague "the plague" back then. They called it the "big death". Also they had no idea that the rats were the ones spreading the disease either so there's no reason for the characters of the movie to fear the rats so much.<br /><br />I dont really know what this movie wants. It seems like half of the time they're trying to have a history lesson and the other they're trying to be funny. And inbetween they're just riding on horses. There's no red line connecting it at all. I'll admit it gave me a few laughs but that was mostly due to the horses having so short legs making them look ridiculous when they galloped. But all in all this isn't a movie to see if your not a moviebuff like myself.<br /><br />3/10
