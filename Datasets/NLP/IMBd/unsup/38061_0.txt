Lesson learned: Getting a man is more important than following your dreams. Clearly a job can never be fulfilling for a woman. She'd rather live in Cleveland, just so long as she's with her man.<br /><br />This belongs in the anti-feminist/backlash category of movies. Like Baby Boom, it shows us that women only think that they have dreams/aspirations in their careers but what is really important is family and that women should give up their jobs (which clearly do not hold the same interest) for their men/kids.<br /><br />Up until the conservative movement's wet-dream ending, this was a a barely passable light hearted fluff about a woman following her dreams. It was OK -Mike Meyers was funny and Candice Bergan is generally amusing. However, the character's final moment of degradation and pathetic apologizing for pursuing her own life (I didn't see him punished for following his dreams!) was horrifyingly nauseating and infuriating.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs! It is not only not worth watching, I think it could be psychologically damaging!
