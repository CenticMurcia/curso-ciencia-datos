This movie is exactly what I look for in a foreign film: culturally different but still understandable and entertaining.<br /><br />(I DON'T look for are huge budgets, big name stars or fiery explosions -- Hollywood has plenty of those.) <br /><br />Yes, the movie has a few flaws -- mostly some mis-directed acting -- but don't let that scare you away. If you're even considering such an obscure movie as this, then you can probably tolerate a few flaws in an original movie. <br /><br />A real highlight is the main female protagonist, Iben Hjejle. She has this fantastic Sandra Bullock think going-on and I could watch her face all day.<br /><br />Jesper Asholt also gives a memorable performance as "Rud" the developmentally disabled brother. His portrayal of mental retardation is the most convincing I've seen since Giovanni Ribisi in "The Other Sister" (which was also 1999).<br /><br />Bottom line: if you're the kind of person who like foreign films, you'll probably like this one.
