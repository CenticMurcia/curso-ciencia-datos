I had no idea GoNY was set in the 1800's, and so the film came as quite a shock to me. I had expected mafia-type action but instead I was treated with a fantastic yet dark world of betrayal and blood and an excellent black comedy. <br /><br />The only complaint is the fact that Cameron Diaz can't act! She barely keeps her Olde American accent consistent, and looks way too thin to be authentic. And the lines they give her are laughable at best, sounding more like lines from an essay than an actual person.
