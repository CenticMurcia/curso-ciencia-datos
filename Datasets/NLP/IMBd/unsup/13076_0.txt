An HBO original presentation directed by Norman Jewison deals with not so blissful marriage. Two couples(Dennis Quaid and Andie MacDowell, Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette)have been friends for a dozen years--sharing summer vacations, talking about their children and gourmet food. One couple decides to call it quits and the other is put in the crossfire trying not to take sides. On a whole, this movie gets real abrasive quick. Your attitude toward the characters gets to the point...who gives a s*^t. Collette is so pathetic it hurts to watch her. And I still don't know who ever told MacDowell she could act. People may consider this a triumph for Jewison and HBO; I'm sorry, I was really hoping for better.
