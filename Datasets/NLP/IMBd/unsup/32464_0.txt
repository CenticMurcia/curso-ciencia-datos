This movie is so bad I don't even know where to start. First of all, what is the deal with the rape scene? Not that I want to see a realistic rape or anything, but c'mon. I mean the woman who is supposedly getting raped just looks bored and the hillbillys obviously have their clothes on when they are supposed to be raping her. It just looks ridiculous and stupid. This is supposed to set the tone of the whole movie and motivation of the killer but instead sets the tone for this being a piece of crap. Watch it if you want to know what I'm talking about. And the shots of that guy with his eye twitching are hilarious. This has gone down in my personal history as THE movie to reference when I want to talk about bad movies. Hey, at least it wasn't as bad as a crack in the floor!
