Last night I watched what on the front end looked like a perfectly good horror movie. It was after all tagged as a trailer on front of the wonderful, The House of the Devil. That was a great piece of work and you should check it out. But this movie. This is what the acronym WTF was made for <br /><br />Deadgirl. Wow. This is the worst movie of all time. Absolutely. I don't really think anything has been a bigger waste of time for so few people. Deadgirl is poorly written (how many times can two guys say, "man"?), terribly, horribly, acted, and a complete fantasy for guys who will never, ever find a girl. Oh, wait, these guys did find a girl, a chained up girl, and she was dead/not dead, so they and their ne're-do-well pals just took their time raping her. Let's just leave the horror porn to Eli Roth. He seems to do them with a little more class. Stay far far away - it will be hard to get the stink off ya.
