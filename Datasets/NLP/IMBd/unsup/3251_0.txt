First: As I am Norwegian, and have lived with this film since I was about six years old I am biased!! I also expect that it's US/UK translation will lose some of the 'Norwegian' humor, hence it may seem less interesting in it's international release.<br /><br />I do however rate this film very highly on account of the following:<br /><br />* The animation is brilliant (for it's time), with unique style and very distinctive puppets.<br /><br />* Stereotypes of Norwegian small town characters are on display, and shown as only Kjell Aukrust can create them, and Ivo Caprino make them alive.<br /><br />* Though the storyline is quite basic, the film is well paced, and the racing scenes is exiting, hence neither childrens or adults need be bored.<br /><br />PS! Watch out for the 'Burnoff' scene. Michael Schumacher - eat your heart out.<br /><br />
