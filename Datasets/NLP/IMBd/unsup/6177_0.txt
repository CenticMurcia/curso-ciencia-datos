ThunderCats is the absolute best cartoon ever created. In a time when Anime was not yet that popular in the U.S., the creators of ThunderCats had the sensibility to try something new, to make ThunderCats stand apart by using Japanese cartoonists.<br /><br />With the most talented voices of any cartoon, ThunderCats reached the top of the charts, an instant hit. It had sensational, original music which had a different theme for each character and the theme song was catchy and simple enough for kids to pick up and sing along.<br /><br />It was truly original. In a time when heroes were macho beyond macho, Lion-O had the vulnerability of having the mind of a child trapped in the body of an adult, the result of his body aging while spending 10 Galacto years in a suspension capsule. As Tygra said in the second episode, he missed those important growing up years where a person matures into adulthood. He was truly relatable to kids.<br /><br />Kids also related well to Wilykit and Wilykat, two kids on the team who had to deal with adults telling them what to do.<br /><br />All the ThunderCats were superb characters, though I must say Tygra is my favorite. The cartoon blended three very important elements which helped it become a success: action/adventure storytelling, humor, and moral & ethical values. And that most kids love cats didn't hurt either.<br /><br />Cartoons today stink, the 80's rocked for the best cartoons and ThunderCats were the best ever. This was my favorite cartoon as a kid and I find now watching them on DVD, I love them more than ever. It's a cartoon which both kids and adults can love.<br /><br />ThunderCats Ho!
