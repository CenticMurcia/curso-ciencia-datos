If you are over 13, then you probably won't like this. As a matter of fact it's more for 9 year olds since the best character in the film is Jack Frost played by Martin Short. Jack Frost was the only appealing thing about this movie. I'm not sure why Tim Allen continues to make these horrible sequels. I mean, he made enough money from his TV show. In this sequel, Santa's in laws come to the North Pole to visit. At first they are first tricked into thinking it is Canada. Sounds really funny, right? It's not long before they are told the truth. For some reason never told, Jack Frost wants to be Santa. He learns that if he can get Santa to hold his own snow globe and say he doesn't want to be Santa anymore, it enacts the Escape Clause. Scott is no longer Santa, and Jack can be Santa. The only worthwhile thing that happens with Jack as Santa is he turns the North Pole into an amusement park.<br /><br />The movie is just plain boring and not funny and would only fascinate a 9 year old.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: Definitely a sequel to miss.
