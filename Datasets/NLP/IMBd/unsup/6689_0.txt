I still can't believe a film with this many fine actors could be this poor, I had a fight with woman I was dating at the time. 1978(she thought it was wonderful)haven't seen her since.This is the only reason I still remember this clunker... Other people told me not to waste money. I guess I should have taken advice!! I haven't over the years seen any other other Joe Brooks productions. I don't even remember seeing Jimmy Breslin in this production, One redeeming quality was it actually was rather clean by todays standards and probably wouldn't have upset a church group. The bed room scene left 99% to the viewers imagination
