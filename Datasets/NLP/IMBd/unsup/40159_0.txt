Don't worry about me spoiling anything. Save yourself the trouble.<br /><br />How can I write this without the nuanced elite or the pitifully depraved thinking I'm just some two-shoes that needs to come down from his high horse? I feel a nasty lump in my heart after suffering through this film. I'm not one of those people that thinks all films should end happy, or hint at some moral, or be thought-provoking. Each style is quite valid, and has its own merits. But I can't find any such category to put this in.<br /><br />Don't go into this film thinking it has anything to do with love. At its best, Portman's character is lonely and seeking someone to hang on. I can almost like her for that. From there, it descends to the other characters trying to satiate their lustful desires, and in the case of Owens' character, a basically vicious appetite for anything sexually depraved. I'm guessing that a porn addiction is the least of the writer's problems.<br /><br />Can anyone honestly believe any of the characters when they say "I love you"? The only thing I liked was when Portman's character finally realizes, at the end of the film, "I don't love you anymore". The truth is, she never did. She's just finally realizing that no amount of loneliness can override the disgusting behaviors of these people.<br /><br />As for the rest of the film... like one other reviewer said, I was just hoping some freak accident would simply kill them all. I think I finally understand the whole Noah and the Flood story.
