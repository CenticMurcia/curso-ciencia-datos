Beethovens 2nd is a pretty good sequel, not as good as the first as far structure wise, but it comes pretty close for me.Its fun, entertaining, and somewhat funny.Also it actually follows up the first one in a good way.It was very new and fresh in a way, and some what believable, that really the first one and second one capture in a right way.It was good to see the return of the original cast members, and to add in some new characters like Regina( who was a cool villain).It was really funny at times, especially at some points from Bonnie Hunt( who's character I love).I didn't care much for the ending, and some points it was a little too out there and unbelievable, and the dogs annoyed me at some points, as did some characters.Well, overall if you liked the first one you'll like this, and in fact this is probably the last good one sequel in the series. 7.5 out of 10 stars
