For somebody who has seen the French original with Pierre Richard and Gerard Depardieu, this is the worst remake of a movie for all times. Martin Short might be a good comedian and Danny Glover is a good actor, but as a team they are not even close to be as funny as the original team. I don't know, why American filmmakers always try to make remakes of French movies and fail on the attempt.
