As unpopular as this comment will be, this film is a total sham. It's so one sided and false that it would be funny if so many people didn't buy into it. John Lennon was a fascist who supported the communist Russian, Chinese and North Vietnamese governments through personal and band proceeds from their shows. His support of the guerrilla movement of the vicious Black Panther's is covered but oddly enough it is glorified. Let's remember that the Black Panther's were one of the largest violent anti American groups during that time period. They shot, stabbed and beat people for disagreeing with their views and bombed businesses and government buildings. No surprises here, this is to be expected out of Hollywood. I just wish that more of our young people had the benefit of the truth of historic record instead of relying on these kinds of factual inaccuracies to guide their thought process.
