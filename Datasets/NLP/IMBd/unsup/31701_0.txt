What was Mike Retigs secret? This is the motivation for the sex scene that occurs later in the scene.<br /><br />I connect very deeply with that mystery. I have sky-dived, and I have loved and lost, And I have love now.<br /><br />This movies theme is similar to the story with Kirk douglas as a Trapeze artist who does one last trapeze act with the woman he loves WITHOUT a net. The difference is that Burt Lancasters character is going to miss the handhold and embrace the consequences. Very profound, yet the true dialogue is not in the DVD and may only exist in the book. But having similar experiences right down to people often intentionally mistaking using my quietness to provoke a fight by saying I "contempt" humanity like Burt Lancaster's character. This remains a powerful film, and makes Burt Lancaster's morally ambiguos character portrayal a reason I like films with actors who can portray that on film.
