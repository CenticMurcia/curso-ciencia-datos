I thought this film was excellent! I heard some people complaining and saw some of the complaints here on IMDb, but this film is genius. Of course it shows the same scene over and over- that is the entire premise of the movie! So for people to say that it bothered them...well, they must like more uninformative plots, i.e. Jumper.<br /><br />The film starts off with a stickler of a news producer shouting off orders to camera men as the President enters for a speech at a world meeting in Spain. The President, obviously, is shot, but it was the loud and unexpected BOOM that caused me to jump. From there the story rewinds to 23 minutes earlier at 12:00. It replays from all the different vantage points several times. Seeing it over and over is not annoying, though, again, those who might prefer a less engaging story might think it is. Each time the scene rewinds we learn something new about the conference, the people attending, and where the "gunmen" are located. Each scene leaves you on the edge of your seat exhaling slowly as you wait for your adrenaline to slow. The ending is also so explosive and heart-pounding, I held my husband's hand with the "grip of death" in anticipation. This film is definitely worth the overpriced ticket at the box office. It deserves to be seen on the big screen.
