Oh boy. Another in a looooooong series of movies penned and directed by Hollywood types who want to stick it to Hollywood. Whoever told writers, "write what you know" should have added the qualifier, "only if it is entertaining." I can only wait for the doofus who put this lame hunk of junk together to produce a movie about reality TV.<br /><br />Now let us place blame where blame is due for this horrid waste of time.<br /><br />Paul Schneider doesn't seem to have a subtle bone in his body and instead of being funny, his antics are tiresome, bordering on the offensively unfunny.<br /><br />Jordan Hawley - wrote and directed this trash. I'm sure that if anyone besides myself had bothered to watch this, he'd be getting honorary Razzies for the rest of his life.
