That Certain Summer must have been ground breaking for a 1972 audience. Today I saw the film for the first time, and am duly impressed. Too bad it's not available for sale on DVD, or video. Well done stories about homosexuality are difficult to find. This one is well worth seeing! As That Certain Summer was done before the intrusion of AIDS, the film can only focus on homosexuality itself, not on the complexities of gay people reacting to crisis. <br /><br />Fortunately LOGO is showing That Certain Summer, and other similarly good films. That Certain Summer is comparable to the qualities found in Long Time Companion, and As Is. <br /><br />I recommend it!
