Famous, as about every film buff knows, for being the movie in which infamous gangster John Dillinger and "The Lady In Red" exited from and Dillinger was gunned down shortly after leaving the theater.<br /><br />The real-life occurrence is far more exciting than the movie. The story was not unlike others made during the '30s and '40s about two pals growing up together and one winds up a gangster and the other a priest or a lawman. In this case, it was a lawman played by William Powell. The gangster is played by Clark Gable. As a boy, Mickey Rooney plays him. Add Myrna Loy to the mix and you an interesting cast, but the story was really not that much.
