Great little horror flick with very gory death's and some laugh's along the way. By no means a cheap waste of time and in places rather good.The idea of a wise cracking werewolf was new but the biggest draw back of the film for me was the werewolf make up.It totally sucked.The whole face was like a stiff mask with only the mouth moving.Bit like trying to be scared of a fancy dress costume.Why do that???? <br /><br />Its not the best horror film in the world and by no means the worst.I have seen much much worse.The actings good, the actions good and the whole thing looks like a great production, not a home made gore flick.<br /><br />The little bits of CGI were fun.<br /><br />If you want a no brain, gore fest which is easy to watch and follow, this is the film for you.
