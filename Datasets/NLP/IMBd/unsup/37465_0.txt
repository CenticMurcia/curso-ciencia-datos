OK, let me start by telling you a little about myself. I've been a member of IMDb for 10 years now. In all that time I've NOT ONCE posted a comment about a movie.<br /><br />BUT .... THIS MOVIE ..... NEEDS A REVIEW.<br /><br />This movie is quite possibly the worst movie in existence. The story is old and the acting is... well..... ATROCIOUS!!! I've not seen acting this bad since ... Well, if I'm frank I've NEVER seen acting this bad.<br /><br />In small places the acting is almost passable, but they only stand out because the majority of the acting is beyond a joke.<br /><br />The dude that plays Carl in this movie (Larry Bagby) is by far the worst actor in it. I actually checked out his IMDb profile as my instant reaction was ' I bet he hasn't or won't do much more than this movie'. To my ultimate horror I see that he's actually done a vast amount of work as an actor. To say I'm shocked is an understatement.<br /><br />Let me put it this way. If you've ever dreamt of being an actor, or even if you've failed miserably at being an actor ... HANG IN THERE!!! .... If this guy can make a living out of it, then ANYONE can.<br /><br />Unfortunately, none of the other cast could actually carry him, so it let the bad story, awful script down.<br /><br />Please, I beg of you .... AVOID THIS MOVIE!!!! You'll never get that 1hr and 25 minutes of your life back!!!!
