Drug store ice cream scooper and soda server Clara Bow (as Ruby Nolan) scams Pacific Coast sailors for gift clerk boss Harry Green (as Solomon Bimberg). When the men find out they're being strung along, they make tracks; and, Bow swears off sailors. But, the arrival of seaman Fredric March (as Mac "Bull's-Eye" McCoy) threatens to blow the wind out of her sails.<br /><br />That Bow's earlier sound films were disappointing shows up in everyone trying very hard to adjust the diction levels. Mr. March provided better support in Bow's first sound appearance in "The Wild Party". Paramount promoted this film with Bow's appearance in the just released "Paramount on Parade". At the time, a certain way to prove one's talking picture prowess was to sing a song; so, Bow inappropriately bursts into a song, while home with apparent maid Louise Beavers! A soda clerk with a maid? Depression-era audiences should be so lucky.<br /><br />In real life, Bow picked the handsomest of the sailors appearing in "True to the Navy", Rex Bell (as Eddie), to be her "wedded husband". Mr. Allen is the first sailor to appear, and he does very well in his supporting role; this film offers a unique opportunity to see the attractive Mr. and Mrs. Bell on screen together.<br /><br />**** True to the Navy (5/25/30) Frank Tuttle ~ Clara Bow, Fredric March, Rex Bell
