Which era does Ravi Chopra belong?<br /><br />BAGHBAN was scripted 40 years back and it was modified and it had some good emotional moments bt yet it was too oldfashioned <br /><br />Here too the story sounds 2000 years old<br /><br />Rani Mukherjee's role, her dress sense, her acting, her smiling is all too bad Don't know why she is boring to watch Seriously i loved her in YUVA, HUM TUM but nowdays she is just doing the same roles, same acting style, even her dress scenes are outrageous<br /><br />I don't understand people praising her like hell here, she has no role just to cry after Salman dies and then get married because Amitabh says so<br /><br />About the rest as i said the story is like PREM ROG(1982) and the handling is not at all convincing<br /><br />The all hoopla done about the clash of titans between Amitabh and Om is just 5 minutes talk<br /><br />Direction by Ravi Chopra is outdated Music is outdated<br /><br />Amitabh once again demonstrates his acting skills and overshadows everyone but he is getting monotonous with such roles Salman does well in the first half, nothing new but he is more lively and less animated then in most of his films John looks sick(he was suffering from jaundice those days) but fails in his acting here Hema Malini is just there in the movie, her role lacks substance In fact the director doesn't at all care for women's wishes in the film supposedly based on women role improvement in society Rajpal comes does some usual gags and is forgotten Parmeet Sethi has no role Om Puri is too loud
