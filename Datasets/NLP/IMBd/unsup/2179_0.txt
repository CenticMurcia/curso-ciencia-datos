Two kind rich old ladies are about to have a birthday party, unfortunately their black sheep nephew has sent them a deadly present that has turned the sweet elderly sisters into nasty and nutty demons that begin to tear apart the guests one by one until some remain as the surviving guests must find a way to stop them.<br /><br />Strange and mildly bloody Belgian-French-Dutch horror comedy romp that was distributed by Troma Pictures has black comedy and some gore even though some of the gore was heavily cut out to avoid an "X" rating here in America. Slow at times but worth the effort and the movie is totally in the tradition of Peter Jackson, the movie isn't really the greatest Troma movie there is cause that honor goes to "The Toxic Avenger" but it's still a good and fun horror comedy.<br /><br />Watch this movie on DVD and you'll see the missing gore scenes in the deleted scenes section.<br /><br />Also recommended: "The Toxic Avenger", "House By The Cemetery", "Burial Ground: The Night of Terror", "Demons", "Cannibal Apocalypse", " Luther The Geek", "Street Trash", " Men Behind The Sun", "Re-Animator", "Dead Alive ( a.k.a.
