the voting for this movie is a shame! its probably one of the most underrated movies on IMDb and it makes me sick how some people who didn't even get the plot talk sh*t about it! it deserves at least a 7.5 in my opinion! and to all the people who didn't understand it: the movie doesn't have plot holes - its hard to get okay - but once u get it u well see what kind of an awesome movie it is! and ryan phillippe did a great job - i somehow didn't like him to much after cruel intentions, then in way of the gun he was pretty cool but now I'm a real fan of him! please go and see this movie - u wont regret it if u get it!
