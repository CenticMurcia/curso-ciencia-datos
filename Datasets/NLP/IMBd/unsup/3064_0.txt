Its hard to belive that Omar Epps was only about 18 while shooting this film & 2pac was only around 20, anyways this movie basically is a different style of african american movies, not showing that everyone in the hood deals with guns, but 2pacs personality had an amazing change in this movie, it was so realistic & his acting is just great. This is Omar Epps & 2pacs debut in movies & both acted very natural. This movie is a lot more convincing & realistic than Higher Learning, ive actually noticed that 2pac is an excellent most of his movies r heaps good e.g. Above the rim, gridlock'd & Gang Related. Anyways i was surprised at how good this film was. I rate this movie 8.5 / 10<br /><br />
