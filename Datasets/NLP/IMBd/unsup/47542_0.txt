I really like this movie,but I am trying to figure out who sings the song "voodoo woman" that was sang at the end of the movie, I can't find it online... I thought it was sung by someone named reed... any help? I really like this song and am going out of my head looking for the dam thing! I also thought that the movie has it's own unique genre, of course I am a huge fan of horror but there are so many different ones out there... too bad this movie was low budget and didn't get a lot of credits... I think it's because when you look up the title of the movie, it comes up with 3 different ones... the title was too common and overused!
