I found this movie a year back in a collection of horror films from a friend. We sat and watched this one first, and we found ourselves cracking up. This film rotates around 3 young men, stranded on a strange island after their plane goes down. While exploring, they find natives who repeat to them again and again that there are "zombies" walking around the island. This is by no means a horror film. If anything, it's good for laughs. Some of which would be the visible strings holding up their "airplane" at the beginning of the movie, and a man who is convinced that he is a voodoo zombie. The actor for this part is very silly, and i'm sure that he was a comedian outside of this film. With one of the most clich√©'d endings ever, a funny opening, and everything in-between, King of the Zombies is good for a laugh, but please don't buy it for it's "horror" appeal. you'll be disappointed if you do. Watch this film with your kids, if nothing else. There's nothing here that a 4-year old would flinch at. worth a buck or two.
