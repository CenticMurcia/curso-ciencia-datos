I've seen this one a few times now and thought it was good horror fun. The opening scene went straight to the murdering action and looked totally realistic (the wolf's teeth in the rear view mirror, when the guy in the trucks head falls off - awesome). I loved the werewolf - usually we see something that looks like a standing wolf or something resembling a overly large rodent. Not with this one. It really takes on a cross between a human and a wolf. The eyes closer together like a human, smaller amounts of hair with human skin showing through...the kill scenes were great, some of the characters are likable. The only parts I didn't like was the blur effect when the wolf was on screen. It limited the viewers ability to really get to check him out and took away from the experience. This is likely the fault of Lionsgate though. If you like the off the beaten path, fun horror flick, this one is definitely worth checking out.
