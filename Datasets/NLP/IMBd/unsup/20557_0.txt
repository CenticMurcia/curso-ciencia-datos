The reviews of this film are reminiscent of those of Waking Life - an even more putrid mess of garbage than this one. All of them admiringly describe the emperor Spielberg's clothes. But he's naked. It's not so much that the film is hopelessly confused and illogical; even really good ones, like Groundhog, don't hold up (logically, that is) under close scrutiny, and virtually none of Hitchkock's greats make real sense. The difference is that the good ones work; the bad ones just confuse and strike you as phony while you're watching them. One of the most annoying aspects of this film is the incessant product plugs, particularly those of Gap, which will not even be around in 2054. So if you really don't like this, don't feel that you're somehow deficient in sensibility. Just realize that the reviewers are a herd and that you don't have to admire the threads of a naked jerk.
