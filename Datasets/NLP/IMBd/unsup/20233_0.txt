As amazing as the dance styles themselves are the lives of the dancers. Most of the dancers profiled in this incredible documentary name Jesus Christ as the reason for their dedication to krumping and the transformation of their own lives. But David LaChapelle (mostly a director of MTV videos) evidently didn't know how to let the dancers communicate this important motivation. The DVD extras contains footage of the dancers speaking to an audience after a preview of the film at the Tribeca Film Festival, and they make clear in their own words what LaChapelle would not let them say directly in his film. Rolling Stone is right to call this a 'visual miracle'; I only wish LaChappelle had let the dancers tell more of their own story.
