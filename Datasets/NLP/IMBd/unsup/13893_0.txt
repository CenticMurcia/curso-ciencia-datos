Since we rarely have the chance to enjoy a new Cyberpunk title fans just have to watch everything that comes out to satisfy their thirst.<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong, this isn't some kind of a masterpiece, the movie is far from great. The story is a little bit more complex than that of an arcade video game and it still has plenty of plot-wholes. The CGI isn't exactly cutting edge, there are not enough action scenes, the dialog could use some polishing...<br /><br />So why the hell do I like this movie?! First of all you can feel that the movie is done with dedication and enthusiasm and they've gone as far as the budget allowed them. The director Pearry Reginald Teo seems to be a fan who got his chance to do what he likes and I just can't help it but cheer for him! Way to go! "The Gene Generation" is a commendable effort.<br /><br />Bay Ling is magnificent! This is her best appearance ever! I mean it, even if you just hate the rest oft he movie it's still worth watching just to enjoy her screen presence. The hairstyle, the make-up, the clothes, the guns - just WOW! Her outlook is terrific. She's like the ultimate cyberpunk chick! There is a short shower scene. And a short sex scene. Both of them hot, especially the second one. Both of them too short, especially the second one.<br /><br />The atmosphere as a whole is very good. As I mentioned the CGI isn't the best you've seen, but the design of the production is really neat. I enjoyed the sets and the outlook of the Gene Generation world. There's a dark and exotic feel about it.<br /><br />By the way I was expecting some race scenes after I saw some promo photos with Bay Ling on a black race bike. There are no bikes and no races. The movie gets slow at times and could use some more action sequences and faster pace. A chase through the streets of the dystopia slums would be great.<br /><br />I hope that we'll get some sort of unrated, uncut, director's cut version where some of the flaws of "The Gene Generation" will be fixed. I give it 10/10 not because it deserves 10/10, but because it deserves more than 4.3 (which is the current rating as I write my review). Objectively, the movie is somewhere between 5.7 and 6.3. It's not a mile-stone, but it's stylish and enjoyable and deserves some recognition for what it is.
