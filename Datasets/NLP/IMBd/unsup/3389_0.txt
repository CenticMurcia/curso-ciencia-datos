I saw this with my 2 daughters - 10 and 7, and it was for kids just their age. My older daughter's heart was pounding so hard in the middle that when she clutched my hand I could feel it on my upper arm. She came out of it emotionally exhausted, but very very happy.<br /><br />The only film I can relate this to is "Contact". This film makes no assumptions about your political, religious, or spiritual beliefs, but presents something for everyone. The story is enjoyable (although a tiny bit long for the age group), and the premise is something that the children can understand and get into. The acting was par for a children's film - not as bad as Tim Allen in "Shaggy Dog", but still not on the level of an adult's film. Some adults may frown during the performances - but it has nothing to do with the story.<br /><br />The ending was drawn out and predictable - I kept telling my daughter that it was going to be 'ok', and knew it would be. But the ride was very fun and enthralling - a movie my daughter will ask me to get for her and she will watch over and over again.
