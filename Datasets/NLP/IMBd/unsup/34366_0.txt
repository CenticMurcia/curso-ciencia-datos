The TV guide said this involved " Sex , aliens and killer bees " so I canceled everything to watch it . After doing so I decided the only thing I`d be canceling in future was the TV guide<br /><br />***** MILD SPOILERS *****<br /><br />Writing out a brief premise of the plot it reads like something from THE X-FILES : An ultra secret government organization comes across aliens infiltrating the human race , but that`s where any similarities with the classic TV show ends . THE X- FILES was a good show ( At least to start with ) but HELL SWARM is an incomprehensible mess that starts off like an MTV music video , has scenes which led me to believe it was sending itself up , but then becomes utterly dead pan and starts to rip off other superior sources like UNIVERSAL SOLDIER , SECONDS , a bit of DOCTOR WHO and a lot of THE X- FILES . Oh and considering this crap is called HELL SWARM the killer bees only feature very briefly at the end<br /><br />Sorry but - Unlike THE SWARM - it`s not even good enough to be bad so give it a miss
