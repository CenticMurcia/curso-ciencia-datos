Daughter Of The Mind is a strange and a very compelling movie. This is one of the rare gems of the made for television movies back in the early seventies.I saw this movie for the first time when I was around eleven years old, and I never forgot it.I saw this recently, and I enjoyed it as much as I did when I was a child.The cast in this movie was very good. Ray Milland was excellent as the grieving father.I have seen so many of his movies, this is my favorite one.The cast also included Gene Tierney and she was wonderful in her part too.Don Murray was very effective in his role.I believe he is such an underrated actor.The music in the movie gives it a very nice quality. I cannot say that this story is scary, it is more of a mystery in my book.It is so nice to see a mystery film, that does not have all of the gore that is so prevalent in the film industry today.I give this film a very good rating, and I recommend to all who love mystery and suspense.
