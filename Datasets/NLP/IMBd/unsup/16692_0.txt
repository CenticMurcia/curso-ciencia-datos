Shadows Run Deep is a horrible movie! Its definitely not one of those "its so bad, its good" type of films. What makes Me sick, yes absolutely sick about the movie is all of the nudity in it! There is so much it the movie should have been called "What woman can bare it all the most before she get killed?":{ If you are a guy and love nudity where it shows the top and the bottom for at least a half of a minute in each scene (which to Me it seemed to be days before a scene ended) then hurry up and find and buy this movie IMMEDIATELY! In My opinion it would have been a good if there wasn't so damn much filth in it because the music was ok and the acting by William J. Kulzer was decent. I guess they thought it would it be great if THAT MUCH was in it! Well, in My opinion this just totally ruins a movie. The gore factor here was really non-existent. For hardcore slasher fans there was a few killings and blood but there was only one killing on screen. My advise is if you are a fan of the Friday the 13th series, the Halloween series, and/or the Scream series (which most of them films keeps nudity to a minimum) don't expect something really great to happen as this crappy excuse of a slasher doesn't even come close to them and even the appearances by Kevin Costner doesn't save this movie:( Only watch the movie if you are a nudity freak! I hate to say it but this movie SUCKS!!! That's My opinion!
