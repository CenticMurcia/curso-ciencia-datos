Miscast? Maybe so but Lon makes the best of his situation and turns in a decent portrayal of the Count. Son of Dracula is an underrated Universal gem which is sadly overlooked because of people being prejudice to Chaney playing Count Alucard(Spell it backwards your in for a surprise). Chaney is seen as a nice guy monster who many say only works when under a Jack Pierce make-up job or as Larry Talbot. Chaney takes the role very seriously and actually creates a villainous character. All though Chaney lacks the thick Lugosi accent he has his mannerisms and creates mystery in his voice. It's sad that Chaney isn't praised for taking this risk because I think he knew his acting ability was going to be challenged by this picture.<br /><br />The plot here is actually quite clever, instead of having your heroes try to save the heroine from becoming undead, our heroine volunteers to become a vampire. Alucard arrives from his native Transylvania as a quest of honor at the Dark Oaks plantation. As soon as he arrives though the plantation's master, Colonel Caldwell, dies conveniently leaving his morbid daughter Kay the deed to the plantation in his will. Kay knows Alucard's true nature and offers her neck to him in order to live forever but she must agree to become the Count's unholy bride in return which causes problems because she is engaged to Frank Stanley. Stanley angered over the marriage tries to murder Alucard with his pistol but shoots down Kay as the bullets pass right threw him. Frank seems to be loosing his mind as he is arrested for murder when Kay's body is found in a coffin on the plantation. Only a local physician named Brewster and a Van Helsing type professor know the truth.<br /><br />The picture also is visually the best of the 40's Universal Monster offerings. Robert Siodmak is no Todd Browning but he understands the visuals of the vampire flick. There are some pretty clever shots in which Siodmak uses the shadows and lighting to his advantage.<br /><br />Besides Chaney 'Son' has a decent cast. Chaney regular Evelyn Ankers plays Kay's sister who is hesitant to believe in this vampire story. Louise Allbritton is perfect as Kay, she creates a mysterious disturbed soul. The best performance besides Chaney and Allbritton has to go to Robert Paige who isn't your stereotypical horror hero, when Kay offers Frank a chance to live forever he all most gives into her.<br /><br />Son of Dracula is different from the standard Horror flicks of the 40's and that is why it works and continues to stand out 64 years later.<br /><br />(The advertisement for war bonds remains intact. Leave it to the Count to stop Hitler)
