Black Hawk Down is definitely the worst Ridley Scott film and for many reasons. Some being on the acting side, some on the technical aspect, others on direction and so on. Black Hawk Down though is only colourful in its rich choreography, which to me is what doesn't completely destroy the film, but only supports it on it's last legs. The acting isn't so good and clearly shows especially when the film is watched numerous times. And the funny thing is, that it has a heck of a lot of strong actors for each role but they don't shine. On direction terms i think that it isn't Scotts best and shows us that he isn't capable of directing a well balanced war film. The main issue though was the excessive amount of action that, to me isn't that bad but when it takes over the basis and substance of the story it becomes quite hard to continue watching.<br /><br />Black Hawk Down is a big disappointment and reveals Scott's weaker side to direct a memorable war film.
