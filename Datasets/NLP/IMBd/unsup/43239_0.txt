This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. It's a creature feature, of course. No, the creatures are not giant, mutated, or in any other way special, they are regular soldier ants in Alaska. The whole movie doesn't make a lick of sense. "OH MY GOD, I'm sitting in my car and there's ants on my legs, I think I'll flail about on the gas pedal and crash instead of getting out of the car and going somewhere the ants are not" "OH MY GOD I'm in a helicopter and there's ants on me, I think I'll flail about at the controls and crash into a cliff instead of getting out and jumping into the river 20 feet away from me" "OH MY GOD I'm surrounded by ants, I'll just curl up and pray instead of running over them, after all they are just ants, they cant jump or run as fast as me" "OH MY GOD I'm surround by ants on a beach, but I don't think I'll wade into the water where ants cant tread" "OH MY GOD there's ants in the town, we gotta flood the entire town" "OH MY GOD the ants will reach Anchorage in a MONTH yes a MONTH, its not like we could organize a few hundred gallons of Raid in a month." It is complete nonsense, there is no way that soldier ants could pose any real threat in this modern world of cars and bug spray, they might have to evacuate the town for a few days and send in a squadron of guys with bug spray but thats it. If that wasn't enough, go see the movie. But, watch it with a bunch of friends so you can laugh at how ridiculous it is, the fact that this movie is actually supposed to be serious makes it even funnier. As a serious movie, 1/10, as a comedy, 7/10, there are some scenes that are so unbelievably senseless that you cant help but laugh your ass off.
