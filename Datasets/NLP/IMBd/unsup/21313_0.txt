Clear and present danger is a simply amazing combination of old school spy thriller and action movie rolled into one. The pace is simply intelligent and the film avoids clich√©s.<br /><br />We open with the Coast Guard tracking a boat that had strayed off course. After stopping, boarding, and arresting the "pirates" aboard the ship, they stumble upon a crime scene.<br /><br />The murder victim isn't just your average citizen, he is a friend of one of the most powerful men in the world, the president of the United States, played to a statesmen effect by Donald Moffett.<br /><br />Spurred by the need of revenge, the plot is planned by two white house staff members, James Cutter (played by legendary character actor Harris Yulin), and Robert Ritter (played by Henry Czerny, who plays the role with the perfect blend of ruthlessness and coldness) James Earl Jones reprises his role as Adm. Greer, and Harrison Ford the role of Jack Ryan, the straight edged hero who sees the world in right and wrong. Both are simply spectacular in the roles. The film also has a good amount of name actors in supporting roles, such as Benjamin Bratt, Ann Magnuson, Williem DeFoe, Thora Birch, Joaquim De Almeida (from Despardo fame), and the late Hope Lange.<br /><br />As the plot unfolds, Ryan is pulled into a world that he's not completely ready to handle. He seems completely shocked that such corruption can come from the White House.<br /><br />On the surface, you can somewhat identify with President Bennett's need for revenge. One his best friends, along with the man's wife, and young son and daughter, who brutally murdered and tossed overboard into the sea. However, the means to which he goes borderlines on the obsessive and dangerous. His actions may lead to the deaths of several drug dealers and their counterparts, but it also leads to the deaths of several women and young children. The underlining question becomes, does the person seeking revenge become just as evil as those they seek revenge on.<br /><br />As Ryan is pulled into this twisted world of revenge he finds himself pushed to his own boundaries. He's nearly killed in an assassination attempt. He's caught in the middle of a coupe between a drug lord and his underlings. And he soon learns that he is as much responsible for the deaths of US Troops as those who sent them on the mission. For once, his moral view of right and wrong has led to someone's death.<br /><br />I think the franchise dropped off without Harrison Ford in the role of Jack Ryan. He seemed to bring the most to the table. Simply put, he was more believable in the role then the other actors who've tackled the role. Of all the Jack Ryan films, I think Patriot Games and it's sequel, Clear and Present Danger remain the best in terms of storyline, character development, and overall direction. I think that some viewers will be left at the end, wondering what will happen to Ryan, as he's testifying at the end of the film about the activities that had taken place. FRom the open to the close, the movie pulls you in, and even at slightly over two hours, the film never overstays its welcome. 10 out of 10!!!
