OH MY GOD. Listen, God, Dear God, How are Ya? Do me a favor? Do the world a favor? Please, don't ever let another movie like this be made. Please. I BEG of You! I just finished watching this and truly it has to be one of the world's WORST pieces of drivel ever produced. I've seen a lot of movie, 2, 300... a year and only once have I stopped watching a movie because of how bad it was, something about killer kondoms in new york city, i dunno, don't care. Anyway, this movie I should have turned off. Complete garbage. F. Scale of 1 to 10 this I give: Negative 4. That's right: -4. MTV = Most Terrible Viewing. The worst was the one guy turning gay and kissing another guy. I had to shield my eyes. That, oy, that was just the worst. Painful. So wrong. That was REALLY un-freakin'-necessary. No need for that, MTV. I will mention two things that were nice: Liz & the Hummer. Those two things alone brought this from -8 to -4. Had there been nothing gay in this maybe it could've actually been better than zero and achieved a 1. Nope. One question: why did it almost always seem like this was taking place in outer space? Whenever they were in the kidnapper's Real World studio warehouse set there was this background noise like they were in in a spaceship like in some horrible Made-for-SciFi Channel movie. What was up with that? Who cares. What we have here is just crap. Hey, remember when MTV was music videos? P.S. find everyone who gave this a 10 and line them up to be shot. They obviously have no brain and are not capable of functioning properly. P.P.S. Anyone who watched this should feel like i do now - ashamed and embarrassed. MTV should pay for our psychotherapy sessions so we never watch their garbage again.
