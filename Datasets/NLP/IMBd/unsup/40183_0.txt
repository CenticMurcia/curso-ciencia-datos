I'm not a huge movie buff so I wasn't sure who the lead actor was in this load of poo poo I watched last night on AMC. I was curious and had to research it today. Mr. Mitchum was stiff as a board throughout the entire flick. Marilyn appeared to be a talentless bimbo. The storyline was pitiful. I'm curious how this movie merits a 6.7 out of 10 according to the imdb community. Please enlighten me.<br /><br />Cousin Scuzzy
