Starring Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Basil Rathbone and Claude Rains, this is often cited as the most popular adventure film of all time. Certainly, in comparison with later Robin films it comes out well, and it didn't hurt to have Technicolor, and Michael Curtiz' master direction. Errol Flynn was rarely more appealing, or de Havilland more luminous, and after sixty years, this remains a classic.
