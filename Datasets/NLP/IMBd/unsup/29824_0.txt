Honestly at first I had serious doubts about this movie. I've always been a big Statham fan but he can be in some horrible stuff. And being a fan of the original 1975 version I knew this was going to be a though bullet to take. Of course after the trailer and poster my expectations were getting lower and lower. And then came movie night. And what I can say is this movie started out right. It gave a good introduction to the game and a good tip of the hat to the original by having David Carridine reprise his role of Frankenstien. The rest of the movie followed through accordingly. The filmmakers did make sure that the highlight of this movie was the race not so much in back story or answer but it picked them up as it went along. All and all if you like Jason Statham, Fast and the Furious and Gladiator you're sure to love this modern B-movie remake of a classic B-movie.
