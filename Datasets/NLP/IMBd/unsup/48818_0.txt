I rented this movie based on the fact that the Blair Witch Project supposedly stole the idea for their movie from this one. Like the Blair Witch Project I was very disappointed with the film. The ending was the only real plus. It was totally unexpected and threw me for a loop. The BWP did a much better job creating a "real" atmosphere. What was with those generic microphones at the podiums of the supposed "real" news conferences from law enforcement authorities? They were far from convincing. I give this film a C (the ending saves it from a D).
