One of the least funny "comedies" I've ever seen. I can't believe the IMDb rating for this is so close to that of the original "Captain Kidd" (1945). I like Charles Laughton but this is just beneath him. If you want to see him in a truly funny, witty comedy, check out "Ruggles Of Red Gap" (1935).<br /><br />Fran Warren's singing is just about the only highlight here. I was quite annoyed when one of her songs was interrupted for more stupid gags. Her romantic subplot and "characterization" (haha) is practically non-existent, but at least her musical numbers (as forgettable as the songs are) provide a respite from the rest of the idiocy.<br /><br />I'm not big on Abbott and Costello, but I assume this is near the end of their career, and they've done better work? They'd never be so famous if "Meet Captain Kidd" was typical for them, right? <br /><br />Recommended if you enjoy obvious physical "humour", childish slapstick, lame running gags (more like, tired limping gags), just plain bad writing, amateurish directing/editing, and what seems like a constant background noise of pirates yelling along with a clunky musical score which seems to desperately implore, "laugh here! please? are we having fun yet?" I almost feel sorry for this movie. But I feel sorrier for myself and anyone else who tries to get through it.<br /><br />I've read that Warner's done some grand restoration which they're planning to release on DVD. Although I normally hate to see films deteriorate like this one has, not taken care of over the years ...this is SUCH a bad movie, I can't help feeling it's not worth the time and expense! So many better movies deserve rescuing more than this piece of crap. But I suppose A&C are bankable names and even their weakest (to put it kindly) stuff will sell... which is all Warner Bros. cares about. I hope my review encourages some people to save their money. Arrggh, mateys! Hide your loot from those cutthroats who would rob you! And remember, my "clever" pirate reference just now, is more hilarious than all the jokes in "Meet Captain Kidd", put together. Yes, it's THAT BAD.
