This movie is my favorite of all time. The dialogue is spectacular, and is delivered with such rapid-fire speed that one viewing is not enough. The film comedy was elevated to new heights with Howard Hawks outstanding direction. Based on the classic play "The Front Page", Hawks gives it a delightful twist by presenting Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant as an estranged couple of newspaper journalists who haven't quite written the final line of their love story. Ralph Bellamy is great as the beleaguered as strait-laced Bruce Baldwin who is the perfect comic victim of Grant's devious deals to get Russell back. Everyone who has ever enjoyed a comedy from "Airplane" to "Blazing Saddles" owes a debt to this movie.<br /><br />It's an AMC cable channel staple, and rightfully so. It's a 9 1/2 out of 10.
