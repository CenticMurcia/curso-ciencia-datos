Well It was an alright night. The action was pretty high paced an I gotta say that It was a pretty cool Royal Rumble PPV. <br /><br />Match # 1 WWE Crusierweight Title 6 Way Texas Match Gregory Helms defeats Funaki, Jamie Noble, Nunzio, Paul London and Kid Kash to win the Cruiserweight Championship. This was an alright match but I still think that JBL vs. Boogeyman should of kicked off the show. 8.7/10<br /><br />Match # 2 Mickie James defeats Ashley. This was an okay match. 8.0/10<br /><br />Match # 3 Boogeyman defeats JBL. I loved this match. It was awesome and Boogeyman won in just a matter of seconds, 8.9/10<br /><br />Match # 4 The Royal Rumble Match Royal Rumble Winner: Rey Mysterio.<br /><br />- Great Royal Rumble Mysterio finally won Good match 10/10<br /><br />Match # 5 WWE Championship Match John Cena defeats Edge w/ Lita....
