Great Movie!!!<br /><br />I am a member of a danish Tolkien society, and I am the only one there, who has seen the whole thing. That in itself says alot (Almost everyone has watched a 14 or so hour finnish series based on The Hobbit (without subtitles)). It never siezes to amaze me, how horrible some people are at making movies. The real laugh comes from realizing that someone took the project serious when they shot it! It's almost better than Monty Python!
