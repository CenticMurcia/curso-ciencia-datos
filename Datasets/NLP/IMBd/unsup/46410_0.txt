I generally like movies that depict anything that is "non mainstream". And I even don't mind gross movies if they are done well.<br /><br />But this movie is a huge disappointment - no real story, no building up any character or situation, extremely bad acting (a school play does far better), the shots were pathetic, the gross scenes were not necessary (nor were they shocking).<br /><br />The close up in scenes is really bad, i think i even spotted a 'cannibal' with long stylish locks! Looks like the directors/producers paid no attention to the movie at all ! <br /><br />With this movie, I've decided to stop watching any more "cannibal" genre movie!
