A good set of dialogue and a nice bunch of actors do nothing with this terrible story. Best Men never develops any of its characters deeply enough for the audience to care about them in any way. We hear briefly about each man's troubled life and how he in one way or another has been treated unfairly or has screwed up his own life. Yet, all of it is so poorly constructed and recklessly thrown together that you never get a sense of why these characters are redeemable. Now I don't necessarily need redeeming characters in movies, but this is what the film was obviously trying to portray. Further still, the film ends with a cute and a tidy ending. A completely unsatisfying film.
