Another cautionary propaganda film. This one is not good so much as hilariously and purposefully bad.<br /><br />Films like Sex Madness are early-middle 20th Century examples of Abstinence-Only sex education. In other words, the message really is, "Don't have sex because scary things can happen. Yes, those urges are natural, but only a person with low self-esteem would want to engage in intercourse before marriage. And, anyway, you might catch a deadly disease to boot." <br /><br />Though these films typically portray the problem for both men and women, the message is really about women and their bodies as baby-delivery devices. I love the assumption abstinence-only supporters make: that when you're married, you won't catch STDs. OKEY DOKEY. <br /><br />Sex Madness is worth watching especially if you are coming to terms with why the white-American-middle-class vision of the world has always lacked any real intelligence. Its mission has always been white people pro-creating. The film's message need not be smartly portrayed; rather, it should be portrayed repeatedly and simply for mass consumption.<br /><br />I do get a kick out of the comments left for these films by IMDBers who take these genre films seriously and are shocked after watching them. Of course they are wrong. They are tools of oppression.<br /><br />Finally, it's worth the purchase of the DVD for the two US Navy hygiene films that come as bonus features on an Alpha Films copy. Cocaine Fiends is my favorite of the bunch.
