I'm not sure how this movie could have been funnier, but I'm glad it wasn't: if I had laughed any harder, I would have p**d in my pants. Top-flight performances by three top-flight actors made this comedy one of the best I have seen in years.<br /><br />The ending was completely predictable... If you can't guess how the movie will end after watching the first ten minutes or so, you just aren't trying. Even though you generally know what's going to happen, the craftmanship with which the characters are portrayed makes it certain that your joy is never diminished.<br /><br />I had the giggles for half an hour. See this movie!
