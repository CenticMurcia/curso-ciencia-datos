First of all I'd like to explain why I gave this film a 10. I don't rate in comparison to other films because I take each film on its own, and I couldn't fault this film one bit. I was thinking of rating it a 9 just because it was a bit short in length but then again I thought that it was that good that I wanted more. The animation is amazing. You forget that it's just drawings one after another, and then you see something so breathtaking and you realise why the creators decided to make this an anime. To be honest I was expecting nothing less from studio Ghibli. The story is haunting in its simplicity. They are right to say its one of the best anti-war movies of all time. The creators don't even try to present the then Japanese empire as something magnificent, on the contrary. They give us the raw nature of the human kind and most of all the unspoilt love that can only be found between siblings. I watched the subtitled version of the film. It's truly worth it. The laughter of the small girl still haunts me and I'd love to watch this film again and again
