As I watched this movie, I asked myself if Blake Edwards could watch it and laugh out loud during the whole thing, or if he got as bored and tired with it as I did.<br /><br />The classic Sellers Panther movies contain many laugh-out-loud sequences. For me, there is only one in this movie, a nice little scene that happens outside the Chicago airport. But by the way, if Sleigh is a NY cop, and he's going to France, why the heck does he have to go through Chicago???<br /><br />Moore's cameo is nice. Almost makes you wonder if the idea was ever there to carry on the series with him.<br /><br />If you have to see it to flesh out the whole series, go ahead, but don't expect much...
