Ok, I will start by saying I absolutely adore, Jill Haworth! She was an amazing actress appearing such acclaimed films as "Exodus", and "In harm's way." She also starred in the first Broadway production of "Cabaret" as Sally Bowles. For some stupid reason, the early 1970's got rid of loads of talented actresses reducing their casting choices. Jill Haworth, should of stayed around and been acting to this very day! I met year two years ago and she is still stunning and amazing. She is saucy and sexy, in this film, that pre-dates "Friday the 13th" but still has some of the same scares. RIGHT ON JILL!
