If someone was firing a machine gun at you just several yards away, would you just stand there firing a revolver, in return? Most folks with common sense realize doing something so ridiculous will get you cut to ribbons! But not the filmmakers of Slipstream! I could not believe my eyes! And this was portrayed over and over again, ad nauseum!<br /><br />Memo to Hollywood: Machine gun wins over pistol, not the other way around. When being shot at make sure you, at least, attempt to find some cover! Wow, did the filmmakers ever bother to take any courses in physics while they were in High School? I guess not!<br /><br />Nor was there a single character I could empathize with! In fact, the story's hero was so shallow and obnoxious, it ruined any fun one could possibly get from viewing this dull, plodding, two-dimensional piece of trash!
