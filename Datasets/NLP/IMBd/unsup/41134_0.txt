I know you people are going to flame me, but I had to review this since I've been bombarded with the show's overratedness. What do I think: I don't really get Spongebob's popularity. I can understand why South Park is popular and I can understand why Ren and Stimpy is so popular. They are both gross and crude humor shows that grow on you the more you watch them. Gross and disgusting humor sells, PERIOD. But Spongebob is like a watered down Ren and Stimpy with none of the gross, disgusting charm that I love so much.<br /><br />In fact, now that I think about it, I think Spongebob is basically the cartoon equivalent of Star War's Jar Jar Binks. Both are immature, stupid and childish characters that can pass off as offensive stereotypes (Jar Jar= black southern people, Spongebob= gay men). But I don't get this...people who hated Jar Jar (as well as the SW prequels) love the Spongebob character and think the show is genius (which it's not). The two characters are so much alike that it's sickening.<br /><br />So in my books, if you want funny cartoons that deserve the hype they get, watch "South Park", "Ren and Stimpy" or even "Beavis and Butthead". I just bet Spongebob will come down with "The Simpsons" syndrome due it's popularity (BTW, The Simpsons syndrome refers to shows that never ever end).
