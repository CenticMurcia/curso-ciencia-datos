According to the movie slang, a "slide" is a guy so dumb he even has no idea he's being framed on. I wish I know someone that would knowingly allow to be framed, so the term is kind of a lame one to me. Anyway, when you finish watching this movie-crap you feel that someone got framed indeed. You feel like you are the "slide" here. Specially if you paid for the flick. I found it miscast, poorly written and bad directed. But I have to agree with those who still find something enjoyable on it. If you search hard enough you can always find useful things in a garbage dump, as long as you care to sift it out. So maybe I have missed the hidden gems of this one. It's a blessing it went straight-to-video. I mean for Keoni Waxman. It should have gone straight-to-dumpster.
