i went to see this movie at the Lowe's waterfront theater in Pittsburgh. they were giving away free tickets so i figured why not the worst that could happen is i waste a night out. when i got there the line was crazy out the door, they were only letting in the first 500 people, but we managed to get in. they had prizes, dvds, t shirts and a band it was awesome. i thought maybe they hyped it up and it was gonna suck,then the previews came on and they were all for local indie movies some of them looked OK and the the other were just horrible. one i remember vividly was some kinda crap called biophage? then i thought to myself wow this movie might be really bad, but i laughed my a** off from beginning to end. there were some slow parts but all in all it was great. i even bought a DVD to show all my friends. i thought it was one of the best local films i have ever seen. the acting was good the picture was beautiful and trust me from some of the previews the picture could have been real bad, and i laughed constantly. i give it 4 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!
