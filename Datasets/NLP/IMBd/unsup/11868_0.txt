This has the typical good and bad of those 1950s mythical stories with Jason & The Argonauts and Sinbad and The Golden Fleece, etc. The good being Ray Harryhuasen's special effects and the bad being the stupid dialog and sub-par acting. Boy, this one really has both in spades.<br /><br />Since this film was done 20 years after those other films, I expected Harryhausen's special effects to be far better, to be honest. For a 1977 film, it didn't look far removed from the cheesy efforts of the 1950s. Maybe part of that was the horrible dialog. The latter was so bad this film was embarrassing to watch at times. <br /><br />I'd like to see some of these re-made today. I am sure they would be far superior to this Class B junk.
