To say that this is an homage to Trufaut's 400 BLOWS would be an understatement. It's a good thing that France never got the chance to see this movie - they'd be in an uproar. Despite that, Johnny Tough is a raw, honest portrayal of a kid with self-indulgent parents, a demeaning teacher and tons of other problems. I'd say he's got like 401 Blows (especially with that surprise ending. If your jaw doesn't drop when the girls go the bathroom, then you must be a psychic. The school scenes are surprisingly touching by the end - it's got to be one of the most real teacher scenes currently in cinema. Not sure when or if ever it will be on DVD, but it's a keeper.
