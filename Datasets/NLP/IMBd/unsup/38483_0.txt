This 3rd Addams Family film seems to be a movie adaptation of the 1990's cartoon series as opposed to the Original Black & White TV series which the first two films were based on. This movie has "comedic" elements which give it a completely different style to the first two movies. And not in a good way.<br /><br />The premise of this film, a family reunion of the Addams family, is utterly preposterous considering there was a family reunion all the way back in the first Addams Family film, when Uncle Fester had a party thrown in his honour. You have to wonder if the people who made this film had ever even seen the other two. It would appear the characters certainly hadn't as they mistake a group of people with the last name of "Adams" for "Addams".<br /><br />It's not surprising this film was direct-to-video. However it is surprising that this film was made at all.
