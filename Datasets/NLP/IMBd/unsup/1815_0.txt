There are 25 comments, if you take the time to read them all. Greatness in all aspects of film making. Epic score, masterful writing, directing, acting. This very moving film, is a documentary disguised as a drama. This is the only film that has several real tiger tanks in one scene. You are transported back in time, like a fly on the wall observing the real Russian people fight the great patriotic war. This great movie was band during the cold war and the United States role was greatly distorted. But that is politics right? Millions of Russians were killed civilians were killed without hesitation. The eastern front war between Hitler and Stalin was personal. They slaughtered each other. no quarter was given nor expected. Whole armies were destroyed. Cities bombed to ruins, then fought over to the last man. This movie records the pain, suffering, desperation, struggle, the sacrifice and most of all the character of the great Russian people.
