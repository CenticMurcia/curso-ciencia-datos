Well it's Friday the 13th and by the remake is so retarded.Jason is Back!!But...... HE'S RETARDED!I'm So sorry all of you Jason fans but this just disappoints my butt.The only thing that Friday The 13th Part 12 Deserved in Media is a video game.Yes..a video game.Now Friday The 13th is classical 80's series in a creepy sorted of way.Now Other Series in the 80's Like Batman,Halloween,and Nightmare on Elm Stereet are 80's that don't lie.I kind of enjoyed the new Halloween Derectied by Rob Zombie but this is BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAD! Hahaahahahahahah! Next Review: Superman Returns (2006)<br /><br />Sigend:The Angry Video game Nerd.
