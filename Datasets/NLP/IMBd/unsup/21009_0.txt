This is an excellent movie with cute songs and more good acting and voices. Despite the fact that Robin Williams does not do the voice of the Genie, it is still a cute movie and good to show your children. Also, it teaches some good morals about friendship and love and should not be criticized. Just because it is not a stupid horror movie or some stupid movie like Snowwhite does not mean it is not an excellent movie to most people and children.
