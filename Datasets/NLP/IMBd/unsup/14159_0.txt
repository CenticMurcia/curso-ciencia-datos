If you like edge of your seat action and non stop fright, then you have to see the 1990 remake of "Night of The Living Dead" a horror fan's dream come true.<br /><br />This movie was just indescribable! I have never seen such a nerve wracking movie! I was on the edge of my seat from the beginning to the end!<br /><br />The cast was one of the best ever assembled and the talent in this movie was as evident as champagne at an aristocratic event.<br /><br />What can you say about Patricia Tallman except that she is dynamite incarnate! She plays Barbara, a shy, timid and somewhat neurotic woman who was obviously under the thumb of her recently deceased mother. But she soon does a lot of growing up and has a wit for survival that could rival any Navy SEAL or Army Recon and an aim to match!<br /><br />Throw in her brother Johnny, played as only it could have been by the awesome Bill Mosley and you have the makings of a night to remember.<br /><br />When one thinks of cool, bad as they come and a force to be reckoned with, you can't help but think of Tony Todd who stars as Ben in one of the best roles in his life. When Ben speaks, he commands your attention and you find yourself hanging on every word, hoping that he is the savior they all need.<br /><br />The chemistry between Ben and Barbara on the screen in magnetic and makes for as believable a movie scenario as I have ever seen. You can't help but hope that Ben and Barbara make it out alive so they can start a life together they are *that* good as a team. As two people who, through no fault of their own, are thrown into a nightmare situation where certain death is like a shadow hanging over them, they act more like leaders than victims of their horrible reality.<br /><br />A great supporting cast includes Tom Towles as Harry Cooper whom you pray that if the zombies get anyone, it will be him. I have never in my life seen someone so convincing as Tom was in this movie. When he finally gets his in the end, I stood up and cheered!<br /><br />Mckee Anderson is just as convincing as the mealy mouthed but tired of her husband's crap, Helen Cooper.<br /><br />Notable performances were also put in by William Butler and Katie Finneran as Tom and Judy Rose, two sweethearts who as naive as they are, have smarts of their own to help them survive.<br /><br />The zombies were believable, the makeup was incredible and the scenery was top notch. From cemetery to farmhouse better scenery couldn't have been found.<br /><br />I could have lived with a different ending but realize it was necessary to make the movie as powerful and poignant, yes poignant as it was.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie as one of the greatest horror films in history and would suggest you watch it with ALL the lights on!!<br /><br />
