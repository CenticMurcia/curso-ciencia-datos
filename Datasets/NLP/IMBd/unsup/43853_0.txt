Harlan County Kentucky is a beautiful place not Vancouver in Canada were the movie was filmed.<br /><br />The people of Harlan County Kentucky do not talk like Granny of the Beverly Hillbillies as Holly Hunter did.<br /><br />Why were the people of Harlan County Kentucky left out of this movie.<br /><br />The coalminers strike in Harlan County Kentucky was alot more than what this movie portrayed.<br /><br />I was embarrassed for the maker of this movie.<br /><br />
