Not as good as it starts out. The initial idea is fine, the plane, off course is forced down due to ice. The early scenes in the aircraft are good. But from there on, just like the plane the movie crash-lands. It starts sinking when the plane is forced down; none of the crew except the pilots bother with belts, let alone sitting down. A forced landing in the snow and the crew is standing up in the cockpit door? It then "bursts into flames" when the overeager rescuing pilots have to be restrained from going searching for the Duke without any idea of what to do or where to go. The hokey comedy scene with the hotel? clerk is just misguided. The music score in the hotel scenes totally detracted from what might have been a great movie. Previous reviewers cover the rest. Bit disappointed, it could have been a really entertaining movie, rather than the cringe it turned out to be.
