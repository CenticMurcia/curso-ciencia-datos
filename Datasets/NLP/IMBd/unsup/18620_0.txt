'La meglio gioventù' is a long movie written for TV, but also shown at the cinemas and which won the price at Cannes contest 'un certain regard'. It is about the life of the Carati family, of people gravitating around them and meanwhile the life of Italy from the 1960s to the 2000s.<br /><br />I think 'la meglio gioventù' is a very moving movie: Marco Tullio Giordana succeeds in describing minds and psychology not only of the two main characters, Nicola and Matteo Carati, but also of other people living their life around them: Giulia, Nicola's wife who takes part in Brigate Rosse actions, Adriana, Matteo and Nicola's mother, their father... Every one has his complexity, his human motivations and attitudes, his personal story which is always also involved with the general environment.<br /><br />The issue is, from my point of view, a very poetical picture, something that you feel being yours as well.
