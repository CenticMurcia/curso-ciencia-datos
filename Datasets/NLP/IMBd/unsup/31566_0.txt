Dr. David Callaway (Robert De Niro) and his daughter, Emily (Dakota Fanning) decide it is best to move from New York to the country to care for her more after the suicide of David's wife. However all is not what it seems when Charlie, Emily's violent invisible friend. Everyone becomes very concerned with her mental state.<br /><br />"Hide and Seek" seems to me to be like 'Secret Window' meeting 'Amityville Horror'. The mystery from secret window and the eeriness from Amityville, makes this film one of a kind, and not to be missed.<br /><br />The only downfall I feel that this film may have is due to it drags during the beginning, however once we get into the story your on the edge of your seat until the end.
