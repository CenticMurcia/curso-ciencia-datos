The visual arts are amazing. The precise attention to detail is remarkable and worthy of a gander. I cannot underscore the fluid realism pervasive throughout the film. Unfortunately, I could not relay the plot if my life depended on it. I am a college graduate from a major university and I had no idea what was going on for most of the movie. Needless to say, my thirteen year-old nephew was sorely disappointed when he could not follow what was going on! I thought this movie would be perfect for kids; it wasn't. I suppose the audience was supposed to have foreknowledge of the game and its cosmology, since there was little explanation given to the rules that framed the events and sequences before us. Without an appreciation for the working reality presented, even the best visual effects cannot carry a film. It ended up rather redundant and slow, to me. My nephew nearly fell asleep and never again mentioned the movie after we left, after days of anticipation.
