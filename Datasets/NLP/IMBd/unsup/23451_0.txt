Against any common sense, I decided to watch another family comedy starring Eddie Murphy.On my defense, I had two excuses to do that.The first one is that Imagine That is co-written by Ed Solomon and Chris Matheson, responsibles for Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure and its sequel.The second excuse is my continuous apology for Murphy, who I keep considering to be a great comedian, even though he keeps wasting his talent on atrocities like Norbit and Daddy Day Care.Well, unfortunately, Imagine That is another atrocity in his career.<br /><br />The screenplay from this "film" is ridiculous and irritatingly cloying, not to mention it is developed with an unbearable slowness and that every situation seems to have been manufactured with waste of other family comedies (Another "tense" conclusion in which the father has to choose between an important business meeting and the school concert from his daughter? Really?!).<br /><br />Frankly, this movie could have been told in less time and with more humor.Wait a minute...they had already done it! The episode from The Simpsons where Homer uses Lisa to bet in sport events covers the same narrative field from Imagine That, not to mention it transmits the same message with more honesty and more laughs.Murphy is absolutely wasted in here, and the same applies to the supporting cast, which has other solid actors like Thomas Haden Church, Stephen Root and Ronny Cox.<br /><br />In summary, Imagine That is an execrable and vomiting movie which is really insulting to the spectator.Avoid it like a plague.I still cannot understand how Murphy is so stubborn in burying his career.
