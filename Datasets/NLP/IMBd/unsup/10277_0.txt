I thought this would be really campy, kind of brutal/sexy revenge story, but it took it's time setting up and laying out the story. There were a couple ridiculous plot points, but overall it played out very simply and satisfyingly. The acting was decent to poor, but the leads were adequate. Yoko Saito did a good job as the lead playing in both English and Japanese and managed to handle some of the cheesier dialogue bits. The one real twist in the plot was worked up to very well by some of the dialogue between Nami and her male friend, not giving it away entirely, but foreshadowing effectively. Nothing new, probably not ridiculous enough for most, but a better than average revenge thriller.
