This film is well acted, very well directed, and well written. It shows, realistically, the indignities women suffered to gain their right to vote- one is shocked that the U.S. government would have the audacity to treat political prisoners in such a fashion (but then again, this is Woodrow Wilson, who led some of the U.S.'s greatest civil rights infractions)--especially in a fight that should never have had to happen. On the whole, this film is not only well worth watching, but essential for every citizen. Our country should not ignore its problems (past or present) simply because it makes us uncomfortable-- the movie is a lovely parallel for our times and this administration. I firmly believe the only reason men would not appreciate this film is because they do not want to recognize their gender's disgusting role in subjugating women (As seen in other reviews). It is a beautiful, uplifting movie, and I'm grateful to the cast and crew for finally telling our story.
