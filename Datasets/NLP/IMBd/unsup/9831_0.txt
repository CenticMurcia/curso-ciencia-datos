This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The story was full of plot holes, the camera and cutting was confusing at best and with the acting on level with kindergarten Christmas plays I cannot recommend this film to anyone but the most masochistic viewers. Avoid it like the plague if you want horror. You might find some enjoyment in watching it if you're a C-movie buff but not otherwise. I often found myself laughing but it was laughing at the movie and actors not with them. Maybe I missed the whole point and it is not intended to be a horror movie at all but a comedy on pair with "Not another teen movie" and the likes but if that is the case there were 3 of us in the room that missed the point. A very small + for the alien suits which looked quite good, but you cannot base a movie on 10 seconds of rubber suits.
