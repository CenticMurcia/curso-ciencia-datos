Has everything. Whitney acts better than Costner, but great story and well made.<br /><br />Loved the references to Yojimbo.<br /><br />Good country scenes with the father from the Waltons. The characters rang true.<br /><br />The jealousy of Rachel's sister rang true and added another dimension to the movie.<br /><br />And then there is the music. Incredible. Made the best use of Whitney's voice. Most movies age, but in 2009 it still felt contemporary.<br /><br />1 point dropped for Costner's acting. He is wooden in a number of scenes and doesn't seem to choose the best delivery for each line.
