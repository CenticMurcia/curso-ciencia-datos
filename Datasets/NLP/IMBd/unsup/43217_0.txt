I saw this one titled as "Pod People." I thought: "What does this have to do with pods or people???" It seems silly that a bunch of rock stars would go out into the wilderness in Spain and meet up with some poachers and locals. The kid in this film is about as bright as Dan Quayle on neuro-inhibitors. The scene where everything moves around by itself is about the only special effect that was halfway decent. The monsters were BAD.
