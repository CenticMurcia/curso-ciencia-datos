I hated this movie so much it is impossible to explain it in words. This is the most ridiculous plot I have ever seen. There is not one likable character except for the pregnant woman/mother. **possible spoilers** Dennis Quaid plays an unbelievable protagonist who goes to a mosque and shoots a bunch of people who are praying to God because he lost his family?!! Being furious and being crazed is understandable but they depict everyone who is Muslim as evil which is pretty ridiculous. Why would they have any weapons in a mosque? Moreover, it does not make any sense to see a five year old kid throw a grenade at the soldiers with a pretty smile on his face. The whole movie shows this monster of a guy(Dennis Quaid) who faces all these people who are only as evil as him and that transforms him into a better man? I did not buy it at all. Collateral Damage is a much better movie dealing with a similar subject. Although it is an action movie and there are a lot of explosions and less psychological drama it depicts a much more realistic conflict between terrorists and the protagonist. 2 out of 10
