With "The Woods", Lucky McKee proves that he wasn't just a "one hit" wonder (May). This is a supernatural thriller that takes place at a spooky girl's school in 1965, and there are some strange things going on with a new girl (Heather) who was more or less sent there because her mother was afraid of her. Seems like Heather was a bit of a firebug, and has somewhat of an attitude problem. She is accepted into the school as the result of some test she took which proved her to be worthy, although worthy of what is not quite evident at that point. As time passes Heather gets into some scrapes with some of the other girls, and other girls mysteriously disappear, their beds filled with leaves. So what the hell's going on? Well, one of the girls says that when the school was just founded there were three girls who wandered in from the woods, who stayed, supposedly orphans, or perhaps, witches. They were discovered doing unsavory things and then what happened from there isn't clear but it seems they were dealt with nastily. Or were they? The staff at this school is something to behold, all quite creepy and cold, one woman reminds me distinctly of Dana Carvey's "Church Lady" from Saturday Night Live, oh my. Bruce Campbell plays Heather's dad, and this is quite a better role for him than anything else of his I've seen lately. This is actually very well done and quite creepy at times, has a good atmosphere and is well worth seeing. Not a gore-fest, mind you, but a solid supernatural film. 8 out of 10.
