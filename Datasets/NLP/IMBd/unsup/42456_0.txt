Major disappointment! Not to take your kids too. This is not anything like the series. This movie was not only boring and pointless, I feel like I have downgraded my intelligence by watching it. My kids 11, 10 and 3 were thoroughly disappointed. I was tired of covering eyes and ears.<br /><br />If you go to utube and watch the series, you will see that this show was made from the time when they used to put decent parents and respectful (NORMAL) kids into our daily lives.<br /><br />Now we have to downgrade our humor. Downgrade our entertainment to homer Simpson and family guy mentality in order to be entertained UGH! This movie raped the original series' decency.<br /><br />DISGUSTED.
