I am a big fan of Dawn French and Catherine Tate, and this absolutely hilarious comedy series is a dream come true for me. It is quite dark and doesn't rely on the big on-screen moments, but rather the toned-down mild, very dry but witty humour (With the notable exception of one absolutely hilarious scene involving bungee-jumping).<br /><br />The Cornwall fishing village setting is the perfect setting for two 'lesbian until something better pops up' girls, and their hilarious neighbours, including the owner of the local pub and his deaf wife, a lonely old sailor, a young lad and a young witch.<br /><br />If you like Dawn French or Catherine Tate- you'll love this. Otherwise, there is a lot in this series that might not seem hilarious.
