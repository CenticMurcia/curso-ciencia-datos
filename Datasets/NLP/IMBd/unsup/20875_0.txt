I have a pretty high tolerance for slow period pieces, but this one pushed me to the limit.<br /><br />The first 5 minutes, and the last 10 minutes were okay. Everything else in between was a snore fest.<br /><br />If you don't mind watching annoying, boring children try to act for over an hour straight then I suppose this might be the movie for you. Personally though, I spent most of the movie hoping all those kids would fall in a well.<br /><br />The plot was contrived and relied completely on massive coincidences to drive itself, the children had way too much screen time and were annoying, and I got about ten times as emotionally attached to a puppy that was on screen for about 30 seconds than I was to any of the main characters.<br /><br />Three thumbs down!
