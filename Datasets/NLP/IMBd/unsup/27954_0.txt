What is special about this movie, is that it has melded the darker aspects of daily life with the light that indigo children can bring into it. Meghan, the ten-year old, displayed the confidence that the children can inspire in grown-ups. She was an inspired choice.<br /><br />The indigo child seated next to me- who is a little out-of-sorts with her environment- was delighted by the film! I could see many moments of recognition. 7 out of 8 kids I took to the film, rated it 10/10; and one rated it 9 1/2. "It was the best part of my birthday," commented one.<br /><br />Parents of indigos liked the movie as well. Yes, it is a starting point; and no- it does not tell the full depth of indigo children. It may make some indigos question themselves if they have not healed as the girl did, in the movie.<br /><br />But in summary, the film achieved for our group of ten that saw it, what it set out to do: entertain, introduce, and manifest the light of indigo.<br /><br />The interview with the film-makers- it could be shortened. Doesn't do much for the film.
