I've liked this show for a while.<br /><br />Billy, a plain stupid little boy, and Mandy, a cynical girl trick the Grim Reaper into being their friend forever. They go through many supernatural adventures and all that stuff. This show makes evil funny.<br /><br />The humor can go in between. Sometimes it's just hysterical, and there are many adult jokes as well. The potty humor can be a bit overused, though.<br /><br />They also don't repeat new episodes enough, blah. Heard it was getting scrapped this year (ew)..<br /><br />Anyway, This show brings back some of what was lost in the transition between 90's cartoons and this decade's cartoons. Really gives you a break from the cruddy shows they have now.
