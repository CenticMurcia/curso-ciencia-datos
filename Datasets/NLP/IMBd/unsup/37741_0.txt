Being born here, I have lived with "humourous" portrayals of Canadians on TV and in movies since I was born. Do they get funnier with age? No, they don't, and Canadian Bacon is chock full of them. A Mountie wearing full dress reds? Yeah, I see THAT everyday. C'mon. Although the movie is supposed to be flattering to Canada, it's really only Michael Moore's twisted perception of how we live here. In Bowling for Columbine, for instance, he made it look as if we all leave our doors unlocked. Newsflash: It depends where in the country you live. I'll bet there are places in the states (actually, I know there are places in the states) where people leave their doors unlocked.<br /><br />Canadian Bacon is a half assed attempt at humour, and a half assed attempt at political commentary. Does this make for a whole ass? Nope, just two missed-matched ass halves that don't fit together. This movie is crap.
