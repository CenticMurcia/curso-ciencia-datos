I have had this on VHS and now on DVD for a long time, I love it and have re-watched it a few times. I must say that Jane Seymour was preferable to Ali MacGraw as was Hart Bochner to Jan Michael-Vincent. I have both Winds of War and War and Remembrance so I can say that I prefer Hart and Jane as I have seen both series. If you are going to watch this series do watch Winds of War first. The scenes in the concentration camps are horrifying and terrible, but this adds to the excellence of the program because you want to be able to emphasize with what is happening to these innocent victims and feel their pain, anguish, confusion and bewilderment.
