I didn't get it. It was a film I saw as a teenager and I remember how bad it was.<br /><br />It seems that everyone was enjoying an hedonistic lifestyle, the upshot being, however, that you ended up dying because of it.<br /><br />My lasting memory is of Richard Todd (what was he thinking) walking quite happily to the firing squad, just to impress the girl.<br /><br />Plan 9 from outer space might be a bad film, but this is so much worse. This will never have the cult following of Plan 9 and I hope, in a perverse sort of way, that this film gets deleted and is never seen again.
