I was 7 when Charlie's Angels first aired, little did I think that 30 years later, I would still be talking about the Angels. The show captured the imagination of this nation and the world. It had glamorous settings, exquisite fashions, beautiful women, and intriguing often ground breaking plots. All these things were a part of the Charlie's Angels phenomena, and yet the key for me has always been the relationship of the three main characters. This was a true team of friends who didn't resort to the stereotypical cat fights that most women on TV often get into. They were three equals who depended on one another with confidence. Yes, they were beautiful and they used their sexuality, but they did so with brains and courage. I consider myself lucky to have grown up with the Angels as my role models, a girl could do a lot worse. The plots may have been silly but the relationships were genuine.
