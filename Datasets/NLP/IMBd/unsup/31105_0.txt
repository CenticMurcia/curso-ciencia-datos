The first time I saw this I caught the last 15 minutes and that (combined with a great song by Bjork/David Arnold) convinced me I had to see it again. Mostly new faces or "isn't that..err whatsisname?" faces and all combine to make a great movie. The soundtrack is one of the best I have ever heard and although Harvey Keitel is an "adviser", he still gets the chance to show that he is one of Hollywood's tough characters. Viggo Mortensen is thoroughly evil and good at it. Keith Allen is (with more hair) just as nasty - as are the teeth of his sidekick Byrne - and continues to be a character you just cannot like. All in all, another great of British cinema.
