I did read some of the reviews and all of them were by parents: i don't like it, i hate it... it annoys me. I don't think that the movie has a bad attempt i mean its a movie for 8 year old's! They don't see anything bad in it. Most of children don't understand that those are empty-brain girls because they are KIDS. And thats it. What else to say? 1 movie is not going to affect kids life. But if the kid likes it that means that she/he sees nothing bad in the movie because well you are parents and u should know it that kids don't see bad in anything. But let me go back to the movie, i think that the point of the movie is to just be yourself and don't care about everyone else if they don't like it. I think thats the only good thing in the movie.
