A long awaited return of Sharpe. This was a very good return for the hero that is Sharpe, but I must say that it was a disappointment! 8 months since hearing about it, 8 years of watching the same episodes and knowing the script off by heart, and a few discrepancies that really spoil an otherwise top notch programme.<br /><br />Didn't Sergeant Harper become a Sergent Major at Sharpe's Regiment? Why has he been demoted? I do believe Sergeant Shadrach Bickerstaff played a Sergeant in Sharpe's Gold, however he is not named. When did Sharpe come across this character again and what has caused such hatred between the two? Sharpe is not the same without the chosen men - Sharpe is meant to be a hero of the common soldier, but the only man under his command here is Harper! Harper's entry into this episode is simply comically stupid. A large Irishman disguised as a local rebel and joining in an attack on Sharpe and a group of lancers, whilst carrying the 7-barreled volley gun. Even if he is meant to be an undercover agent, this is still stretching the imagination! The fort siege sequences and the storming of the breech are awful when compared to Sharpe's Company, and that was supposedly on a much smaller budget! Have they forgotten how to make Sharpe and what made it so good? No complicated storyline, just a job needing doing, and Sharpe being the man to do it. This focus' too much on a plot that is not very strong to start with! Rant over, I will still be going out to buy the DVD, and will enjoy every second that is on offer, superb!! Did anyone else notice how it was left fairly wide open for another return? Sharpe's Flash (an old Sharpe meeting with a young Flashman), now there is a thought!!
