Everything about this movie is just plain awful. The acting is amiturish, the directing is almost nonexistent, the script is a joke with countless pages of terrible dialogue which soon develop into a terrible plot. In addition, the characters have no redeeming qualities whatsoever and are completely two-dimensional. The nerd, Kunkle, is actually more of a gracelessly and abruptly put-together composite of two two-dimensional characters instead of being one very three-dimensional character. Finally, the budget crushes every possible chance the movie had to be in any way entertaining. There are many outdoor scenes in this movie that take place at night during which the director took no notice to the fact that entire scenes were being lit by neon signs.<br /><br />Stay away.
