Review of An American Tale (Gone Western): I didn't like the first and original film based on the same characters. This one certainly did less for me. I remember being bored out of my mind while watching this (as a child). Maybe adults will find it cute, but I didn't like it at all, and I was in my early teens when I saw it.<br /><br />Review of An American Tale: I could never get into this film as a child, and I had trouble relating to the characters. It was a sad story, but the sadness just seemed to make me cringe-especially when the mice started to sing about it. I just couldn't get into this film.<br /><br />These were not my favourite Disney films. I'd recommend Bambi, Lady and The Tramp, and some of the others.
