I would have to rank this movie as my top worst if not the worst movie of all time. I don't think it's worth wasting any amount of time in your life to watch this movie! It was one of the absolute worst movies I have ever seen as there was no character development, very bad dialogue, very bad acting, and it moved very slowly with very bad filming... Definitely not hostel, or the hills have eyes, or house of 1000 corpses, or Texas chainsaw massacre, or any other horror flick involved. This is just a horr(ible) movie! Watch it if you have lots of time to waste and nothing better to do with your life! That's why it was banned from 43 countries, because the countries would have to pay you to see the movie!
