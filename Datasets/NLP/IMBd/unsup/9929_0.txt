This movie is complete garbage. I didn't think it was funny or anything. I could find no redeeming value in this movie at all. Do you think it would be okay for someone to make a movie about a child molester killing kids and raping them? Neither do I, and I also don't think it is okay for them to make a movie where the killer does this to women. When is the world going to wake and realize that this kind of stuff is not okay? <br /><br />This movie supposedly won awards. So did Eminem, the guy who sings about raping his 10 year old sister. Well, I think it is very misogynistic and Hastings should not be carrying this kind of movie. Next time I'll be renting at Blockbuster.
