For those not in the know, the plot surrounds an anti-terrorist group made of cyborgs in the future called Section 9, or basically CTU in the future. Like 24, each season has an overall story, but unlike 24, Stand Alone Complex has episodes that have nothing to do with the main story arc and are for the sole purpose of revealing characters and establishing a world (the latter is something that 24 doesn't need to do). The writing is excellent, and (continuing the 24 comparisons) makes the 24 writers almost like amateurs. For example in 2nd Gig, they actually make one of the terrorists seem human, something that they tried to do last season of 24 with the President, and failed horribly (Don't get me wrong, 24 is a good show, but I like this more). Everything is stated as the state of things, and there is one side versus another side, neither of which is good or bad, and Section 9 is right there in the middle trying to stop making the situation go from bad to worse. If action is all you care about, this show will only be good, but for the viewers who don't mind the talk, so that things can be explained such as why they're going to execute the plan and how, this will be great. Even if you were put off by the movie's incohesiveness in plot (and completely understandable if you were), this one's a lot easier to understand. Everyone should check it both seasons out, especially those into 24.
