This western starring William Holden and Eleanor Parker is a very good western I reckon. It takes a while for it to take off so to speak but when it does there are some real thrilling action and some real good scenes and moments you don't easily will forget.<br /><br />*SPOILER* I really liked the scene near the end when they were caught in open by native braves and had to take shelter on the ground with just some rocks and walls of dust to protect themselves from spears, arrows and bullets. *END OF SPOILER*<br /><br />William Holden good as Captain Roper and Eleanor Parker as Carla also puts in a good performance. I recommend this to western fans with some patience because, as written, it takes a while for it to reach climax, but when it does, you won't forget you watched it.
