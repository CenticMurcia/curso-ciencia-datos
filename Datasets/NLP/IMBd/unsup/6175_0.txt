Like I had said many times, I was shocked, surprised and flabbergasted by the negativity I heard on Keyframe.com; I've watched this show, and frankly I find it AWESOME! Based on the characters created by Tobin "Ted" Wolf, the series is set in the far distant future (I don't know how far) and follows the adventures of a team of heroes: cat-like humanoid aliens from the planet of Thundera. <br /><br />The series begins with the dying Thundera meeting its end, forcing the ThunderCats (a sort of like Thunderean nobility) to flee their homeworld. The fleet is attacked by the Thundereans' enemies, the Mutants from the planet Plun-Darr, who destroy all the starships in the "ThunderFleet," but spare the flagship hoping to capture the legendary Sword of Omens they believe is onboard. The sword holds the mystical Eye of Thundera, the source of the ThunderCats' power, embedded in the hilt. Though the Mutants damage the flagship, the power of the Eye drives them back, and Lion-O's elderly guardian, Jaga, pilots the ship to the safety of the world of "Third Earth;" however, he dies in the process, as there are insufficient cryo-stasis pods aboard the ship, and the journey to Third Earth takes several decades even with advanced interstellar spacecraft. The flagship contains the young Lord of the ThunderCats, Lion-O, as well as the ThunderCats - Cheetara, Panthro, Tygra, the ThunderKittens WilyKit and WilyKat, and Snarf. Upon reaching Third Earth, the ThunderCats made friends with various creatures of the planet and they designed a fortress. But Mumm-Ra the centuries-old embodiment of evil, along with the mutants that destroyed the rest of the Thunderans are a constant threat. But Lion-O, the new leader of the ThunderCats, now grown man due a malfunction in his cryo-stasis pod, with the Sword of Omens will help the ThunderCats to have a standing chance on their adopted home. <br /><br />I love Cheetara,Tygra, the ThunderKittens WilyKit and WilyKat, and Snarf; OH! and Snarfer too. So all I could said is that this is one of the best animated series from one of my favorite animation studios - Rankin/Bass; with plenty of fantasy, adventure, humor and beautiful animation, I loved it. And one thing: Anyone who watched the episode "Dimension Doom" ever notice that near the end, Cheetara & Wizz-Ra took a moment to have a sentimental farewell; like anyone's thinking of doing a fan-shipping of the couple; I might.
