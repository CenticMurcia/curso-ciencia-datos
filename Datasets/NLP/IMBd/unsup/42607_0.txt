Maria has been sent to a prison on an remote island where the warden is giving kickbacks to the warden of the mens' prison on the other side of the island via his choice of girl inmates. Naturally he has his eye on fresh meat Maria. The government gets a whiff of the corruption and sends a plant in to investigate the abuses. For a WIP flick I was surprised how tame it was, for a Franco flick i was very surprised how tame it was. The only thing that keeps one falling asleep is the horribly inserted porn inserts that don't fit well into the film in the least. What's laughable is that Franco fans (yea hard to believe they're people out there who are) actually got angry that Franco's name is even on this version. Yea, we can't have his sterling image as an ingenious competent visionary be sullied *snicker* <br /><br />My Grade: D <br /><br />X-rated version DVD Extras: Nothing at all
