Funny women Posey and Kudrow star in this popular indie film about office temps in the city and the none-too-bright future they have in this increasingly paranoid and indifferent job field (if it can even be considered one.)<br /><br />A lot of cute office shtick in the beginning (though nothing you haven't seen done better in "Clerks" and "Office Space"), but the climatic story of the office-snitch is what killed it for me. Completely cliché and predictable. If you don't know who it is the moment the drama starts you have seen very few movies in your day and the character herself (no I won't spoil) is a tried and true trite stereotype that is more plot device than any character at all. <br /><br />Still both an amusing and somber look at this joke of a job "opportunity" that awaits many a young woman. The cast is very good, I wish the story would have been better written. I disagree with the critics, "Party Girl" was a much better showcase for Parker Posey. That film had me laughing from start to finish and without rolling clichés in the plot.
