Rated R for Strong Graphic Violence,Language and Sexual Content.<br /><br />Natural Born Killers is a very violent and controversial film.The two Columbine school shooters were said to have have watched this film over and over again.Its a very violent film and not recommended for children who cannot handle this type of material.I am 15 now and I saw this film when I was 13.It didn't affect me in any way.I play plenty of violent video games and watch violent movies and they don't make me want to kill anybody.This is because I can separate fantasy from reality.Anyway that was my rant...now on to the film review.Natural Born Killers is an underrated and excellent movie.Im surprised its only 6.8, I think it should be in IMDb's Top 250.The performances in this film are great.Woody Harleson the actor who played Mickey Knox ironically had a father who was a hit-man.Anyway the story is great as it shows how the media portrays murderers.The film basically shows the life of Mickey and Malloryy knox.In a comedic "I Love Lucy" spoof, you see Mallory's life at home with her abusive father.Mickey is a butcher who delivers meat and delivers it one day to Mallory's home.The two both led disturbing lives and basically they kill Mallory's family and start going on killing spree's.After a while, they get caught and go to prison while a reporter wants to do an interview with Mickey.A prison riot breaks out and basically they are set free.A cool aspect about this film is sometimes during the violent scenes of the film, you see some trippy images.Natural Born Killers is a great film worth watching for anyone who can handle it.
