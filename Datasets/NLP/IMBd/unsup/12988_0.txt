Chilling. Absolutely chilling. One of those rare horror films that actually scared me. I saw this movie when I was about 9 and couldn't really sit through to the end because it scared me so. The character of the Candyman was so scary, not just because he killed people (though that had a lot to do with it), but because the person he was chasing was not believed (and actually framed for his murders). Believe me, if someone was popping up killing people unexpectedly like Candyman did, I would not stick around to see what was going on. I still won't go up to a mirror and test the Candyman theory out. Definitely one of the best slasher films of the 90s. Rent or buy it.
