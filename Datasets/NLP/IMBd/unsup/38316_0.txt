I just finished re-watching the entire series on DVD a few days ago, and it gave me a definite impression of nausea this time: to be more specific, I think that seasons 1 & 2 had potential, interesting ideas, but the problem is that from season 3, the series went completely off-focus, and should have been renamed "Waiting for the new Messiah", because the plot evolved endlessly around two things: Jordan Collier and his f*****g promicine, and how "great" the world would be with the possibilities it could provide. But here, I said: STOP! and asked me two questions: 1) How the hell would anyone think of such an idea, considering the fact that our world is far, very far from being perfect two thousand years after a Messiah whose name I do not need to mention preached his gospel. 2) Why should humans have to take a shot, as if it were some kind of miraculous cure, to be better, instead of changing their MINDS? Then, those who are familiar with the series should also bear in mind that, although the series ended with a cliffhanger, this one was very badly done, ridiculously showing images of people performing so-called 'miracles' and that stupid thing of Seattle being renamed 'Promise City', and completely evading one fact clearly emerging from that pile of garbage: even if at the end of the series, they found a way to make a test to determine who could or could not take promicine without danger,the fact remains that this 'new world' would be divided between two classes of people: those with abilities and those without, in short, practically two species of humans. Our world is divided enough with one human species and definitely doesn't need one further division: I cannot help but thinking that this crap of a TV series is finally somewhere extremely right-wing, or even racist/fascist in its conclusion. So,I just put my DVD's of the series, after having delightfully scratched them, to where they belonged: to the WASTE DISPOSAL.
