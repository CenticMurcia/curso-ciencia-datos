I tuned into the first episode of 'Nighty Night' and was bitterly disappointed, but then one of my friends said to me ''Watch the rest of the series, Danny, it does get better''. I watched the rest of the first series and became even more bored with the show than I had been before. Are we really supposed to be amused by the sight of an evil-hearted beautician bullying defenceless people and pursuing married men? <br /><br />The cast cannot act to save themselves, and the scripts prove to be about as funny as stomach cancer. 'Night' follows the life of 'Jill' (Julia Davis), a woman so evil as to defy description. Her husband is dying of cancer so she sets her sights on her neighbour 'Don' (Angus Deayton), a doctor whose wife (Rebecca Front) is suffering from MS.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I do like dark humour, 'Rab C. Nesbitt' being a prime example, but the difference between 'Rab' and 'Night' is that 'Rab' is funny, well written and well acted, whilst 'Night' is badly acted, badly written and is not in the slightest bit funny.
