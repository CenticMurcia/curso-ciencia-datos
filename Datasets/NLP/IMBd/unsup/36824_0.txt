I just have to say that this movie was horrible. Although there was 1 good quote from the movie, I greatly disliked it. None of this would really happen, and gay guys aren't all fashion freaks. They are people,and most of them can be "normal". Christy Carlson Romano stinks, and the only reason I watched it was for Thomas Dekker. He was bad in this movie, but don't consider this all his acting style. Don't listen to the other person, "Mean Girls" was pretty awful too. There are a few problems with movies like these. 1. We have classes! We don't have all that spare time to talk and do NOTHING. 2. How many of YOU have plastic surgeons for dads who will just go and buy you a printing press? NO WAY! They would take you to Cabo or something. 3. Do we all really look like that? No.
