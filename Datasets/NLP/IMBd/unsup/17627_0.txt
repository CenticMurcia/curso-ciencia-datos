Living in Southern California and being a gay man I never really spent much time thinking about not being able to marry my partner or the ramifications of an amendment to any states constitution banning same sex partners. This film made me laugh and cry and made me remember what being an American and gay human being is about which is equal rights for all. If other states can take on this issue it gives hope for places where the rest of us live and is relevant for all gay and straight people who love and know gay people. After time you learn to accept and forget the want to say in front of your loved ones and the world that you are gong to marry the man you love and be able to legally call someone your husband though that is what I call my boyfriend now. Thank you Mike and Doug for putting your heart and soul and time into this project. I hope my partner and I will soon be able to marry here in California and I am now going to be more proactive about making that happen in part due to the inspiration I gained from watching this film.
