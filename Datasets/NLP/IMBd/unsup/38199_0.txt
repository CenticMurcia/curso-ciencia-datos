Alison (Betsy Russell from "Private School" and "Avenging Angel") goes to cheerleading camp despite suffering terror daydreams and nightmare. When the girls start get murdered one by one, she suspects herself. More of a summer camp teen comedy than an out and out horror movie. And what would a teen summer camp comedy be without an obnoxious obese guy, yup he's here. This being an '80's film you know you'll see some fat guy ass sometime and what do ya know, it happens within the first 10 minutes. Man is that thing huge. Anyway back to the movie proper, I got distracted for a second there. It's just a cheesy dumb flick, nothing more nothing less.<br /><br />Eye Candy: Vickie Benson as Dee Dee, Krista Pflanzer as Suzy, Teri Weigel as Pamela Bently all get topless <br /><br />My Grade: C- <br /><br />DVD Extras: Commentary with Producer Jeff Prettyman and Director John Quinn; an ultra lame Alternate title sequence; 2 stills galleries; 3 Theatrical Trailers <br /><br />Easter Egg: Highlight the word "Trailers" in the trailers menu for a really crappy trailer for the film
