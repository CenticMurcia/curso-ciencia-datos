I went onto IMDb, saw the 10 star ratings and read the vast amount of reviews in which people described this film as 'heart warming'. So obviously I expected a decent film. This film turned out to be an illusive teen flick about a bunch of people and their silly lives. The movie is full of stereotypical characters with bothersome personalities. <br /><br />The story line and plot were appalling at the best!<br /><br />I give this movie two stars for the actor Jensen Ackles who plays Priestly. He's the only genuinely good actor in this film, he was the one that added a bit of life to this dreary film. One more star for the laughs I received from the terrible ending!<br /><br />I wasn't happy at the end of it, I wondered why I watched it. It was lacking in good script, characters and actors, who were supposed to bring them to life. Don't believe the hype because you'll end up disappointed.
