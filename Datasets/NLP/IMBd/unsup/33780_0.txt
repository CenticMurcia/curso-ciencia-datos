Truly, truly awful. The questions were mind-numbingly dumb (as was the commentary), if anything it makes you realise why the Sept 11 campaigners still haven't been able to prove a single one of their allegations. This film must be a false-flag operation, it truly is that bad. Watch it only if you are a die-hard conspiracy buff, or you can suspend all disbelief at the banality of the film and it's utter lack of impact. I tried hard to understand why she really decided to make this film, and the only conclusion that I could come to was that it is an attempt to cash-in on peoples natural desire to think the unthinkable.<br /><br />Only watch this if you have already lost the will to live!
