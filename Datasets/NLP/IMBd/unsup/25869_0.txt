I actually find myself watching this show and unable to turn it off, sort of like how you can't help looking at a car wreck. The videos are often cute, but the writing is so bad it is downright strange. The jokes don't make sense. Its like nothing I've ever seen...the jokes are so bad that they are weird. I don't think they are intentionally bad, like the jokes on AFHV. It's almost like a sixth grader wrote the jokes. A humorless, stupid sixth grader. I wish I could sit in on this show being made. what does the producer say when he reads the script? Do they just not care? Do the demographics for this show indicate that the audience is 6 yo? But the humor seems inappropriate for children of that age. Is the audience really stupid? Really, it's so bad that I want an explanation.
