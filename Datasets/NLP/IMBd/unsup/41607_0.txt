Embarrassing characters, lame dialogs, no funny jokes. A waste of time. The only interesting thing was the appearance of the characters. They played 15 year old teenagers but appeared rather old and a little bit feminine (at least Perry) at the same time . That puzzled me and kept me watching. After looking at the cast here in IMDb now I do understand. The actors were near to the forties, when they made the film. And why a middle-aged woman must play a teenage boy will remain the producer'secret. I do not know the Mr. Enfield's TV show. Therefore I can not give him a bonus for this movie. 'Kevin & Perry Go Large' is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
