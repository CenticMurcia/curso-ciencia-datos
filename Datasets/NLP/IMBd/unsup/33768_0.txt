A quick Summary of this film: A Green Fish like Monster takes a liking to eating people 0n the Paradise island of Hawaii.<br /><br />With the low budget and poor acting the only watchable aspects about this film are the scenes showing the Wildlife and the Island. I managed to watch the whole film on my Film philosophy that it can only get better, Unfortuantly it Didn't!<br /><br />Why i gave it 2/10 instead of 1/10 shows the quality of films i have seen in my life time. <br /><br />I would say avoid but make your own mind up....<br /><br />Next
