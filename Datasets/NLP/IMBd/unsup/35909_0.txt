If you want to see a movie where - the main charachters are flatter than a table - the background charachters are just "background", no emotions, except for some chinese extras that while pretending to be menacing smile at the camera! -the visual effects range from nice CG landscapes to rubber boulders -ANYTHING happening his predictable! -the plot is so silly that "Manos" seems Ben Hur in comparison -the silliest end in all the movies i ever saw: "I'm pregnant!"<br /><br />than see this movie. I saw it just because i was ill, and it made me sickier...
