I started cursing myself about 20 mins. after the start of the show. One tends to think what has happened to Ram Gopal Verma's quality of production. This movie certainly digressed from the main theme of horror movies - "Its supposed to scare ya !" .. <br /><br />Almost the entire movie is clich√©d .. there is no proper story .. and the director thinks that by adding weird sounds, it will sound scary .. you could almost guess what was going to happen next .. there is no proper story in the movie ! There should have been some history about why the tree killed people .. why did all the people decide to appear in the end together ? why could they not start the carnage earlier .. pathetic movie .. sushmita can act and she does a good job but the direction and the story is just nonsense .. "bhoot" was so much better .. I just saw exorcist (the beginning) a couple of days back and I thought it was pretty good ..<br /><br />Man !! the next time I go to a Ram Gopal Varma production, I'm gonna make sure I don't got for the first day show, it would be more sensible to ask someone who has already seen the movie ... it seems he is losing his touch ..
