This movie is a commendable attempt at telling the story of a simple, yet brave man and thus well-deservedly (50 years later!) commemorating his (albeit futile, by an absurd delay of seven minutes)attempt at assassinating Hitler. For this reason alone, this movie must be praised. One should, however, never confuse the contents (in this case: the political statements of a movie), with the form (viz. the style and craftsmanship with which a movie is made). <br /><br />Keeping this in mind, "Georg Elser" is _not_ a good movie. It suffers from a very unsophisticated screenplay which very often most gruffly connects scenes without any elegance, which includes many characters that aren't fully developed at all (e.g. the Brian Dennehy character is quite unfinished which is all too bad considering the enormous abilities of this actor, the same goes with the Vadim Glowna character). Worst of all, the movie is very poorly directed. Brandauer as an actor is flawless as usual, he gives a good performance as "Elser", but his directing is pretty bad. Given the fact that Brandauer had such remarkable men at hand as cinematographer Lajos Koltai (the images in this movie are very beautiful - the autumnal tints convey a certain feeling of doom) or composer Georges Delerue (a beautiful title theme), the overall result is most disappointing. There are many sequences lacking proper editing (shots that are way too long and thus very tiresome), there are other sequences which do not seem to make too much sense at all (e.g. several haphazardly combined shots in the Bürgerbräukeller), the storyline is never sufficiently tense.<br /><br />It is a pity: This movie could have been far better in the hands of a qualified director.
