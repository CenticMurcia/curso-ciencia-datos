Many movies these days come up a few blocks short of that miracle mile. Be it casting, character development or the story in general, you're lucky if you are able to stretch your legs, let alone walk the dog.<br /><br />16 Block will go down as a classic. It's a well done movie that showcases the acting ability of underground raper Mos Def solidifies Bruce Willis' ability to do more than blow up buildings and shine the spotlight on a personal favorite of mine, David Morse (Bait, The Rock, Green Mile).<br /><br />The beauty of this movie is how things flow. You know the plot going in. A cop has to get a witness 16 block. The question then becomes Will he make it, how will he make it, who will survive the journey and whom will they meet along the way.<br /><br />This is a great movie and reveals a great deal about people and their ability to change.
