I don't know why this website always manages to post reviews by people who know not what they are talking about. I read a review posted prior to the one thats up there now and the same thing. Whats up with you people?! Star Wars Clone Wars is simply one of the best cartoon series there is! The amazing style used by Gendy Tartakovsky... (I hope thats spelled right... And the brilliant plot lines makes for one excellent adventure through time...oops wrong movie. Anyways if you're a fan of Star Wars or if you're a fan of Samurai Jack or even if you just love good old fashioned cartoons, do me a favor and go rent "Clone Wars" and to that idiot at Blockbuster its "Clone Wars" NOT "Attack of the Clones". For those of you who know entirely nothing about Clone Wars, basically it takes place immediately following the Attack of the Clones and leads into Revenge of the Sith. Remember in the original Star Wars when Ben is telling Luke that his father fought in the Clone Wars... well thats what this series is all about. The Battle between The Jedi and their Clone army VS the Seperatist lead by count Dooku and their Droid Army... I gotta Jet... Check Out Star Wars Clone Wars...available NOW to buy!!!
