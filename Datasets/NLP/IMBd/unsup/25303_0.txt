I really enjoyed this movie. The film starts off a bit slow, but it is so true to real life and real people.<br /><br />I like Jean Reno and Juliette Binoche very much, although they both looked very different physically from their usual selves. I didn't even know it was Juliette till the credits came up.<br /><br />It was nice to see Jean in a non-action film.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to any romantics out there!<br /><br />
