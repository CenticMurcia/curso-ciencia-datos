People may think I am exaggerating how jaw droppingly awful this movie is, but I'm really not. This movie has earned it's place in the Bottom 100.<br /><br />It's extremely stupid and the screenwriter clearly has no wit whatsoever. I noticed a lot of recylced jokes from early Mike Myers movies, but no one will notice because they too busy staring at Justin Timberlake's fake bulge.<br /><br />Expect a ton of jokes about poop that aren't remotely funny. A five year old could've written this junk, and it would be superior. Do not waste your money on this offensive piece of crap (Yes, I'm offended by the way they are representing American filmmakers).
