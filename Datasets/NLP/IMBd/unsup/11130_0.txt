I liked this movie, it is a movie filled to the brim with cheesy dialog. I don't think that it should be a movie just for children to watch, I am 20, and I thought that it was pretty cool. I also loved the fact that Tyra Banks was a black doll, and the other cast members were white, you just don't see that very often, Had I not known that Tyra Banks was playing "Eve" the life-size doll, I would have figured that the person picked to play "Eve" would have been white, hey, that's just the way the world works. You should watch this movie.
