I loved Thundercats just as much as any other child of the 80s, I had the toys: the regular 6", the little 1" high ones, a giant Lion-O that lit up...of course they're all lost now.<br /><br />But watching the episodes on DVD now is almost painful for how terrible and cheesy the shows are. The animation is cheap, though still not half as bad as shows like Pokemon. But the dialogue and voice acting are horribly overdone, the music is repeated ad nauseum...<br /><br />I realize it's a kid's show, but look at shows like Dexter's Laboratory or Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends for well-done kid's shows with high production values. Let's not kid ourselves here, Thundercats was a very cheaply done kids' show with very imaginative and great characters, which serve its purpose of selling toys.<br /><br />Rest assured, though, if they ever made a Thundercats movie with feature-quality animation, I'd be first in line...
