I will keep this short and sour. I'd like to get into the sheer horrors that this movie lays out there, but there is a one thousand word maximum, so that would be impossible.<br /><br />First of all, any effort to make exposition any less painful than it became was clearly abandoned in the early stages of the writing process and replaced with painful "into the camera" sequences. Not only does this device show an astonishing lack of creativity, but it also grates on your nerves after an hour and a half. I'm not saying I expected this film to be some fine accomplishment of cinema. Or even less than a total embarrassment for everyone involved, including the viewer, but to unleash this on an unsuspecting public is just cruel.<br /><br />On a totally superficial side note... How short is Christian Slater? I never thought him to be a tall man, but unless everyone else in the film is roughly the size if Shaquille O'Neal, Mr. Slater should inquire about membership to the lollipop guild.
