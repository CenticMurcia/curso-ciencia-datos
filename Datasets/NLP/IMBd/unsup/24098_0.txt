Roberto is superb once more! Roberto did a fabulous job as The Son Of The Pink Panther adding not only humor, but giving it an wonderfully amusing and unique touch deliverable only by him. I recommend this movie not only to Mr. Benigni's fans, but to all who are seeking a laugh with a pink panther twist.
