I had fun watching this. There were some good twists that I didn't see coming and some good suspense. While they are others out there who hate Lifetime movies, I have to say I love the majority of them (there are exceptions though). And this movie is one that I liked. If you don't like Lifetime, all you have to do is not watch it. I loved Alexandra Paul in this and Lover's Revenge and Saving Emily. I also saw that Love Thy Neighbor scored the highest approval rating in the Nielsens that they've "ever had for an Indy film." I honestly can see how people would dislike Lifetime films, but they are what they are. I am the audience they're shooting for I guess. If you're looking for an Academy Award film, you're not going to find it on Lifetime. But if you like these movie of the week popcorn movies, then I'd recommend this one as much as any other. To each is own I guess.
