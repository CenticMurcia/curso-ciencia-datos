I was a bit anxious at first when I heard about this remake. I have never been a fan of remakes. I always worry that they will somehow ruin a perfectly good classic movie. And being an avid lover of "Guess who is coming to dinner," I had even more to worry about. However, I believe that this "new take" on the movie was great and inventive. It was updated to give it a modern twist and wasn't an exact replica of the original. In fact I laughed hysterically through out the movie. Of course there may be some over-the-top antics, but it is in good fun and this definitely constitutes a meaningful feel-good movie. So I am recommend watching Guess Who highly.
