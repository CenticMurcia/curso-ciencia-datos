What a piece of crap, very disappointing should never have been made. Where are the original actors there's no jeff Daniels, no Danny DE Vito, the character of patsy was slim and pretty and smart and sophisticated in the first film but now shes replaced by some heavier actress who just acts dumb all the way through. Terms of endearment was one of the best films i ever saw but this one makes it look really bad. Too long and drawn out and what a shame that all the children turned out bad and that there father isn't in the picture. In the first he seemed to be there a lot but, how can he just never see them again after his wife dies how does that happen.
