Please please please tell me what's the point of this movie? Why make a sequel if you aren't going to be original? The plot and the jokes are pretty much recycled from the first movie. The first movie was good, it was a cult classic.<br /><br />The french translation of the first movie was a masterpiece. I still say that the french translated version of the first is better then the original English version (both are good in their own ways)<br /><br />Here tho we get a bad attempt from the dubbing company to recapture the magic of the original french translation but all we get is a badly translated movie.<br /><br />If you want my opinion this movie belongs in the trash can along with other bad sequels.
