I saw this a little while ago in the heyday of the "Hong Kong" craze. Me, I'm a purist. I love Woo, Hark, Lam. But this little gem is one that has stayed with me after all these years.<br /><br />Performances and action are leagues above any American action movie in the past 20 years. Hong Kong/China are where the best action movies come from. No wonder America is stealing all their actors and remaking their movies.<br /><br />At times comical. At times James Bond. This Hong Kong working of the plot from "Sneakers" is one that is definitely worth tracking down.<br /><br />10/10
