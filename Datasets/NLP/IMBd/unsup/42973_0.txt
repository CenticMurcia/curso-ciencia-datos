I have to admit, that first season of Monk was really amazing - original, interesting, entertaining and I was always looking forward to the next episode. Second season was very good, not as good as first one, but still kept the high level.<br /><br />Unfortunately since third season everything started to go bad - the cases are less and less interesting, the Monk's dead wife became the most important character, the plot really weak... I was hoping that Traylor Howard will bring something new to this show, but after few episodes she became just a simple replacement.<br /><br />When I see Monk now I really feel sorry for the creators - they are literally killing their own brilliant idea for the show - everything about Monk became pretty predictable and since usually there are 1-2 people outside the regular cast in each episode it isn't much challenge for the viewers to point the murderer without Monk's help, and constant repeating of "I solved the case" started to remind me of Scooby-doo mysteries...<br /><br />So, all I can say to the creators is - Monk was brilliant idea for the show, but move back to that idea or let him end with dignity, don't wait until it is too late (like "Scooby-doo meets Vincent Price" level).
