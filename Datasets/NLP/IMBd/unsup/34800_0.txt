If this movie is considered good, than I am a genius.<br /><br />I saw that movie yesterday with my date and I feel bad for this loss of time we could have spent home watching DVD's or in bed.<br /><br />Al Pacino has the expression of a retarded (always an open mouth like a puppy) and tries to be funny somehow. The screenplay has no justifications in anyway and the direction itself of the actors is more than poor.<br /><br />I wont tell anybody what it's about but I can tell you this: It's the typicall thriller that tries to make you believe that everybody could be a potential killer and in the end they come up with something totally predicable.Just rubbish, so please someone tell me why, the rating of six.
