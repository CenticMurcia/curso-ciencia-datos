Wes Craven-many horror fans consider him as a master of horror,but after watching his truly god-awful movies like "Deadly Friend","Invitation to Hell" and this one I came to conclusion that he is very overrated.Only three of his movies are actually worth watching:"Last House on the Left" which is brilliant,"The Hills Have Eyes" and "Deadly Blessing" which are pretty good.His other movies,including overrated "Scream" and "A Nightmare on Elm Street" are a typical Hollywood garbage."The Hills Have Eyes Part 2" is truly one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen.The plot concerns a bunch of annoying youngsters,who are attacked by cannibals:Pluto(Michael Berryman) and his uncle Reaper(John Bloom).Absolutely no suspense,even no gore to satisfy gore-freaks(although there's a nice throat slashing).The acting is diabolically obscure and the final twist is obnoxious and stupid.The scene when the pet dog has a flashback to the previous movie is extremely dumb,but also hilarious at the same time.Avoid this junk like the plague.Not recommended.
