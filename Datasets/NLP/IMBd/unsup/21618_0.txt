I agree with one of the earlier posts that ppl must be getting offended 'cause he's officially made fun of everyone and if he hadn't yet, then this routine touched that last nerve on the so-called "hard-core" supporters that think that his best yrs are behind him.<br /><br />My favorite is one guy who thought that after he started attacking religion that his routine went down hill and why? Because he's some full-of-himself, "moralistic", religious nut himself and got offended... Obviously he didn't take in the message George has been sending all along... to take a step back, realize what's going on around us, and most importantly, LAUGH!!!! This was a very ingeniously performed routine that took a shot at all the ills of pop-culture, the morbid curiosity of your average person, and ultimately the extreme human behavior(exclusive to us so-called "civilized" beings) that shows how primitive we really are...<br /><br />And for those of you that don't think there's punchlines how 'bout when he talks 'bout "scarfing" and throws in the pun, "think of how many kids are trying to pull this one off" Also he touches on several current topics like obesity, stupidity, and consumerism that are just becoming too much of an issue to ignore, I mean the whole "pretty soon all you'll need to get into college is a pencil" is so true, I mean I know that i'm not as "enlightened" or "educated" as I should be and I know that if I had the same study habits/dedication towards school just 20yrs ago there's no way I'd be able to get a college degree but now i'm just a couple months away from graduating college, just going to show that they're definitely lowering the standards, I mean I'm no dummy either, but still, getting into and graduating college is becoming less of a big deal 'cause the best way to help "educate" the ppl is to lower the standards....<br /><br />The obesity part... OMG... Being in Europe now, yes there are obese ppl, but nothing like the "interstate buses" you see in the US, especially in the Southeastern states...<br /><br />And as for consumerism, while he's touched on the subject several times the "spending money we don't have on things we don't need" is just becoming more and more evident in society! I could go on and on, but the ultimate genius of this bit is how society is "going to the dogs" and he touches on this not only in the Suicide Reality TV bit, but also the Eliminating Electricity to bring us back to primitive times and finally the Nationwide Natural Disaster bit as well as just the whole routine shows us what's wrong with society and that it's only getting worse, so what should we do about it... SIT BACK AND ENJOY THE RIDE!!!!
