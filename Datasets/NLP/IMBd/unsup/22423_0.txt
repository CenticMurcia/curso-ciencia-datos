I wish IMDb had a 0 of 10 rating. This was a terrible piece of cinema. Absolutely no creativity, no originality, and no talent went into the making of this film. It is an utter piece of sh*t.<br /><br />The one saving grace of the film is that it ends eventually. I am glad this was banned in the United States, because it shows a total lack of professionalism in regards to theft of ideas.<br /><br />There is one funny part... When the jackass town mayor smacks his son in the hospital and a great Kung-fu slap sound is added. Other than that it fails on all levels, I was seriously hoping that the shark killed everyone in the movie, but NOOOOOOOOOOOOO. Nice try on making a Robert Shaw worthy character, but I would rather watch Zombie Planet with my testicles attached to a car battery than watch this again...
