Desperate Housewives began with a bang in season 1 but with a revolving door of cast changes starting in season 2 and the 5 year time jump, Marc Cherry might as well drive a nail through the series coffin. For the past 2 seasons, the series has had a number of recycled stories. The latest falls on Susan Mayer who is once again unlucky in love and having issues with her love life. Tom, Lynnette's husband is once again finding ways to liven up his miserable existence to his miserable hag of a wife. The show needs to end this season or next at the most. Further delays would severely cripple what remains of this one time hit.
