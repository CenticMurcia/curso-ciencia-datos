What a trainwreck. Cheesey family, bisquick-filled villains, horrible dialogue, even worse acting, cliche after awful cliche, large plot holes, non-attention to some details, over-emphasis of other details....<br /><br />~Avoid~ this movie, unless you want a good laugh and/or are in the mood to MST.
