Kissing A Fool is such a delightful movie, you can't help but love it. The movie has a great script and a brilliant cast, including, the fantastic Mili Avital (One of my favourite actress'. She's destined to go far.) and David Schwimmer who are both brilliant here. (I think it's great that they're both together in 'real-life.' (And engaged too.)) I shouldn't really forget, Jason Lee who is also good here. If you haven't seen, Kissing A Fool, then I'd really advise you too. Like I've said many times, it sure is brilliant and I give it a well deserving 10/10.
