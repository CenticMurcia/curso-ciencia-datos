The Serpent and The Rainbow has many ups and downs, but unfortunately the bad parts of the movie outnumber the good parts. The theme of this movie from the very beginning is being buried alive. The movie is boring up until Dr. Allen starts dodging the cult leader. Dr. Allen is ambushed in the streets right after his friend is killed, he has the secret potion blown in his face, and stumbles on the streets whispering "don't bury me, I'm not dead", truely creepy. The anticipation builds every second after that because of what the director has shown us what happens to those who have been given the potion, and we fear for Dr. Allen. The climax of this movie is the middle, which isn't a good thing at all, and that's when he is proclaimed dead by the doctors, and is sent to be buried in the graveyard, the same thing we've seen in the beginning of the story, but it hasn't touched a character we care about yet.<br /><br />The first half is boring and useless, it could have been cut down. The dream sequences were stupid and numerous. The middle was great, but quickly ruined by an end that might appear in the cheesiest action flick you have ever seen with idiotic one-liners, voodoo, and people flying across the room without dying.<br /><br />Most people will not like this, film buffs need to avoid, but the average horror fan should see this just for the shocking experience of being buried alive.
