I felt this documentary about the Living Organisms of the Ocean was sloppy and rushed. There was some good footage but nothing earth shattering. Kate Nelligan was just OK as narrator. She had no pizazz. She was monotone and basically just going through the motions. Pardon the pun. The movie was short , only 35 minutes. It was just a lackadaisical effort . Seems like any amateur could get the footage that the makers of this documentary were able to get. I also felt the music was unnecessary. I love new age music , don't get me wrong , but I would have much rather have heard more of the natural sounds coming from the ocean. I am glad they mentioned something about some of the ocean plants that strive . Some of the facts about these plants were satisfying to hear. Still I can not give this movie any kind of kudos. I was simply; Very disappointed in this effort and would certainly not recommend this to others.
