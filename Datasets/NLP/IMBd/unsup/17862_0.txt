Identity is an above average horror film and I am always rooting for B-movie filmmakers when they break into classier material(the writer of jack frost 1 & 2). While listening to the director's comments on the DVD made me appreciate the film more I am going to review based on the feelings I had walking out of the theater.<br /><br />Identity Starts off with greatness and if you didn't watch the last chapter you would get a much better film. I understand what the writer and director were trying to do with the end but it took a high quality horror film and shot it in the foot. <br /><br />The film presents a interesting idea for a story that I will not give away for people who have not seen it. John Cusak has a really strong performance the kind that is brilliant in a way that never gets noticed. The cast is strong, with quite a few bigger named actors who seemed willing to be wet for weeks.<br /><br />The film is in a genre that the director refers to as single location horror. Panic room and phone booth are better recent films in the same vein. Classics include Rear window and Alien. The confined space provides a lot of the tension. Worth a watch.
