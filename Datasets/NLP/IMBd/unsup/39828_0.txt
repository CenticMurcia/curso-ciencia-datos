A smooth talking ladies man and his very married partner are the "Bad Boys" in question here. Together this cop duo show plenty of attitude while pursuing a ruthless crim who has stolen millions of dollars worth of coke from under the noses of the Miami P.D. There are explosions and gunplay aplenty, a sexy girl and a useless, unfunny subplot propelling this romp.<br /><br />"Bad Boys" is another cop buddy action flick with absolutely nothing new on offer. Both script and action sequences borrow much from other, superior action movies, and the whole film is just far too formulated to make any sort of impression.<br /><br />The cast are uninspiring, the story seriously lacks some fresh effective humour, and not only are the bad guys totally predictable and one dimensional (they can't shoot straight either - but what's new?), but the good guys are void of depth too.<br /><br />Still, all things being equal, "Bad Boys" never pretends to be Oscar material. So, if dumb, loud action films are your thing, then by all means give these boys a whirl, or rather let them give you one!<br /><br />Tuesday, May 23, 1995 - Hoyts Cinema Centre Melbourne
