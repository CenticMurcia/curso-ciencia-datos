I bought this DVD for $2.00 at the local variety warehouse. The creepy clown cover and quote "he's not clowning around"took my eye with a hope of either a Horror/slasher or possibly a b grade movie that might have some laughs.<br /><br />Man was i mistaken. This movie might be OK to see if you had smoked some wicked herb or taken some acid, though because i hadnt it just made me angry.<br /><br />The story/plot was not original and the constant use of similar sounding riffs to the john carpenter halloween theme and the Ã«xcorcist theme quickly became annoying.<br /><br />Alice witnessed the death of her son or did she? Was it the good clown,bad clown an evil serial killer or herself? I don't know if this film was SUPPOSED to be open for interpretation if this was the writer/directors master plan... i don't think it was.<br /><br />maybe i am not really here typing this review and i am secretly in some mental hospital thinking about writing this review?.<br /><br />Overall this film blows.<br /><br />1/10
