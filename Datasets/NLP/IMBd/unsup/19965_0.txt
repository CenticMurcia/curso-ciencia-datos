Agents Secrets is not only a spy / contra-spy thriller but also one of the best portfolio examples french cinema has nowadays. With few words and dynamic fast camera movements the actor-couple Monica Bellucci & Vincent Cassel are very well fitted in this story of spies & secret agents. Not the most original story, but the story sequence is.<br /><br />It is a joy to watch these two professional actors, there is no question about if they are acting: the just ARE the two secret service agents. No doubt about it. You will be touched by the movie and once you will see the credit rolling by, you still be in your chair thinking about all the impressions and story line.<br /><br />I think this one is a high ranker on your list if you like spy-games.
