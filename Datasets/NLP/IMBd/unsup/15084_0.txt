This film got Hitchcock an Oscar nomination and it was well deserved. Tallulah Bankhead got an award from the New York Film Critics for her role in this John Steinbeck story about survivors on a lifeboat.<br /><br />There was an eclectic mix of characters with a German Captain, an American who changed his German name, a multi-millionaire, a typical New York character, and two from the South side of Chicage, a girl and a guy who find love on the boat, and one black character. You can imagine the stories and conflict in that as they float on the sea.<br /><br />Hitcock did a create job keeping things moving and the film never dragged as they awaited rescue. Cinematography was excellent. Great cast and an interesting look at how people react without food or water.
