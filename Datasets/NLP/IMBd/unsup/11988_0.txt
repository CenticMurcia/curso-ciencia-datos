This is one of the best documentaries I've seen since Farenheit 9/11, Game exposes the truth about this lousy piece of garbage name G-Unit, game delivers one of his best performances as he exposes the lies, the deceptions and the evil surrounds this horrible group and pop rap group Pistol Pete from Terror Squad also delivers here as the person who exposed tony yayo as a coward, you know people always say you should listen to music like G-Unit, because it's good for hip hop's soul, it's not good, it is hateful, disgraceful, shameful and truly unbelievably tasteless, I Bet these stupid stans don't even know what real hip hop is, all they listen to is garbage like this, it's a shame that tupac and biggie & big pun turning on their graves and probably laughing at how pathetic the mainstream hip hop has become and especially for someone like fifty cent that is ruining it.<br /><br />Stop Snitchin, Stop Lyin is a classic masterpiece of all proportions, it's one of the year's DVD's.
