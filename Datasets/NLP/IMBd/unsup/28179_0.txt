South Park: Bigger Longer & Uncut is unique, as it is likely the only movie adaptation of a television show that was popular with both critics and audiences. It is also one of the funniest animated films ever made. The film takes satiric aim at American culture, through the premise of a war between the US and Canada started by an "obscene" Canadian film. Like MASH, South Park contrasts the perceived obscenity of language and sexuality with the true obscenity of war and violence. The film has become even more poignant in these dark times of wars fought under false pretenses. <br /><br />The film is also a musical and benefits from the catchy tunes of Trey Parker and Marc Shaiman. Highlights include the "Blame Canada" song and a Stanley Kubrick/Anthony Burgess tribute involving the V-chip. It is an excellent film overall and is among my favorite animated features. 10/10
