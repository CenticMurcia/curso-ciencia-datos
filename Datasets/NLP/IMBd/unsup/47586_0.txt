This one of the most boring movies i have ever seen!. Nothing happens, until the final 15 to 20 minutes!, it's basically just people wandering around, screaming and arguing, there is hardly any action, just lots of boring dialog, with unlikable characters, and a pretty uninteresting main villain.I got this on a 8 horror movie 2 disc set. I don't really have anything more to say, about this, god awful film. The Direction is terrible!. George Gage, does a terrible job here, with a boring location, terrible camera work and most importantly the pace is extremely boring!. There is a tiny bit of blood, a few bloody gunshot wounds, bloody stabbing, gory bird attack. The Acting is not good at all. Sonny Landham, is bad here, he is uninteresting, and seemed bored, i like the guy, but his performance here was terrible. Steve Kanaly, is okay but nothing great as the main hero,and was the best of the lot. Karen Carlson, is annoying, here, and very unlikable.Same goes Macon McCalman Overall Avoid like the plague! BOMB out of 5
