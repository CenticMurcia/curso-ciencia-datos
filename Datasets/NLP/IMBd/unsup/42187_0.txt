i didn't like this movie at all.i think it's supposed to be a parody of March of the Penguins.but for me,it just wasn't funny.plus,i felt the humour consisted of mostly vulgar,crude language.there's a lot of the F-bomb(among other words) dropped here.this definitely isn't for kids.but i also just found it boring.i actually couldn't watch it all,because i found it too slow.as for the crude language,that doesn't always bother me,but i just found it gratuitous and too frequent.i don't think you always need to have swears to make things funny.it's not for every taste,that's for sure.if you don't mind a lot of very crude language,you might want to check this one out.for me,Farce of the Penguins is a 1/10
