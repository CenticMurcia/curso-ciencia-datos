I just saw this film today and as an avid Gable worshipper, I was shocked that people even attempted to capture Gable and Lombard's chemistry on film. Even though James Brolin (who played Clark) was I suppose alright acting-wise, he was not the best. Jill Clayurgh (who played Carole) didn't even look like Lombard, but I also suppose she did mediocre acting-wise. Its hard, at least for me, to watch a film where actors and actresses are trying to play someone who's passed away and don't even look like them! I know the love story between Clark and Carole like the back of my hand, I KNOW it. I wish Sidney J. Furie, the director, should of done more background information about both Hollywood legends before trying to make a film about them. I mean, I know the film focused on their love, but still if you don't have the right information to play in front of the camera, other fans will dislike it. I wouldn't watch this movie again, but I suppose if you have a free afternoon, its not worth watching. for God's sakes, just pop in Gone with the Wind!
