"Boys and Girls" is total teenage date movie waste-of-seven-bucks garbage. Hollywood makes these movies because they know that they're trash but the opening sales will cover the cost of the production and still make a small profit. There was no feasable reason why this movie would be made. Did someone say "hey, we need a movie that has attractive stars but let's not add depth, good plot, good dialogue or interesting funny parts"?<br /><br />Well, maybe someone did say that, because that's what they got. At least in "When Harry Met Sally" you felt there might be some small tiny chance that the two main characters wouldn't get together at the end. Here's the spoiler, because I have to identify it: once you see the first ten minutes you know how the film will end. The film just plays with you and wastes your time, delaying the inevitable. A lot of romance movies are like that, but this one doesn't have any good qualities, except maybe Jason Biggs, who really wasted his time on this.<br /><br />Take my advice. Never see this film.
