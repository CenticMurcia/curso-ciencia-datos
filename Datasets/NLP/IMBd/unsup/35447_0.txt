James Marshall stars as an ex-crook trying to go straight however this is hard because his criminal record keeps haunting him and ruins his chance for any decent employment, however when he gets his hands on a counterfeit plate, three sets of mobsters come gunning for him. (Such mobsters include Eric Roberts,William Forsythe, Sasha "Kickboxer 2-4" Mitchell,Patrick Kilpatrick, Ice-T and Dennis Hopper) If anything else, Luck Of The Draw answers the burning question of what became of Sasha Mitchell after Step By Step, however that aside, Luck Of The Draw is just terrible. Actually that's not true, Luck Of The Draw has potential to be a truly enjoyable movie but squanders it every chance it gets by giving us James Marhsall, an actor who has zero rapport with the audience. I admit that Eric Roberts and Sasha Mitchell's over the top portrayals of meat-headed hit men have their moments. As does Dennis Hopper. (As expected, he's Dennis Hopper for goodness sake!) but too much screen time is taken on the far less interesting James Marshall and a new love interest. Also wasted is Michael Madsen, who doesn't have that much screen time despite having a a substantial part of the plot. Overall it's just a low budget, underwritten and dull gangster style movie, with a solid B.movie cast that focuses too much time on a really dull leading man. So even though a cast this good promises something epic, it hardly delivers. But that's the luck of the draw, isn't it?<br /><br />*1/2 out of 4-(Poor)
