Just wanted to say to the guy who thought this film had a bad ending, you clearly don't understand the essence of escalation. "Revenge is a dish best served cold" you will note is the opening lines of the Kill Bill Series, not a black comedy granted but a similar themed film. The whole point of revenge is to go one better than what was done to you, when someone blows up your entire family, albeit unintentionally then what better way to dish out the moment when said opponent in the battle of revenge meets his maker, than by carrying out your dead fathers wish. In my mind this is the ultimate black comedy, a biased decision I'm sure growing up on the welsh border and getting an extra tickle from the welsh eccentricities, but from a writing point of view, perfectly executed!
