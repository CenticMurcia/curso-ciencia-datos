Regardless of what any one else says, this is a well done movie particularly considering it is her first with writing, directing and scoring credits. It is a statement on the French / American connection as much as it is a statement of love, sex and relationships. This is probably the most unromantic representation I have seen of Paris since moments of Paris, je t'aime. The dialogue is rapid fire, often amusing, profound and poignant. A whole lot happens in those 2 days. Much of the American and apparently French sensibility is called into question. Yet as hellish as Paris is presented to be, the final scene between Julie and Adam is so beautifully done and emotional, it makes the whole ordeal well worth it. If you have ever loved or are in love, it will make you cry.<br /><br />I assume the small number of reviews for this film is due to limited release. I applaud my theater and all others who present this film to their audiences. If you get a chance, take a date, see it alone or with open minded friends, but don't miss this if you believe in love.
