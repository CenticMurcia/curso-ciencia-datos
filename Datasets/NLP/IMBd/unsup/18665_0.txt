This is the sort of movie that has probably done well on word-of-mouth alone. I liked it enough to recommend it to at least 2 different friends. Like Shakespeare in Love before it, this movie is definitely not historically accurate. If you can look past some of the more glaring inaccuracies (if you've ever taken a history of theater class you'll know instantly what I mean), you will be rewarded with a pretty gripping story. If you like Shakepearen-era theater and like stories that are well-written, you'll like this one. While I had certainly known there was a time in theater when men played women's parts, I had never before thought about what might have happened to them when women were finally allowed on the stage. This is an interesting and thought-provoking movie and probably best for adults and mature teens.
