Well, to me, it was Nicole Kidman which made me rent this DVD.<br /><br />I watched if after 'Bridget Jones - The Edge of Reason' because I reckoned I needed something serious after that fairy-tale, but I was not prepared to see what it was coming.<br /><br />I honestly hated the story, I find it appalling that somebody would think of such a f**ked up story. And even though there are some CGIs used for some of the scenes where the two main characters meet, I still think this is a sick tale to put on screen.<br /><br />However, there is something interesting about this film, despite its many flaws (as if they did not have enough money to properly edit it). Nicole Kidman is wonderful once again, playing the part which suits her like a glove: a very beautiful woman, entirely consumed by all sorts of dramas ('The Others', 'Dogville' are just two other examples). And yes, that shot, at the Opera... is just amazing! Brilliant! Apart from Nicole Kidman, there is also the very special soundtrack, which combined with the directing, create an atmosphere of intense pressure, eroticism, beauty and darkness altogether.<br /><br />Also, the image at the end of film, on the beach... will haunt me forever.<br /><br />Relax your nerves, cause they will be stretched ... to the maximum (at least that's what happened to mine!)
