This movie was DEFINITELY very true to life. The characters have a lot of depth -- even the minor ones -- and it allows you to definitely connect with the main characters. A very sentimental, very honest look at adolescence and growing up. Being the biggest Noah Taylor fan, bought it off ebay, unsure what to expect, as I am usually unwilling to just purchase movies I've never seen. This one did not disappoint and I recommend it highly. The girl that falls for the dumb jock instead of the guy she SHOULD have fell for, and Noah Taylor is a genius portrayal of the "boy next door." And if you're a Nicole Kidman fan, she's in the sequel, so this would give you a little background on Danny for "Flirting."
