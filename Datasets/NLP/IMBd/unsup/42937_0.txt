This latest entry into straight-to-TV videos sees Tom Skerrit running for his life when disaster hits New York City. <br /><br />Another predictable, pretentious natural disaster "thriller" made for TV, "Earthquake in New York" does nothing we have not seen before, and accomplishes zip.<br /><br />Boring from start to finish.<br /><br />1.5/5 stars -<br /><br />John Ulmer
