I cannot understand...Simbu does not have any originality. ..He acts and copies Rajini's style, then copies Kamal's style .. then copies Vijay's style and then last but not least copies his dad's style. Does it mean he is more like a mimicry hero. ..who has no originality and just copies everyone...He wants to be like everyone and never wants to be like Simbu.....It is so annoying and boring to see the same crap. .. If the same portrait of Rajini, Kamal and Vijay are going to be always there, why see a dummy instead of a real one. Maybe Simbu should accept himself and act his own style instead of having no originality and copying everyone.<br /><br />Renu
