The key to enjoying this movie is in your expectations. After seeing cars with guns and a wide array of other BAMF weaponry attached to them in the trailers, I didn't expect Death Race to have much depth. I went in hoping to see the lovechild of the Fast and the Furious and Mad Max, and I saw just that--and I loved it! There are plenty of things in this movie that normally would have annoyed the crap out of me, but giving it a lot of leeway made it a hundred times more enjoyable.<br /><br />The acting is, dare I say, somewhat decent for a Paul W.S. Anderson film. The actors give the performances they need to give, while still having fun with their roles. The cold, awkward acting that plagued Resident Evil and AVP is kept to a minimum here, if at all present. Jason Statham is the typical tough guy protagonist, while Joan Allen is the usual one-dimensional villain. They play their parts well, as does the rest of the cast.<br /><br />Death Race is pure escapism. And, oh, is it fun escapism! This is the first Anderson film I've seen that I've been absolutely satisfied with. It never tries to be anything more than what it is and it shows the audience everything they want and expect to see. If you're not into ADD action and gore glorification, this one ain't for you! Otherwise, catch this one in the theater while you still can!
