After watching this movie, I can watch again and its is still funny, I recommended it to my m8s and they love it too, hell they wanted to watch it again. Although Swardson could of had a bigger role but it all good mix, of humour and 8 mile,<br /><br />Terry Crews role was just hilarious, he can always make me laugh :O when is he gonna be a lead in a comedy???<br /><br />I love Kennedy work,I don't know about his song maybe he Should that go and keep making comedy films.<br /><br />Every character is great in this Most enjoyable. And Even people who are down with it. Love it!!! 8/10 "my uncle gave it to me for my birthday" you will laugh when you hear this quote occurs in the movie. Cant wait for 'Kickin it old Skool'.
