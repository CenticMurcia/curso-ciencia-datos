by far thee worst movie i have ever seen in my life! i would rather watch teletubbies over this movie! i am telling you this was a waste of time and money! -bad acting! -bad, cheesy music! -bad filming! it looks more like teenagers taped it for a project.. which they got an F on!<br /><br />me & my mom were at the video store looking for a good, scary movie.. i came across this one and the cover made it look like a great one. so i thought what the heck.. it looks good so let's get it.. well we just watched it and we couldn't wait for it to be over with.. we gave it a chance and didn't stop watching.. but it was dumb! sorry to any of you who may like this movie.. for some odd reason.. but this is my opinion.. and a bunch of others too so if you like scary movies.. Don't LET THE CASE FOOL YOU!!! THIS IS NOT A GOOD HORROR MOVIE AT ALL!!
