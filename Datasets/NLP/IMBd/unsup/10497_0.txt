Adventures of Elmo in Grouchland is disappointing. In trying to differentiate the movie from a typical Sesame Street episode, the creators produced a dull generic children's movie that lacks both the educational and entertainment qualities of the TV series. The movie also lacks any spontaneity and the genuine-feel often found with the small children on the television show.
