1st watched 2/19/2007 - 3 out of 10(Dir-Elmer Clifton): Formulaic good woman gone bad story. This time being enticed by getting nice things thru gambling initially, then pushed into being an escort to pay back her debts to the gambling club. This all happens while her husband is trying to make it in the medical field and is often out of town. The movie starts with a murder and the rest of the movie is told in flashbacks as the accused tells the story. As is usual in these films, it starts out innocent enough at the roulette wheel but blossoms out of control as she loses more money. The bad guys threaten her by saying that they'll get her husband involved and then she's stuck to being their slave until the money is paid back. Eventually, the main character's sister gets enticed as well and her hatred brings about the ensuing crime. This is one of those "B" exploitation movies that doesn't pack much of a punch and the viewer is left waiting for the whole thing to just be over. The good thing is that it eventually ends, the bad thing is that I watched it.
