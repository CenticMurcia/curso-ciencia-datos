Was this supposed to be a comedy, a comedy/drama or what? The story revolves around a small time British singer named Toni Cocozza,(Ian Hart) why his name is spelled with an i on the end of it, I have no idea, and it was never explained.<br /><br />His big hero is Frank Sinatra and he mostly sings Sinatra songs, (I don't know if the actor did his own singing or not), accompanied by an older man on the piano, who is a friend of his, named Bill (Alun Armstrong). Bill walks with a limp and a cane, but we're never told why.<br /><br />Toni is so nerdy looking he is kind of like the poor man's Barry Manilow on a bad day. I don't know if we are supposed to think this character is nerdy looking or not, but he strictly is with his frizzy permed hair, weak chin and weasel-like, beady eyes.<br /><br />Toni isn't doing all that great in the singing biz, but a mobster's elderly wife, named Dainty, is quite a fan.<br /><br />This leads to Toni getting involved with the mob and the mob's henchmen.<br /><br />He is advised against doing this by his friend, Bill, but Toni doesn't realize it is going to lead to consequences.<br /><br />There is also a romantic interest, a cigarette girl named Irene (Kelly MacDonald), who is rather pretty but stands out no more than any other of today's actresses.<br /><br />The ending is rather abrupt and the viewer is left wondering just how they could possibly pull it off, nor are we shown the details.<br /><br />I was somewhat surprised that gangsters apparently leave the doors unlocked, and the keys in the ignition, of their cars, at all times.<br /><br />Toni Cocozza is a nice enough guy, but the actor playing him was so unappealing, plus the abrupt ending, has me giving this film only 3 stars.
