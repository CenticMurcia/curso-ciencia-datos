I took a friend to see this movie with me and as I worked a little behind the scenes I kept nudging her with my elbow saying, "That was filmed at Riley!" or wherever the scene was shot at. I must say it's different watching a movie where you have been behind the scenes.<br /><br />Lets see, take 4 cups "A Knights Tale", 6 cups "Weekend at Bernie's", 2 cups "Clerks", and 3 cups "Scary Movie" and put all ingredients in a bowl. Blend with mixer until mixture is creamy. (about 40 different strokes, if mixing by hand) Place in a 16:9 silver baking dish and give to writer / director Gary Wood to bake. What you have is an excellent movie that will keep you laughing out loud from start to finish.<br /><br />A story about a father (Woody) who loves his son that has been stricken with a terminal illness. They both have precious memories of seeing the StarWars movies with each other. His son makes a last request for his father to continue to go see the movies without him and remember him when he does. Woody is dragged to Indianapolis by his best friend (Hank) to a StarWars convention with a goal to talk to George Lucas (played by George Starkey) and get him to never stop making StarWars movies. Along the way Hank winds up, somehow, in the most hilarious scenarios you can imagine and learns what it will truly take to fulfill his son's wish.<br /><br />Doesn't sound like a comedy you say. Well, that's where the brilliance of Gary Wood comes into play and you'll just have to go see the movie to see how he does it! When the credits hit I couldn't believe that nearly an hour and forty-five minutes had gone by. To me that says it all - See you at the movies !!!
