If you are strong willed and can force yourself into an open state of mind, than you are sure to appreciate anything John Waters has done. "Mondo Trasho" is a very early and amateur looking movie, shot on a 16mm camera with a 'silent film' - exploit-type of style. It is basically dialogue free. Not nearly as shocking as, say "Pink Flamingos" or "Female Trouble", though it is strange enough to hold your attention. Mary Vivian Pearce plays a woman who is accosted by a foot fetishist in a park and undergoes a bizarre sexual encounter while envisioning herself in a possible flashback of a Cinderella-like scenario. This is all normal looking in comparison to Divine's role when he accidentally hits Pearce with his car and attempts to take her to the hospital. They end up locked in a mental asylum with a topless tap dancer where Divine repents to the Virgin Mary before they escape and make their way to the hospital where a whacked out surgeon butchers his patients. "Mondo Trasho" is definitely an unusual cult film with some irreverent symbolism and flat out disjointed insanity such as the opening scene depicting chicken execution. I'd recommend it to die hard John Waters fans but otherwise it's a bit dull.
