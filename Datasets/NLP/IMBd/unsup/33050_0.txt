They should have called this movie "Angry women ride off of a cliff after committing crimes." This movie was really bad. An extremely anti-male bent that would make any hair-brained empowered western female smile.<br /><br />The film contains a bunch of petty "women get even" instants. The funny thing is since "oppression of women" is largely a myth they really should not be getting even for anything. The movie seems to keep in line with reality when it comes to women seeking revenge over imagined slights.<br /><br />Now men on the other hand should be thinking about getting even since we have been treated horribly by women for years. They should make a film called "Tom and Jack" where men go around breaking the law and acting crazy. The only thing is that movie would be over in 15 minutes since the law would react viciously to any man doing what these women did.
