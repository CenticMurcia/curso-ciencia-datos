This is a very very outright bold show. Mostly consists of toilet humor that seems to so very common today. The very first show I seen, had the characters burping/belching, and flatulence/farting as they were laughing about it all. If that is okay with you parents let the kids watch, if not.. I suggest something else. As far I as I am concerned this show belongs on Adult Swim on Cartoon Network. This show along with some others are not for children. But that is up to the parents to decide. I can think of so many other shows that could be better suited for children, no matter how you look at a television show, there will be some sort of negative that you will find. Be it violence, toilet humor, sexual innuendos.. etc. <br /><br />The final say here, is you the parent.
