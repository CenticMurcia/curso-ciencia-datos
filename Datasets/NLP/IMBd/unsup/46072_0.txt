Rice paper thin story and non-existent character development. Despite the fact the story took place in a potentially rich environment there was nothing rich about it. I don't even understand why some characters were even in the film. John Cleese's "Mercury" seemed to only exist to provide shlocky sight gags for Tim Curry's gang of Nazi Falcons. Yoddling is a torture technique, oh my, hilarious, my sides are just splitting.<br /><br />Sorry, kids are more sophisticated than this. This is entertaining for no one. Oh, and the animation? Dull. Lots of work with a really pedestrian results. Look like a college student's first film. Lotta work and technique, but little inspiration. This is definitely a product of Disney's long trip down the hopper.
