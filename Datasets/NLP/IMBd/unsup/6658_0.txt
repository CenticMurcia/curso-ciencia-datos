National references and debates of explicitness aside, this film has some very interesting uses of photography. The director creates spaces with an unreal or detached feel to them (thanks in a large way to the way the sound is used), which perhaps allude to the unreal place the main character inhabits at that time in his mind. <br /><br />Surprisingly, there are also a few touches of humour (two incidents in particular involving passengers in cars), which serve to break up some a monotony which could develop around what is a very bleak picture. <br /><br />In conclusion, not spectacular, but a promising turn in the development of this director, in what is an interesting study on the extremes of desire.
