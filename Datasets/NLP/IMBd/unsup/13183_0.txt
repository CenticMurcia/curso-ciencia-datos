Well, kinda lost for words... if you are a true horse lover (or maybe own horses) get this movie. If you despise horses: leave it on the shelve. But this film has everything: the love of a young girl for a broken down horse is so intense, you'll be in no time right in the middle of this movie. And the finale is so.... wait, I don't spoil it. You gotta see it to believe it! 10 out of 10. (or maybe even higher!)<br /><br />I had seen this movie in the cinemas and I just had to see this one, but I could not find it. They only had the (terribly dubbed!) dutch version. I browsed every store and finally: at last I found the movie, included was a cdrom with some neat demos but I only care for this magnificent movie.<br /><br />And o yes: try to run this movie in Dolby Surround: you won't believe you ears!
