Lou Diamond Phillips sadly signed his name to this train wreck of a "movie". Phillips does his best to make lemonade from this lemon of a script, but it proves fruitless. The unknown supporting cast laughably overacts. The writing is awkward & the characters are unsympathetic.<br /><br />Phillips plays a military detective, and former MP, who comes to the Presidio (the former military base in San Francisco that was closed and converted into a national park in 1994, not to be confused with the Presidio in Monterrey, CA which houses the Defense Language Institute) to solve a murder. His love interest, a female MP who looks extremely awkward in her over-sized uniform, proves way too easy, so it is difficult to sympathize with them as individuals or as a couple.<br /><br />The plot boasts TV-ready predictability, and the production was obviously made for TV- there were even breaks in the movie to insert commercials! What a disappointment. <br /><br />My advice...skip "Murder at the Presidio" and watch a "Law & Order" rerun instead. The plot will undoubtedly be more interesting.
