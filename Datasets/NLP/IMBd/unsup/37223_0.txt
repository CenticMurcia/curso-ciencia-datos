This movie is horrible! I can think of many different things to waste my $13 and I wish had instead of watching this movie. It falsely advertises, a "serial killer" which is actually a huge crocodile in Africa. The movie trailers portray a human serial killer, but it is the furthest thing from it. Everyone is assuming the movie is actually about Jack the Ripper, but it is not. Don't be fooled. If you want to see a man eating crocodile, rent Lake Placid. They are exactly the same. But much cheaper! Save your money! Worst movie of 2007, and its only January.<br /><br />There is nothing good about this movie. Enough said!
