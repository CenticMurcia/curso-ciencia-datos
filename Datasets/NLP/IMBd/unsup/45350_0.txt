I had high hopes for this. The trailer shows us what appears to be a very good movie. Tense and exciting. Upon sticking this in my DVD drive I found that the trailer in fact appeared to show a very different movie.<br /><br />Whilst I found the idea of this movie interesting I found it very very very hard to watch all of it. I liked the idea of trying to show this genre in a more realistic light and I expected more from the Documentary segment but alas no.<br /><br />Poorly scripted, poorly acted, poorly filmed. The special effects are good. But I feel most of the budget was wasted on them.<br /><br />Disappointing.
