i've seen this show first through a music video and fell in love with it right away because of the good storyline and the worked out characters that are complicated with many problems and dark pasts.<br /><br />the characters are mysterious and dark but you can connect with them so good that it is almost magical. you follow the story with the shinigami Tsuzuki Asato and Kurosaki Hisoka as they meet and slowly get a strong emotional band after a rough start there dark pasts and there enemy Muraki connect the two to work together to stop the evil maniac.<br /><br />the show has a good balance between the dark moments and lights up when it's getting to tough. <br /><br />you have to like yaoi to like yami no matsuei even if it's not shown that well in the beginning.<br /><br />there are only 13 episodes and in my eyes that way to few for such a series. the story can't possible be told in only 13 episodes and the last episode calls up lots of questions that aren't answered but even with this little minor downside is yami no matsuei great to see<br /><br />the show is based on the manga and even if it's so short it's a must watch for the fans of yaoi and anime<br /><br />the darkest emotions combined with love, friendship and great unnatural powers is incredible
