Like the first two this takes palace in Florida in the mid-1950s. Those "funny" guys and girls are back to celebrate their senior year in high school with more juvenile humor, sexual humiliation and ugly "humorous" gags.<br /><br />The first two were no masterpieces. The acting was pretty bad and the jokes were downright sick. However each one had some moments that made me laugh out loud. This one however has NOTHING! The plot deals with whether the boys (all on the basketball team) will throw the final game of the season or not to save their coach who owes Porky a lot of money. To put it mildly, that plot is as old as the hills. Also the entire cast of "teenagers" are quite obviously in the late 20s or 30s. NO ONE looks even remotely like a high school kid. Heck, they'd be hard pressed to get away as college kids! The "jokes" do have plenty of the expected female AND male nudity and have the kids laughing hysterically at someone getting humiliated. Also they play a very cruel and sadistic joke on Ms. Balbricker (Nancy Parsons). The thing is Parsons was such a good actress that it's uncomfortable to watch. Wyatt Knight also isn't bad as Tommy Turner. However Fred Buch as Mr. Dobish overacts to a truly embarrassing degree.<br /><br />I will say a few good things about this--it was reasonably well-directed and all the "kids" have good bodies so the nude scenes aren't unbearable. But this has a stupid plot and unfunny comedy. This one (rightly) lost money at the box office and we were sparred any more Porky movies. Even if you're desperate this isn't worth watching. A 1 all the way.
