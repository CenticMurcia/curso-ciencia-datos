There are many timeless issues and interesting characters in this first-rate melodrama. There are secrets and lies aplenty lurking within the respectable facade of Peyton Place. Lana Turner plays against type as Constance Mackenzie, an uptight mother of an 18 year old girl. Her daughter and her friends have their fair share of problems and conflicts. The characters are realistic, they make you feel for them and want to follow their development. There is never a dull moment and I can thoroughly recommend this great slice-of-life drama!
