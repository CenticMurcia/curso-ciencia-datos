You can always recognize a good movie by these elements : 1- good story with an interesting intrigue 2- great actors 3- a few young & promising new faces in movies<br /><br />This one has it all. The views are great, the ambiance is dark, the dialogs precise & intriguing, a lot of twists and turns, never really understand how it'll play out until the final chapter is upon you.<br /><br />In short, if you like police movies with some political twists & some great suspense and action, you're @ the right stop !!!<br /><br />Enjoy this one. <br /><br />Peace
