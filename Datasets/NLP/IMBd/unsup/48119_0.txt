'The Dead Next Door' is an ode to all things Zombie. A homage to Sam Raimi, Tom Savini and the great zombie-king George Romero; done on a next to nothing budget. Shot entirely on Super-8, and written, produced, edited and scored by J.R. Bookwalter; this thing looks and feels just like one would expect it to: Indie. I found the storyline to be about as entertaining as it could be. Zombies running amuck. Scientists trying to cure them by running tests (much like Romero's 'DAY of the Dead'), which end up being fruitless. Nice little original twist here too, a "Zombie Squad" who hunts down and kills them as in most zombie films, but this time they are roadblocked by a group of what appear to be leftist democrats trying to preserve the human rights of zombies. Haha. Not too far fetched in this day and age. Anyhow, this leads the Zombie Squad to a farmhouse outside of Akron Ohio, where an original group of doctors almost perfected a serum which could get rid of the problem once and for all, problem is now that farmhouse is inhabited by a cult of zombie worshipers, led by a Rev. Jones, no doubt a tongue-in-cheek dark homage to the madman Jim Jones of Jonestown fame.<br /><br />So it is what it is. A low-budget, ultra cheesy, terribly acted zombie gore-fest. By my standards of gore - my standards being Jackson's 'Braindead' as the godfather of gore for a zombie flick; 'The Dead Next Door' is slightly below average, but still having enough squirting blood and decapitations to keep me happy. Enjoy this film with some mates and a few pints.<br /><br />4 out of 10.
