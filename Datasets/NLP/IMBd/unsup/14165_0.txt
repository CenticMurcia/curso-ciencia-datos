I haven't seen the 1960's version of this, but this is still okay for me. It gave me the creeps I swear. The zombies were very surprising from the beginning and came as a shock to the two, Barbera and Johnny. And then there is still Ben played by Tony Todd, this has got to be a cool role he plays and very good acting too, as he plays the loner from the city who seems to know how to fight these beings. His acting was very convincing and dramatic and the last scene of him was creepy, and really frightening! And it does seem very faithful to the original Night of the Living Dead, the farm, the people, and the dad Cooper, who is mean and disgruntled, very intense acting from him. And his famous lines were great and went like "a way in is a way out!" or "none of them yo-yos has got a car! Yo-yos! Ya bunch of Yo-yos!" Classic. Recommended to all fans of the dead trilogy, which no longer will be one as Romero is filming another, and to those who have seen the original, this one has many more surprises, which you will notice, watch it.
