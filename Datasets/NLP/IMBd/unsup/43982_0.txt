This movie is pure MST3K fodder. How they overlooked this "piece of Texas trailer-park trash" is beyond me.(Please understand that in no way am I criticizing the State of Texas, just this bucket of rancid garbage that came out of it.)<br /><br />Anyway, my main complaint is that this "film" tries to do too hard to live up to the basic "renegade robot on the rampage" genre. Also, it has too much of EVERYTHING. Dialogue, bad effects, movie genres, and by far the most god-awful acting since "Laserblast". My advice: only watch this if you suddenly feel the need to be depressed.
