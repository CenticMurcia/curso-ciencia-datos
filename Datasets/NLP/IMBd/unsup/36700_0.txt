It is getting harder I fear for film makers to come up with new plots. This film has its moments, having Hugh Grant with his English accent trying to learn how to talk like a mobster was very funny, however the rest of the movie was very predictable and could have been a made for TV movie instead of a feature movie. I'm afraid I paid money at the theatre for this one and it should only be considered a renter.
