Both parts of this series were ridiculously good IMO. They were directed, acted, written, researched with what seems bordering on obsession of perfection.<br /><br />That being said...why the hate? It seems this is about as good a film you can make and not get any academy recognition for it. We're more than happy to reward the standard George Clooney acting genius that rivets us (Syriana, Micheal Clayton, Up in the the Air), the display of excessive violence and insanity (There will be Blood) or the Tragic Heartfelt Love that overcomes poverty (Slumdog Millionaire) But for some reason, we seem unwilling to reward movies that are superbly made simply because WE personally don't find their message appealing to our emotions.<br /><br />This story is told almost flawlessly. The only movie I can think of that accomplishes their story better is the Shawshank Redemption.<br /><br />The look into Che is also a contrast to American assumptions (especially today when everyone is clamoring about how we're becoming a communist state)
