This movie has some rough subject matter and some rough language, but it is a really good movie. It put real people in absurd situations. I have heard that NOW has blocked the release of the movie, but I couldn't begin to guess why. It is sad, tragic, and very funny. I have a very old copy I copied off the MOVIE CHANNEL, but it isn't very good quality now. I have been trying to clean it up and burn it to DVD without much success. I know that Turner Classic Movies listed it among their movies and it was scheduled to be shown several years ago, but never aired. Now they deny having it. I have been trying to find a good copy for years. If anyone has one or knows where I can get it, please let me know.
