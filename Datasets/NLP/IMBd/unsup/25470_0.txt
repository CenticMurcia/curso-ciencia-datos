Where do I start with this one? There is no doubt that this is one of the worst pieces of trash I have ever seen. No, I'm not saying that because I disliked it a little and I'm definitely not exaggerating. This is on my list of top 5 worst films I have ever seen. The production values are absolutely TERRIBLE on the Region 1 DVD. I had my speakers on full volume and could barely make out what was going on. It was so full of static that it made me wonder if there was something wrong with my television. The visual aspect of the film is awful as well. It looks as though it was filmed on a Viewmaster.<br /><br />It's hard to comment on other aspects of the movie like acting, simply because it's difficult to get past the disgraceful audio/visual quality. The storyline, however, is so convoluted and ridiculous that my head began to spin. If you can understand what's going on, or care enough to know what's going on, then you deserve a medal.<br /><br />I see several 10/10 rated reviews and I can't help but think we're being duped. There is absolutely NO way that this film can be rated that high. I respect others' opinions, but these people MUST be associated with the film in one way or another.<br /><br />It's utterly disgusting that trash like this gets released. People, such as myself, rent or buy stuff like this expecting a decent film and end up with a $20 frisbee. Stop releasing garbage like this! It's a disgrace to the horror genre and its fans. We should use films like these to torture Osama bin Laden if we ever find him.
