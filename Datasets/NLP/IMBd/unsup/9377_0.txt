The film 'The Fly' has one of the saddest story lines I have ever seen in a horror(Sci-fi and drama) film. Its about a man named Seth Brundle (Jeff Goldblum) who invents a Teleportation machine and accidentally teleports himself with a fly from one transmitting pod to another, which places the insects genetics into Seth Brundle, causing him to slowly mutate into a giant insect. What mostly moved me about this film was the sorrow and pity I felt for Seth Brundle and his girlfriend Veronica (Geena Davis) as he was mutating into an giant insect. To see a man who loved life so much and finally making it in life by meeting the woman of his dreams and by succeeding in his six year goal in inventing Teleportation and then losing it all by transforming into a monster, is enough to put a tear into my eye. I admit this film in many aspects was quite hideous, but because Jeff Goldblums and Geena Davis' acting was so proper and convincing, this is what made the film into what it is. The scene when Seth Brundle went smashing threw the abortion clinic window and then trying to convince Veronica (Geena Davis) not to abort his unborn baby as the baby was the only thing left of the real him, I thought was very sad and moving for Jeff Goldblums acting was so real and professional in that scene, I honestly don't think that any other actor could have played the role of Seth Brundle better than him. I recommend anybody to see this film for I rate it an 7 out of 10.
