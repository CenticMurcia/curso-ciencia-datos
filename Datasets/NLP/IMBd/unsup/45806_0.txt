there is NOTHING about this movie, absolutely nothing, worth watching NOTHING<br /><br />if you liked the movie, if you liked the series, do yourself a HUGE favor, do NOT WATCH this<br /><br />1) the music is terrible (cheap at best) <br /><br />2) the writing is so amazingly bad <br /><br />3) talking heads, rather than acting <br /><br />4) stilted acting, wooden heads reading lines from cue cards <br /><br />5) worthless directing <br /><br />6) INANE dialog <br /><br />7) the ending? insipid <br /><br />8) special effects? why bother, NOTHING could save this movie <br /><br />9) sword fighting? nope, people banging sticks together<br /><br />I really don't understand why anyone spent any money on this. I can't understand why the scifi channel broadcast this.
