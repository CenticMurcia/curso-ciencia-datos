Hide and Creep is bad. It is cheesier than a cheap order of nachos at your local megaplex theater. That being said, it is one of the better spoofs of the whole Zombie concept. Yes the plot is minimal. But the whole thing rates right up there with Shaun of the Dead. The characters are all very clever parodies of characters you have seen, or wish you had seen in much higher budget living dead type films. The snappy video store clerk. The bored and uninterested police dispatcher. The retired cop love interest. They even have the obligatory young couple who disappear while making out in their car at the beginning. And to make the whole thing more entertaining, they have the regular people in the town going about their lives while everything else is going on.<br /><br />The entire movie is filled with good one-liners, and comments that you get if you have ever hung out with gun nuts or rednecks for any length of time. The importance of football. Gun safety. Why Coke is better than Pepsi. Don't rent this is you are expecting a glitzy, high budget action film. Get it if you want to laugh.
