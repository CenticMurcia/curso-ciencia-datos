This was about as bad as they come. Throughout the movie, you'll continue to wait for a coherent plot, then at the end, a surprise ending that will leave you feeling empty.<br /><br />Not unlike trying to stand an egg on it's end for two hours only to find out that it can't be done (unless it's the solstice).<br /><br />Don't watch this.
