The first episode (Los Angeles) was the most boring. It had absolutely nothing to offer that was entertaining and I felt the actors didnt play very well too. Sometimes it looked more like a play than a movie. Also I found Winona Ryder exaggerated her character too much. But luckily after the LA episode came the NY episode which was the best overall. Very funny and the characters played very well too. Really gave me a good laugh. The Paris episode, well it wasnt that great overall. The Rome episode then again was a bit better featuring Roberto Benigni as the Taxi driver. Very good actor! The last episode played in Helsinki and tried to be dramatic though for me it failed as you cannot feel so much for characters you hardly know about. Besides the plot the movie featured some really great scenes and I liked the fact that everyone spoke their native tongue (the french taxi driver spoke french,...).
