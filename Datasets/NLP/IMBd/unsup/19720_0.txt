With some wonderful names attached to this film you would expect to see some great acting... no disappointment there. All the main cast were superb in their roles.<br /><br />So why am I not enthusing over this film. There seemed to be something just slightly off key with the humour. It had all the trappings of being exceptional but, perhaps it went a little too far overboard and became a little confusing - in the 'why did the Director want to do that?' sense of the word.<br /><br />The highs: Michael Biehn as the inept, would-be-killer, Bill, stuck in the closet with panicking Billy Zane's Insurance salesman and Bill's 'flatulent' best buddy.<br /><br />Dan Ackroyd in a wonderful deadpan role as 'Bob'.<br /><br />The Lows: The script - it was a little too flat and I am amazed the actors did such a great job given some of the lines they had to work with.<br /><br />
