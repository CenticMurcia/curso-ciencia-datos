I wasn't sure what to expect of this movie, but I had seen Secrets and Lies a while ago and really liked it. Suffice it to say this movie starts out excrutiatingly slow, but about halfway through character's motivations begin to reveal themselves, and things start to happen. Timothy Spall is great in the lead. He wanders around for most of the movie with a look on his face like his dog was hit by a car, but by the end you realize why. The last 20 minutes in particular are devastatingly emotional and provide the needed payoff for the slow beginning. A real movie about real people with real emotions-certainly needed in the current movie climate of idiotic chick flicks and "family friendly" entertainment. Go rent it, it's worth a look.
