I have given this movie a four out of ten.. it probably deserves a two. but it does have a few saving graces. I am a big fan of this genre, so it is difficult to make a movie that i think is so bad. However the plot is so diluted that it barely exists at all. I hear that it has been extensively cut.. which could explain why so many things are unexplained. The action just pops from one chase or fight to the next.. It's like a video game where you have no control. If you don't laugh out loud a few times in this movie then you have no sense of humor, and the end is a total shocker. Maybe they ran out of film. It had a lot of potential, but didn't deliver at all. What a shame ! Read all the other reviews and it's the same story so I won't go on anymore.
