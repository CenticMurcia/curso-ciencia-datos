This was a good movie worth watching. The theme was above average and acting was OK. It could have been a great movie if it had used a lot less jerky action camera shots, had way too many freeze frames, and reversals time shots that took waaaaaaayyyyyyyyy toooooooo long. An interesting plot and a unexpected nice surprise ending makes watching the movie worthwhile! <br /><br />If you liked Millennium you will like this, not up to a Stargate, but still a nice plot. Sean Astin could have been less whinny, and the British accents better if toned down with not so much pointless yelling. Would have rated it a lot higher if the lengthy, jerky, and dizzying camera time lapses were cut to a smooth one second blur like the One Second Watch in Trancers.
