The idea of creating a world that looks exactly like the old West is interesting but it could have been done so much better! Yul Brynner is in most films only a joy to watch but he never reaches that high standard here. Richard Benjamin and James Brolin also make efforts to make this movie better but miserably fail.<br /><br />A $1000-a-day vacation in the Old West is what Benjamin and Brolin will experience as the film takes off. One of the robots is played by Yul Brynner. Indeed as I said quite an interesting thought of a story but it's more or less not so entertaining most of the time with too much small talk.
