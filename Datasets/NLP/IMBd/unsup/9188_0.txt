This documentary film showed the warts and all frictions that were beginning to creep into the band's interactions. The film was initially going to document the lead up to a live performance, but seemed to lose direction mid course as The Beatles could not agree on what direction to take it. The lack of re-release on DVD is not an issue for me. I would like to see the original unedited footage re-cut to showcase far more of the impromptu jamming at the studio and the ENTIRE uncut rooftop concert sequence, all in modern surround sound. Paul McCartney has the biggest say in what will happen to the film, for now we all have to make do with old copies of VHS versions of the original film.
