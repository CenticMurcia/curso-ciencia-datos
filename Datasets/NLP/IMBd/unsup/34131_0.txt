If Todd Haynes intention was to lull us to sleep with the shallowness, closemindeness and already well documented mores of the fifties he succeeded. I for one can take only so much beautiful scenery before I start to get irritated from the LACK of a REAL story and "unstaged" acting. From all the hype of this film and hearing that Todd Haynes was a genius I really was expecting a lot more than a animated Norman Rockwell Painting. Really, Todd, you have a great future as a designer or landscape architect, but PLEASE no more movies like this. Nolie from South Africa said it much better in His/Her review a few days back "exquisite to look at but more than a little flat" and "stolid affected version of Pleasantville for the faux Hollywood cineast crowd, people in love with themselves as much as the film makers are in love with their product" I grew up in the fifties and their was more REAL drama going on in my neighborhood and in the lives of my family and my neighbors in a single afternoon than in the entirety of this "FILM".
