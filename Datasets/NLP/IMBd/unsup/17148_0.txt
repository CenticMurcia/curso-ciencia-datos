I got a hold of a VHS copy of this movie recently after watching it as a child over and over again. Evidently hard to find in America, this film depicts the story of Beowulf from the monsters point of view.<br /><br />Sort of your typical tragedy of misunderstanding,(which we all secretly love..) this film did a lot for me as a kid. As the daughter of one of those progressive 60's moms, strange foreign cartoons were always finding their way to our VCR. It's taken me almost 20 years to find a copy of this on amazon.<br /><br />This is just a kick butt cartoon.<br /><br />In a world full of imported 2 year old spoon fed animation, it's kind of nice to go back and see what cartoons where like when people were kind of just experimenting. Movies like Rock 'n' Rule, Twice Upon a Time and pretty much anything by Ralph Bakshi were tearing down the walls of traditional cartooning and challenging children and adults to get something out of their Saturday morning rituals. <br /><br />If you're a fan of indie cartoons, do yourself a favor and watch this film. It's not mind blowing by any means, but it is indeed a thought provoking little film, voiced very well and animated in a really interesting style. I have lovely memories of this cartoon, and i'm proud to own it once again.
