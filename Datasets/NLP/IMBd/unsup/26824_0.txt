SPOILER ALERT You, reading this site, know that this film is a MOCKumentary. I liked this film a lot, and really enjoyed seeing it with someone who assumed it was all true... or at least he didn't begin to question until well into the film.<br /><br />Tell them after if you must, but I think I would have liked it even more if I hadn't known!
