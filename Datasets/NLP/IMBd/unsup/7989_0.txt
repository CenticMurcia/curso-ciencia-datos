I was pleasantly surprised when I caught this film on the IFC today, well written, snappy and real dialog, as well as relevant.<br /><br />Good performances by Joe Pantoliano, Barbara Barrie, Bronson Pinchot, Jennifer Tilly, and Boyd Gaines(very amusing) as successful Hollywood producer, visiting his old high school friends in New Jersey.<br /><br />This film has reality and relevance. The usual story of the high school popular guy (Gaines) and his long suffering friend (Pantoliano) and their group of friends. Basically Pantoliano starts an internet column ("for losers") and people begin to respond, telling tales of their lives, layoffs, and family issues.<br /><br />A few very good cameos include Polly Draper (late 1980's "30 Something" TV fame), Barbara Barrie ("Breaking Away"), and Paulina Poriskova ( late 1980's swimsuit/Estee Lauder model) Overall, you will enjoy this film. It is sarcastic and real, and well worth seeing for any baby boomer's, as well as the rest of us. Highly recommended. 9/10.
