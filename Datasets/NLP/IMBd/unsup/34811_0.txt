A thriller about a college professor who, while moonlighting as a forensic psychiatrist for the FBI, receives a death threat telling him that he has only 88 minutes to live. In narrowing down possible suspects, he frantically seeks to communicate with a problem student, an ex-girlfriend, and a serial killer on death row.<br /><br />Like most "whodunnit" movies, this tries to be something new. It tries to be clever in its own way. It tries to be so original with the plot that it is all very stupid in the end. It needs you to suspend your belief at its most.<br /><br />This sounds very familiar? Oh, wait. These comments were from my review for "Mindhunters", another movie that tries too hard to be original. Still, "Mindhunters" was entertaining. This movie was not. Al Pacino is not an action hero anymore.<br /><br />Surprisingly, I expected this movie to have some action scenes but it had very little of it. Then about the twists and turns: They aren't believable. They don't work. They're just stupid. They are nonetheless very laughable.<br /><br />Al Pacino gives a decent performance in this film. There wasn't anything really special about it. All in all, this tries to be a smart thriller but ends up being a doofy, dumb movie in its own little world. If you're a Pacino fan, don't watch it if you want to remain as one. Skip it if you like smart thrillers. It's just stupid from beginning to end.
