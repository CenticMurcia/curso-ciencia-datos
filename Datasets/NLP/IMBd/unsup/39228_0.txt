I heard about this film while at the NY Horror film festival where the audience was told they HAD to see this intense & brutal movieand I read some reviews that called it amazing and grippingLIES! I recently became a fan of Gasper Noe's `Irreversible' and that was an amazing, brutal and brilliant piece of filmmaking, so this also being a French film I thought it might live up to the hype. Well, don't waste your timethis was perhaps the most boring film I have seen in yearsIt was boring, then briefly brutal then boring againit tries to be artistic but it's really just autisticit's not a daring brave piece of filmmaking because it truly makes no senseI tried very hard to find either the reason for the woman's actions or the hidden meaning in themNOTHING! Someone had a very good idea and executed in a terrible, boring, artsy, unjustified way.<br /><br />
