I think this was an excellent movie. It's hard to believe that this was not filmed in China the settings looked so authentic. The directing was very good. Richard Gere gave his usual superb performance and Bai Ling was brilliant. Some people seem to think that this movie was being too hard on China. I read some of the quotes that the Chinese actors made who were in this movie, they said the movie was being too lenient, I tend to believe them. Just because Richard Gere is a Buddhist doesn't make him biased as some have suggested, he is too gifted an actor and too much a gentlemen to let his spiritual beliefs affect a movie, his compassion sure, but not spiritual beliefs. Too many people think it's hate, but what it is, is his compassion. Just be glad we live in a democracy and have compassion for those who don't. I can't imagine what it would be like to find myself in a situation like the character Jack (Gere) in the movie - it would be terrifying.
