British man Brian Roberts (Michael York) comes to Berlin to teach English in the 1930's, at the time the Nazi party is rising.There he meets an interesting singer Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli).The bi-sexual teacher becomes very fond of her.In between there's the handsome and rich Maximilian von Heune (Helmut Griem).In Berlin he also meets people as Fritz Wendel (Fritz Wepper) and (Natalia Landauer).They're both Jewish and attracted to each other.Joel Grey is the eccentric Master of Ceremonies.The cast is absolutely fantastic in this Bob Fosse's musical drama.I read about two years ago Christopher Isherwood's Goodbye to Berlin, which this movie is based on.This week I saw the movie and they're both great.In the movie you can hear the songs being sang and they're all marvelous.I truly recommend this movie to a whole bunch of people.
