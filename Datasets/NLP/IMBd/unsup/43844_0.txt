This is my first review as I felt compelled to write to say just how bad this film is.<br /><br />The acting is awful. The direction is awful and this type of storyline has been done to death.<br /><br />What was Christian Slater thinking ? <br /><br />I always watch films to the end of the titles but I was sooo glad when the, "Action", finished, I couldn't bear to see the names associated with this monstrosity.<br /><br />If you have 94 minutes to spare, just go and stare at a wall, you may find it more entertaining.
