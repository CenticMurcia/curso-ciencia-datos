I'm watching this movie RIGHT NOW and have absolutely NO need to finish it. I already know it's another predictable piece of cinematic junk in the now regrettably classic formula of commenting on the state of modern dating via terrible comedy. There are elements in this late-teen comedy that owe debt to movies like 'There's Something About Mary' and 'Chasing Amy' and countless other better variations on the same theme. Why, you may ask, am I watching it at all? My wife has it on, and her tolerance for clunky comedies is much higher than mine. The only reason I even give it a 2 is because I like Prinze and Forlani...who are both dreadful in this poorly scripted, ineptly directed clunker. Enjoy.
