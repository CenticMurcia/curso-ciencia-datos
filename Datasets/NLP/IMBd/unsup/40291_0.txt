This movie was really bad, I think that the title fooled me because I thought that there would be at least more vampire call girls and more of a vampire acting but what I got was a bunch of boring sex scenes including a girl straddling a washing machine while some goof with glasses watches through a peep hole, a lady at a club watching the most horrible band in the world play with a guy playing a guitar with only one note and then she takes him back stage, or vice versa and straddles the guy. Then there's the red neck who gets ripped off by one of the call girls and goes after her at the head call girl's house and asks for his money back and they all seduce him instead. This movie was nothing but a compilation of lame skits, terrible acting and left overs from last years copy of Hustler and thats it.
