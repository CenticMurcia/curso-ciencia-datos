I just loved this movie! It was so interesting. I was bored one day, and I just turned the TV on to Disney Channel, and Smart House was on. I watched it, and the more I got into it, the more interesting it was. I especially liked the part when PAT became a human. My sister started to watch towards the end, and when she saw PAT become a human, she said that she looked very familiar. After the movie ended, I went online to find out who played PAT, and was surprised to find it was played by Katey Sagel, who I already knew played Cate Hennessy on 8 Simple Rules. I also found out that LaVar Burton directed this film. I already knew about him from what he's most famous for, Reading Rainbow. I always loved that show. Smart House is such a great movie, and I'm not just saying that because I'm in love with Disney Channel. I would love it even if some unknown person made it with $500 just for the heck of it. This movie is definitely satisfying!
