This is by far the worst movie that I have ever seen. The DP must have been blind and the sound guy must have been wearing ear plugs. The film is a sad attempt at a low budget film. By the looks of it the film budget must have been $0. The actors suck and the editing is ridiculous. Filmmakers in San Antonio, Texas are really stupid to think that audiences will want to see such a horrible film. I have yet to see a decent movie from a "San Antonio Filmmaker". Someone needs to tell these people that their movies suck and that they need to stop making them NOW!!!! Just because you get your movie picked by a cheap distributor does not mean that the film is worse a damn!! I had to return the film an get my money back...that's how bad it was!!!
