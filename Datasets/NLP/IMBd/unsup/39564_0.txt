Now, granted i only saw about parts of this film (as it is, my father had it on, and i was in the basement working on a project), from what i did see, it was just so grating.<br /><br />Perhaps this movie was directed towards certain people so they can have something to watch, and feel better about themselves, or perhaps it was directed towards the normal viewer so they can better understand the plight of the soldiers.<br /><br />Whatever, and whoever it was directed towards was irrelevant. what kills it, and grates on my nerves like a cheese to a shredder was the endless, and by endless i mean, scene after scene, nonstop cliché'.<br /><br />I get it, you know, coming back from "the war" and trying to integrate back into society only to find that a vast majority of people don't "get you". my father contrasted it to world war ii when the vets came home to a hero's welcome and star treatment as opposed to what vets come home to now.<br /><br />I wont get into the fundamental differences between now and then, not that it isn't painfully obvious, but it is true that vets coming home today do not get that same treatment.<br /><br />Off the plane, cheer and holler, hugs and tears, a week later back to life...<br /><br />But again, there must be a better way to tell the story without it being one long political cliché'! Either way, i sincerely did not like the movie. Jackson is as Jackson does and can do no wrong when it comes to acting. beil needs to realize that she is best when she is a comic book heroin type, and cannot by any stretch play a normal average house mom school teacher type. she is simply to much of a presence.<br /><br />Half Dolla'... i don't really have much to say either way cause i do not care for rap, and have not seen him in any movies that i would want to see anyway so i cannot vouch for him.<br /><br />sorry, 50...<br /><br />I don't think you can really take this review as the end all be all, because admittedly i did not watch all of it, but hopefully someone will get some use out of it.<br /><br />hoo...<br /><br />ray :-) (ps... that was a joke... you know instead of hoorah, hooray!...<br /><br />never mind...)
