A bunch of looser marines are sent to a remote island to diffuse it of bombs. When there they start to uncover a Government cover up that took place many years ago. It all seems that many years ago aliens landed on the island and proceeded to kill everyone on the island or something like that. The government somehow or other covered the aliens and their ship in concrete. The find out to much and are left on the island to die. Xtro 3 is a pretty dull affair that remains below average throughout. The effects on the aliens are fair until we see them jerkily moving about the place. the acting isn't to great either and most of the characters are really annoying i ended up hating all of them and looking forward to their demise. The effects of the helicopter attack on the other hand looked really good but its hardly a saving factor. The plot has been done to death the new setting of an island did nothing to help things along. The strange guy they find is kind of funny at times with is dancing and his rambling. The ending was just terrible. Pretty much a below average sci-fi film with poor effects and a done to death plot.<br /><br />4/10
