I saw this film on TV several times as a boy in the early or mid-1950s. At that age, it was a genuine sword and sorcerer fantasy. The weird part was years later when I'd try to explain the plot to someone. It was too complex and didn't make a whole lot of sense. When videotapes became available I tracked it down, bought it and watched it. It was just as strange as I'd remembered. It was also just as absorbing as it had been at the age of 10. An earlier comment about the quality of the movie on tape was accurate. It appeared to be taken from a damaged print and the subtitles are often unreadable. Still this is an interesting piece of film history. It's not for everyone, but for those interested in Italian film, epic blockbusters, etc., it can be fun. I'd like to see a good DVD version.
