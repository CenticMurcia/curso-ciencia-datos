This movie looks and feels too much like what it is--a play. As a result it has an artificial feel to it, and does not cut it as a movie. William Hurt is one of my favorite actors, but his prancing around his jail cell is painful to watch, and is a poor and uninteresting characterization of a gay person.<br /><br />4/10
