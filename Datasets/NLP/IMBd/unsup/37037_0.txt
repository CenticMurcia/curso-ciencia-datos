I've seen corny and cutesy movies before, but I usually have no problem avoiding them. This only caught my eye because I recognized the Sprouse boys and I saw it had Tom Arnald in it and thought it would be funny. After watching it I wished I never picked it up. It was more stupid that "The Stupids" I usually enjoy Arnold's comedy, but he was hardly funny and barely in the movie. If I had just wanted to see a sports movie just for the kids I would have rented The Sandlot. Now that's a quality movie. James Earl Jones(a great actor) is in that movie, but it holds itself up as a great movie regardless. Anybody who heard Jones was in the film and then went to see it was most likely not bored and wondering where he was until the ending. Arnold disappeared soon after "Just For Kicks" begins and only turns up again in the last scene. Some Tom Arnold, Cute little kids, very, very attractive ladies. this movie gets a 2 for being stupid, but clean. If it was stupid and dirty I wouldn't even give it that
