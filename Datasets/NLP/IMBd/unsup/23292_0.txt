I was actually a bit surprised to see a French film that realistically depicted the Soviet Union--particularly in the later years of the Stalin regime. That is because Communism is pretty widely accepted in France. So, it was nice to see intellectual honesty by showing how repressive and brutal Russian-style communism was.<br /><br />Sandrine Bonnaire gives an excellent performance as a French woman who agrees to emigrate to the USSR with her Russian husband following WWII. Stalin insisted all Russian expatriates would be warmly welcomed. However, once they arrived, most were either executed or sent to gulags to be worked to death. However, this woman and her family are allowed to stay--after she is savagely beaten by the secret police for being "an imperialist spy". Well, life is amazingly tough in the USSR and she desperately wants to escape back to the West. However, doing this WITH her son isn't easy. Plus it's made worse after she helps another Russian escape. After years in a re-education camp, she is released to her family. Fortunately, she has not given up hope. Will she escape? Will she be able to take her son and husband? Tune in and see for yourself.<br /><br />The film is extremely interesting and important historically--well worth a look by parents or teens (it's a little too adult for younger audiences).
