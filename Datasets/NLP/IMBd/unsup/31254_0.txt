This movie has a realistic, thanks to the way its acted, aura about it, though is it supposed to be an in your face, over the top comedy. However the movie definitely shocks the audience with its humor and doesn't fall flat in that department either. Some of the strange things that are happening in this movie most probably happened to everyone once in some degree in their lifetime, so in some weird way, everyone should be able to relate to the characters and events that are occurring, rather than just being shocked by them.<br /><br />But the makers obviously tried to create shock and awe for the audience with its controversy, that's for sure. It is as good as Clerks, not quite as Pulp Fiction, but about the same as Borat. Throw in Billy Bob Thornton with Johnny Knoxville and some Jim Carrey mixed with an angry Edward Norton and you get the feel of what "?" is all about.<br /><br />In short, it works well as an off the wall comedy, but works even better as a disenfranchised, controversial statement on modern western life.<br /><br />I 'enjoyed' watching this movie and thought it was really good for what it is.<br /><br />8/10
