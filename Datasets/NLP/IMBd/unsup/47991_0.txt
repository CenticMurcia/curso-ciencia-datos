I LOVE bad horror movies. On the whole, the whole genre of unspeakably bad horror films is typically funnier that movies that try to be funny, such as "You've Got Mail."<br /><br />But this movie is so bad, so shamefully poorly constructed, that I was not laughing. I was just bored. The whole time.<br /><br />Well, not the WHOLE time. At the end, when the leprechaun climbs up out of the well with his face peeling off and screams, for the last time, "I want me go...aah....ohh," I was laughing. And it was kind of funny when he summons his bag of coins from Jennifer Aniston's hand, and you can see the string guiding it over to him. Those are good moments. That's why I gave this film a 2 instead of a 1.<br /><br />Any film that is so bad that it doesn't even get unintentional-laugh points (except for two), has got to have an overwhelming amount of flaws. And this movie does. So everything works out.
