If your work was about to be shut down, what would you do? How far would you go to prevent it from happening? Would you blow up something? Or maybe hold a hostage? Not in my entire life, not even in "Dumb, dumber", did I laugh this much. From the very beginning to the very end. All I can say is that this was a brilliant movie, and I strongly advice people with a good sense of humor: see this movie.
