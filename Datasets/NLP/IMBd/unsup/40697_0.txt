I agree and disagree with all 9 reviews (to this point) on this flick to differing extents.<br /><br />This was by no means a classic movie. It barely would be considered a good movie. But I did watch it and I don't regret my decision to do so.<br /><br />Possible spoiler....<br /><br />The crazy twist ending does leave a little to be desired. A mental patient who 'died' and a weird mental patient outwitting the crazy rapist doctor? I know you have to be crazy to rape your patients, but the nutty patients outwitting the doctor? I had issues believing that.<br /><br />For the record, I liked the post credits little ending.
