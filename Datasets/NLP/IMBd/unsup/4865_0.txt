This film simply passed me by over the years and I finally was able to enjoy one of Woody Allen's great pictures about the depression days when most people escaped from the real world and were entertained by Hollywood and all the dreams that people wished would come true in their lives someday. Mia Farrow,(Cecila) played the role of a woman who was married to an abusive husband and a just plain Good For Nothing of a man. Cecila found her way to the local movie house and never missed a new showing of any film which came to town. Stephanie Farrow,(Cecilia's Sister) gives a great supporting role as a waitress where they both work together in a diner. Cecila goes to see the showing of "The Purple Rose of Cairo" five(5) times and something happens in the movie theater which completely changes her life and she has to face the fact that Hollywood is fake and unreal and real life is what really matters. Enjoyable film with lots of humor, sadness and romance.
