This is the 1hr 30min story about 4 guys that fell asleep watching a movie they never could imagine falling asleep to. Well this movie was all that it shouldn't be: 1.Good story 2.Good acting 3.Good special effects (well they weren't tha bad actually)Well anyway just a lame excuse for a movie, splatter movie, horror movie, you name it. The thing is: WE ALL FELL ASLEEP! Alright you get that? Not a good review for a movie when you can say that. 1/10
