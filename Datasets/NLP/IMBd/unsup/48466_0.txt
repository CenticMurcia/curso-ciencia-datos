Some may think of her as the first lady of exploitica, I don't.<br /><br />Oh my God... I must have been mad for handing out my cash for this ultimate crap-movie. Now I'm desperately trying to get rid of it.<br /><br />Avoid this film at all costs! But die-hard fans may still enjoy the commentary track.<br /><br />This film was totally horrid to watch, it's like clips here and there from some other crappy Doris Wishman films. You can forget about logic and quality. Doris Wishman is the most untalented filmmaker of all time. Acting is awful,soundtrack and the picture quality are utterly poor. There's nothing scary about it and the gore is like ketchup and very badly made. Parts of the film were filmed in Wishman's own house and friend's garage.The so called plot is about a female mental-case, who butchers her family and a few others.<br /><br />The commentary track on the DVD release was almost funny at first but soon it made me want to strangle Mrs.Wishman, irritating and selfish b***h! She actually made three new films after "A Night To Dismember" was released on DVD. She died in 2002, may she rest in piece(s).<br /><br />No stars for Doris Wisman's horrible mistake for a movie. One star for me, for watching this torture.
