This film would have been fun to fix as a Theatre of the Absurd. Otherwise, in its current Hollywood format, it fails. There's about enough material here for a good half hour.<br /><br />The good visuals have little to do with the story. Story? There really isn't one, which is fine, except that the director tries to pretend that there's a story. Furthermore, no one buys that the main character's in love with the Asian girl or even Keira Knightley. If the audience is expected to buy this, then the main character's a nut job whose weird logic tells him to build his wife a garden while he plods along, ever ready to escape abroad. <br /><br />Asian actors would be advised to choose juicy villain roles as Hollywood just doesn't know what to do with Asians on film. Alain Resnais adaption of Marguerite Duras' Hiroshima Mon Amour is an exception that is beautiful.<br /><br />Why would Hollywood waste its time trying to prove their love to and for Asians who know better. It's odd. Asians in Hollywood film are not to blame when a picture fails like this. Muddled thinking led to the mess on screen, which must have originated in the script. Did anyone read the script?
