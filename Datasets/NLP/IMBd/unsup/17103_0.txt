I would say that this is a way better improvement from The Crow: City of Angels. This film went for another direction. They used different music this time, a new theme. The setting is taken someplace else and the elements felt like it was from the first Crow movie. I'm not gonna say this is better than The Crow cause you can't beat the Brandon Lee classic. But this is right behind it. I thought the action was better than the second film. The love story is moving. I just wish that this Crow film was in theaters and not direct to video. Cause the cast in this film was pretty good. I'd give it a 8 out of 10. The Crow is a 10 out of 10 for me. The Crow: City of Angels was a 6.5 out of 10 for me.<br /><br />RavingHulk
