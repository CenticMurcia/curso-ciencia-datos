"The Visitor" was headed for greatness. It's unfortunate that it was only allowed to grace our television screens for 13 episodes. With such a high profile production team, established writers in the genre and an excellent cast, the show couldn't fail. All of the characters were quite likable, the plot believable (in an unbelievable kind of way), and the production value ranked right up there with any great sci-fi motion picture.<br /><br />The show unfolded with a mature spin on today's attitudes and mindsets. The long story arc approach was brilliant; it got better and better after each episode. It was this exemplary writing style that brought viewers back each week, not the typical "part 1", "part 2" gimmick of using a hair-raising scene at the end of an episode that some novice writers often employ.<br /><br />The actors were equally brilliant and entertaining as well. Their focus and enthusiasm toward the show and its message pervaded their performance so much that the viewer could relate and connect with their characters as if they were real people. I guess that's what it's all about, isn't it?<br /><br />Anyway, it would be nice to see more episodes produced someday. The fans all remain hopeful.
