I'm not a film buff of any sort but after seeing 'Right at Your Door' I feel the need to say some things about it. Even though this film deals with a very real threat and demonstrates people under panic moving with pure instinct, as a piece of film, as the story winds on, the viewer finds themselves questioning how much longer the film will go on. In no way am I attempting to belittle the plight that chemical warfare presents. What I am commenting on however is how Gorak seems to drag out the film to make the conclusion all the more effective, and instead of causing surprise as a twist should all the ending does is leave the viewer thinking, 'Is that it?' With bombs being so recently detonated in London and other cities around the world I can see why this film has been made; in order in investigate whether people are ready for such an event, or whether mass panic is an eventuality that cannot be avoided. But as a piece of cinema, 'Right At Your Door' begins to sag as the story is stretched out more and more leading to a very strange twist that in all honesty it could have been better without. I'm not saying that the story didn't work or that I wasn't shocked by the demonstration of how an event such as this could play out. What I am saying is that the story becomes lost in the search for a conclusion, for some semblance of an ending. It could have been a lot better if attention had been focused on the story and the characters rather than a bizarre twist that you end up waiting for, in the hope that the film can regain the energy that it has gradually lost since it began. A promising thriller that swallows itself up.
