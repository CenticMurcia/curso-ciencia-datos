How could this movie even have gotten released? I rented it on DVD today and did heavy leaning on the fast forward to get thru the bad acting, bad costumes and simply a rotten story that didn't connect. I was actually hoping the big bugs of the island would gobble everyone up to make this a half hour show or less to at least end the filming crews' misery. This one can't and shouldn't even be placed on the shelf for rental or sale let alone claim to be a pirate movie, unless that was the intent behind it to pirate/steal money from the public. Definitely avoid this movie, but if ya like bugs you get to see a few and they're the best part of the movie.
