I saw the cartoon 'Page Miss Glory' on TURNER CLASSIC MOVIES for the first time in about 10 or 15 years and it brought back for me good memories of when I was a kid and a rushed home because I knew that the 'good' cartoons were going to be on Channel 5 here in New York. This is back in the days when we only had seven channels, kids.<br /><br />Channel 5 showed the Warner Brothers cartoons and 'Page Miss Glory' was always one of my favorites along with the owl who wanted to singa about da moona and da junea an da springa and the one with the elephant who sang the 'Hut-Sut Song'.<br /><br />Thanks to TCM for showing this wonderful cartoon and reviving such wonderful memories from my youth.
