I had seen the controversial and hard-hitting Vera Drake from director Mike Leigh, and the critics liked this film, so I decided to give it a go. There was no real plot to the story for a while, just a gentle, philosophical taxi driver named Phil (Timothy Spall) who has a dry love relationship with his partner (who works in a supermarket) Penny (Lesley Manville), their daughter Rachel (Alison Garland) is an elderly people's home cleaner, and their son son Rory (James Corden) is unemployed and aggressive. It is when Rory suffers a near-fatal heart attack that the film really gets it's biggest interest (although there are moments of good chat before), and all characters are brought together to rediscover themselves. Also starring Ruth Sheen as Maureen, Marion Bailey as Carol, Paul Jesson as Ron, Sam Kelly as Sid, Kathryn Hunter as CÃ©cile, Sally Hawkins as Samantha and Helen Coker as Donna. The actors are great, the story is human and believable, and this is just one of those films that you can't stop watching. Very good!
