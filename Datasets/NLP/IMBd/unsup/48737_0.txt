Surprisingly bad considering the involvement of such great actors. Like an alternate universe Citizen Kane. In Journey Into Fear we see many of the same actors, but none of what made Kane great. Joseph Cotton appears annoyingly useless, instead of his usual sympathetic everyman of films like The Third Man. The plot plods along with strange contrivances. The relationship between Cotton and his wife does not sit well and ends with the worst scene in the movie. The only thing to fear in the movie is Everett Sloane's twitchy performance and the insane getup of Mr Welles. The bad guys are quite useless. Cotton is barely there. In short - It's not terrific!
