Started out funny enough, and I was exicted at the promise the movie showed. But it quickly deteriorated from there. I mean, the flick wasn't even funny after the opening sequence with Shaq and Dr. Phil in a saw-like peril. It actually gave me a headache, and I found myself wishing that it would just end. At least Scary Movie 3 (which ain't no Scary Movie) spoofed movies that totally deserved it, but they were good films. War of the Worlds was terrible, and so was the Grudge. Neither could go up against Signs or The Ring in terms of the quality of the films (Despite Signs' weak alien bad guys.) If you're going to spoof movies, at least pick some that are actually decent. Spoofing crap leads to a crappy spoof. Boo hiss.
