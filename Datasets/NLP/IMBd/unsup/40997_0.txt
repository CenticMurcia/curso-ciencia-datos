Something is off here. This show isn't working enough to keep me glued to it like, say a Lost.<br /><br />It should have great potential as we have new nuclear fears due to terrorism. A show dealing with this should be timely and interesting. As long as the story retains a degree of believability and is well written it should work (even if it's not entirely believable, as in science fiction with say, aliens, it could work if it was well done and focused).<br /><br />I guess I'm saying that the story is losing ground with each episode due to a lack of believability as well as no apparent focus. As for characters, I do not see a male character I like enough to want to be...And though there are some attractive females none of them seem very desirable after a short while. When a show is weak on both storyline and character development it's only a matter of time that I give up on it.<br /><br />To sum it up for me, I have watched eight episodes I'm not sure if I will continue on. I'm fighting the thought that Jericho is cheesy. Maybe the writing will tighten up and at least let me know if I'm watching something that's suppose to be possible. At present I find the story too far fetched and the fictional town and it's people very annoying! I hope that it finds it's center and gets better because I think the premise of nuclear survival is much more interesting now than just a few years ago.
