I just can't believe the comments I read here. Pure crap? Come on! One of the worst films ever? Pah!<br /><br />This film is good, well written, well directed, and really funny. What else can I say? It seems like whenever a film with real humour is made by a well-known director, it's viewed as bullsh...! While plain stupid comedies (Pretty Woman etc..) are praised by many, elegant and clever ones like "Road to Welville" are considered as crap... I just can't believe it.<br /><br />I feel saddened that such a good work is being flamed. Maybe it's because it didn't reach its public... Or that the whole purpose of the film is being missed by the majority of the public... Or that people think Parker should only make serious movies... I don't know.<br /><br />It's not the first time I'm so deeply amazed by the way a film is perceived by others, but gee...
