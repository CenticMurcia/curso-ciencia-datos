I love, love, love Coneheads! This movie has GREAT lines. The perspective of American life from that of an alien is SO funny. Some of my favorite lines...like when Primaat and Beldar invite the neighbors over for "charred mammal flesh" or when she reads a magazine and asks Beldar how he'd feel if she passed away (his answer is one that EVERY husband needs to memorize and tell his wife OFTEN!. There are too many to list, and so many that I think are better than what are listed on the page. I love the creativity of the story line. From screaming at the bowling pins and eggplants to rigging the pop machine to get "silver tender disks" to pay for the motel room. I've watched it over and over again through the years and each time find a new favorite part! It's a movie that grows on you from the start!
