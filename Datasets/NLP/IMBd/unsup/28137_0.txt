The fact that someone took the time to create this movie as entertainment is, quite possibly, the sickest thing I've ever heard. This is a "horror" movie? Really? It was actually made to be watched by people and enjoyed in some way? .<br /><br />I get that people have a dark side, that we're fascinated with the concept of horror and pain, and sometimes can't pull ourselves away from watching it. After all, it's just a movie...Watching something like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or even a psycho thriller like Rosemary's Baby, OK, that's fine. It's messed up stuff, but the "bad guys" are clearly just film characters, something someone made up (I don't care how much they plaster "based on a true story" across the Chainsaw Massacre - they took INCREDIBLE historical and artistic licenses in its production).<br /><br />Leatherface was left in a dumpster at birth, had a degenerative facial disease that caused his face to...well, fall off, and was made fun of his entire life. Harsh. As for Rosemary's Baby, well, we all know the Devil is the incarnation of evil...<br /><br />And the woman in this film? She was depressed, had some bad marriages under her belt, and too many kids to show for it. In other words, she could easily be a real woman.<br /><br />Wait, that's right - she is. Her real name is Gertrude Baniszewski, and she really did torture and beat a girl to death in her basement with the help of her children (and one of her daughter's boyfriends). I don't care how depressed you are, that is just sick.<br /><br />So congratulations to the filmmakers: you have chosen to make a movie, for entertainment and possibly profit, based on the real murder of a real young girl by some messed up woman and a bunch of kids. That's so great. I'm sure that Sylvia Likens, the girl who was actually tortured to death, is glad her story will live on in our memories, and that people will pay to see it.<br /><br />Some closing facts: No, I did not pay to see this film, nor did I choose to sit through to the end. And yes, I know how the film ends. Allow me to quote the last line, as the main character sits thoughtfully by the river he met "Meg Laughlin" (aka Sylvia Likens) on so many years before: "I will never forget the gift of Meg Laughlin, though I am plagued with the torment of failing again...failing somebody...But as she taught me, it's what you do last that counts." Uh-huh, of course she taught you that.<br /><br />You tried to find something positive about the situation, writers, good job. Too bad that character wasn't there in real life...<br /><br />Honestly, I can think of no good reason to watch this film. Mediocre cinematography, average acting, incredibly disturbing plot...If you want to know about the murder, just go read the news reports. But stay away from this movie.
