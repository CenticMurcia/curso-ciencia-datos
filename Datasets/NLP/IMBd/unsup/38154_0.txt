WOW!<br /><br />This was a waste of film i mean i look at the previews an d thought this movie was going 2 great! Boy was i wrong , the only thing good this movie did was pay attention to details, every tiny , obscure detail until u just loss focus. It had a hardly any character development and had plot at all , just a lot of random scenes put together to make an 87 minute film . my Advice if is for anyone suffering from insomnia , THIS MOVIE WILL PUT YOU 2 SLEEP! Also The acting was a little off but with a plot like this easy to fall out of character
