Robin Williams is like a spastic chipmunk with Tourette's syndrome. It's a complete shame that a wide release of a turd like this equals box office success. All members of the cast must have received their money on the dresser as the producers left the hotel room. I can't believe Robin Willims could be more unfunny. He makes Robert Kline look like George Carlin. Robin has replaced Jerry Lewis as the person who is most out of touch with what is funny. On the plus side, I believe the French will be unveiling a croissant for Robin on their walk of fame. Is Cheryl Hines really this desperate to work in movies. The only thing that could make this movie worse would be if Paris Hilton would show up and try to be dramatic and then she would be consoled by Wanda Cykes wearing a thong and looking for a Brazillian wax. This movie is not only a complete waste of time and theater space, it would have been an improvement if they just ran the trailers on a continuous loop for 90 minutes.
