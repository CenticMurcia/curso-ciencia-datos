I used to watch this show when I was growing up. When I think about it, I only remember it vaguely. If you ask me, it was an okay show. Two things I remember pretty well are the opening sequence and theme song pretty well. In addition to that, everyone was ideally cast. Also, the writing was okay. The performances were okay, too. I hope some network brings it back so I can see every episode. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that I'll always remember this show in my memory forever, even though I don't think I've seen every episode. Now, in conclusion, if some network ever brings it back, I hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good.
