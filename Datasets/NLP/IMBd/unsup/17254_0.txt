This little movie was a total delight. It had a great story line, was well acted and had a strong message while being poignant and humorous. The story of a 5th grader at an all boys Catholic school on a mission to find God is extremely funny, witty and compelling at the same time. This movie will make you run the gamut of emotions; you'll laugh, cry and at the end be satisfied that yes, there is indeed a God. Joshua's mission includes his discovery of life around him and for the first time he notices the wherefore's and why's of his family, friends and life in general. I found this movie to be very moving, so much so that I bought the DVD and am passing it around to friends and family. I give it my highest recommendation and know anyone who watches it won't be disappointed.
