This movie is really bad!!! We just rent it yesterday and I was pretty disappointed. I thought by the title and the cover that it would be a little scaring and funny but...<br /><br />Come on, the first 30 minutes are so boring!!!! The actors are the worst that I've ever seen play in a movie. The horror scenes are bad most of the time. I mean, it is a movie that will scare a 8 years old kid, but not adult. It is gore???? Maybe but a cheap gore. You can't relate to any character because of the bad acting and because they all seems odd. You wish that everyone die at the end. The horror scenes could have been great but it was poorly directed.<br /><br />Did I laugh? Yes. I laugh about the stupidity of the character and because of some great quotes. But it did not help me to like it. I wished that it would end quickly.<br /><br />My vote? 1/10
