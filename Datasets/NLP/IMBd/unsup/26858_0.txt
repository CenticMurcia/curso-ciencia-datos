Storywise, this film is perfect. Seriously, this is more or less the exact story i wish movies told. I don't know why there aren't more movies like it, really. Not only is it by far my favorite "twentysomething mopey slacker" movie (the only good one, really), but it ranks up there in the tragic love story department as well. Unfortunately, in terms of actual "filmmaking" the story isn't really done justice, although it's not so bad that it really weakens the film significantly. The cinematography and so on is competent but never really inspired. Pretty bland (some nice lighting though at parts). And the pace and tone are somewhat uneven, particularly towards the beginning. The film starts pretty choppy, narratively speaking, and at first it goes way too fast. Eventually it settles into a good groove though and towards the later part of the film the pace has adjusted itself comfortably. It also focuses tone-wise as the film progresses. At first the tone is a little haphazard and there are some attempts at cuteness and quirkiness that don't go over so well. The soul of the film is clearly a drama and not a comedy, and the director seemed to realize this part of the way through. But it's safe to say that overall the moments of greatness far outweigh the few awkward, misdirected moments. And in any case, i like the story enough that it can carry almost anything.
