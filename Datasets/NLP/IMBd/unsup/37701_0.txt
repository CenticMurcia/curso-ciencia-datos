My guess is that the only way this film got made was because Lawrence Tierney was the uncle of the writer/director/lead actor of this thing. The elder Tierney sounded awful and it comes as no surprise that he passed away not long after this was made.<br /><br />The whopper of a plot is a joke. Two slackers don't work and they are getting evicted from their apartment. They throw a lame party and trash the place. That is it. I mean...really, really it. The "script" consists of non-stop swearing, plenty of drinking and drug use, and bad parts culled from other bad films. In one scene a guy pours beer in his cereal instead of milk. Seen that before. There's also the part where beer is referred to as the "breakfast of champions". Seen that before. They even included the crusty old gag where some girl totally chews out a guy and the guy's pal says, "I think she likes you." Morons.<br /><br />My guess is that the people who gave this a 10 were intimately involved with the making or distribution of this picture. I really can't even think of one nice thing to say about "Evicted" so that I don't sound totally negative. Shannon Elizabeth couldn't even be called a supporting actress in this. She literally only has a handful of lines and is barely seen at all. To prominently place her on the cover of the DVD is completely false advertising and the people at York Entertainment are crummy for tricking consumers. 1/10
