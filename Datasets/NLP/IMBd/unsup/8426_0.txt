How badly can you ruin a great story of post-apocalyptic America? Zelaney's book, though not his best, was a good read. But this film mangles everything that was good about the concept. As I said, the vehicle, which appears to be real, is totally cool, the nuclear maligned sky is great. EVERYTHING else is just pathetic. Pass this lemon by and don't look in the rear view mirror. A "2" only for the "truck" and the sky. This should be remade. It could be a huge winner with a GOOD script, decent acting, today's CG along the lines of "Twister" "Dantes Peak" or "The Day After Tomorrow". Roger Z could be made proud if somebody could come up with a decent script from his "Damnation Alley".
