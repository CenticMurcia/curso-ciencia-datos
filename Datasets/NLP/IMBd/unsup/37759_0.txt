First of all, I have to say to all of you that I haven't seen the anime. So if you're looking for a review that compares this with the anime, then just skip this. This movie came as a disappointment to me. I could easily see that this movie is influenced by Japanese cartoons. The main reason for that, is that the movie is really violent, bloody and brutal. The fights are really hardcore. Unfortunately, they are not very good. Daniels isn't anywhere near his best in this movie. The movie makes him act more than he usually does, and that's a failure since he can't act. It's the fighting that makes him so great, and when the fight scenes didn't deliver, there was so no hope for this movie. --An unintentional comedy because of a stupid story and lame characters.--
