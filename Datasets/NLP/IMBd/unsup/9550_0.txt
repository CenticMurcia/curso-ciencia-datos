I am not usually a big fan of experimental films but this movie is now one of my all time favorites. This movies has everything; action, comedy, horror, romance, philosophy... you name it. With 5 original and different stories to follow, even if you don't like one aspect of this film, another is sure to catch your fancy.<br /><br />Being a Japanese film this movie has the trademark Japanese type humor, so if you are into random comedy, you should enjoy this film. Even if thats not your style of humor I recommend you check out this movie just as a refreshing change from the typical Hollywood style<br /><br />Most important though, just have fun with this film; I have read reviews that try to analyze and put meaning to the different events of this film. Why do some people always need to find a moral to every story? I suppose there are ideas to be taken away from this movie, but don't try and analyze it too much, just enjoy it.
