1. What was this earth-shattering paper about? Why did Robert need Catherine to work on it? What techniques made it so hip and prove whatever it was trying to prove?<br /><br />2. "I feel like I could crack open. Like an egg, or one of those really smelly French cheeses that ooze everywhere when you cut them." Gag!<br /><br />3. Robert complains that Catherine didn't get up until noon. If you take care of someone, as she is supposedly doing, you are on their schedule, not yours!<br /><br />4. Catherine is a narcissistic, self-absorbed whiner who doesn't deserve anyone's sympathy.<br /><br />5. Jake Gyllenhaal. How this guy gets work is beyond me! I never bought he could add 2 + 2, much less, was a math whiz! But I did buy he'd bang Catherine so he could make off with the old man's "sh*t" to "write my ticket"!<br /><br />6. Claire's determination to convince Catherine that she's nuts and put her in the loony bin. What's in it for her?<br /><br />7. Who knew mathematicians are a bunch of drugged-out wack jobs? Sophie Germain must be spinning in her grave!
