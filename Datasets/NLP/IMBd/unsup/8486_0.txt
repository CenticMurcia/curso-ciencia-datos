I cant find any obvious flaws with anything in this superb Batman film with a fast-paced story that never gets boring.<br /><br />the animation is completely stylized just like in "Sin city" which of course look perfect in a Batman movie. The script might be silly and childlike at times but it's hardly noticeable and I find myself thinking how a simple story like this can be both interesting, smart and above all very emotional.<br /><br />The amount of violence couldn't be better it walks a fine line between being a serious action-thriller and just a good cartoon which in my opinion makes it timeless.<br /><br />Speaking of timeless the music should get every award i could possibly get because this is THE best part of the movie and if i find the soundtrack I will buy it for sure.<br /><br />I shall wrap this up by saying that this is a movie no ACTION fan should miss because of its brilliant cinematography, tempo and the excellent orchestral score by Shirley Walker. just do yourself a favor see this movie NOW I promise you that you will LOVE it.
