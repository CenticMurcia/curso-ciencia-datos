I saw this movie when I was a little kid. It's about a crippled man that builds a suit that allowed him to walk and he ended up trying to be a crime fighter. He almost looks like a walking red bullet or missile. He had one weakness, a lack of air in the power suit. For some reason I really thought this movie was cool. By the way, the suit was bullet proof. I would love to see this movie on Mystery Science Theater 3000.<br /><br />BGR
