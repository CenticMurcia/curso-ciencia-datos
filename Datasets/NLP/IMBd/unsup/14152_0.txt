MY GYM PARTNER'S A MONKEY is an odd show featuring talking animals and a boy named Adam Lion.<br /><br />Anywho, I got bored one time so I decided to go to Channel 36 which over here is Cartoon Network. And this show happened to be on and I seemed to enjoy it. It's slightly funny, but keep you watching.<br /><br />I usually don't like the new shows on Cartoon Network except Camp Lazlo (only a slight bit), The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy, and this show. Also, I usually don't like children television shows because it's lack of cussing, violence, etc.. But this one was okay.<br /><br />I recommend this for parents to show their children if they are not too old to watch it and still think children shows are funny.. like the simple bong on the head or tripping..
