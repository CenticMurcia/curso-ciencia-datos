Curious how so many people view this movie in the narrowest of terms, e.g. as an study/attack on "male aggression", as a comment on the personalities/politics of Serbs, & similar self-serving ideologic simplifications. I see this as a basic & pure allegory on the human condition. It could be Ireland or Zambia or a dozen other places, past, present & future. People love to kill people (& every other available living thing as well - see the article in the NY Times today about the devastation of gorilla & elephant populations in the former Congo). Serbians are better than most at depicting this because they're that much closer to the event. But none of us is terribly far from the ultimate human condition. We just pretend to be more civilized. This is a very good movie. Now watch Underground made a few years earlier with many of the same actors.
