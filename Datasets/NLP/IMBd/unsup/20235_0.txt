Rize is a documentary about "Krumping and "Clowning". Its not about Anger Its not about being "ghetto" or "hood" like many people perceive when they see this movie. You don't see this type of movie, you Experience it.Rize is about staying positive in a not so perfect world. The youth in the masterpiece of a film are amazing.Talented,good hearted and intelligent, they are all definitely the stars of this movie. The movie is not all about the fancy dancing that you see, it is about the reasons behind the dancing. All that I'm trying to say is that this movie has a "spirit" This movie has heart. And if you are open-minded enough to leave this film grasping that you will have a new outlook on a number of things and possibly a new outlook on life. I have watched this movie over 15 times now and it will always be my favorite. Not only is it all of the above, Its gut busting hilarious at times, Extremely entertaining, and all around fun. Watch it,Experience it. Share it.
