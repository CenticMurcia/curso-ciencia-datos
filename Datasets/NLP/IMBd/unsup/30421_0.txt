My Favorite Year is my favorite movie. After reading about this movie, I put my movie on my DVD player to observe a few details and wound up sitting through the whole movie, enjoying it from start to finish. And the following evening, I had to watch the movie again.<br /><br />The beginning with the outline of New York City as Nat King Cole's "Stardust" played, was truly a magical combination, a high point with even more high points to come! Just what was it that made this movie so funny and so enjoyable? Was it the swash buckling washed out Alan Swann (played by Peter O"Toole) as he moved from one situation after another? Or was it Benjy Stone (Mark Linn-Baker) as he tried unsuccessfully to keep Swann out of trouble, only to wind up becoming an involuntary accomplice to Swann's wild schemes, and realizing that he was actually enjoying himself, having every bit as much fun as Swann? Maybe it was King Kaiser (Joseph Bologna), with his outrageous outbursts and unreasonable demands. King Kaiser's writing staff with those connivers, ready to tell their boss off, only to turn into a team of cowardly "yes-men", the moment he showed up, is worth its weight in gold.<br /><br />Maybe it was the performance of Cameron Mitchell as Karl Rojeck as he had that face off with King Kaiser?<br /><br />Come to think of it, the correct answer here is "all of the above"! It was sad, though, to see Selma Diamond, with that cigarette dangling out of her mouth, knowing that within 3 years, her smoking would turn her into the "Late Selma Diamoind" as lung cancer would claim yet another life.<br /><br />The use of equipment used in the late 1950s as opposed to equipment used in 1954, is on little or no relevance unless you've been working in a television studio since the early 1950s. While a lot of work was put into the styles and fashions of the time, leaving no detail overlooked, I couldn't help noticing that some of the men wore their hair a little too long for the time. <br /><br />But for crying out loud! This movie is a comedy, not a history lesson! Just sit back amid enjoy this movie, again, and again, and again, like I have!
