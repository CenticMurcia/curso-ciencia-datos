UN CHANT D'AMOUR is the only film made by the controversial French poet and playwright, Jean Genet. Upon the release of this film, it was to be banned from exhibition in France. But everything I needed to know I learned from banned movies.<br /><br />The film itself is only 24 minutes long and silent. It's simply a testament of Genet's own incarceration and homosexual desires. In UN CHANT D'AMOUR, two men trapped behind prison walls find unusual ways of communication, and have erotic sexual fantasies about each other, whilst a prison guard watches them.<br /><br />This is definitely a must see simply because of its history, and its future impact on the underground movement of the 1960s. Yes, it is homo-erotica, and you might be repulsed by the imagery, but if anything, UN CHANT D'AMOUR is more or less a scathing look at the prison system, showing how abused prisoners can feel.<br /><br />Interesting note: Jean Genet was a petty thief himself, but was saved from incarceration by the director Jean Cocteau because of a poem he wrote. UN CHANT D'AMOUR is an interesting film by an interesting filmmaker.
