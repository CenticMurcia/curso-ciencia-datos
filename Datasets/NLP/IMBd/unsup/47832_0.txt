Honestly ,i was expected better movie from the people who played in that movie. Pascal Nouma ; you might knew him ,he played in various different teams in Europe and even U.S. till early 2000's. His popularity was outrages in Turkey due his attitude on field. Anyways Mehmet Ali Erbil ,Denis Seki and the other main actors,actresses are well known people in Turkey. The biggest problem is Cuneyt Arkin is doing cameo appearances ,he talked like 3 to 4 minutes during whole movie!! Yeah if you have nothing to do and just looking for small laugh ,this is the movie , i probably rank the movie 4 out of 10. Mehmet Ali Erbil is doing his job but he is just out there so much ; that creates problem for other people to not showin themselves that much.When i watched the movie ,it feels like i watched movie about Mehmet Ali Erbil. If you are looking to watch Turkish made space movie-check out Gora.It 2004 made movie ,it broke all the records.Cem Yilmaz whom i believe the funniest guy in Turkey now is in it.
