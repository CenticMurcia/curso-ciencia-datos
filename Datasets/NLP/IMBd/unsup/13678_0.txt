If this movie only had Meryl Streep going for it it would be excellent. But the performances by Kevin Kline and Peter MacNicol enhance the awesome portrayal by Ms. Streep, of a woman faced with a series of difficult choices, one of which should be unimaginable, but sadly is not. In my 40+ years of moviegoing I have not seen a finer actress than Meryl Streep. A word of warning, make sure you have your crying towel before you watch this excellent movie.
