I will admit that the description on this one may be a little misleading. It is not nearly as much of a supernatural film as it is a pretty realistic look at a couple of hardcore tweakers. If you want a ghost story look elsewhere but if you just want to watch a disturbing movie than 1-Ichi is what your looking for. For those of you claiming bad acting, no offense, but you don't know what your talking about. I'm guessing you've never seen someone on a 2 week binge. I have, it's not pretty. I've seen someone pull a gun out from under the couch and start screaming that someone was after him. I thought that these actors nailed it. Sad to say, I've seen people act like that. That was almost twenty years ago and just watching this movie put knots in my stomach. This is a b-movie and it is pretty much a window into watching teens spiral downward as far and as fast as they can go. For me it held a good amount of intensity all the way through. I thought the camera work was good and the different techniques often added to the intensity of the situation when required. As far as all the jaw grinding going on, that what tweakers do. There actually IS somewhat of a parnormal aspect to this movie but it pretty much left up to you to decide if it really is paranormal or just these freaks losing their minds. In the end it doesn't really matter though. Just don't go into this one looking for ghost themed movie because the focus is definitely on the violence and the social commentary. I thought this was fantastic for a b-movie.
