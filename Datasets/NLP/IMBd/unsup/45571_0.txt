The USS Britannic is off on a cruise in the South Pacific. On board her are the rich & famous and most of all jewelry and money. But where there is money, there are those looking to take what they can get... ICE T plays the leader of a gang bent on robbing the ship once it is far enough out at sea. However, he doesn't count on a security guard (DYLAN WALSH) interfering with his plans. He also doesn't count on structural flaws in the ship which cause it to take on sea water. The film feels like a Made-for-TV film, but the action is passable enough and the dialogue so-so. Ice T's performance as the chief villain is a little over the top, but okay. Walsh's performance as the hero just lets everybody know that you don't have to be Van Damme, Schwarzenegger, Bernhardt or Daniels etc. to be the good guy. Overall, a passable film. If you spent the $7-$8 to see Speed 2...spend the $1-$2 rental fee and see this! You might be surprised.
