Some of the best things about Thundercats were the obvious battles between good and evil and the blend of the different genres like Science Fiction,Fantasy,Action,Myth,Magic,etc and of course such memorable and extremely well written episodes. My favourite episodes from the first half of Season 1 are:<br /><br />Exodus: The origin episode,if you will.<br /><br />The Unholy Alliance: The Mutants crash land on Third Earth and join forces with Mumm Ra.<br /><br />Berbils: The first appearance of these robot/bear soon to be allies of the Thundercats and this episode is where Panthro builds the Thundertank too.<br /><br />The Slaves Of Castle Plundaar: The Thundercats free a docile race of aliens known as Brutemen from the clutches of Slithe,Monkian and Jackalman.<br /><br />Pumm Ra: This is an episode where Mumm Ra infiltrates the Thundercats Cats Lair and causes mayhem.<br /><br />The Ghost Warrior: basically a Jaga VS Grune The Destroyer episode.<br /><br />The Doomgaze: a good Mumm Ra episode.<br /><br />The Spaceship Beneath The Sands: The Mutants combat the Thundercats with their own weaponry to no avail.<br /><br />All That Glitters: Mumm Ra tricks Lion O and Tygra into fighting each other and The Sword Of Omens becomes shattered,so Lion O must get the Inflamer,a mercenary to reforge it for him.<br /><br />Snarf Takes Up The Challenge: All the Thundercats except Snarf are captured by the Mutants and are held in Mumm Ra's pyramid,so it is up to Snarf to save them.<br /><br />The problem with cartoons nowadays is they just are not interesting anymore and do not really have any morals to teach kids. Thundercats did just that and of course other great cartoons from the 1980's such as He-Man & The Masters Of The Universe,She-Ra and Transformers which all spawned toy lines and comic books like Thundercats did also.
