Although "Red Nights of the Gestapo" is extremely boring, poorly made and totally unmemorable, I somewhat feel obliged to reward it with a *slightly* higher rating than the majority of Nazisploitation flicks I've seen before. Why? Because these stupid films usually always revolve on sleaze and repulsive experiments in concentration camps, filled with perverted guards and deranged doctors, but "Red Nights" is at least a little more ambitious. The plot revolves on a Nazi (a typical one with blond hair and blue eyes) who has to come up with a plan to prevent an already plotted murder conspiracy against Hitler himself. To accomplish his mission, Werner does a whole lot of things that don't make any sense  unless I wasn't paying enough attention  like kidnapping the daughter of a Swedish industrialist, recruiting nymphomaniac women for the army or forcing a fellow officer to drink the breast milk of a female prisoner. What the hell? The absolute funniest sequence shows a doctor giving a scalpel to a female prisoner and commanding her to hurt herself. The scalpel is clearly just a red pen and the blood she licks is simply ink! Practically ALL Nazi-exploitation movies are total duds and not worth tracking down (two exceptions being "Salon Kitty" and "Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS"). They're the most boring films imaginable and the sexual footage depicted here is of the most UN-erotic kind. For example: in "Red Nights", there's a scene were a poor girl gets raped with a gun and some sick bastard even bites off one of her nipples! If that idea arouses anyone, they're in urgent need of professional psychological help.
