Great idea, even if it is Matrix-derivative.<br /><br />But, guys, if you're going to place a "carefully screened and selected soldier", who is supposedly representative of the "best" the Army has to offer, into a VR game, please don't turn him into a big p****y right away. I thought he was going to scream and run away when guns started firing. He certainly never got out of basic training, as he has no idea of how to conduct himself, how to survive in a hostile environment, tactics, weaponry, or anything else even remotely military. The military would have been better off just pulling a wino off the streets and putting him in the game. At least the wino would have been smart enough to find a cardboard box and get out of the weather.<br /><br />Very, very poorly executed. No evidence whatsoever of any effort in writing. Strictly a concept show.<br /><br />Not worth your time to rent on DVD...really.
