I love it! it's my favorite (and only) Daffy Duck cartoon; I'm not too crazy about him. And I'm not to keen on parody too...In fact, I HATE IT PERIOD! But I can make an acceptance with this great swash-buckling cartoon by Chuck Jones with animation by Phil Monroe; I love Chuck Jones/Phil Monroe collaborated cartoons.<br /><br />And since this short is based around the title of the story "The Scarlet Pimpernel," I would like to point out, that I've seen the movie version of "The Scarlet Pimpernel" from 1935 starring Leslie Howard on T.C.M. I had even taped it too, and I'm even thinking of reading the book too; I'm crazy about literary movies.
