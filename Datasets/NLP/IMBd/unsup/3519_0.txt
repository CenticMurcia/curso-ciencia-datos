While watching this film, I kept wondering how this ever made it past the pitching stage. I keep seeing the writer in the room saying, "But this really happened," for the plot appears to be a lame adaptation of some post-college celebrity's life experience.<br /><br />What actually happens in this movie is unclear, and not made any more clear by the jagged, amateur editing and directing which (maybe for the best) distracts us from the first half hour of the film. Thence on, the viewer is subjected to a reunion of college buddies getting together for the wedding of a famous friend. Doubt and betrayal appear and disappear magically, as in all buddy-wedding films, but instead of adding to the cliched plot, Best Man takes away from it, destroying the charm and levity of the original. What is left is nonsensical anger, contrived forgiveness, and a waste of time.
