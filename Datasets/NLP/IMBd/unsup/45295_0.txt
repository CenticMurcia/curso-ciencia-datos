Just what you didn't know you needed - an 80s sci-fi epic from the director of "Singin' in the Rain". With a cast of three - outer-space technocrat Kirk Douglas, wife Farrah Fawcett, and prim British agent Harvey Keitel. Read those names again. The movie opens with some peculiar choreographed stuff that looks like a tribute to the moon landing at the Oscars, and proceeds before long to an absurdly jocular Douglas-Fawcett shower scene. There as elsewhere, Douglas looks like he's having the time of his life - huh huh, I'm in the shower with Farrah Fawcett - only they're being MENACED BY KILLER ROBOTS for Christ's sake, and there he is winking at us. Farrah's blank 'oh my gosh' stares make for a dissonant counterpoint, her star must have been fading around now because we get some gratuitous boob shots. And meanwhile there's Harvey acting as weird as ever while he frantically builds/turns into a robot. There was some kind of money in this movie, clearly, and some of the flashing lights and stuff amount to a dream date for stoners, but it's still an 80s sci-fi epic from the director etc.
