this movie was an excellent bio pic about the martin and lewis duo. the movie was well planned and was so close to actual events that really happened. nothing in that movie was made up. jerry lewis was played by sean hayes. hayes delivered a wonderful performance and was very much like his character jack mcfarland from will and grace. the resemblance did not hurt his performance at all though. jeremy northam who played dean martin was an excellent choice for the role but i think a little more practice with miming the words to the songs would not hurt. all in all i highly regard this movie as it is so close to the truth unlike some movies which twist the truth so much. i rate this movie very highly because the story line was 100% true and the acting was very convincing. on a scale of 1 to 10 i rate this a 10. it was a very good movie
