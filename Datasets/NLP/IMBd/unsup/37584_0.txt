Well, in a nutshell, lots of no names with a soggy plot. Who are most of these people? The drinking problem storyline is way overdone! It was a good concept, but not enough attention to who they cast in the flick. I wish the cover photo was more detailed, it just looks like a scribbled drawing from a middle schooler with issues. There was some 'would be'scary moments, but its 2008, even youtube clips are scary if the watcher is caught off guard, right? Made for t.v, maybe but a motion picture? It's mainly D list at best. (maybe E, lol)I am not a pro critic, this is just my opinion. Don't get me wrong...I love horror movies, but this movie is a horror!
