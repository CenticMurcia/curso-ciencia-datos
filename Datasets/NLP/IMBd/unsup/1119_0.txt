Have you ever sat and wondered why popular music has become plasticized and oh-so formulaic in the last ten years? This film answers that question and more. Rosanna Arquette does a magnificent job of presenting a fantastic cross-section of musical artists from every genre. From Sting, to Don Henley, to Mary J. Blige to Willie Nelson and Burt Bacharach. Rosanna sits back with her hand-held camera and allows the artist the opportunity to speak freely about their art, life and the music business. An open and honest commentary that is sorely missed in this day and age. A must see for those who appreciate music or for those who are just getting started. Thank you Rosanna!
