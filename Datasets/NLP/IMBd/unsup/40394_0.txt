At first glance, you start watching this movie and wonder if you accidentally turned to the Idiot Channel, because you can't possibly imagine someone actually getting PAID so much to act so poorly. Is this what it has come to? Cheap hacks of real actors like Tom Arnold, and kid actors that made McCauley Culkin in "Home Alone 2: Lost in New York" ALMOST a pleasure to watch.<br /><br />If this is the kind of movie to which our children turn for entertainment, then I'm scheduling an appoint with my urologist first thing tomorrow morning for a VASECTOMY!<br /><br />The only ENDEARING quality I can give the movie is that Colleen Rennison makes the Olsen twins look like something out of a Wal-Mart circular, but it's not worth seeing the movie when you can see her cameos in great T.V. series like Stargate SG-1. I'm being sarcastic, of course.
