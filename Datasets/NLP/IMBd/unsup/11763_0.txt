CAUTION: Not a real spoiler, the spoiler is only the beginning so read ahead until * This is a great movie with more dog scenes, but there is still a thicker plot. I think it is much better than the first and until i saw the 3-5th movie on IMDb i didn't know they existed. The movie has great scenes of ADORABLE puppies. The plot is great with a story line little kids can follow and older kids can relate. *Beethoven and Missy (his girlfriend) are cute and the puppies are cuter. There are many things that will keep any age kids attracted and the growing up puppy scenes are GREAT! Moe is the funniest and chaikowski is the cutest (although they all are cute)
