I was unaware that this was a fake. In the US they made a big deal about how it was real. But than I recognized the actor who played the boy holding the camera. He was in an old show on Nickolodeon. He is not a well known actor. Even though I recognized him the show still was very freaky and scared me so bad that I had trouble falling asleep that night. It was very convincing that it was real.<br /><br />The video left you with a lot of suspense as it would just show scenes and actually leave huge gaps of time making you wonder what happened especially when characters started to disappear. They eventually re-released it again with scenes they were able to "restore".
