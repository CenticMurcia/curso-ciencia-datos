This movie is a shameless copy of the Pink Panther.<br /><br />A diamond is stolen from a family (Sener Sen's family), and two inspector Clouseaus (Kemal Sunal and Halit Akcatepe) are assigned to solve this mystery. And of course there is also a chief inspector Dreyfuss (Sener Sen) present. Sen hates Sunal, because in the war a hand grenade exploded in his hand and he got shot due to Sunal's clumsiness. Sen has sworn whenever he sees Sunal again, he will kill him. Suddenly Sunal returns in his live. He can't kill him because Sunal works for the police.<br /><br />The jokes are of a much lower level than the jokes in the Pink Panther movies. They are very childish and absolutely not funny. The people who made this movie, and especially the people who wrote the script, were uninspired to give the movie something that makes this movie different from the Pink Panther movies.<br /><br />There is scene where Sen has got two guns in his drawer. One is real and one is a lighter. This is obviously taken over from The Return Of The Pink Panther. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anybody, because the exaggerated acting of (especially Sunal and Akcatepe) the cast gets on your nerves.
