I love science fiction and Roger Zelzany was one of my favorite authors. Damnation Alley was first a short story and then expanded to a Novella (probably to make the movie from). Hell Tanner (yes, his first name is Hell) was not Jan Michael Vincent, George Parpard would have been better cast as Hell Tanner. In the book Hell Tanner was about as anti as you could get an antihero to be. I was a great story about driving from California to the East Coast to take vaccine for a plague. Hell Tanner was a motorcycle gang member and used to smuggle candy to the Mormons in Utah. I was so excited when I saw that this movie was being made because I had enjoyed the short story so much and then to see how Hollywood butchered it. I'm surprise that Roger Zelzany even allowed his name to be used in connection with this movie. Don't waste your time with this one.
