I think this is a very neatly made movie. Although the focus of the movie itself is on Lara, the audience is also able to get to know each character's personality (e.g. Lara's parents, and her aunt and uncle). I personally found the reconciliation scene of Lara's Father and his sister very touching (though a bit too quick).<br /><br />This movie encourages people to go and search for their own ideals and ambitions, and at the same time let them know that despite every kind of fame and riches in the world, nothing can be more important and precious than the love from your own family. Very touching indeed.<br /><br />The music used in this movie is breath-taking as well. Alas that it doesn't have a soundtrack (or does it?).
