I caught this documentary back in a repertory theatre back in 1992. I haven't seen it since but I never forgot it. It's basically talks with lesbian writers who talk about writing and having published books about lesbian lovers. Also they talk about what it was like in lesbian bars back then.<br /><br />Some people may think that this will only appeal to a limited audience (i.e. gay and lesbian) but I saw it with a straight friend and he was fascinated. The talks are lively and fun--there's no despair or negativity. One writer speaks openly about fighting with publishers to have her books have happy endings! Interspered is a sequence in which two women meet in a bar (no dialogue), go to one of their houses and has sex. I have no problem with that, but the sequence seems way too explicit for this. Still this is an excellent documentary about a subject that is never covered. How about one with gay male writers?
