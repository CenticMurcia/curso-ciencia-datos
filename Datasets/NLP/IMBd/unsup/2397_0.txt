I enjoyed the movie - the plot line has some twists and Bruce Willis is as good as ever. <br /><br />The only thing that spoilt the movie for me was the amateur filming - it looks at times as if the cameraman is holding a home movie camera. The swaying to and fro gives you the front row experience even if you are seated near the back.<br /><br />At one stage they are in a Chinese laundry and you find yourself thinking about the drunken cameraman and not the story, to the point where it gets confusing as to what is really happening. <br /><br />My recommendation is to wait for this movie to get to the dollar theaters or else wait until it comes out on DVD.<br /><br />This is not the only movie to suffer from this amateurish filming - what has happened to our standards of film-making? Pay the stars a bit less and the technical crew a bit more.
