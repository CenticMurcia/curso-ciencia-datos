***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** The movie is based on the famous in Russia novel of Daniil Koretskiy, who is trustworthy in everything that concerns Russian mob, as he worked in Police. I'd like to recommend this movie to non-Russian watchers as they could see the realities of modern Russia and almost real Russian criminals(it would be hard to translate Russian slang of convicted in English or other language), who don't sing songs about Mother-Russia, don't play chess a lot and aren't so fool as foreign movie-makers try to show. Still movie depicts Russian temper, people who act fast and don't talk much, hard choice between revenge and law - "is punishment equal to crime?" and how close are they? - these dilemmas has the main character Fox. And in the end he's waiting for the death or life,he's standing by the window and knows that there the sniper's waiting for him and boss of mob, Krest, drops the coin to define Fox's end.
