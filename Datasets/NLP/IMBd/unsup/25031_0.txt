After years of hearing about the brilliance of Bava and his contemporaries and the influence they had on modern horror, particularly slasher films (which I'll admit to having a morbid interest in), I finally watched this film last weekend. All I can say is, "huh?" Before I get flamed: yes, I know that giallo films are supposed to be short on plot, long on style. But I didn't get ANY sense of danger or suspense at all during this movie, only of a desire for it to be over.<br /><br />SPOILER AHEAD: Only the hanging death at the beginning was of any interest, mainly because every other murder in the entire movie looked as if it was doused in red tempera paint. There was almost no realism to any of the murders. The beheading was particularly ludicrous: there were holes in the back of the "neck" of the decapitated body! Sorry, giallo fans, but I just don't get what all the fuss is about.
