Now, there can be no real doubt when you watch this movie that it is absolutely awful. Bad as bad can be. Because it is. "So why oh why have you given it a score of three as opposed to a score of one or two?" you might ask. Well, the reason is that it is the most unintentionally hilarious movie that I have ever seen. It is listed as being an "Action/Comedy/Fantasy" which would lead one to believe that it is meant to be funny. I saw the version in which the mighty Arnold speaks for himself in his customary Austrian brogue. I have not seen the dubbed version so I don't know how much of the comedic value the movie loses based on Schwarzenegger and his dialogue being the funniest part of the movie.<br /><br />It's the parts that are supposed to be serious that are the really funny bits of this movie. Such as Arnold regularly proclaiming (with an even thicker Austrian accent due to him not yet mastering the English language) "I am Hercules". Having a weightlifting contest with Arnold Stang and pushing over N.Y taxis.<br /><br />I'm a huge Schwarzenegger fan. I always have been. But the irony is that in the late-1980's he felt the need to display "range" as an actor by trying to branch out from his heavy-hitting actioners into comedy with movies such as "Twins" and "Kindergarten Cop" but the fact of the matter is that Arnold for all his trying was at his funniest right back at the start of his movie career.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Arnold and love his inimitable manner of delivering lines. You need to see this. Ignore the non-existent plot and acting and just roll along on the river of cheese in a film that is so bad it is hilarious.<br /><br />Three is a low score, yes. But when you consider that this movie should have a score of one you know that those additional points are on comedic merit alone.
