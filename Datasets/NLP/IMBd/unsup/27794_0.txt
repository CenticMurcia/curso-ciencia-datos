Now personally I don't see what Anthony Quinn was squawking about in Larceny, Inc. Edward G. Robinson and sidekicks Edward Brophy and Broderick Crawford take over a caper that Quinn has planned. Robinson serves his time in prison and Quinn gets denied parole. It's not like Quinn took a copyright out on the idea and you can't count on him busting out of stir.<br /><br />Nevertheless that's what Quinn does and he does see things differently which is the whole basis for the plot of Larceny, Inc.<br /><br />Edward G. Robinson, as he did in a number of films, gets a chance to satirize his own gangster image and he does it quite well. This was one of his last films under his Warner Brothers contract and he went out in style. Robinson would be back at Warner Brothers in the latter half of the Forties with Key Largo which was definitely not a comedy.<br /><br />Robinson is the brains and he gets stalwart support from Edward Brophy and Broderick Crawford, two guys who at that time usually played simple minded lovable lugs. Brophy went with the flow, but Crawford was quoted as saying that he was not the world's greatest wit, but he always resented playing half a one. He got his big chance at the end of the Forties with All the King's Men and an Oscar.<br /><br />Robinson's adopted daughter is Jane Wyman and her beau is salesman Jack Carson. Wyman was also a few years from an Oscar for Johnny Belinda and Carson did break the mold of playing lovable blowhards.<br /><br />It's a pretty funny film, best scene is when Crawford strikes a pipeline in the basement and for a minute they think they've struck oil in New York City.<br /><br />And already refined too.
