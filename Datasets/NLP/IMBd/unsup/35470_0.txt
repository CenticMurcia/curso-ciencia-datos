Steven Seagal. What is there else to say about his recent movies? He's not just phoning his performance in, he just seems totally and utterly disinterested in even attempting to act his lines! He doesn't even do his own fight scenes anymore, because anytime a fight occurred, the cameraman curiously ensured we never got to see Segals face during the fights.<br /><br />The 'story' is beyond perfunctory, its as old an clich√© as they come, that in itself wouldn't be a bad thing I suppose if the rest of the action, acting, effects were good.... alas they are not even anywhere near! The music.... it took two people to write the music, and frankly, i've heard far superior music made as a hobby on computers from the 1990's! The only reason I even bothered to watch this 'movie' was because it had Steven Seagal in it.... I see no reason to torture myself with any of his future movies if this is the standard we can expect! Where did it all go wrong? Under Siege was a great movie, he even ACTED in that movie, here.... he's just not bothering, hence why I won't be bothering with anymore of his movies.<br /><br />Avoid... its more crap than you think!
