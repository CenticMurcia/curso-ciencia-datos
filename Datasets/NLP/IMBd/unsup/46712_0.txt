The 70's were worthless, a paltry shadow of the 60's, a hangover of a generation. What I got from this film and my moderate modicum of knowledge of punk was that you either became corporate or rebelle and had no cause, ala the punks. I realized the punks embraced dissent in the form of doing nothing, and embracing it. Their rebellion was an embodiment of what they viewed outsiders as. As paradoxical as that sounds it's as though they thought the world and those around them were vile, worthless trash, and took it upon themselves to become that. You can taste the grit of 1977, and it makes you feel dirty. I thought I hated this film, but I think that's the point. It's vile, and digusting, has nothing behind it but some images and scraps of ideology.
