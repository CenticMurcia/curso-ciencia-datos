As easy as this: "Girl Fever" is NOT funny. When a movie tries too hard to be funny , then it's a bad movie. The humor is terrible because it tries to be like "American Pie" but in such a not so funny manner.<br /><br />The sex related jokes just don't work and the rest of the humor is really dumb. The acting...oh the acting. The actors are really bad and look very uncomfortable.<br /><br />I agree with many other reviewers who say that this is a very boring movie. To be honest, I couldn't watch it until the end. I fell asleep but I'm sure that even if it was a good ending, it isn't worth the watch. <br /><br />Stay away from this not so mainstream teen comedy that tries too hard to be funny. Avoid it!
