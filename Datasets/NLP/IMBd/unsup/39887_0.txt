I have only been on this website for a few short days, and this is only the second review I have done. So why did I choose this movie to review and not more natural choices? Because this movie sticks out as one of, if not the worst film, I have ever seen.<br /><br />I loved the first movie - Eddie Murphy was outstanding. The second film was more entertaining than funny - but it was still good and the characters were strong.<br /><br />That's what made this movie so disappointing. The pieces were in place. John Landis was back.<br /><br />What they made was a movie so horribly unfunny that five years after seeing it, I still use it as a measuring stick for movie futility.<br /><br />I may have seen worse movies in my life. But after Beverly Hills Cop III, I can't remember them.
