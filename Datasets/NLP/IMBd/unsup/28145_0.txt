After just sitting through Jack Ketchums THE GIRL NEXT DOOR, I had mixed emotions, but mainly I felt extremely sad at what I had just watched. The film is a true story set in the 50's about a two young sisters who go to live with their aunt after losing both parents in a car accident. The younger sister got badly injured and has to walk with steel frames supporting her legs. But her older sister, Meg, takes care of her and in general is a really nice kid. But when they go to live with their aunt, things turn nasty, really nasty. The aunt is a really horrible person, she has all the local lads round her home all the time drinking beer and doing basically anything they please. But aunt really does call the tune, anything she says - goes! And as soon as she takes a dislike to Meg thats when the torture and downright cruelty begins. Now, I'm not going to go into any great detail, but what happens to Meg in this film is disturbing, but incredibly engrossing to watch.<br /><br />The acting on all fronts is nothing short of brilliant, the detail on the set is stunning, bearing in mind it is set in the 50's the attention to detail is excellent.<br /><br />How anybody can give this a low rating beats me - if you don't think you are going to like it, don't watch it - it is'nt nice, but it is an essential piece of film-making, well written, well directed, well acted - and devastatingly delivered.<br /><br />AWESOME...10 out of 10.
