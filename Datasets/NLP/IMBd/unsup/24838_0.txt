What a film, excellent is not the word for it. Suitable for the whole family it has you glued to the seat the whole way through. Maxwell Caulfield plays a brilliant part throughout, it is very funny and a bit sad it parts. It is one that can be watched over and over again and still have the same effect. My whole family absolutely love the film and have watched it so many times I have lost count. Maxwell Caulfield should make so many more films like this he is certainly great in this one, much better to see him as the nice guy than the villain. We hope to see him again on screen very very soon in the United Kingdom, we are so short of good actors here.
