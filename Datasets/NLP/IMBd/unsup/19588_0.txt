Bulworth is a rolling nervous breakdown, and we're invited to the last 48 hours of his until-now pointless life as a U.S. Senator. And C-Span is along for the ride as well, doing a "24 Hours on the Campaign Trail" feature, following Senator Jay Billington Bulworth as he spouts (and then raps) uncommonly frank (and decreasingly lucid) truths to his local supporters, and a nationwide audience. Oh, and he dabbles in flirtation with from-the-streets Nina, through her finding perhaps a reason to stay alive after all...<br /><br />The result is: some of the most laugh-out-loud funny scenes in the history of political satire; some very brash statements about American political reality ("If you don't put down that malt liquor and chicken wings, and get behind someone other than a running back who stabs his wife, you're NEVER gonna get rid of somebody like me!"); an intensely compelling (and very funny) performance by Warren Beatty; and an uneven but extremely worthwhile experience. At the very least, Bulworth (the man) is one of cinemas great characters, exploring a very unique arc--and that alone is reason to take a chance on Bulworth (the movie).
