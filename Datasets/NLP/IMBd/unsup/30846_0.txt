After the launch of the PSP, this GTA game marks the first hand-held game of the series and was one of the perfect buy for Christmas 2005. Rather than going forward, this GTA game is a rather stripped down version and uses the same AI and engine from GTA3 and is re done in an San Andreas style. The story uses old side character Toni Cipriani in a leading role where you take control of the city (but not to great depth) and complete missions, side jobs and other tasks available. There are three islands to wonder with new safehouses and vehicles to cruise. Radio stations are very good and I do enjoy great music from MSX 98, The Liberty Jam and Rise FM for all the wicked East Coast hip hop, House/Trance and Drum N Bass music. <br /><br />There's a new multiplayer option which is more expanded than the previous one that was introduced in San Andreas which gets it bigger marks in the PSP version of the series. There are some really good things about this game, the graphics are incredible for the small detail of the PSP, the sound is mint and you can listen to the effects and music from the city. Main disadvantage is there are somethings you'd feel they should have put in like swimming and air vehicles. That aside it's a great game and because of the 24/7 appeal of hand-held gaming it's what gives GTA LCS it's addictive and fun level. Inside the game itself feels big in a small world and doesn't lose any of the atmospheric appeal that you see in the previous GTA games. Incredible how its all fitted in a UMD. Aside from some flaws, there's no denying GTA: Liberty City Stories is a superb game and may well be the PSP's killer game.
