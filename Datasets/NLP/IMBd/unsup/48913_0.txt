Shame on me. Shame on me for mindlessly buying this movie based on internet recommendations. I went to an anime site that allows you to enter a movie you like, and you will receive recommendations. The movie I entered is Akira. This was the number one recommendation. I cannot begin to conceive how and why this movie came up. Akira is EXCELLENT, in every facet of it's execution--plot, characters, animation, etc... This is sh*t.<br /><br />To begin to review this pile of garbage is to grant it too much consideration, but I will allow some of that. I think the problem starts with the fact that the object of mystery is Noah's Ark. This of course means hearing scripture. (Remember, I'm embarrassed even to be writing this, because I just bought the movie.) The scripture is quoted *just enough to be vaguely unsettling in the fact that it is Christian. I don't mean to belabor this point though, as you'll probably hear less than 20 seconds of the stuff; but in a movie in which the combined dialogue runs for 5-10 minutes, it's something to think about. The whole plot is right out of Indiana Jones, minus the good movie part.<br /><br />Really it's just a mindless shoot-em-up with a VERY thin plot, and completely disposable characters. Two of the characters are called Fatman and Little Boy (just brilliant). This should appeal to boys ages 8-10. The dialogue, sparse as it is, is totally laughable: "We can't all be Schwarzenegger." or French Spriggan: "I don't bluff, mon ami." I wish I was a member of the site that recommended this movie, so I could try to attempt to understand how this movie came into comparison with Akira. I would personally rate Akira about a 9. I'm giving this a 2. I was going to give it a 3, because of the animation, but the style of the animation is totally generic; in point of fact there IS no style.<br /><br />TEN THUMBS DOWN. I was on the verge of crushing the DVD when I considered that there might be some resale value--to some eager young child, or mindless schlub such as myself.
