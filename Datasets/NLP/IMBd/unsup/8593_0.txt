MBW is one of those movies that is humorous because the characters are kinda stupid but funny. Kennedy plays the seemingly stereotypical role of "black-wannabe-gangsta-trapped-in-white-boy's-body", but i think we've seen this role in movies quite too often (actually Mitch Mullany did a better job in The Breaks). The definitely could've done a better job w/ the plot line, but I suppose they did a good job by using the equation character stupidity = loads of laughs. I think they made Kennedy's character more stupid than he deserved to be. Then again, the whole movie I think was just a big tease about how a lot of kids nowadays (whether from the 'hoods of Compton or Malibu) are trying to emulate the lifestyles/persona of real hip-hop stars. It was a silly yet funny movie, I think more of the "crack-up-laughing" kind of movie vs. lighthearted humor (like Sandler's Anger Management). So yes, don't expect a strong story but go there for the laughs. One note though, they should've made Snoop Dogg's dialogue more like the way he really talks/raps...it seemed a bit "censored" to me...perhaps they did it to make the PG-13 cut. For shizzos, my nizzos. Don't be hatin'! :)<br /><br />** out of 5 for storyline ***** out of 5 for laugh factor
