i don't know how somebody got this film funded. this is by far one of the worst films ever made, and i like the other 9. if you do watch this, get the unrated version; it is significantly better for gore fans. i do still watch it for the blood and laughs. the premise is that only a vorhees can kill jason and she has to use a specific knife. so, jason has a living relative somehow...but that's not the complicated part of the story. jason is ambushed by the s.w.a.t. team (i'll never understand why a s.w.a.t. team member would pause for a shower when trying to draw a serial killer into a trap) and blown to bits. then, naturally, a mortician eats jason's heart (out)! now, the mortician has the power and mind of jason, but it wears on him, like in stephen king's "desperation" and "the regulators" (as richard bachman), so he has to pass on the heart when the body starts to wear, and then somebody else is jason. then the ending. i hate to give it away, so stop reading if it will bother you to find out this travesty of an ending. he gets stabbed, but isn't dying, so massive hands from hell burst through the ground and start to drag him into hell! you think it's over, but no! then the wind starts to blow the dust, and you see that his mask is still there...and freddy kruger's claw bursts through the ground and pulls away the mask while laughing. what an appropriate ending to that one. the good news is, i use this for an example in my class as a deaux ex machima each semester.
