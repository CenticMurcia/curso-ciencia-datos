Well, I'm not a big fan of documentaries because they are usually really, really boring. But, because this one was following one of my favorite movie stars, I went and saw it at a screening in New York City. It showed how hard it is to make it as an actor, and all the jealousies, in-fighting, and the fact you have to be an 18 year old to get any part in a movie. Because of the fact Lisa Picard can take all these blows and keep going proves she is the strongest woman in the world! This movie has some really big surprises because, people like Mina Sorvino and Sandra Bullock keep popping up, making for some big laughs. I love this movie and I love Lisa Picard!
