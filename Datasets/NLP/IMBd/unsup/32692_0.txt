Spoilers?<br /><br />This movie contains disgusting humor and terrible songs and acting, but I will not explain that. When the Rugrats crash on the island that the Thornberries are filming on, the adults join together to find a way out. When Angelica watches the babies, she is dumb enough to go play. The Rugrats run off into the woods to do some playing of their own. When Tommy witnesses a Thornberry filming (Curry, one of the few good actors in this film), he is determined to find him. But when their split up they have to fight their way back to camp. Angelica, meanwhile, realizes the babies are gone and goes into the woods to find them for her own benefit. When she runs into Debbie Thornberry, she takes a break at her camper. Alizza is out with her chimp, and she runs into Spike, played by the always good acting Bruce Willis, and for the first time, you hear him talk.<br /><br />A deserved 2/10 (because it had the Thornberries, which are better).
