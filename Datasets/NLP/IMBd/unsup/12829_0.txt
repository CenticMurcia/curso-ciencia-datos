And that's because I'm not all that willing to give anime the same due many others appear to. Animation style and quality notwithstanding, the "classics" by popular acclaim invariably start out interesting, as you'd expect a pilot episode of any TV series to strive for, but gradually or quickly become weird, occasionally startling, mildly disconcerting, formulaic, or just plain tedious. I respect and enjoy Miyazaki's works and I'm a bit partial to those of Tezuka Osamu, the latter because Astro Boy made quite the impression on me when I viewed its American broadcast premiere. But for today's anime broadcast Stateside there are only two exceptions in my view. Cowboy Bebop is one, for reasons I'll provide among its IMDb comments. GITS:SAC is the other.<br /><br />I first saw the American broadcast premiere of the first of the two GITS:SAC series quite by accident, at about halfway through the third episode. I roused from my insomniac stupor, sat up, blinked, and muttered, "Now this is different." Not a serial in the strict sense, no kids in the lead, no swordplay between mythical creatures or giant robots, no mutated dinosaurs, definitely nothing marketable (perhaps the Tachikoma, but I doubt Stateside), and unquestionably something you won't catch broadcast Stateside anywhere near prime time, though I sometimes think Stateside networks aim for that, whether the viewing public likes it or notÂ—<br /><br />Mystery writers would call GITS:SAC "a police procedural," and science fiction writers would probably add "cyberpunk" to that label. Plots, subplots, arcs, you-name-it, all set in a future Japan that subtly requires you to try to figure out what's "different but the same" but not all at once. Nominally each of the two TV seasons has its own principal story arc; the first season features the way the world is, the second features someone who would very much like it different. Miss one episode, no harm done, but perhaps with a lingering enticement to be more certain that you truly did not miss anything. And then they'll have you! <br /><br />Action, obligatory gore (albeit animated), some expletives and "cheesecake" (ditto), but all tempered with a captivating and truly surprising allotment of characterization, dialogue, insight, wit, and "breathing time." Exceptional music. Passing references to "the war," "refugee zones" and the "American Empire," while "all natural" and "puppet" take on entirely different (and frightening) meanings. The settings may look familiar and untouched, but every character is a survivor, and I think you'll catch on fairly early as to just how that's done.<br /><br />I don't normally appreciate this kind of a challenge from a TV series. I frankly lack the patience of a regular viewer and, if I must get hooked, prefer that happen from the very start. But I haven't enjoyed a challenge in quite this way since my equally serendipitous introduction to Paddy McGoohan's The Prisoner many years ago. And I leave it to you to try to figure out the meaning behind the title as well.<br /><br />Plenty Web sites if you want to cheat. Both televised seasons of 26 episodes each are available on DVD. (Catch the interviews with the production members and cast; Kamiyama Kenji is a thoughtful and articulate young man, and "production by committee" here is something to be proud of.) Two predecessor GITS movies to rent, each radically different from the other (one dubbed into competent English, the other subtitled) though essentially featuring the same characters. The TV series is no thematic sequel to the two movies but still another direction taken by the same characters. Besides a recent novelization that bridges the gap between the two predecessor movies and a sequel movie soon to arrive Stateside, two manga ("graphic novels," Stateside) are also available, but you might as well stick to GITS:SAC on the 'tube or DVD, for if the prospect of viewing anime gives you pause you'll probably also refrain from holding a fancy comic book.<br /><br />Whether seasoned otaku, accidental viewer like myself, or just plain curious, take the plunge and draw your own conclusions, but, in a phrase, brace for intelligence.
