this movie is simply awful. i was forced to watch this piece of fecal matter cinema while taking an English analysis and interpretation class. we were focusing on Mary Shelley's brilliant, terrifying, and splendid novel, and our professor was introducing us to different modern interpretations.<br /><br />why they called this movie "Mary Shelley's" Frankenstein, i don't know, since it veers off so wildly from the original book, it will make any literature fan's head spin. i know, even the original "Frankenstein" film wasn't close to the book at all, but at least it was done stylistically well and was merely "based" on the book rather than being touted as "the closest adaptation" of the book like this one was.<br /><br />everything about this movie is bad, except the costumes and makeup. the script is awful, much of the dialogue laughable if nothing else, and even the most "interesting" scenes only inspire boredom. this film has such a great cast: de Niro, Helena Bonham Carter, Ian Holm, Tom Hulce, and director Branaugh...but all fail miserably here...mostly thanks to this monster of a script.<br /><br />take my advice. stay away. read the book. the original 1818 version. rent the original James Whale masterpiece of the delightful parody "Young Frankenstein" by Mel Brooks. this creature is better left dead.
