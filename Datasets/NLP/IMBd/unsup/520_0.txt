I really enjoyed this film, it was such an in depth, deep, powerful, scary, beautifully done film I absolutely had a blast watching it. It was well acted, though to be honest I didn't think Kiera Knightley was that amazing in it, especially since she wasn't in it all the way through. And I do not understand it in the slightest when people say she stole the film from Thora Birch. The one, and only, problem with this film is that, as a very very religious person, the excessive nudity and fondling was a problem. And the blood was unnecessary, but it's Hollywood (or wherever this film was made), and I had low expectations. Great film though, love it to bits, one of my faves ever.
