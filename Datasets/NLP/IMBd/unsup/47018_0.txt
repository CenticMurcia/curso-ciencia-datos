I loved the first movie so I thought the second one would be even better. I was wrong.<br /><br />The story and the script for the movie is excellent, and the characters are wonderful as well. The worst part of the movie are all the animations. They are neither realistic nor timed at all, just a big pain in the backside. And annoying, which lowered my vote from an 8 to 4.<br /><br />The DVD-release of the movie is not better. The cover tell you about all the extra-material and such, but when you launch the extra material in the extra annoying and slow interface, all you get is: "You need a computer with Windows and a DVD-drive to use the extra-materials".<br /><br />Am I going to buy another DVD just to check out the bonus materials?<br /><br />Not likely. This lowered my vote from 4 to 3.<br /><br />Conclusion: Avoid this movie. Perhaps you can use it as a sleeping pill.
