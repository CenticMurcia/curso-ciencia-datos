The concept: Explore what possibilities of paradox exist if time travel to the past (or future) becomes reality. This is an exercise that has challenged the most respected minds humanity has produced from Einstein to Hawking - a concept captivating and eloquently delved by authors from Heinlein to C. S. Lewis - a vision brought to the silver screen in an accessible and engaging way by such movies as Back to the Future and Terminator.<br /><br />The result: What should probably have been a complete Alan Smithee production.<br /><br />There are a couple positive items of note - if you enjoy tongue-in-cheek, campy films that don't take themselves seriously, and give a passing glance at the hypothesis that gave it birth, you MIGHT try it. If you're sorry afterward, pick up a book that does the subject justice - some Heinlein (_Number of the Beast_ or _Time Enough for Love_) or the recent Crichton or Baxter releases (_Timeline_ and _Manifold: Time_ respectively). Another plus: the end of the movie, and of the pain.<br /><br />There's just too many cons to cover fully - poor acting, vague direction, TOO low of a budget and special effects, terrible writing, unsatisfactory plot resolution, horrible redundancy... I saw the original release and was young enough to be embarrassed for the actors. When I caught a replay recently on TV, I struggled through it to make sure I was truly rating my "worst ever" fairly.<br /><br />I was. 1/10.
