I had only seen this episode once when it first premiered, but it came on tonight and I saw it again. This was a very fun episode, too bad Duchovny wasn't involved. Burt Reynolds makes this one, no question. And the various musics & songs...great! It is a true X Files episode in that it's confusing and makes you think, but it is also extremely lighthearted and comical at the same time.<br /><br />One thing confusing is who Burt Reynolds' character truly is. It appears he has the advantage of knowing the patterns people make and can thus draw conclusions as to what they're going to do, but at the same time not to give the appearance of knowing this. I wouldn't say that he's just a man, but it could be argued that he's Fate or God. The discussion Scully & Reyes have about God playing checkers would be very ironic if his character somehow was God. Either way, a stand-alone episode not to miss!
