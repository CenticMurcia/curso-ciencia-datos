The three main characters are totally different from each other. At a picnic they probably would have little to say to each other. But all three just arrived by plane in NY, from war, on 30-day Army leave, and are about to catch planes to their eventual destinations. But something happens, a regional power outage has caused flight delays and cancellations. So they end up unlikely companions on a road trip.<br /><br />They are "The Lucky Ones" , they are still alive.<br /><br />Tim Robbins is Sgt Fred Cheaver, actually getting out of the military and on his way home to St Louis. He rents the last available car and takes along the two other soldiers to share expenses and driving. They will catch planes from St Louis.<br /><br />Rachel McAdams is Colee Dunn, country girl, unsophisticated and unfiltered, she says whatever crosses her mind. She has been wounded in the leg and has a limp.<br /><br />Michael Pe√±a is T.K. Poole. He was also wounded, but in an embarrassing place, his male private parts. Some of the funnier scenes occur when Colee tries to get him help for his (hopefully temporary) ED.<br /><br />The three actors are very good here and their interactions are interesting. I found myself wanting to own the DVD so that I can re-watch it periodically.<br /><br />UPDATE: I just watched it again after almost 2 months and enjoyed it as much the second time.<br /><br />SPOILERS: Cheaver arrives home to a standoff-ish wife, she has decided she will be happier single. At the same time their son announces he has been accepted at Stanford but needs $20,000 within 3 weeks to hold his place. Colee's boyfriend was killed and she is surprising the boy's parents by delivering his guitar to them in Las Vegas. The deceased soldier turns out to be a big fraud, with girlfriend and baby back home, and Colee gets to keep the guitar. Cheaver tries to win $20,000 in LV but fails, but re-inlists for the $20,000 bonus. They all end up back together, about to be shipped off to 3 separate fighting zones, not knowing if they ever will see each other again.
