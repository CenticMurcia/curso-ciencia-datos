Dodge City is a very entertaining and exciting western of 1939. A great year for movies. Errol Flynn plays Wade Hutton a cattle herd groupie turned suave, tough sheriff of Dodge City. When Wade is turned into a sheriff, exactly one hour into the movie, the action and story really picks up and the tone of the movie turns a bit serious. Errol Flynn is at his most heroic in this film. He's the savior of the town and hero when he takes the role as sheriff. He was pretty heroic in Robin Hood toward the Saxons, and he's just as heroic to the people of Dodge City. This film has some exciting action sequences, like the mammoth bar fight and the runaway train fire and shootout. Some great characters, good screenplay and witty dialouge makes this film for everyone to enjoy. There are though quite a few flaws. One is the tone of the movie. In the first hour this film plays out like a comedy/ western and then suddenly it turns into a drama/romantic/action western. The pace is uneven and at times it seems like your watching two different movies in one. Another problem in the film is the terrible color featured in the film. I think it was a mistake for filmmakers to color western films of the 1930's. The color lookes murky and very distorted and faded and is very hard on the eyes. Also featuring westerns in color seems to lose that classical fell to them, especially in the 30's. Some films just aren't made for color and westerns are those kind of films. But to sum it all up, Dodge City is slam bang action and exciement, that will definetly entertain. **1/2 out of ****.
