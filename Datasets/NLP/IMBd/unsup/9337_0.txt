Although this story is relatively confined to a simple bar set I found the characters that enter the scene are very animated and entertaining. The level headed owner/bartender keeps everything in order but the antics do fly. A refreshing look at the expressive character types of the 40's. Not much in terms of complex plot twists or symbolic messages just a funfilled look at a bar/lounge of that time period.
