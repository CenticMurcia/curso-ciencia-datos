Dinosaur adventure! (yes, another one).<br /><br />While on an Arctic expedition, a group of scientists become lost in an ice-age environment which is tainted with the humidity of the Amazon. Jock Mahoney is the stalwart hero who divides his time between fighting off dinosaurs, a crazy jungle hermit, and the advances of pretty Shawn Smith. If Mahoney had any sense, he'd push the hermit off a cliff, let Shawn get her hooks into him, and have dinosaur filet mignon for dinner, but apparently, he's not that smart. Douglas Kennedy co-stars as the Navy captain who sends these dillweeds on the mission aboard a helicopter with a defective push-rod tube - why, you.... dirty....<br /><br />OK sci-fi/horror time-killer from Universal-International.
