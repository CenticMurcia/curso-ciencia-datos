Poor old Sean Astin. Hot off the success of LOTR he ends up doing this dull excuse for an action sci-fi movie.<br /><br />Slipstream is dull. Not boring, just dull. I had hoped for more seeing as how Vinnie Jones was in it. But he is horribly hamstrung by not being able to swear properly. Substitutions for the F-Word such as "flaming" just aren't funny when they come out of his mouth. Reminded me all to much of a network version of Aliens I saw some years ago, where Hudson kept saying "Frickin'-A!" in a completely different voice than Bill Paxton's. At least here they got Vinnie to do the words. But it still sounds just wrong! Because of this, Vinnie isn't remotely funny in this film. Sean seems terribly ill at ease and the rest of the cast do nothing spectacular. In short, the movie is just dull.<br /><br />I don't mind the silly physics of time travel, but I do dislike lack of common sense when movies are made. Here, we are told that the time-travel window to the past is just ten minutes long - something to do, we find out later, with not having enough power. But dear old Sam - sorry, Sean - has no problem using his device several times over in those ten minutes, effectively going back over the same ten minutes again and again. So it begs the question....if you can use the device repeatedly, why not go back 10 minutes, then another 10 minutes.... and so on? All in all, poorly thought out and badly executed. Let's hope this film drops into obscurity and does no harm either to Astin's or Jones's careers.
