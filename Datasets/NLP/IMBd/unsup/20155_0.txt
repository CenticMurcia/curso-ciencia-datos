Not the VFXs or anything like that attracted to this movie. The only thing was the theme, and of course a great story A+. The film started out with just a normal setting. Later on the theme started building up as the main character Jason started going through all of his tests. From then on foreshadowing make the film flow to the end. However, the end was somewhat surprising, because of the dynamic change that the main character went through. Yet it ended with a great beginning for me as I went home thinking about. It is somethings that every person should think about, and re-prioritize some things in life that should be first, rather than money, etc... Just a great movie, was very moved by it...
