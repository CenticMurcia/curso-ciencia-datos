Watched the original Men Behind the Sun, and then this sequel. This was English dubbed though. Cantonese version may have been way better. Anyway, from the 1st 2 minutes I felt this is some awkward attempt to ride on the "success" of the first movie.<br /><br />Story about Japanese biological weapons development with some off-topic (maybe I missed something?) autopsies. Some shots are clearly ripped from the first one, like the liquid nitrogen demonstrations and when the leader dude stands in front of the japan flag & his "army". If you haven't seen the original movie, you may like this, anyway I was so much disappointed I recommend watching "Men Behind the Sun" or even "Mermaid in a Manhole" instead, and skip this one.
