This movie started off with a lot of promise and, it had all the ingredients for a great heist/action movie. But it all get very lost and over the top, the two marine officers have a no part, the marine major is also a no-parter. Wesley Snipes is funny and as always action packed. Tamsym has a great part but it needed more meat to it. Over all not a bad movie but it could have a really good one.<br /><br />The location was a great one, the first car chase was great, fast paced and full of action, they then duplicate it towards the end. If you really enjoyed this movie, you have to watch HEAT.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie but only because I'm a big Wesley Snipes fan.
