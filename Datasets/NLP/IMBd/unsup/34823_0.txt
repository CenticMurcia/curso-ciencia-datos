I don't know what's wrong with most of the reviewers here, but this film isn't even vaguely funny.<br /><br />The plot line sounded like it might be a real hoot, so I thought I'd give it a go. What a mistake. Maybe if you're Jewish and/or are from Rhode Island you'd bust a gut watching it. I got suckered in the same way by "The Hebrew Hammer" which probably was hilarious if you were Jewish but pathetic if you're not.<br /><br />A shame, because the basic story showed some real promise. Somebody with a bit of insight could have made a good indie film from it.<br /><br />For me, it was just boring, pointless and stupid. Some here have called this a "cult" film. They couldn't be more wrong.<br /><br />Waste of time.
