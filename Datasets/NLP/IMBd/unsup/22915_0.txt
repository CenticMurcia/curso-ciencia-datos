The movie is made up of different stories, and at the end the characters from each story are involved in the same incidence. Till that incidence, you wonder whats happening, why is it happening. There is no clue in the entire movie about what is going to happen at the end. And then at the end when you find out that the movie is actually based on one real incidence, your reaction is just WHAAATTTT? Are all these stories made just to show how people suffer in this? Its really sad even after having some good actors like Paresh Rawal, Irfan Khan, the movie failed to make an impact. You will not like to discuss it after you watch it.
