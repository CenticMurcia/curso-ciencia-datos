What is this about cross-country racing? I saw "The Gumball Rally" and it's mostly comedy and adventure, this one is more high octane. David Carradine who's fresh from "Kung Fu" plays Coy "Cannonball" Buckman, a ex-con who makes this race an important part of his life. Veronica Hamel(before hitting it big as "Hill Street Blues" character, Joyce Davenport) as parole officer, Linda Maxwell. Everybody gets to the spot in California in a coast-to-coast race where anything goes. Scheming and cheating, sabotaging other vehicles, everyone wants the big money. A friend of Coy emulated him, and Coy's brother Bennie(Dick Miller) placed some explosives under a German driver's car. When the truth of the traffic accident surfaces, Linda realized that Coy wasn't a guilty man. His Trans-Am was totaled,and his replacement car is a mean Ford Mustang. The car pileup was sickening, and the young kids help out Linda after Coy's friend was killed. And Coy himself would rather win fare and square, than having the competition eliminated by extreme matters. Looks like Linda was more important to him than the money. And the young kids deserved it more. This movie has got plenty of action, and plenty of laughs, and David Carradine haven't lost his touch in his moves. 3 out of 5 stars
