"Love is Never Silent" is an emotional drama set in the 1930s and early 1940s. Unlike her parents, Margaret is not hearing impaired.<br /><br />Therefore, young Margaret often finds herself acting as a buffer and an interpreter for her deaf parents in the hearing world. As a result, Margaret's youthful innocence is lost at a very young age and often does not inform her parents of the rude comments people say to her parents.<br /><br />In addition, Margaret's parents, particularly her mother, become alarmed and angry when Margaret asserts her independence as she gets older.<br /><br />Friendly neighbor Mr. Petrakis is one of the few who fully understands Margaret's difficult circumstances.<br /><br />In the tradition of "It's a Wonderful Life", "Love is Never Silent" builds and sets the stage throughout the movie for the highly emotional scene towards the end of the film when Margaret finally stands up to her demanding parents.<br /><br />Mare Winningham is brilliant as Margaret. Sid Ceaser is convincing as Mr. Petrakis. Cloris Leachman is great in this rare departure from comedy.<br /><br />I highly recommend this emotional film.
