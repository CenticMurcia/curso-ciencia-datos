I'm one of the zombies movie's lover, and I've watch every zombie movies I could find out. And most of it, it's good. But this? This is a total crap. Everything in this movie is a waste. Bad script, bad acting (never saw anyone that's stupid enough to let some guys (zombies, if you could call it zombies) put a bomb in his laps, and just stare at it, as it is just a toy or a girl who looks very ready to scream her guts out when something approach her), bad make-up (the zombies look like a man who got a gray paint all over himself), bad music (using some kind of rock music, didn't really up the heat of this movie), and even bad plot (never seen a zombie who wants revenge only.) Overall, don't even watch it on DVD, except if you find the movie just lying around at a street corner. Not even worth your time, I should say.<br /><br />Rate 1/10
