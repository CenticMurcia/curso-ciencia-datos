I only heard of this film in passing, and did not realize how good it was until I rented the DVD. Don't be put off by the dated 1970s music, wardrobes, hairstyles, small-budget, grainy photography, etc. for this is a milestone in gay cinema. Made just about 5 years after the groundbreaking "Boys in The Band", this greatly improves upon that film, with no self-loathing characters, but natural, real people. The writer-director Christopher Clark incorporates pensive dialogue in the story of an ex-Seminary student who finds love with one man, but is soon turned away from him and eventually finds peace with someone else. The musical score is moving, with classical pieces and more. Cast of unknowns unfortunately remained that way, but they are all outstanding. The parade sequences give added flavor and still timely food for thought. The last 5 minutes, with slow-motion photography and soaring music (pre-dates "Chariots of Fire" -1981), better illustrates male bonding than anything seen before or since. Most of the latter-day gay films remain silly, shallow, frequently mean-spirited fodder, with "Making Love" (1982 - good, "Maurice" (1987 - better) "Big Eden" (2000 -great) among the few notable exceptions. A classic awaiting rediscovery.
