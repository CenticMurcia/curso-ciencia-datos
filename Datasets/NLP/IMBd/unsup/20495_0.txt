Doc Hollywood is one of only a handful of movies that I never tire of watching. It's a vacation for the mind -- the story of a brash big city surgeon (Michael J. Fox) who, after a minor car crash, finds himself trapped in the "twilight zone" of backwater USA, only to make a series of amazing discoveries about life off the beaten path. It's a nice love story with a wonderful cast set in the fictional town of Grady (the "Squash capital of the South"), which is straight out of Norman Rockwell with a touch of Mayberry RFD. It's the kind of place that, if it existed, you would immediately move there. Since it doesn't, the next best thing is to watch this very entertaining movie.
