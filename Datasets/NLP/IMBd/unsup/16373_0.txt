One of the best if not THE best silent or "purely graphic" comedies ever made. Yes I am a huge Keaton fan, but no one can doubt his influence after watching Harpo Marx, Jackie Chan or Jim Carrie. How Mr. Keaton could transform his artistry from Vaudeville to the big screen is more of a tribute to his genius . You might not like the trains or the ragtime music but you'll have to appreciate the situational and physical qualities of this film.
