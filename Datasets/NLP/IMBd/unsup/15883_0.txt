This movie was so horrible I could barely even watch it all. I do not recommend this movie at all. The plot was horrible and the acting was just as bad. I really think they could have put more much needed time and effort into this movie. I think that if it was more of a movie and less of a documentary it would have gotten a better review from me. I seriously think this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. I try to watch movies that are not popular just to see what they are like, and most of them are not so great but this one was truly horrible. 1 out of 10.<br /><br />-
