I rented the I inside the other day and was intrigued from start to finish.I did have to re-watch parts to understand it but ended up with more questions. Like another person said on here,i'm surprised this movie wasn't in theater's.It would have been cool seeing it on a big screen,and Ryan Phillippe's performance blew me away.He really made me believe how tortured the character of Simon was right up until the end. It started out as a good mystery with interesting characters. The one thing I didn't understand was why Simon Cable's mother was never shown.There was only a quick mention of her being dead.His father also died but later appeared in visions along with his dead brother and his girlfriend. The story was slowly coming together and the mystery was solved but confused about the character of Anna and why she was even in it.First she's his wife,then she's a nursing student,and then a blackmailer.Her character in the whole story just did not fit.I understood at the end how all the other characters fit in to what was going on.At the end each person in the hospital,both doctors(including his own father as one),his brother and his lover Claire who was his brother's wife had a part in Simon's head as he was wanting to go back to the past and make things right but it was too late. I have seen other movies like this before like the movie dead end,but I thought the ending of the I inside was more real.He was either in a coma for 2 years and while under imagined all the scenarios of bettering his life and making up for the people he wronged,or was stuck in hell tortured with never ending memories of what he did while he watched with his own eyes the sins he committed.And his guilt was making him see how he would change things if he had another chance. At one point in the movie he felt he was lost in a never ending confusing void and the one doctor who was also his father was telling him he died.The spooky thing about the ending is that it gets you thinking about what lays ahead after our own death. This was only my perception,another person may have seen it differently.Or maybe he did wake up from the coma and had to face up to what he did.
