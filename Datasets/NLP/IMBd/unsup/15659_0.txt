I always wondered what happened to Todd Bridges, anyone else? I had seen him pop up from time to time in different roles, but more serious roles. When I saw this cover on the video store shelves, I just had to get it. I was very curious. Now, here is what caught me totally off guard. He's in only like the first part of the movie then sprinkled here and there till the end? Now the other part of this is that I didn't know what think as far as the other characters and where this was going to go without Todd. Boy was I wrong, it was so funny. Don't get me wrong, Todd did his thing and he was funny, but once the others had to take control, they did their thing as well. I give props to to everyone involved. Good Job!
