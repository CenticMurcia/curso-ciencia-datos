This movie was painful to watch. I usually find every movie to be fairly entertaining, but this is one of only 2 movies I stopped watching part way through. I expected a Rodney Dangerfield movie. This was just Rodney Dangerfield put to waste in a horrible movie. He did not do any of his usual material which might have made this movie bearable. Instead it is a stupid gangster movie, with a stupid plot, bad acting and generally bad feeling throughout the picture. If you watch this movie you will wish you could have that part of your life back and erase the memories of the experience.
