OK, so the hardest part of watching this is to not assign human emotions to this little wild critters and to get over our human desire to save every creature. After all, they live in the wild and they have their own ways and we need to just let them be and enjoy them.<br /><br />The meerkats are adorable...the funniest little faces and bodies and they way they stand on their hind feet and look around is just a scream, but of course it has purpose. The closeups give me the shivers because I can see the fleas flitting around their little bodies and there for a while one of them had ticks, which are normally group groomed off.<br /><br />Listen, take the time to watch this. Anyone would enjoy it, or they don't have a heart. The meerkats are adorable and lovable, except for the fleas.
