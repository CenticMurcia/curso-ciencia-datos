With FC Venus it is a rare pleasure/torture to see a film which is partially well done and partially awful. The pleasure is that all the scenes that are about the soccer game are carefully worked with a good amount of dramatics and game technicalities. The torture is that everything else in the movie is just painful watching.<br /><br />A good load of fine actors don't really improve a film if directing is terrible; the dialogue is lost in a messy scene of too many people waiting one to recite some limping lines that are supposed to be funny. It is difficult to concentrate on the dialogue as the speaking voice is taped so poorly that it makes you feel that you are completely outsider in regards to the film events. No close shots to speakers and no idea what is generally going on. A lot of talk about sex is used to replace more usual humor. The cameo by Aki Riihilahti and Mikael Forssell looks only embarrassing in this context.<br /><br />It seems that the movie makers have been too much concentrated to train the bunch of actors to love and play soccer because they have forgotten to finish the drama part of the movie. If that was to hint how much more fun sports is than movies I think it shouldn't have been done this way. The match day is worth watching but it may render you only sad because everything that comes before it is rather unpleasant.
