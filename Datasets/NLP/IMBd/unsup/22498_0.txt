The music, the sounds, everything in this game is PERFECT.. I wish i could tell what Starcraft means to me.. But its much more that what words may define.. I bought maybe 20 copies and all the copies are stolen by my friends who hated Starcraft once (and they became fans too) I LOVE THIS GAME.. <br /><br />The game is about 3 species; Terrans , Protos and Zergs. You have to gather the resources of the planet and fight against the other species. Each unit has its advantages and disadvantages against the others.. The species are nearly equal in force and in tactics. All you have to do is focus on the strategy.
