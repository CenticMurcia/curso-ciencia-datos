This film is (or should I say "Both of these films are"?) really very suspenseful and action-packed. The acting is very good, although I would have liked to see the old pro's like E. G. Marshall, Martin Balsam, and Kim Hunter all have more time onscreen. Tom Savini reaffirms his position as one of our great makeup artists. The problem is that TWO EVIL EYES is much too gory, especially Dario Argento's take on THE BLACK CAT. I watched this movie on video last night and my stomach is still queasy 12 hours later. It is not necessary to show graphic and gory effects to tell a good story. DO NOT WATCH THIS RIGHT AFTER EATING, although dieters might do well to watch it before eating. Also, do not show this to children.
