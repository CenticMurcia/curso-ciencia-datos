It was with great honor to broadcast such a phenomenal woman, a woman who was not afraid to bear her true essence in film, poetry, directing, teaching and having said the last word. The documentary brought tears to my eyes, with such greatness from her films and poetry, her works shall always be ingrain in my heart. It takes much courage to struggle in a world that has so-long been divided especially when it comes to finding black roles in the acting industry; as well as having her voice heard without being accused of being radical. I applaud all that allowed her story to be told...because she is indeed a woman of many talents and excellence. Her vitality and energy emerged until the very end...thank you Beah!
