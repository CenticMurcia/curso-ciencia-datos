The film is a life reaffirming statement of one man's choice of his final farewell to the people, places and memories that sum up his life's work. The film works well because of how little is actually stated by the principals. The film's focal point appears to be the indirect answer Antonio gives for the reason for his visit. Antonio recounts the story of his colleague, a professor, who during a lecture looks out the window and starts humming a tune from his native country and his youth after which he suffers a heart attack.<br /><br />When Elena says her goodbyes, it is evident that she knows about Antonio's health condition.<br /><br />The final scene with the theme music playing in the background simply restates the life reaffirmation.
