No one expects high art from a Chuck Norris film, but this one is one of his poorer outings. The pace is tedious, the dialogue bad, the plot weak, and the acting substandard. Norris is no Olivier but he can act better than this, and definitely outacts some of the other actors in this one. Some of martial arts scenes are competent enough, but don't make up for the overall poor quality of the film. Its surprising that it came from MGM, who must have been really disappointed with what their dollars produced. If you want to spend a couple of hours watching him go rent Delta Force, which is more entertaining and has Lee Marvin as the world's oldest US special ops commando.
