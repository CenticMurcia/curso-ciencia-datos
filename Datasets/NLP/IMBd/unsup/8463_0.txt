Hook is one of those "what if?" stories that answers the question if Peter Pan grew up and stayed in our world and left the world of Neverland behind, and had a family of his own. <br /><br />In the 1990's Peter Pan is now a middle aged man with a lot of work on his head, his name is now Peter Banning. Peter puts work ahead of his family and has issues with his own family, especially his son Jack. They return to England, Peter's wife's home country where they meet her grandmother, Wendy Darling, again. Wendy is older and much more wiser with the world, and grows a fear on Peter, he's no longer the nice boy she once had many adventures with, he's a hard working man who has a cranky attitude for the most part. It's heartbreaking for her. t is till the legendary Captian Hook kidnaps Peter's children that he is reminded by Wendy of who he used to be, of course Peter can't believe it, he can't believe it even more when Tinkerbell pays a visit and carries him off to Neverland where he meets Captian Hook after so long. Hook is in disbelief that Banning is Peter Pan, but Tinkerbell promises she'll have been back into shape in a week, then their war shall continue. Hook agrees and that leaves Tinkerbell and the Lost boys to train Peter into being the boy he once was. <br /><br />The acting in this film is fantastic, Robin Williams embodies Peter Pan, Dustin Hoiffman embodies Captian Hook( tries to phone in on the Disney version), Bob Hoskins doe s great Smee, and Julia Roberts is decent as Tinkerbell. <br /><br />The direction is fantastic, classic Spielberg, it also brings in his taste in comedy and juvenile essence. <br /><br />The musical score by John Willaims is fantastic, as usual. <br /><br />Despite being a box office hit, Hook wasn't the film that Spielberg wanted to make, in the end, he isn't fond of it and frankly neither is Julia Roberts for that matter( take a look at the trivia, clearly she didn't have a good time as it would seem). <br /><br />Hook is undeniably a love or hate movie, but even after so long, I still like it, though I don't think I could call it a classic to be perfectly honest. <br /><br />7/10.
