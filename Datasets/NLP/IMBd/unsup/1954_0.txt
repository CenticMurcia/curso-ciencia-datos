This television movie is aptly titled, two doctors Drs Jones and Enari played by Robert Culp and Eli Wallach are sent to an isolated Arctic research lab because Dr Vogel hadn't had contact with the base research station in five days due to snowstorms.<br /><br />But before they lost all radio transmission to Dr Vogel, radio contact between the base and Dr Vogel grew increasingly sporadic and irrational, the doctor rantings about conversations with Napoleon and Alexander The Great have become a great concern naturally.<br /><br />The Tower Mountain Research Station where Vogel was stationed had been conducting high altitude experiments on monkeys and chimps furthermore fearing their four years worth of research had been wasted, two doctors chosen for their experience in research in stress situations for space programs are sent to relieve Dr Vogel.<br /><br />What they find is the research station in shambles, the monkey's nearly dead from exposure, and Dr Vogel sitting prone frozen to death in the electronics room with the window wide open and 300 feet worth of used tape on the recorder in front of him.<br /><br />Sending the helicopter pilot and Vogel's body off back to the base research station, quickly things go awry with strange bumps in the night and doors ajarred shutting and open windows. <br /><br />Dr. Jones (Culp) begins to grow apprehensively suspicious about the conditions with which Vogel died and Dr Enari (Wallach) chooses to believe there is a rational explanation for everything including the coincidences and weird going-ons causing due friction between the pair. And what is recorded on Dr Vogel's thawing tape? <br /><br />This movie is an exceptional slice of paranoia and mood undeniably influenced later films The Shining and The Thing. The final scene ROCKS!!!
