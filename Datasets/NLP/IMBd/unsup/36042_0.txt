As a big fan of Chris Prynoski, I just hate to say, "I don't get it," or at least I don't get the hype. The science fiction of the Civil War era wears out quickly and soon falls prey to a collection of off-the-shelf movie monsters that our grandparents used to watch who were portrayed by Bela Lugosi and Lon Chaney, Jr. among others, (have I given away too much?). The animation varies from very detailed to what seems like four frames per second. And funny? No, not really. Maybe I'll try it again, but if you've ever seen Downtown created by Chris Prynoski, I think you'll find that this doesn't compare when it comes to humor.
