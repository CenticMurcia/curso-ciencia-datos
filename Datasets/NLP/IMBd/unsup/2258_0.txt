This movie is one of the worst I've seen in the past year. The writing was absolutely horrific. If you believe this movie was even remotely entertaining than you may have been tricked by a talent less writer. The movie twisted and turned so much that I found myself carefully paying attention to every little detail only to realize that when the film ended absolutely nothing was accomplished. The writer twisted the order and events of the movie because he can't write. I imagine most viewers will be so overwhelmed by the ever changing events and they won't actually sit back to realize this film was a complete and total waste of time. This movie was so bad that even after watching XXX immediately before Sex and Lucia; it was still painful to witness.<br /><br />At least the porno bits in Sex and Lucia were entertaining.
