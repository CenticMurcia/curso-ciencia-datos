Well, I fully agree on the script being absolute crap. Who ever wrote that must have had an IQ of less than 2. The acting was also not impressive but whoever expected it to be was out of their mind. This is not the kind of thing where you would expect Academy performances, so who cares about that? <br /><br />I honestly believe that whoever compared this film to Twin Peaks was definitely high on crack or crank or something. Whatever it is, please give me some. I cannot fathom how there could be any comparison to something as brilliant as twin peaks to this. It's like comparing A Clockwork Orange to Napoleon Dynamite. Anyhow, I thought that it could be worse.... Than again, I was anticipating the worst. I did like the artsy bits like the beginning and the back story.<br /><br />P.S. The blonde kid singing that song with the dead pigeon was pitiful!!!
