This is a tough one! I am viewing this film in December of 2006. I know it was released at least 3 or 4 months ago although with films in this category the distributor is pushing to get it to video release as soon as they possibly can because the video release is where much more money can be made and in this case video release will surpass domestic profits. However, you are not reading this to hear about how the distributor makes money... I watched as PPV on home cable after reading some reviews and taking in the marketing several months ago, and only because I like Jennifer Anniston and I was bored with X-Mass shopping and am not very familiar w/Vaughn.<br /><br />Anniston's film 'The Good Girl' is how I became hooked on her. I watched 'Friends' seldom but when I did, it was because I liked looking at her. 'The Good Girl' is J A at her best. Prior she was not pulling in audiences as one would think she would after Friends. Her previous films did not make money for the production companies to actually allow her to continue making films as a 'star' and I believe based solely on her performances on Friends was she cast in other films, all the while the producers would dump cash into her films hoping she would hit that one big starring lead to allow them to justify another J A starrer.<br /><br />"The Good Girl' was so good but yet made no more than her previous attempts in film work (I would imagine rentals put her over the top because rentals are rented mainly based on consumer 'word of mouth').<br /><br />I'm generalizing here and simply writing as I watched her career slowly fade (I.e.: I have completed no research on J A and her films but writing simply as a consumer watching what was going on with her career) until 'The Good Girl showed up on the radar screen of the possibility, the potential of a possibility for JA to find a niche for her considerable talent. I believe Good Girl was a big 'critical' success which will always make studio heads turn. 'The Good Girl' was so good and on a 'real life' level that if you have not seen this film do so now. You will be blown away by her subtle but deeply felt ability to sweep you away from your troubles for 90 minutes.<br /><br />Thus, based upon the GG showing blatantly her abilities for film work once a DECENT script is placed in front of her and her sheer talent we all know is there (why do you think H'wood keeps remaking and extending sequels...no freaking writing is going on out there.) she gets to make more of this genre' which is a shame because she is capable of much more than the horrid 'Break Up' and I am afraid she will be stuck in this type role. Certainly on one level she does not mind as I imagine she is paid very well as the women love her in this 'Break Up' sort of waste of film. <br /><br />Nevertheless, JA as a "STAR" right now and not an "ACTRESS" has to be frustrated not even mentioning her personal life.<br /><br />I have been wanting to get all the above thoughts down somewhere where someone MAY read them, although as you begin reading and notice this is not about this film specifically but about J A, you may skip over this 'review. I will tell you what I thought of 'Break Up', though: a true and real BORE. However, watching JA was a treat. The script was poorly written, the direction was bad, the casting was OK, and frankly, the supporting actors were more entertaining than the entire film taken as a whole. Generally, in most anything, you are usually only as good as those surrounding you and although JA tried, she could not carry the film herself and end up with an enjoyable product.<br /><br />My god when I think of that script and most of the dialog I want to cringe. Vaughn who was fun to watch as a fast-talking slob who tries, grabbed me more this time. <br /><br />Think about it, if someone meets over a hot dog at a baseball game and he essentially bullies JA as to what HE thought best, then you deserve what you get.<br /><br />I have been there, I deserved what I got, and it was not fun.<br /><br />This film made production budget wise at 150 mil (But when you see that figure multiply by 3 for what the film really cost in marketing and prints the production company (distributor) has to get to the screen and all the other costs involved.)<br /><br />Look at the video rentals of this film at what, 50 mil? it made a reported 350m worldwide but there are many more ancillary ways of picking up revenue domestically and foreign, so at 450mil they may have made a few dollars allowing JA to TRY AGAIN.<br /><br />Rent 'The Good Girl'. There is the real Jennifer Anniston. Moreover, I hope she can break out of the mold she has been cast in. Julia Roberts did it so can J A!!
