"Celebrity" is about three childhood friends who are bound to each other for life due to a tragic event which occurred when they were teens.<br /><br />Each one of them gains a certain amount of notoriety as adults and the viewer just sits around waiting for the other shoe to fall. You wait and wait and wait...and wait. Finally, their past comes back to haunt them and leads to another predictably tragic event.<br /><br />This mini-series actually got quite a few good reviews when it first appeared on TV. Evidently, it was a lot easier to be entertained back then. At around five hours, the length of the film is excruciatingly long and it easily could've been stuffed neatly into a two hour TV movie.<br /><br />Aside from the horrid pacing, the fatal flaw in this mini-series is the lack of viewer empathy for the three main characters. You keep getting introduced to interesting supporting characters only to have them completely disappear or pop up only every hour or so. The three men in the lead roles all come across as being dishonest and shallow to varying extents.<br /><br />"Celebrity" is not a mini-series which has stayed in the public consciousness for good reason. It is bloated and tedious. 1/10
