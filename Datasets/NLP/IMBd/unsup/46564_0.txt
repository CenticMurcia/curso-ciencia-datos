I honestly don't understand all those positive reviews. This gotta be one of the worst series of all time in my book. Is there any cliché left they didn't do? Come on, we've seen it all before. I gotta give them credit for the operations scenes but that's all that is good with this show. Their effort to present this as something cool and fresh is pathetic. If you wanna see some quality drama with humor go for "Six feet under" and not this. I've watched four season of this and it only gets worse. It's obvious that this show has big budget and it's evident in every scene, it's too bad that that's the only thing they have cause the story is trying so hard to be provocative that it gets irritating. The characters and screenplay are your typical American soap opera cliché after cliché thing. There's no doubt that the cast has some really good actors but their skills are lost with such a poor screenplay. I don't know, maybe you have to be American to actually like this (not meant to offend, it's just different culture and state of mind than European) but I have yet to find someone I know that actually like this show. But I guess users here are exception. I understand that everyone is entitled to their own opinion and that a lot of people like this show but I'm writing this review to show that there's the other side too and that we don't all think this is such a brilliant show but poor, and lousy attempt to shock and nothing else. Superficial as their characters. If you wanna see show that will make you laugh, that will make you think, that will touch you in any way DON'T watch Nip/Tuck. If you wanna see dumb entertainment that is popular today, pathetic excuse for a characters and story, Christian Troy's ass in every episode and some gross but rather impressive surgical scenes than this show is great for you.
