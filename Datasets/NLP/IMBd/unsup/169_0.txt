Enjoyed this great classic film from 1946 starring Claudette Colbert as Elizabeth Hamilton who was a young woman very much in love with her husband, Orson Wells, (John MacDonald/Erik Kessler). John MacDonald decides to go into the Army and fight in World War II and is killed in action and his wife Elizabeth is completely heart broken. However, she finds a man, Lawrence Hamilton, (George Brent) who loves her very much because she works for his father's firm and he asks her to marry him after many years. Elizabeth has a son from her first husband and then a second from Lawrence. It just so happens that Elizabeth's first husband is not killed and has been severally wounded and finally returns to America with a little girl named Margaret Ludwig, (Natalie Wood). As you can see this story gets very complicated and there are many secrets that are finally revealed which turn this love story into a great masterpiece with all great actors. Enjoy.
