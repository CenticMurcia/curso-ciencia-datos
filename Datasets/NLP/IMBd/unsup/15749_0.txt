Well well, I know that I hadn't to expect to much of this flick. But hey, over here in Belgium it's a hard to find so I was lucky to find him in a stupid shop. The cover looked promising as was the storyline. SM, gothband, dismemberment...the unusual stuff. It starts off pretty nice with the killing of a guy. And for no reason a girl shows her melons. But afterwards it decays. And it becomes really stupid, the radio is the gothband playing live in a cage for no reason. Clocking in at 82 minutes isn't true. The movie stops after a hour and then the clownface appears telling that they had another ending of the film too, and they show it afterwards, it's not an extra. It's in the film. So that's the only good part. The dominatrix isn't sexy or whatsoever. The cast isn't convincable except mr. Mascaro, made me think of pogo the clown. The gore isn't believable too, almost no blood. I think that the puppets are more acting then the actors. Watch the gothband, they really can't act or even play. The songs are nice but ...i really have to stop here, this is your xmas movie to watch with the whole family, in other words, a Disney horror.
