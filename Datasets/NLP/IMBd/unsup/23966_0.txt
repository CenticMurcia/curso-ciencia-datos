This isn't great film or anything, but it entertained the hell out of me. I stumbled across it on USA and stayed because the guy from that Crow Stairway To Heaven show was in it, and I always felt he was a decent actor on the rare occasions when I watched that show.<br /><br />The plot is thin. Mr. Crow is supposedly a former operative of some kind of Chinese top secret intelligence agency or something, and they implanted a machine in his heart which pumps up his adrenaline and makes him super-fast and strong. He's trying to sell the gland to an American company, and the Chinese have hired a mildly amusing redneck assassin to go after him. He happens upon a generic wise-cracking black sidekick, and they high-tail across the Western US to California. The bad guys follow, and there's a showdown between Mr. Crow and a new, more advanced bio-implanted freak. Not exactly Memento, but it suffices.<br /><br />The action scenes were pretty kick-@$$. I don't know if they were as good as some of the other reviewers were making them out to be, but they were certainly above your standard Van Damme and Chuck Norris fare. I think the whole bio-implant thing was an excuse for the Crow to get away with all the super-human stuff he does.<br /><br />What set this movie apart from the rest of the crappy B-movies was the dialogue. I remembered 2 jokes falling flat, and the rest of the movie was pretty damn funny. Harrison is pretty funny, and his lines are well-written, and he and the Crow seem to have good chemistry. The redneck assassin is pretty funny, although his character tries a little too hard to make us laugh sometimes. And there is a pretty funny appearance by the fairly attractive Brittany Murphy as a pretty crazed teenager. I must admit I was kind of hoping for her to show up at the end unexpected, but that was one of the B-movie tricks the filmmakers left out.<br /><br />Funny dialogue, inventive and fast-paced action scenes, and just a solid fun atmosphere gives this movie a solid 7.5. Of course, if it was supposed to be a blockbuster, it would be a 6 because of the plot, but that's forgiven here because it is a low-budget film. If you go into this with B-movie expectations, you are in for a treat.<br /><br />Adios<br /><br />
