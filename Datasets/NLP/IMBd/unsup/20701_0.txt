My wife and I caught Winding Roads in St. Louis and were pleasantly surprised. Finally, a movie about regular people dealing with regular issues. We are so tired of special effects and flashy filmmaking with no substance. This film was great and the acting was phenomenal. The lead actor - Kimberly Quinn -has quite a career ahead of her - kudos to the director as well.
