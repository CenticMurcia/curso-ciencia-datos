***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I did not actually have a high expectation for this movie, thinking it will be just another scary flick with lame looking zombies. But after watching this movie i must say the scares were quite refreshing as in they were not your standard kind of horror. Overall i'll say its pretty good. And i like the way milla jovovich (did i get that right?), played her role, that confused, apprehensive but yet calm and controlled kind of action figure you would find in the game. but i must say the role played by Michelle Rodriguez WAS HORRIBLE....it was super irritating the way she played the role, perhaps the director wanted it that way or it was the actress who made her role suck so bad i dunno, but the way she spoke and the way she TRIED to look unfriendly and bitchy really irritates me. She like a small child acting smart and have that "know it all" look in the film. Well dun let that spoil your enjoyment of the film. (SPOILER AHEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) And lucky she died so we will not see her in the sequel (hopefully.)
