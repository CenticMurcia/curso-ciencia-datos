This is truly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The movie is a pathetic extension of this man's therapy/sex addict self-help group. One of the more disturbing elements is his delight in humiliating the actresses who are in the film by revealing private details from their personal lives. Perhaps this is an extension of his prostitute fetish (that is, he believes that by paying them he owns them somehow)? The man is a control freak, and obviously not a talented filmmaker. Also, the sex scenes (and there are a lot of them) are truly disgusting to watch. I literally had to close my eyes, fast forward, and even turn off the movie at points. A complete waste of time.
