Ther are silly films,really silly films,and there is "Angel eyes". It is way too long,there is no performance strong enough to anchor it,there are very few believable characters.The exception being Mr Victor Argot as Miss Lopez's father,a small role with little dialogue but a first class example of how good actors can do "less is more". Miss Lopez herself is far from convincing as a Chicago cop I'm afraid. Too physically flawless to resemble a real human being,she would not survive ten minutes in the blisteringly macho world of the real thing. Mr Jim Cazaviel with doe eyes and designer stubble seems to have persuaded a lot of people that he has given a performance of great sensitivity,but I am not amongst them.He is not traumatised,rather he is catatonic. No one was more surprised than I when he sat in at a jazz club and played a version of "Nature Boy" that Jack Sheldon would have been proud of. The various sub - plots about domestic violence and guilt transference don't work and are merely tedious. Quite what the title refers to I am at a loss to explain.I thought originally it might be to the 1950s Matt Dennis song of that name but I was to be sadly disappointed. If you want to watch a movie about two miserable people who walk around with faces as long as a wet week in Southend "Angel Eyes" will hit the spot.It will make a change from listening to your Leonard Cohen CDs.
