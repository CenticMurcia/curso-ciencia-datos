A masterpiece of international cinema that tranceeds all unnatural boundaries as it deals with human emotions which know no boundaries. Maria Galana who plays an old woman in the sixties from a village in South Spain. Her four sons have moved away as soon as they could to the north.<br /><br />Her husband is admitted to one hospital in the city where she finds herself a bit out of place. Her daughter lives in the same city whom her husband hates as she has gone beyond the cultural limitations and has studied. The daughter played by Ana Fernandez is a character who wants to be rich and hates the way her mother has lived her life like one obidient wife.<br /><br />The movie comes to its real essence when Ana becomes preganant and her boyfriend refuses to take up the responsibility and asks her to abortion. Parallely her monther meets Ana's neighbour-a man in his sixties as well who is as "solas" as Maria even after being married and Ana even after doin what she wanted. Ana's struggle with her identity and her crave to have the child with the fight for her self respect is very well carried by the script.<br /><br />How the things turn up and how Ana realises the importance of her mother and her life, how her mother manages herself intelligebily between all those who hardly want to see each other, the old man wants to be with lady and the story itself which is itself a pillar in the movie are to be watched out for.<br /><br />I say its a best movie when one cannot jus leave his/her seat, its when you feel every bit of the characters are going through, its when every node of the music makes your herat beats.... You can expect everything from it that you expect our of a classic!!
