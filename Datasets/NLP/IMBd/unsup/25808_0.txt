An intriguing premise leads to a feature length film with very limited story line to go on. A young man learns of an imminent nuclear holocaust just as he is falling in love with a young waitress who shares his feelings. Witnessing incredible chaos, people committing suicide left and right, the couple ends up on the roof of a tall building. Eventually giving up on having a "quickie", the two heroes appear ready to face their doom. The final lines have a touching finality. In 1988 (the release year) a large number of people all over the world still had great fears of a nuclear war and the subsequent end of the world. Fearing such doom as a certainty has become less of a concern since the end of communism and the arms race. With the fears diminished, the message of this film may have weakened considerably.<br /><br />The material presented here would have made for better viewing if turned into a 20-30 minute short film. To stretch a story that can be summarized in 2 paragraphs into a feature film is, like the words suggest "stretching it". The congenial leads make the viewer empathise with their plight, yet it is understood that there will be no happy ending. It's like purchasing a one-way ticket to an unknown destination. All you know is that you will not return home. This is no "Day After", but OK viewing for fans of love stories.
