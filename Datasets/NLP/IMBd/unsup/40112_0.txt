Any fan of the Hellraiser series will be sickened and insulted to see that the entire franchise has been reduced a teen slasher comedy/horror joke. It's hard to believe that director rick bota, who actually created the dark and atmospheric "Hellraiser: Deader" is responsible for this putrid. With the look of a student film gone wrong, bota sets up his ditsy teens in a stupid haunted house to get ready for the slaughter. The premise is that these kids are all attending a 'Hellraiser' party, fans of a stupid video game. Yes; this movie claims that Pinhead doesn't really;y exist: he is actually a video game! If you don't believe me, just take a look. you will be shocked at how incredibly bad this one is. With the look and all the style of a horrible made for TV movie, this one is certainly the death blow to the franchise. Absouletely sad and embarrassing... but should be seen only to see just how bad a film can be.
