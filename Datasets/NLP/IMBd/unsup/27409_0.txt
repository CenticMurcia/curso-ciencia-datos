Oh I laughed and cried. Maybe I went in to it looking too hard, but this made for TV presentation is a lousy and by-the-numbers knock-off ('Predator' for most part) ah most of this cable ilk could be labelled so, but where it got me was how passé it was on delivering thrills and excitement. Yes, the story didn't draw me in at all (and does it get silly in the latter half) and the transparent characters would only annoy (not a good sign), so I was hoping they would up the ante, but it just smoldered along as it seemed to be running on empty and the macho dialogues were utterly pathetic. It didn't roll off the tongues, but felt forced and clunky. I just wanted some fun. No so luck. Hey one thing I couldn't knock though, even though it looks cheap however the CGI was competently executed and never overdone in any way. They even used some passable puppet designs too, and the main alien design works out well despite being a cross between 'Predator' (mainly the armour it wears) and alien from 'Enemy Mine'. Disappointing was that the action with these CGI beasties is cut-up and blurry, making it hard to adjust and the block-headed characters get plenty of time but in the end they aren't worth it. Brian McNamara was so-so, but the rest were largely forgettable, just like this whole presentation.
