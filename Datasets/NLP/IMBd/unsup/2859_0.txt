Lenny is a powerful movie about the life of tortured comic Lenny Bruce and his wife Honey. The surprise of the film is it focuses a great deal of time on Honey, which is fine because I am all ready very familiar with the entire story of Lenny Bruce. His wife is usually not talked about as much and this movie does a good job dealing with her. The acting is excellent, Hoffman is dead on as Lenny Bruce, he looks and acts a lot like him. Perrine is just as good as Honey. The movies only flaw is that I know so much about Lenny Bruce, a lot of this felt like old material. But the acting and atmosphere more than makes up for the fact I all ready knew most of what would happen in the movie.
