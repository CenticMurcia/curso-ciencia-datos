Maybe a dingo ate this movies real script, and producers were forced to go with this one instead. Or perhaps star and Producer Paul Hogan believed the audience would drink so much "Foster's" beer they wouldn't realize how awful this movie is! "Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles" is a lazy copy of the original movie's fish out of water story line. But that fish has been out of water for 15 years now, and its stinking up the theatre!<br /><br />And really, the original "Crocodile Dundee" was a one joke movie as well. "Watch what happens to this wacky Australian guy who doesn't know a thing about our modern society!" While this formula charmed us back in 1986 -- it now only makes you want to throw Paul Hogan, and a few shrimp on the barbee for inflicting this boring and derivative flop on us! If you go see "Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles" you won't have a G'day Mate! 1 and a half stars out of 5
