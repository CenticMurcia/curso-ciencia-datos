I hate paying good money to see Hollywood blockbusters. They are all just the same old, same old. Blow something up, two actors divorce their spouses in real life because of their co-stars, boy meets girl and boy loses girl and boy becomes hero and gets girl again. Yawn! But when I sit down to watch The Lost Princess, I'm absolutely entranced, no matter how many times I have viewed it in the past. This movie gives you a great insight into the world of the Renaissance Festival, plus it's mighty entertaining! Several of my favorite Ren Fest acts make prominent appearances in the film. I love The London Broil, though in the movie you never see them juggle on rolla-bollas! Hey Nunnie Nunnie make a most memorable appearance in the film as two less-than-reverent nuns. Lolly Foy does a brilliant job as Queen Eleanor (and I give props to her durable corsets!) And I do believe Krankenmal is my favorite Miguel alter-ego to date! Esmerelda (aka Dakota Star Granados) is becoming a formidable Ren Fest star, not to mention quite a capable actress! And the soundtrack to this movie has some very valuable jewels you might want to check out! If you tried very hard, you could find many faults with the movie, especially considering it ISN'T a big-budget Hollywood production. But if you're looking for a fun time with the best acts The Renaissance Faire has to offer, look no further than The Lost Princess!
