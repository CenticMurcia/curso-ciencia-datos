Do not, I repeat, DO NOT be fooled by the title or synopsis here.<br /><br />"Quest of the Delta Knights" may seem like, "Hey, cool!!!!! This movie rocks!!!!!," but in reality, it's "HEY!!!!! THIS MOVIE STINKS!!!!! BLEECH!!!!!" I mean, this movie is nothing but chock full of mistakes, goofs, continuity errors, plot holes, etc. I mean, would anybody, and I repeat, ANYBODY actually like this movie!!!!! I won't!!!!!<br /><br />Unless, of course, it's featured on "Mystery Science Theater 3000," as it was on episode #9.23. Mike and the Bots have done such a terrific job ripping this movie apart like a dog would rip apart a fancy $500 dress shoe, and the Minnesota-area participants that played the people in the Delta Knights Pancake Breakfast scene!!!!! That's amazing!!!!!<br /><br />So, pick which version you want to watch. If I were you, I'd pick MST3K!!!!!<br /><br />1/10
