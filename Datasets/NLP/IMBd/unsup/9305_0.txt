If crap carries a name it sure is Megalodon! In my entire life never did i see a worst movie! On the other hand ,i'm sure this was intended to be a movie, it was probably designed as a something, the big nothing, created especially for the drunk people to make them puke! If i wanted computer animation i would have watched some Pixar arts, not this waste of time! this film does not have anything original in it. from the beginning you can tell who lives and who dies, and when it stars to get interesting it ends! I feel sorry for the producer! my guess is that if he'd gave the money to the homeless he'd get a better profit!
