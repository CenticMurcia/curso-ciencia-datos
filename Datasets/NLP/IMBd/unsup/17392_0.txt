Sure, how many times have we seen the same old Romeo and Juliet portrayal? Thousands, sure... but art is also found in interpretation. This will evoke some kind of feeling, if it doesn't then I seriously think you weren't able to appreciate it! The soundtrack is amazing, one of the best I've heard on a film so far, the script leaves a lot of room for improvement for my taste, but its somewhat compensated by the artistic risks taken by the director to highlight racial differences, conflict and equality. My only criticism is Ximena's Sari√±ana's acting (Renata's sister), who is a fabulous singer (proven by the soundtrack), but unfortunately a poor actress. Hats off to the character Ulises and the actor who plays him, since I think his performance was absolutely real, believable, sincere and just superb.
