When I say Bela Lugosi was wasted, I am not talking about his being intoxicated, but how the small part given him was poorly developed and how he had very little of interest to do in the film. Why they gave him the thankless role of the bland servant and not Lionel Atwill's or Joseph Calleia's part, I don't know. Whatever the reasons, his rabid fans (and they are a VERY devoted lot) will no doubt be disappointed by his role.<br /><br />Now as for the Ritz Brothers, they were a third-rate comedy team and this film is exactly what I expected from these unfunny brothers. Aside from making a few facial grimaces here and there, they were completely unfunny and irritating--sort of like less funny versions of Brown and Carney (now THAT's bad) or even Allen and Rossi (now that's REALLY bad).<br /><br />The plot itself is very muddled and confusing. It's about a serial killer, Atwill's disappearance and a guy dressed up in a very unconvincing gorilla costume. Don't watch it unless you are a glutton for punishment. The score of 4 is only because Atwill and Lugosi infuse a little bit of life into this dull film. The less said about this unfunny film, the better.
