ok, Tank is under the curse, and he is making a puppet, which is going to contain his life essence... I understand this part. what I don't understand is why is he carving a humanoid body, when he ends up as a TANK!?!? I Don't get it.... also the use of old footage for the puppets is just bad. I usually enjoy full moon films.. . I did not enjoy this.....
