Excellent casting. Scott Perry did a bang up job on this short. I personally recalled elements of Alan Arkin's "Simon", Lucas' "THX-1138" and the British sit-com "Asylum" (Simon Pegg). For a small production, it was well shot and appropriately lit. I especially enjoyed the fact that Perry played the character "straight", as it were, and gave that realistic push in order for the audience to appreciate the plot. I hate the point system, and cinephiles might become physically ill at my rating as compared to the history of short film, but I think it's a keeper. I mean, it ain't no "La Jetee", but as far as relevance to virtual reality and drug culture, it does have a place.
