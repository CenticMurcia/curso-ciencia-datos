This movie butchers The Return of the King, and doesn't stand well on its own. The transitions between Gondor and Mordor are sloppy. At one point, the scenes in Mordor get so far ahead of those in Gondor that they had to add narration at Mount Doom saying "Sam searched for Frodo for days..." when the subsequent events took place only seconds later.<br /><br />The narration could have been far more effective. In this movie, there is a lot of narration, but it is usually pointless. They cut a lot of the book out, yet fill in few of the gaps with explanations.<br /><br />And the songs..."where there's a whip, there's a way" has to be a low point in cinema.
