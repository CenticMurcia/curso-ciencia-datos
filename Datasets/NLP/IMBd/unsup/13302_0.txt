First of all, this film is a sequel to Hitokiri (1969). Thats one of the classic Samurai swordfighting films with very fast action scenes thats still better than much we get to see today.<br /><br />"Izo" starts where the first film ended. The protagonist is crucified for his crimes that he committed as a hired terrorist in the service of those who tried to restore the old regime.<br /><br />But he finds himself alive again, at first not understanding that he has taken on a demonic existence because his soul cannot rest and he must descend through the layers of hell in full consciousness.<br /><br />Following his motto from the first film, "Divine punishment", he sets out to take revenge on the world and on the gods for getting him into this whole mess.<br /><br />This film may be another blood bath, but the philosophical content is also enormous. Miike film-making at its very best, another no-budget production whose profundity may give the watcher stuff to think about for years.
