Like the previous movie games, this one is also based off the motion picture film and depicts Spider-Man bonding with a dark entity that changes his entire persona and life to a great evil. When it nearly ruins his life, he realizes he must cleanse himself of the suit.<br /><br />While the game follows up on a big blockbuster movie, do not let that fool you. Graphics may be one of the only greatest things about this game. The graphics are the best any Spider-Man video game has seen yet and a step up from the Superman Returns video game graphics. It isn't comparable to Gears of War, but certainly is great on its own level.<br /><br />However, the downfalls overpower the pros. First is the monotonous city. The hyped up improvements die quickly as the explorable subways and sewers become old. The citizens of Manhattan no longer thank, yell or cheer on their friendly neighborhood, Spider-Man. A few improvements include cars that actually hit you if you get in the middle of a busy avenue- but the lackluster atmosphere of the city from inaccurate landmarks to zombie-like citizens certainly is a downfall.<br /><br />This time around the missions are different and the player gets a unique feature to play any story missions in any order. Unfortunately there is no continuity as the missions feel scrambled and it is unbelievable that so many things could be happening in the city all at one time. To make matters worse, players only get a mere three missions representing the movie storyline whilst everything else is filler. A few disgruntled fans and critics of the movie argued about cramming too much into a Spidey film. In here- it almost seems mimicked.<br /><br />Spider-Man is greatly improved however in his own graphics and fighting techniques. He is even more powerful using the black suit. Yet Spider-Man is the only decent character in the entire game and through time, it doesn't even feel like a Spider-Man game you are playing with all the costume changes (Rhino looks like the Juggernaut from X3). Bruce Campbell as the narrator sounds bored with his job this time around and the villains seem to reflect the little screen time they had in the movie.<br /><br />Sandman for instance appears out of nowhere on your first mission using the black suit and you almost wonder if Spider-Man is having a nightmare. Sandman's transformation in the game is also a rip-off as we see it in a mere 3 seconds in the opening credits. Eddie Brock appears about 2 times tops in the video game, and Venom in only one mission. The same is said for Harry Osborn who makes two appearances and is nothing like the way he was in the movie. Unlike the first two games where we see the detailed and sometimes emotional transformations into their villainous persona's such as Norman Osborn into Green Goblin or Octavius into Doc Ock- the villains here appear in the blink of an eye and are long gone before you realize it.
