Greetings and if any of this does indeed spoil the movie for you then you really have not missed much anyway but there is a disturbing aspect with this production that just must be commented on. Using real Bush footage and not making the movie based on a fictional character is just stupid and also inviting if not inciting assassination as a glorified and approved method of action. The major problem with this is its banality. All the people are just mono-dimensional and so obvious that its painful. The reconstructions of the forensic evidence or lack of it would never pass in the real world unless you were in a totalitarian dictatorship. If these people are suggesting that, then they are worse than stupid. The next infuriating thing is the incredible lack of any balance regarding the Bush presidency and what has really been done during his Republican period. It is almost as if these people at Borough were paid for under the table as a Democrat Propaganda film. One wonders where the money came from (really)? The production technique was fairly good and that was what the 3 points were for. But it is just unbelievable that in this advanced western culture we still get garbage like this passed off as a work of art etc. just like that idiot Michael Moore. It is nothing more than the ravings of a fringe delusional leftist ideology and belongs in the coffers of regrettable efforts in the making of motion pictures. Just in case you are wondering. I am European and not a US Republican. But I suppose that will not matter because the Democrats and all the wet liberals and leftists are so closed minded that any thing that puts down Bush must be just brilliant. Poor fools you!
