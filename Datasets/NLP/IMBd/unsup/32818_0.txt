I'll watch Evan in anything (her she is in one of her earliest roles), even in this tepidly uninspired rehash of the Fatal Attraction/Hand that Rocks the Cradle tone. She still shows her remarkable poise and maturity as a performer at a very young age (she was 11 when it was filmed), but this lifelessly conventional release doesn't deserve her.<br /><br />In Down will Come Baby, she plays Robin Garr, a young, mostly anti-social adolescent silently worried about the arising tensions at her upper-middle-class home. Her mother wants to move to Denver with a high-paying new job, but her Dad wants to stay in their Phoenix suburb and continue his burgeoning architectural career. So, with the growing distant relationship between the family despite her parent's earnest and loving efforts, it looks like the film's headed for a potentially affecting domestic drama.<br /><br />Not quite. As Robin takes a trip to camp during the early summer, she finds solace with another remote camper named Amelia, a young, sad-eyed girl that seems to be hiding something. Over the next few weeks they bond into best friends, not caring that they are somewhat removed from the rest of the campers and counselors in the entire place.<br /><br />One night, however, when they sneak away from the campfire to have a night-swim, Robin doesn't seem too worried when Amelia warns that she's not a very skillful swimmer. As she soon gets stuck out in the middle of the lake, barely being able to keep her above the water, Robin's belated attempt to save her ends up in tragedy as she immediately drowns below the lake.<br /><br />And all that certainly didn't make for a benign homecoming. Even as her parents try to calm her by telling her it wasn't her fault, she still blames herself, and has a tough time adjusting to her regular life back home. It certainly doesn't help that her mother is often gone to Denver, and when she is home the tensions of the distant relationship with her husband are quietly manifested, as Robin watches with her worried, faintly melancholy eyes.<br /><br />However, one day, luck might seem to change, as a stroll through the park she meets Dorothy while sitting a park bench, an unusually intriguing one who just happens to move in to her apartment building the next day. At first, she seems like the perfect older mentor for robin, as she enjoys spending time with her after school and showing her how to bake and do other rather useful things.<br /><br />After a while, though, she seems to have become obsessed with young Robin, as she soon starts popping out of everywhere at any time to try and spend time with her, to an alarmingly excessive degree. So it should come as no surprise that Dorothy happens to be the resident psyhco, hiding a baby monitor in Robin's room to listen in any conversation that takes place in there, surreptitiously taking photos of her from the balcony and angrily lashing out on her when she happens to put too much chocolate chips in the cookie batter. It starts to frighten Robin, as she tries to avoid her completely, though her parents tend to differ on their views of Dorothy: her Mother gets worried as she perceives subtle signs of nefarious intent in Dorothy, though her Father thinks she innocuous and a reliable baby-sitter for robin. Then, on one night, as her mother is in Denver and her father has to visit a client in California, he invites Dorothy to come sit for her as he is away, despite his wife's warnings not to do so, and... well, I guess you can pretty much fill in the blanks right here.<br /><br />As usual, Wood manages to carries the film with grace and makes her robin completely believable, and lifts the film into watchable territory. However, Down Will Come Baby doesn't merit the attention that Wood deserves. The film seems like it was written, directed and produced strictly for late-late-night cable TV: it's tedious, poorly paced, often over-the-top and offers no surprises (or thrills) whatsoever. It's plot contrivances are shameless, and they seem as if they we're made to pluck out any possible moment of suspense whatsoever.<br /><br />That's too bad, because at the begging, it looked like if it stayed in the domestic realm it could have made for a perceptive, moving drama about family and childhood. However, it goes into the trajectory of the myriad thrillers about obsessive psychos and young kids before it, and a completely hum-drum one at that. If it weren't for Evan, I would've changed the channel (though seen during one of my insomniac nights, I didn't have a whole lot of other options), and she was, without exaggeration, the only thing worth watching in this ineptly produced dreck.
