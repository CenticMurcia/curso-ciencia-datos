This is another of a number of post Titoist Yugoslav films that deals with tragedy of the Yugoslav Split from 1991 to 1996. In the spirit of Underground, Lepo Selo Lepo Gore, and more recently Bure Baruta; the film makers use a very dark form of humour to state their disatisfaction with the times and the system of that period in the capital of Belgrade.<br /><br />Like the other films, a thorough understanding of the Serbian mentality and the background to the events of 1991-1996 is crucial in making sense of many of the themes and images seen in the film. This probably a bad facet of this film for a lack of understanding by the viewer paints the picture of the Serbs even darker than it actually is.<br /><br />The viewer should also keep in mind that Belgrade is not a fair and complete reflection of Serbia and the Serbian people as would the rediculous idea that Paris is a reflection of France. This would have to be one of the biggest criticism that can be and should be aimed at the current school of Serbian producers, directors and writers.
