This movie is hilarious. Every single time I watch I laugh. I think that the acting is terrific and wonderfully over the top. That is the point of the movie, for the characters to be way over the top. My personal favorite is Agador played brilliantly by Hank Azaria. Every single time I see Agador I just my head off. Albert comes in an extremely close second, he is very funny and he makes a terrific women in drag. Nathan Lane is a genius! The chemistry between all the characters is wonderful. And for the record I have a lot of gay friends and a gay relative and none of them find this movie offensive in the least. They all think it is funny too.
