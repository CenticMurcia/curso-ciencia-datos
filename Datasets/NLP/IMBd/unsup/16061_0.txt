This is a typical attempt to make a sequel movie to others that have rocked the box offices, such as the American Pie and Road Trip series.<br /><br />The plot is stereo-typical, the acting is bad - not necessarily on any one actor's experience, but more on poor script-writing, bad editing and poor direction. There are some very accomplished actors in this movie, but unfortunately they were given sleeper roles.<br /><br />In my opinion, this movie was not worth the $3.99 + tax I paid to rent it. I would have been very disappointed if I had paid theater price to see this movie (if it had a theater run even.)<br /><br />If you don't mind paying to download movies from an authorized download site and viewing them on your PC or renting "sleepers" from your local Movie Rental location, then its up to you to see it. I would however, recommend viewing a movie like "Guess Who" or "The 40 Year Old Virgin" as an alternative.
