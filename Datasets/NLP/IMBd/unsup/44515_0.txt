Mind numbing in its awfulness. Director Giulio Paradisi concocts a ridiculous mixture of horror and mysticism while roping in a sad cast of actors, both over AND under the hill. John Huston, whose performance consists of walking into rooms, spouting a few philosophically tinged lines of inane dialog and then vanishing, leads the cast as a "visitor" sent from someplace "beautiful" to "rescue" a little girl who is evil incarnate (and apparently the vessel-in-waiting to start a new race under the guidance of creepy doctor Mel Ferrer and a bunch of corporate goons). The girl, who is a curiously talented gymnast and ice-skater, cripples her mother, kills a couple of teenagers, uses foul language when yelling at both Shelley Winters and Glenn Ford and keeps an attack eagle as a pet. It's filmed in Atlanta but the little girl is the only one with an southern drawl. A real mess. In addition to the slumming Huston, Ford, and Winters, Lance Herickson, Sam Peckinpah and Franco Nero are in it too. Director Paradisi even has the moxie to pay homage to the likes of WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE as well as THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI.
