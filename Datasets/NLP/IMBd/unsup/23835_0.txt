Confused and shallow biography of Madame Satã, a notorious Brazilian homossexual thief fails in the attempt of give a large, acurate and more profound vision of a so curious and rich man. The movie just go on and on telling about his homosexual relationship, his exibitions as a gay singer in some old and decadent places but forget to portrait the human side of the main character, mainly his relations with the press, the intelectual of his time. The direction is electric but at the end the result is just routine. Ramos gives a superb performance as Satã but he doesn't save this lame misfire. I give this a 4 (four).
