THE ADVENTURES OF DON JUAN was the last of the great swashbuckling classics Flynn would star in.Though Flynn isn't exactly in his prime here nobody was ever better as the dashing devil may-care swashbuckling hero! Once again Flynn is reunited with his greatest screen sidekick Alan Hale,who is always a delight.Viveca Lindfors plays the Queen with grace and a strong will and her beauty further enhances her performance. Robert Douglas is no Basil Rathbone but he still makes a fine villain.The score by Max Steiner is very fast paced and exciting and the duel between Flynn and Douglas is also nicely staged. All in all this is a truly entertaining adventure with Flynn as dashing and heroic as only he could be!<br /><br />MY RATING: 9/10
