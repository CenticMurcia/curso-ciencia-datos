Kurtlar Vadisi may be a good time passing movie for the ones who have to much empty time. Actaually I didn't like the serial at all. Why may you ask? Well it's very hard to see a movie who takes all the mafia com-plots in one, with poor action and bad acting. It seems just like they created the other Octopod (the serial Italian movie about mafia) with a little less touch. Also I didn't like the so called Polat Alemdar smoking cigarettes quite in every screen, making him self very charismatic with his Zibo lighter (a friend of mine restarted smoking for this, I am not 100% sure thought but yes it gives you effect). Well the beautiful actress Özgü Namal (in Elif Eylül role) tried very hard and she showed her best performance but she could't do any miracle surrounded by ''not at all good'' actors. Long story short ''Bad''. It's not worth being watched, as long as you have to much empty time!
