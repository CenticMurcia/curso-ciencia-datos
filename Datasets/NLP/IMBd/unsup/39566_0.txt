this film, at least as far as the DVD jacket is concerned, is portrayed as an action movie about the changes that take place in soldiers seeing combat. Until the battle scene is over and you realize that the focus is instead going to be on their post-combat return to civilian life, you are expecting something unique and insightful. This movie is so clich√©' ridden as to be laughable, from the conceit of a short-timer squad going out on one last patrol (yeah, yeah, the same as every 19 year on-the-job cop movie where the sergeant dies the day before retirement, yawn), to the PTSD laden troubles that have been shown over and over in so many movies, so much better, in the past 30 years. I'm truly embarrassed for Samuel Jackson. I would have thought he would have had much better sense in selecting a script. He does great. Can he not? But THIS film? I'm 3/4 the way through and still waiting for just a hint of something original that I have not seen before (employment woes, civilian misconceptions, drug and alcohol abuse, slams against the VA -yawn). And don't get me started on offering a role to an overpaid gangster like fiddy cent to try and lure viewers instead of spending the money on talented writers. Man, this is the first time in my life I have been so incensed at such a misrepresentation of an unoriginal film. I will ask for my money back.
