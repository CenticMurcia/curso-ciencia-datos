This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. What a waste of an outstanding actress in the first segment The first segment had so much potential but then they moved on to the next segment... Miss Tree put the bird back in and the home was empty. What happened to Miss Tree ? Where the girls in the 1961 segment related to Miss Tree ? No connection between the segments... This film is a waste of time and does not promote any cause.. A film that never should have been made
