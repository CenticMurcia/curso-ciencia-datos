This film is one of my all time favourites , it reminds me a great deal of trading places, in as much as it has very funny,quotable scenes, but also a solid story that strings along the jokes. <br /><br />Michael Keaton just bounces off the walls as Billy Blaze, it is still to this day ,one of his most memorable turns. Henry Winkler obviously wanted to play against his persona as the Fonz, and manages inject great pathos into his character , without ever being overly sentimental. <br /><br />Shelley Long is a master of light comedy , she may not instantly be an actress one would consider to play a lady of the night, but realism would have worked against this film ,as it really is a flight of fantasy.<br /><br />Its a true feelgood comedy, well written, well acted and very likable, in other words ,far superior to cynical, race to out-gross , slew of humorous films we are subjected to now.
