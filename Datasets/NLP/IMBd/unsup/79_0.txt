A plethora of stars are here. I was surprised to see a fay Billy Crystal, annoying Regis, Mike Brady, Burgess, Ginger, Q, Peter Graves. It's Titanic in the sky as anything that can go wrong does go wrong on this plane's maiden voyage. Lots of sub plots are thrown at you and still no story can be found. I loved the realism of how passengers could easily walk up and down aisles freely during the flight. This wild ride couldn't end any faster for me.<br /><br />
