This movie starts out with an excellent premise: a young witch named Kiki, following the ancient tradition of her kind, leaves her home for one year to train to be a full witch, and find her special skill. Her mom, for instance, is a healing witch. But all Kiki knows is flying, and everyone can do that! She must brave the outside world and find herself in order to become a full-blooded respectable witch. Sounds good, right? Well, it would be, if the script wasn't awful. The plot then goes into her flying delivery service way too much, and not enough into interesting things. Also, apparently most people believe in witches. Wouldn't it be more interesting if her witchitude was a source of problems between her and her new society? Worse, she is barely a witch, because there is no training, no finding of a new skill, barely any discussion of other witches, nada. There's also no 3-dimensional characters, almost nothing deep, enthralling, or unexpected, and NO REASON TO LIKE KIKI AS AN INDIVIDUAL!!! She's a happy-go-lucky bumbling 13-year-old girl, until she comes upon a friend who happens to be a boy her age, and then she acts like a cold-hearted shrew. Everything that should go wrong does, and everything that should go right does. Plus there are WAY too many shots of her underwear for a G-rated movie. Has Kiki never heard of wearing shorts under her witch's gown?! The only reason I did not give this movie a 1 is because the drawings are lovely. Oh, by the way, this must be set in France. It's never stated, but there is no way in H-E-double-hockey-sticks that this is set in Japan.
