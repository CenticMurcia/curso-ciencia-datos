The film was dire in the extreme, filled with bad acting, bad writing and a poorly structured plot. Lines such as 'But you're the only healthy one left!' fail to stand out when written down; yet when combined with the delivery in the film they are poor enough to induce laughter. Fortunately this film managed to achieve the so bad it's good category, one reserved for films which are enjoyable solely through the realisation that although you yourself may not be able to do better, you certainly would bury any attempt this bad deep underground to prevent the embarrassment of having the general public see it.<br /><br />If you enjoy a bad film and have enough people round to mock it, then see the film. In all other circumstances avoid it.
