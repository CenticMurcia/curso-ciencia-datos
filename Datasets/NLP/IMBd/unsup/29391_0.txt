I am a stand-up advocate of the obvious as long as it's done well. The Bodyguard is a straightforward thriller with and entirely believable romance, told in a manner which makes you feel, er, both thrilled and warm.<br /><br />Not only are there no surprises here, we are also seeing another in a long line of films made specifically to showcase the talent of one of the stars looking for a new pocket of audience for their great success elsewhere. No doubt a fair proportion of the audience that went to see The Bodyguard and bought the videos, DVDs, soundtracks and, no doubt, fridge magnets were only interested in new performance footage of Whitney Houston the (unarguably gifted) singer and a fictional dramatisation of what they imagine her fabulous, starry life to resembles.<br /><br />No matter. This issue is decently integrated into the film. Costner gives us just enough ennui to translate into genuine care and Mick Jackson understands how the star and fans want to commune with it all. 4/10
