I saw this movie on TNT a few months ago, for only about the second or third time in my life. I had remembered it as very creepy and scary, but the last time I saw it was when I was 12 or so. I was able to tape it and view several more times now. And as an adult viewer, I have to admit that it's pretty goofy and unconvincing, in that you have to believe some fairly silly, improbable things to get even a slight tingle up the spine from it. (And as a child I never really appreciated how hopelessly racist the film is). There isn't the slightest mystery about what's going on either; unless you're in the clutches of severe Attention Deficit Disorder you know from the get-go who's responsible for all this death and mutilation. Sure it scared me at age 12; so did "The Screaming Skull". Maybe it's just skulls that give me the creeps.....
