Have you ever seen an Asian horror movie with BLACK HAIR????? I haven't this was the first =D=D=D=D=D.<br /><br />OK I lied... almost all have the element of long hair doing this and that.<br /><br />If you're a little teen liking seeing horror movies for the first time in your little life then OK, I do get it.<br /><br />On the positive side the cinematography is good. This is not a micro-budget -dv movie...<br /><br />I didn't get scared even once. I thought horror movies were supposed to make feel nausea and scare so that sh*t in your pants.<br /><br />Not this one... luckily I didn't pay for this one as my friend rented this one \o/.<br /><br />Next time is my turn.<br /><br />I think that these horror movies have turned quite a bit more non-scary when I stopped smoking hashish and weed prior to the experience few years ago. For some strange reason I remember what's going on =D.<br /><br />It's not bad, but it's not great... or maybe I'm a tired man who don't feel nothing no more.<br /><br />And I do hate christians and religion =D.<br /><br />I know what is wrong with these movies... the pattern to scare you is always the same. Silence broken by fast movement of some unnatural effect accommodated with lots of bass... the sounds are also so convergent in all these movies. It is like as if these movies don't take risks of any kind and take the people watching for granted...<br /><br />I mean I'd like to see some really disturbing stuff... I think that I could make a really disturbing movie. Something in the vain of modern Exorcist crossed with old Italo-horror. Also taking utter violence, and making bodies look real... I mean bodies hardly ever look real in movies.<br /><br />I DEMAND ULTRAVIOLENCE AND UNLIMITEDHORROR NOT SOME TEEN CRAP!!!! =D=D=D=D=D=D=D=D=D=D=D=D=D=D=D=D=D=D=D=D=D=D WHERE'S THE BLACK METAL FEELING?
