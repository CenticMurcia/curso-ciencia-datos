Nemesis 4 follows in the footsteps of the previous two sequels to the original Nemesis. It follows the adventures of female hardbody / warrior Alex (played by Sue Price). This time she is given one final assignment (kill yet another victim) before ending her career as a professional assassin. Very little happens in this extremely talky, apparently near-zero budget film, except for almost-constant nudity on the part of Alex, and some slimy "android" gore. Something happened here. All three sequels were shot at the same time, from what I have heard, yet it took nearly four years for this installment to get released to video. I could swear that a male double was used for much of the full-body views of the nearly-naked Alex, and Alex's voice was always dubbed in, even when it should not have been necessary. The actual running time is barely over an hour. Did something happen to Sue Price, making it necessary for extensive reshooting or re-editing? Watch this movie, and see if YOU can figure out what went wrong. One can only hope this is the last film in this series.
