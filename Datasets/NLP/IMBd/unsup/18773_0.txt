I'll admit I trailed off a little towards the end, but this second Dirty Harry sequel from director James Fargo (Every Which Way But Loose) didn't seem very interesting anyway. Basically 'Dirty' Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) foils a liquor store robbery after driving a car the robbers wanted through the front and killing them, causing thousands in damage. As punishment he is relegated to Personnel to see which patrol officers become inspectors, three out of eight places to be filled by women. Meanwhile a group called the People's Revolutionary Strike Force (PRSF), led by Bobby Maxwell (DeVeren Bookwalter) plan a rampage in San Francisco, and Harry's long time partner is killed during their big weapons theft. Vowing revenge, Harry and his new partner, not brilliant Human Resources department officer Kate Moore (Tyne Daly) try to catch these suspects, and she later proves resourceful. Eventually the PRSF kidnap the Mayor (John Crawford) and demand a $2,000,000 ransom, so Harry goes undercover to find Maxwell and his gang, leading to a final showdown. Also starring Bradford Dillman as Capt. McKay, Harry Guardino as Lt. Al Bressler, John Mitchum as Insp. Frank DiGiorgio, Albert Popwell as 'Big' Ed Mustapha, Samantha Doane as Wanda, Jocelyn Jones as Miki and M.G. Kelly as Father John. Eastwood still does well with the gritty attitude and one or two good one liners, and the film has it's moments of action and explosion, but to be honest, it was a little boring. Clint Eastwood was number 18 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 61 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and Harry Callahan was number 17 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains. Okay!
