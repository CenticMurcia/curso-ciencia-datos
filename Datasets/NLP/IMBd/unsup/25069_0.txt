I was lucky enough to check out this indie film and I was thoroughly impressed. The Kevin Smith influence is obvious, though the film pulls it off well. Lots of sophomoric humor offset with some great moments. The cinematography "felt" a little "indie"- as in not shot by an ASC member, but still felt solid. The same goes for the editing. The writing had to be the best part- lots of great one liners and witty banter. The guys were funny, the girls attractive- the way it needs to be in the type of flick. Clearly the film is a labor of love and it shows. It was shot on a prosumer video camera- probably the way Kevin Smith himself would do it if he were to start his career at this moment. Yet, the film is more watchable than many of the Hollywood films out at the moment. Imagine what these guys could do with a budget... Highly Recommended!
