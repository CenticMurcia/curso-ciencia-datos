Pitch Black was above average sci-fi/action/horror movie and it had very interesting main character called Riddick. The Chronicles of Riddick manages to completely lack the first and to somewhat ruin the latter.<br /><br />First I found the fantasy elements of the movie somewhat stupid. Where was all that in Pitch Black? I have nothing against fantasy films but to me it seems that the whole world of Riddick went through the looking glass sometime during those five years and it just doesn't make sense.<br /><br />Second problem was that I obviously wasn't part of the target audience - the movie felt very childish with all the WWE fight scenes, illogical series of events that doesn't deserve to be called a plot, lack of graphical violence while being an action movie etc. I really wasn't expecting Riddick to return as some kids' action hero.<br /><br />And then the story itself. One part David Eddings, one part Star Wars and one part pick-your-favorite-super-hero pretty much sums up this movie. As a formula that might sound even cool but not with the script of this caliber and not with the expectations I had for a Riddick movie. How can anti-hero make his job in a PG-13 film?
