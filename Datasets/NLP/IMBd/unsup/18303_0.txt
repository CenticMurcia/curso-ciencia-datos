Very engaging game! Fantastic space-flight graphics. Two aspects of the game that made it very interesting for me were the fact that you weren't confined to flying the same spacecraft on every mission, and the different paths you can take to reach the final outcome. The video sequences were well done, and actually added to the storyline instead of just adding fluff. It's still a space-flight combat game, but an excellent one at that.
