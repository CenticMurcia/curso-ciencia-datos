With so much work done on detail in this series, I was some what shocked to see a RN Captain with a mustache. As a former Lieut in the RNVR I know that at least during the war they were not allowed in the Navy. You had to have a full beard or be clean shaven. I also noticed that several times they left a door open at night and a light was seen, Other than these two items, I must praise all involved with Foyle's for making not only a first class murder mystery but such interesting background into the war.I read somewhere that they hopes the show would go on till at V Day. I sure hope that it will and the DVD's will be on sale in the USA.
