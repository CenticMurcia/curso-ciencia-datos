A young forest ranger Danielle(Cerina Vincent)uses her lonely outpost to grieve the death of her best friend. In a cave in the forest, a Native American legend comes to life from years of slumber. The creature has already slaughtered campers and hikers and attacks the ranger outpost. The creature slowly stalks and makes her life more miserable. Danielle's boyfriend Justin(Dominic Zamprogna) tries to help to no avail. She must face the wrath of the ruthless monster and destroy the flesh-ripping creature from hell...alone.<br /><br />This horror flick is better than expected and is given some credibility by being produced by Stephen J. Cannell. Also in the cast: Greg Kean, Miranda Frigon and Eric Schweig.
