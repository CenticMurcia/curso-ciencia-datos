I worked on this show .. Don Adams WAS my boss on/off for about 5 years .. he ONLY wanted Marty Pasetta to direct .. and Don could persuade anyone to do what he wanted:) .. The pilot, James Caan, Patty Duke, Connie Stevens, Jason Miller was an hour .. there were 3 judges and just ONE winning contestant from the 4 . when we did the series .. (people flew in from all over the world to try to get on the show) .. we shot two shows a day every other day for a total of 24 episodes OR 12 days of shooting . it was quite a FEAT .. but both Marty Pasetta (he is just super) and Don Adams knew exactly what it was they each wanted and got along just GREAT .. got it all done 'on the button' . Universal, where series was shot, had never done TAPE before and all 'THE SUITS' would come to watch & see 'how is that done?' .. we gathered out audience from the tour center . the contestants had to fill out forms in various newspapers or magazines .. thousands were interviewed by casting directors on the back lot at Universal . then about 500 were seen by Don/Marty .. we had a script supervisor to help . also a censor from both NBC & CBS as it was syndicated and would be on each network around the country .. Don & I traveled around the country to promote the show . it was super . it was Don's way of 'showing how outtakes happen' .. Universal canceled the show after ONE season . but they were immediately sorry they did NOT let it run for at least ONE more season ..<br /><br />that was NOT a man off the street playing FRANKENSTEIN . that was LYLE Waggoner . who graciously came directly from his workout at the local gym due to another actor/singer or would it be singer/actor? .. uhhhh .. leaving .. <br /><br />Nancy E.
