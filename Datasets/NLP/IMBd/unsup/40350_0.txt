There is just one question (ok I am lying there are many questions, only one that matters) that pops into my mind after watching this: Why? The idea for the vengance filled superhero back from the dead has been done before and done much better: Spawn, The Crow!!(not counting those horrid sequals). The acting is beyond awful. Whomever that Jack Frost is really shouldn't quit his job at Jack in the Box just yet. If that is his real name, shoot I wouldn't want to be known for this movie. The plot has been done before, dialog was MST3K fodder, and the makeup/effects are laughable. They state they won awards for them at the beginning of the movie-they pry got them from a bunch of beauty school drop outs. Now I feel that I have to be a little more choosy when I see a Jeffery Combs movie on the shelf. This was a waste of 99 minutes, even if there is a unrated version I still think that it would stink. It felt like half of the movie was cut out. A horror superhero that slashes people up-including cops-with wolverine arm blades and you see nothing but the aftermath? The editing was irritating as hell! A gore movie with nothing shown? Why,why,why,why,why? What were they thinking?
