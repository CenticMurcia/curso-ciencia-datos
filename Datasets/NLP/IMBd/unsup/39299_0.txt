We saw this years ago on DVD and it has got to be the worst of the entire franchise it IS the worst! Basically Santas wife Mrs Clause is about to have a baby yadda yadda yadda Jack Frost comes into the picture there's a horrible It's A Wonderful Life ripoff where he sees what it would be like if he was not Santa Claus.<br /><br />The entire movie was abysmal boring like getting your teeth drilled without the novocaine basically. I understand that Christmas movies are normally heart-warming sweet and touching.<br /><br />But seriously this movie was TOO sweet it made me gag through most of it it was like being bombarded by gumdrops and cotton candy as it devoured me.<br /><br />The acting was awful everyone involved the ending was as stupid and cutesy as it could possibly get .Ugh even writing about this travesty of a Christmas movie makes me gag .<br /><br />I had such high expectations for the third one too and it let me down big time.My entire family was bored to death my mom even fell asleep during it so did my dad.<br /><br />Tim Allen looked angry bitter and bored throughout the entire movie the kids were extremely grating and couldn't act at all especially that red haired girl who played his niece in the film.<br /><br />It stinks I can't give this less then 1-star but since I can't this will have to do even though it deserves a -10.<br /><br />Oh and pay attention throughout the movie there is absolutely no chemistry with anyone just forced unfunny stale boring deliveries over and over again. The reindeer fart jokes by the way NOT FUNNY talk about lame .
