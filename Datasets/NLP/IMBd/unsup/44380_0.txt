I was confused from the first 2 Min's of the film!!.. I found it boring, confusing, poorly acted! I have seen soaps with better scripts. In fact.. script was probably on the back of a postage stamp! i turned it off after watching the first hour... shockingly POOR! 2/10 is been generous!! Don't waste your time with the movie!!! Unless you enjoy bad acting... and how the h*** did this get on DVD, in fact someone on benefits could of fronted this movie!<br /><br />LOL this sums the whole movie...<br /><br />quote from the over view "Plot Synopsis: This plot synopsis is empty."<br /><br />this is a empty movie and should never of got past the "short film project"
