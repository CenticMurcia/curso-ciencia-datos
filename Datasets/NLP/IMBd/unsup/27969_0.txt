I love movies that inspire me. And this one did. I love how INDIGO was distributed - with the exception of the 100 AMC theaters that showed the film on one day at one time, INDIGO was only shown when a community requested it and agreed to have at least 50 people come. To me, that's amazing. When was the last time you saw a new film with a whole community of people? <br /><br />I love, too, that the spiritual content was not watered down or shied away from. I had fun watching Meghan, the girl who played Grace. I would have loved to see even more of the inner workings of her character, of what it was like to be her.<br /><br />This film had a $500,000 budget. For a small independent film to work on that kind of budget and produce what it did - it's just amazing. I'm impressed, inspired, and looking forward to seeing many more spiritual films like INDIGO.
