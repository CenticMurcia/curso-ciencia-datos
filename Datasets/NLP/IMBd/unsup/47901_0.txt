Flat out one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life.<br /><br />I got it from a friend who had bought the DVD without viewing it before...it was so horrible that he gave it to me just to get it out of his house.<br /><br />I honestly couldn't finish it. It was that bad.<br /><br />The script is a mishmash of every "successful" gimmic over the past five years, the acting is second rate, the special effects look straight out of 1994 and the editing leaves you scratching your head.<br /><br />None of the actors seem to know what the heck they're doing there. As soon as you realize this, you wonder what you're doing watching it. Its like sticking around at a party no one wants to be at. Its not fun and no one wanted to be there in the first place.<br /><br />Thumbs WAY down.
