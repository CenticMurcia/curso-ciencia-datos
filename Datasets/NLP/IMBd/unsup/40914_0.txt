Frank (Junior) Coghlan portrays Sonny who, along with his best pal (Kenneth Howell) and their tiny friend Mary Lou (Shirley Temple) decide to try prospecting for gold into California's high desert region, the point of which is an attempt to gain enough money for the financing of Sonny's tuition into a military academy which his parents cannot afford for him to attend. A variety of silliness transpires during this short, much of it concerning Mary Lou's new-found desert tramp friend (Huntley Gordon) who is a victim of amnesia, but the ofttimes spontaneous roughhousing between the two teen-aged boys along with their complete artlessness causes the viewer to forget the thinly written script.
