The quintessential eco-drama of civilization, so-called, in conflict with cultures more attuned to nature. Compare to Greystoke: the Legend of Tarzan. My favorite quote from this film is the native chief explaining the limitations on his powers to the father of the long-lost boy: "Any chief who doesn't tell his followers what they want to hear doesn't stay chief very long." Do see this beautiful and poignant movie.
