This movie begins with a corporate officer who blows the whistle. As such it had considerable potential to be an excellent movie. Instead it degenerates into a stupid and unrealistic sex fantasy (but all fantasies are unrealistic). Ellen Barkin, who has a face that would stop a clock, is her usual foul mouthed self in playing the woman playing the boss, highly unlikely in the corporate world. She is so ugly and nasty one has to wonder how the corporate officer would ever consent to having sex with her but then again there is no realism in this flick.<br /><br />This guy who is black gets fired for whistle blowing. Yet he doesn't immediately get himself a lawyer and sue for discrimination. He had a slam dunk case and as educated and sophisticated as he is, he doesn't seem to realize it. He doesn't get a lawyer until it becomes clear that he is served with a summons by the SEC. Dumb, Dubmb! He would make a great witness for the SEC in a case against is former employer and in reality would have done so in his situation but that never occurs to the movie maker.<br /><br />But the movie isn't really about a whistle blower. It is only a backdrop to set up the corporate officer as a gigolo in a porn movie.
