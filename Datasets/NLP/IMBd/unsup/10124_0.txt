This film is a Western, but combines a number of strange bedfellows - the romantic comedies of Hawks (two men fight over a woman treated as a slave); melodrama (the film is brilliant at visualising the limited options open to Rachel, from the proscenium curtains looking out at a world she has no freedom in and the metronome ticking away her life, to the overall claustrophobic setting (a small farm) and limited dramatis personae), and even psychological thriller (like REBECCA, Rachel is a second wife living in the shadow of a perfect predecessor; both films share a cathartic conflagration). The unsophisticated characters conceal a complex film about family and gender, in which the usual Indian threat is more of a psychological displacement.
