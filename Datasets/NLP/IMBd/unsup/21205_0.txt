Hey, what can I say? My son, my then-future son-in-law, and most of their friends were involved with it! A good amateur first effort. Filmed in and around Rapid City, South Dakota, with Stevens High School students and staff(?). Few movies out there will thank a local preacher for the loan of his car! A few of the people involved with this film went on to bigger and better things in the entertainment world. Part of the reason this movie was made, IMO, was a tribute to a very good and popular drama teacher. These guys discovered that the Black Hills and the Badlands were good movie ground before Hollywood did. Then they went on to experiment with making their own. This was big stuff for high schoolers in 1992! Now, it would be on YouTube. Compared to some of the stuff I've seen on SciFi channel lately, this is still awesome and certainly wears better.
