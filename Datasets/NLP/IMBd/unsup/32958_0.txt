the film was so grainy it looked like a print from 1974...there were 3 action scenes in the movie totaling about 6 minutes...you rent these movies to see ass-kicking not a dreadful story about the death of small-town America. The reason the Rock can carry movies is because he has a personality...he is this big guy with vulnerability. he can actually act and he certainly is believable as an ass-kicker. Sorbo was horrible...he may be big but he has no presence..he couldn't scare Pauly Shore. They actually made Walking Tall 3...my God, at least Seagal would be worth watching... hit the roids Sorbo, you blow. Next time at least get a villain who weighs more than 150 pounds and increase the budget to 50 grand.
