Just caught this last night and was expecting powerful drama based on IMDb reviews, but instead found a mess of a movie. Sorry. O'Toole (whom I like) gives new meaning to "over-the-top" acting and ruins the chances of the drama having a non-camp feel. Shariff is fine, but couldn't he even draw his gun when going into arrest the killer in Paris? Duh! The actors portraying the other two suspects (Gray, Pleasance) were given ZILCH to do w/ the story (unless you count the nonsense about killing Hitler), and it doesn't help that they're more recognizable to movie audiences as Blofeld #1 (You Only Live Twice) and Blofeld #3 (Diamonds are Forver). I kept expecting Telly Savalas (Blofeld #2) to show up in a cameo.<br /><br />A really disappointing experience. Even the ending is campy!
