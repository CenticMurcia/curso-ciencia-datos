I'm ashamed to admit I've seen this. I don't know what's worst- the "plot" or the "acting" -I've never seen a more hideous and inept cast! And how about the "special effects" and lame 80's music? Not to mention the hair, clothes, the lack of continuity... and that dance sequence! Was that really necessary?<br /><br />The only positive thing I can say is that I laughed... but it's not supposed to be funny.<br /><br />And, huh, "Nilbog?" Who saw THAT coming?<br /><br />Horribly bad in an epic way. Torment friends, neighbors, love interests and total strangers with this, PLEASE!<br /><br />I Suffered through it! I inflict it on everyone I know, like the infectious disease it is. Give it a "1" but spread it around.
