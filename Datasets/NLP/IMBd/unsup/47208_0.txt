I might be missing something, but I do not understand the appeal of this particular John Hughes production. I tend to enjoy John Hughes and I am not a member of any anti-Ringwald clubs, so those types of prejudice do not factor into my acute disdain for this particular film.<br /><br />The film is woefully dated. It is not the references to records, slang or the clothes that date it. Instead the intangible style and attitude possessed by the characters ages the movie.<br /><br />On a more personal level, what makes me want to throttle this film is the is the creation of high school as the summit of life. Around this perceived pinnacle swirls "adult" conversations of understandings of life, and particularly love. I watch and cannot help to snicker at the thought that anyone would take Andie and Jack's or Andie and Iona's delving into these matters seriously. Perhaps the most realistic view of high school romance and love held in the film, as morally despicable as it is, is by Steff. This was almost as funny as overhearing a two hour symposium on love given by Paris Hilton and Nicole Richie.
