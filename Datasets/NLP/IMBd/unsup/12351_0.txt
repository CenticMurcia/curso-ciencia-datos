Unfortunately even though there is plenty of air action, one is left flat with this film. The build up is great, however as the movie comes to a close and the viewer realizes the final outcome, one cannot help but feel cheated.<br /><br />The paradox at the end is good. Kirk Douglas is (as always)a great presence. Marting Sheen's acting on the other hand, has a lot to be desired. Katharine Ross is adequate, but I would have liked to see more involvement with her character. Charles Durning's character was very good, if not a little over the top.<br /><br />This movie really had a lot of potential. It's unfortunate that the writers didn't work up a better ending.
