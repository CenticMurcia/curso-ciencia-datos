All seasons of 24 have been fantastic. I've been on the edge of my seat throughout each season!! The direction, storyline and acting is brilliant. Jack Bauer is a fantastic character...friendly, kind hearted, yet certainly not a guy to mess with.<br /><br />I only started watching 24 recently, treating myself to the first season. After that I was hooked and went to buy the other seasons. Although if I'd watched 24 on TV and had to wait each week for an episode I would have gone crazy. At least with the box sets I could watch 3 or 4 in a row each night! Can't wait for season 6...and the movie!<br /><br />For those who haven't seen it treat yourself to season 1 and you'll be hooked!!!! It'll be the most intense 24 hours of your life ;)
