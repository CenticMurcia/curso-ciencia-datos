I picked this one up as a "blind" rental and wasn't really expecting much from it. I'd never heard anything about it, and like most blind rentals, expected it to be very mediocre at best - I have to admit that I was very pleasantly surprised...<br /><br />The story centers around a group of kids at a high-class boarding school. The school is going on a field-trip, and anyone that doesn't want to go has to go back home for the duration of the trip. A group of four students are looking for a way out, and with the help of another student, hole-up (so to speak...) in an abandoned bunker. It all starts off as fun-and-games, until no one comes back to retrieve them. With the bunker locked from the outside, the group has no way out, and the tension builds as supplies run out and the "fun" comes to an end...<br /><br />I thought this film was pretty dead-on in every sense. The casting and acting were great, the transition within the bunker from a fun party-place to a death-trap is palpable, and the story has some pretty inventive twists that I didn't see coming. I highly recommend this one for horror or thriller fans who want something a little different from the average slasher/zombie/alien/serial-killer, etc...types of films. 8.5/10
