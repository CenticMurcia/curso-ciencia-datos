This is an amazing TV series focusing on the investigation team of NCIS who investigate a number of things including brutal murders, terrorist threats, kidnaps and other things happening inside the navy while developing a close friendship. It stars Mark Harmon as the head of the team special Agent Leroy Jethero Gibbs.He comes across well as the head of the team.The rest of the team consist of David McCallum as Dr Donald "Ducky" Mallard Gibbs best friend and the teams medical examiner who is both wise and a little eccentric,Michael Weatherly as Agent Tony Dinozzo Gibbs second in command who has a fantastic sense of humour and who cannot help teasing Kate,Sasha Alexander as Agent Kate Todd formally a secret service agent assigned to the presidential protection detail she may be new but she soon learns the ropes and what tragically happens to her in the episode Twilight leaves the team heartbroken,Sean Murray as Agent Timothy MGee Tony's apprentice who is only been an NCIS agent for a couple of years but soon becomes a valued member of the team,Cote DePablo as Mossad officer Ziva who replaces Kate she's a very strong character who has some very funny lines,Pauley Perrette as forensic officer Abby Sciuto a goth with a great sense of humour who is a vital team member and Lauren Holly as Director Jenny Shepard a former girlfriend of Gibbs. My favourite character is Dr Donald Ducky Mallard he has the best lines in the series. This is very good with interesting stories, characters and great action scenes well worth watching on TV or renting or buying.
