Steven King really must have lost it with this movie. Who ever thought that a chattering teeth toy could kill some one, I mean come on who thinks that is scary? I just thought it was so stupid that it was funny. I laughed through the part that the teeth attacked the guy in the recked van. Christopher Lloyd is pretty weird in this movie as well. Who ever thinks this movie is scary has never watched any movie that makes you jump. This I think is just a movie that doesn't even make sense to have even been made. But this story is funny to watch. This might just scar little kids in to not playing with chattering teeth toys, but I know some kids that this wouldn't scar.
