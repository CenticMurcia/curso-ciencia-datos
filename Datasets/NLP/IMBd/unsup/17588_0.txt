The Bad News Bears is one of the biggest "Don't judge a book by it's cover" movies you'll ever see, yeah it's one of those "Team of Missfits Coming Together" kind of movies that you see all the time, but this one is different, it's the original, no predictable victories or Disney clich√©s'. <br /><br />The movie is about an alcoholic low key unfriendly pool cleaner named Morris Buttermaker who is payed to coach a team of little leaguers after one of the kid's Dad sued the league for the right to play, the team is of course a team of underdogs, the kind of kids who you wouldn't want playing on your team in gym class; with Toby: The Nice guy who's gonna finish last Lupous, the shy one Tanner, the short- tempered, overbearing, runt Ahmad, the token black kid Engleberg, the fat kid Rudi Stein, the uncoordinated awkward guy Ogilvy, the smart one Jimmy, the curly top Jose and Miguel, the foreigners and Regi, the redhead with an overbearing sports Dad One thing I liked the best is that they give each kid a reasonable amount of screen time, some (Amanda, Kelly, Tanner,)more than others, but each a good amount, so you can know each member all pretty well, unlike most sports movies, where you only get to know a couple players, while the rest are pretty much extra's.<br /><br />together, they do not make a good team, but after Buttermaker's ex- girlfriend's daughter, Amanda joins the team to prove to Buttermaker she can still pitch and the local bully "lone shark" (as Ahmad said), Kelly Leak joins the team to tick off the A$$hat Yankee's coach, Roy Turner, the Bear's eventually get their act together and become a great team, going to the championship (and losing), still think it's sounds boring? Trust me, it's not, it has just the right amount of physical and subtle humor with the right added drama and is -somewhat- realistic<br /><br />to make a classic movie, heck, I had to almost literally drag my Mom to see this movie, and she liked it, so once again, just cause it's one of those movie's that has the most reused plots ever, doesn't mean it'll suck.
