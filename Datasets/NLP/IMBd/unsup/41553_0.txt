In the near future, vampire and non-vampire people have a difficult time getting along. Renegade bloodsuckers don't help matters by creating vampire mischief among the tasty humans. In order to help a government plan to integrate vampires into mainstream society succeed, vampire cop Adrian Paul (as Aaron Gray) teams up with human cop Bokeem Woodbine (as Steve Grant). Mr. Paul, who survived Nazis by becoming undead, is a vampire rights proponent. Paul is troubled by flashbacks, and has to avoid bloodlust. Mr. Woodbine has to overcome his prejudices against vampires, when he finds himself falling in love with sexy Chinese vampire Bai Ling (as Lucy Westenra).<br /><br />Michael Oblowitz' "The Breed" has a good supporting cast, and a stylish look; but, the plot doesn't really dig. Most obviously, the mishmash of symbolism is confusing; and, the movie becomes absurd. The "love story" between Woodbine and Ms. Ling has no teeth; in fact, the shooting of a gay vampire's testicle is played as sexier. Nosferatu and Dracula are obviously referenced. And, so is horror queen Barbara Steele, who co-starred with Adrian Paul in "Dark Shadows", as "Her name is Barbara SteeleÂ…" introduces the film's most bloody victim.<br /><br />**** The Breed (2001) Michael Oblowitz ~ Adrian Paul, Bokeem Woodbine, Bai Ling
