I saw this film when it was first released and with its all-star cast, the lines were a block long at the 41st Street Sheridan Theater on Miami Beach.<br /><br />The acting was out-standing, but the story-plot seemed sort of unrealistic. The film however was stolen by Tom Courtenay as a reluctant war-hero. Courtenay gives a brooding, emotional, sole-searching performance of a simple man caught up in the madness and terror of World War II.<br /><br />The story line just goes off in two many different directions: serial killer, murder mystery, plot-to-kill-Hitler, madness, love story, the horrors of war, hero worship, and survival. <br /><br />If you're a fan of Tom Courtenay this is a must-see. If you're not, rent another film.
