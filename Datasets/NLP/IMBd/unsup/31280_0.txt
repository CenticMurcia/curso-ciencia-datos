I have never seen a film so unique and different!!! <br /><br />'?' movie is the most original & humorous film I have seen since 'Team America'! The movie is able to link reality with fiction, like nothing I have ever experienced before, and it does it all with twisted, edgy, provocative humor.<br /><br />Its real-life, hidden camera scenes are amazing! At first you have no idea that this is real, non-scripted footage, but at the end of the film, the producers prove it to you. I have no idea how they were able to pull this stuff off, but damn its funny and impressive! And the 3 main characters of the film, West the psychopath, Art the retarded & Nancy the Lovedoll, develop so well as the film progresses, while engaging in some of the most captivating dialog / interaction of any movie I have ever seen.<br /><br />If anyone wants to see something absolutely funny & completely unique, you should definitely go see this film or buy it somewhere online, like amazon.com. I have even heard that there were 2 different versions of '?' movie made, 1 Color and 1 B&W, but I'm not exactly sure? I would love to see it again in B&W, if this version actually exists.<br /><br />Arod
