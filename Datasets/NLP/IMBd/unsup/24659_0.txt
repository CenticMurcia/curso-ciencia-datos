I almost never give movies a 1/10; even really bad films usually have some small redeeming qualities. Unfortunately Thanksgiving Family Reunion is so mind-numbing bad it isn't even worth seeing for a cheap laugh.<br /><br />Horribly delivered, unfunny, often embarrassing jokes, terrible acting, completely forgettable characters, and no plot or direction what so ever. A completely pointless waste of time from start to finish.<br /><br />Remember when National Lampoon made good films like "Animal House" and "Vacation"? Where did it go so horribly wrong? <br /><br />1/10 all the way.
