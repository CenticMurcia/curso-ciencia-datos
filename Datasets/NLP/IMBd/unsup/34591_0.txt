Billy Connolly stars a florist who finds out he has a brain tumor and that his wife wants a divorce all in the same day. Mr. Connolly's bad day is not over because he takes off from work in search of adventure and runs smack into Sharon Stone. Ms. Stone plays a woman with a gambling problem and drags along two kids with her that apparently have no father. <br /><br />The only other movie I have seen Mr. Connolly in was an old Columbo episode where he was caught partially by the evidence of him marking the rum bottle with his thumbnail so he would know when he had enough. You will be marking your DVD with your thumbnail early on on this clunker because about 5 minutes of this stinker is 5 minutes too much. Ms. Stone's accent was almost enough to send my foot through the screen. It was the worst attempt at an accent since-well since Ms. Stone's accent in the remake of "Gloria".<br /><br />Mild Spoilers<br /><br />I think that anyone can figure out where this movie is going (Connolly will bond with the kids and eventually with Sharon Stone) but I did want to mention the silent kid. It reminded me of the old joke where the a kid has never said anything his whole life until he sees a bull charging at his father. He yells a warning out to his father who gets out of the way of the bull. He asks his son why he has never spoken before and his son replies that he never had anything to say before now. The boy in this movie speaks for the very same reason.<br /><br />Last thought<br /><br />If a DVD can have features such as different languages- can't we get one where it can remove a bad accent from the movie and we hear the actress in their normal voice?<br /><br />rating 1 out of 10
