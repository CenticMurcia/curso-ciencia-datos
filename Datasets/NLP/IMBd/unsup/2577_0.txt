"A man like me" (Maður eins og ég) is probably one of the best Icelandic film ever made. R. Douglas manages to tell a brilliant story about a lonely guy seeking happiness in a simple but ironic way. The strongest points are (like in R.Douglas previous film "The Icelandic Dream") good dialogues and solid characters. I had a really good time watching this one.
