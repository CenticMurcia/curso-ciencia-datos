"Joseph" is probably Andrew Lloyd Webber's best show, because it's intentionally derivative,and everything else he's written has been unintentionally derivative. Take one calypso number, one country number, one French-bistro number, etc., et al., and you've got a hit! Throw in an astonishingly illiterate script ("Famine's hand will stalk the land" -- how's that for a mixed metaphor?), and you've got a mega-hit.<br /><br />I did, to my surprise, like Donny Osmond in "Joseph." Ain't enough. The overwhelming unoriginality, tedious score and 2d-grade libretto easily make it one of the worst musicals ever.<br /><br />As Tim Rice candidly stated in an interview, "The best line in the show was the list of the colours in Joseph's coat. And I didn't even write that."
