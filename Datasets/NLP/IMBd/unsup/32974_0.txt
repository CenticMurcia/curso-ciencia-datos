I have just saw this movie on a cable reprise, home alone, and it seems that I have to talk about the movie. There is nobody home and I ended up writing to IMDb...<br /><br />For almost one hour nothing seems to happen in the movie. Sometimes it seems that the writers are not sure about the story they are trying to tell. Bad acting from the children, confuse plot, a mess.<br /><br />The script makes no sense. The secondary plots are uninteresting and unconvincing. And I am sure there I spent too many time listening to people calling out for Lucy, present or past Lucy. Endless. Useless.<br /><br />The ending is absurd. And I would like to ask to the bad guys in the movie (or the script writer) why in hell they and their ancestors managed to keep a letter of the author confessing the crime AND the original map of the land, for 250 years. Just in case a ghost may need it?
