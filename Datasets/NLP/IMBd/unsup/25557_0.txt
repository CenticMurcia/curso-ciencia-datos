Although made on a lower budget than some of the more popular documentaries of late, "Blue Vinyl" is an excellent film. This investigative work of environmental journalism does a great job of telling the story in an informative, accessible way. It is difficult to appropriately incorporate humor into a documentary about toxic chemicals. It is equally difficult to make a documentary about plastic interesting to watch. But, Helfand and Gold achieve both of these feats. While the story is told from Judith Helfand's perspective, she is not the focus of the film. As a result, the viewer has a character to latch onto without distracting from the story. If you enjoy documentaries, or you're just curious about the topic, this is a great film to watch.
