Absolutely awful. Don't say its for kids. A 9 and 6 year old had me turn it off when I got sick of it, and very lightly suggested we watch Toy Story or Monsters Inc. instead! Usually they say "NOOOOO!", but in this case, in unison, they said "Yeah!!!!". I will admit it was a good 10 - 15 minutes after the public transportation scene, which they did like, but yuck!!!!<br /><br />What a trite useless bit of un-entertaining fluff. I like ENTERTAINING fluff, but PC take no chances we don't want to offend anyone and use jokes and clich√©s that were old when Atok made his first comic cave drawing is a colossal waste. <br /><br />Everyone in the "normal" world of this movie smiling and low key but no true warm feelings or bonds are anywhere to be found. For example: Why was the father running around town disrupting everyone's life who were strangers just because he was having a baby? I live in a big city, but if I was having a baby, I KNOW all the vendors and store keepers on my path to work and would bask in their EARNED friendships, their daily lives that interact with mine- the countless relationships that everyone (who is human anyway) has in their daily life. <br /><br />While a stranger looking incrediuosly at the antics of another can be funny, as a rule, people shouldn't be used as mere props to somehow squeeze humor from a situation- unless you are a rich actor or movie executive who has no clue what life and real relationships are _really_ all about.<br /><br />Tell me, where in the film does it get fun? Or funny? With babysitting over, maybe I'll try to watch it again. Maybe I was in a bad "mood", but really, please, SOMEONE go to where they make this stuff and shake them up! Sorry, I'm ranting. But still....
