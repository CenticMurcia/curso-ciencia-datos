If you know what you are getting into, you'll enjoy this. Sick,perverted, twisted, cheesy and funny. <br /><br />One of the best independent horror flicks I've seen in a long time. <br /><br />Many recent "B-films" decide to show everything from the start, this film has the balls to develop the character, to take its time, I kind of liked that. <br /><br />Matt nelson is dead on balls perfect for the character, Kevin O'Neil is hysterical and newcomer Tara Cardinal brings some heart into this sick film. <br /><br />Even though the special effects are cheesy (as expected with this budget), the cinematography is great, good angles, a clear effort to create a "bigger"looking picture, with scenes that look so close to film that one forgets we are seeing a DV 24p project. <br /><br />Very good effort.
