How on earth did this get an average score on IMDb of over 6 (at the time of writing)? Where to start with why it's so dire? The "acting" and dialogue are worse than that in the average porn movie (if you've ever seen a porn movie you'll know what I mean).<br /><br />The direction is appalling - there are so many scenes where you can see the actors freezing waiting for either the next line from one of the other characters or their director to yell "Cut". It's like watching the rehearsal of a bad stage production designed to "project" to an audience that just happens to have been filmed.<br /><br />There is no "chemistry" between any of the characters.<br /><br />The male "muscle Mary" lead, who admittedly has more charisma than most of the rest of the "actors" put together, and is very easy on the eye should NEVER have been cast as a "straight" lead. One certainly doesn't believe for a fraction of a second he is "in love" with the fag hag who he is supposed to have fallen for. Cast him as someone in love with himself and you might have a movie that walks.<br /><br />And the script, while containing some witty and "daring" (yawn!) bitchy one liners is insulting in its depiction of stereotypes. The plot strands are so ridiculous they become funnier than anything the "comedy" writer originally intended. <br /><br />The UK DVD has been deliberately "gayed down" in an attempt to shift copies, with a cover claiming this is "A modern-day variant on a Shakesperean comedy". No - it's a diabolically bad amateur movie that will only be of interest to a gay crowd wanting to see some eye candy (who would be better off spending their money on gay porn). <br /><br />To add insult to injury the UK DVD is a full-priced non-anamorphic copy that looks like it was transferred from an out-of-focus print.<br /><br />Avoid!
