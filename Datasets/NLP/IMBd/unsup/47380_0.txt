This movie was terrible! Judd, dude! You use the same bits in EVERY movie! Write some better stuff! Damn, this was terrible!<br /><br />Riley's character destroys numerous sinks throughout the movie. Why? For no reason whatsoever. Apatow had one or two hits with such physical comedy, but that very short era has ended. Similar to Will Ferrel's role in Talladega Nights, Riley's character runs around naked and screaming. Terrible. Not funny. <br /><br />Way too much gratuitous nudity and vulgarity. Don't get me wrong, I love vulgarity. But in this case, none of it fit. There are a few points in the movie when we see penises for no reason. Absolutely no reason. Terrible.<br /><br />I can't even put into words adequately how terrible this film was. DON'T RENT IT OR BUY IT! It was terrible!
