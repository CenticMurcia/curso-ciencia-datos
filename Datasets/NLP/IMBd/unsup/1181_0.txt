I found the move to be extremely believable  and thus gripping and fascinating to the last frame. The corruption in Cambodia is almost unbelievable, the agony of adopting a child in that country are hard to imagine. Paul Pot left a miserable, poor, largely primitive and corrupt society behind  well documented in this movie. Little is shown of the country, stressing the fact that people who come there to adopt a child have neither the time  nor the inclination  to see any of it  the aim is to finish the incredible amount of bureaucracy  and get out before someone else demands some "service charge" Both the acting as well as the direction is excellent.
