I thought the first few minutes in 2009 had potential but very soon the story turns in to a clich√© filled, below average b-movie. The details that annoys me in this film are so many that i can't count them all. I'll try to give you hints to what kind of film it is without giving away the story.<br /><br />1: How's this for an alternative time-line... the Germans had the main character of this story on the beach of Normandie with a submachine-gun and one clip... <br /><br />2: Why would a Japanese national agency have an English name (JBI.. my god..) and a graphic interface on their computers that makes the HUD in any computer-game look like the first version of donkey kong.. (not a big thing but it's just an example... )<br /><br />3: When you hear violin music in a gunfight it's OK to stop running and shooting... <br /><br />4: "OK guys: If someone is about to make an important kill everyone stop shooting so we can hear the empty shell bounce.."<br /><br />I could continue on and on but i think you get the picture.. <br /><br />It is impressive though that they singled out a credible event that could have changed history.. it seemed like a good movie for a few minutes but...... <br /><br />Could have been an OK movie in an alternative time-line.. where pathetic predictable crap isn't allowed.
