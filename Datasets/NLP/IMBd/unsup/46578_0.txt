No, seriously. It makes no sense. It's just a bunch of random nothing thrown together in as senseless as way possible. Pick up stock footage, assemble it at random, and release it as a feature film, and you'll have something easily better than this.<br /><br />So bad, it's not even funny. The only thing funny is that I watched it, and you can laugh at that.
