3480 IMDb users gave this movie an average vote of 6.2! What? Is it a joke? This movie should belong to the bottom 100. I don't get it. Who enjoys watching a pretentious no brain movie with stereotype characters and predictable clich√© plot? For almost two hours I struggled not to fastforward or just push the stop button. I have seen so many great movies lately (such as Fight Club, Gladiator, Memento, Snatch) so the only good thing about Save the Last Dance was to give me some perspective about the good movies from the bottom. I pity the people involved in this movie... and the audience.
