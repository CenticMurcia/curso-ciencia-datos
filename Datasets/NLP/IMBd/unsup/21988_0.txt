43. THE HEARTBREAK KID (comedy, 1972) Lenny (Charles Grodin) a young Jewish man, marries seemingly perfect-match Linda. On their way to their honeymoon in Miami Lenny realizes that Linda's various idiosyncrasies are driving him crazy. In Miami he meets Kelly (Cybill Sheperd) a young-WASP beauty whose lustful innuendos he falls under. After 2 days of courting her he decides to leave Lina. He follows Kelly to Minnesota where he plans to marry her. However, Kelly's rich, snobbish parents object. But he shamelessly fights for Kelly's hand in marriage.<br /><br />Critique: Extremely funny, satirical film adapted by Neil Simon and directed by Elaine May. It is Charles Grodin's best outing, proving that once he could act and have a comic touch (his persona has become strangely wooden). Lenny is the ultimate, unthinkable 'schmuck' who cons his way into any situation. <br /><br />The fun of the film relies on Lenny's unnerving pursuit of Kelly, and how his ridiculous lies and deceit work to his favor. Trying to pass himself as an honest, likable fella, we are astonished that Kelly even likes him. Thinking that 'honesty is the best policy', he repeatedly infuriates those around him. Despite all this, we can relate to this guy. Maybe because at one time or another we have sunk as low when in pursuit of someone we lust after. At the end, we do come to understand Kelly's equal fascination with him. After all, the never-say-die attitude sometimes pays off.<br /><br />QUOTE: Lenny: "You were very attracted to me. You were? . . That's cute, that's a really cute thing. So I was. . .something to do?"
