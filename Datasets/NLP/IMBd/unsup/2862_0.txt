I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Dustin gives a wonderful performance as do all of the supporting cast. Valerie Perrine has the ability to draw your attention in all respects and is a wonderful actress. The dialogue is smart and smacking and LB's words will be having you squirming in your seat in no time at all. If you wanted to know about Lenny Bruce, his thoughts, his loves, his fears and passions, Dustin delivers for you. He makes you feel as if you'd known Lenny yourself. See this movie. Why? Because _you_ need to think about the nature of things, too. - 8 of 10
