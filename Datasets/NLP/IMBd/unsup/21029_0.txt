Quite possibly the most overrated film of all time; maybe even the worst film of all time. Far from the great streetsmart action film that it is praised to be, Boondock Saints is a severely banal and contradictory film that contains poor acting, poor accents and even poorer performances. From the two brothers who are flawed, contradicted and pathetic characters, who are in the movie to tote guns and sport bible lines all to a hip soundtrack and Troy DUffy's pathetically uninteresting vision. THis movie is sacrificed to be what it became- pure Hollywood movie-making; produced only to make money and look entertaining, filled with archetypes where everything leads to something else, with no point and no vision. THe film reaches its sad low-point when Dafoe's uselessly gay character (why? why is he gay?) lets the killers go, because, well, we just don't know. That and the fact that their dad joins in the cause. THe whole movie sums it up; we don't know. And it sucks.
