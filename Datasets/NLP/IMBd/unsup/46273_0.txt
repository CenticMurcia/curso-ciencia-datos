Very poorly written & directed, I laughed a few times, fast forwarded it a few times and mainly kept watching it because Vincent Gallo kept popping up. There's more chemistry between him and David Tennant than there is between Tennant and Ms. Shaw. It would have been more interesting as a buddy movie with Tennant and Gallo getting into mischief than a poorly played out romantic comedy. Julie Delpy has the worst fake American accent I've heard in a long time. Tennant in his boxers isn't too bad.<br /><br />For fans wanting to check out Tennant in something other than Doctor Who, I'd recommend Blackpool or Learners. Einstein and Eddington was pretty good, but Tennant was sort of... cardboard in it & Casanova was extremely silly. For people wanting to check out a movie like this, but done much better I'd recommend True Romance (1993- Christian Slater & Patricia Arquette) or the cult classic Valley Girl (1983- Nicolas Cage in his first lead role and Deborah Foreman).
