Queen On Fire: Live at the Bowl DVD contains one of THE best Queen concerts. Every member of the band gave excellent performances, including Freddie Mercury's vibrant, arena rock voice will make the hair at the back of your neck stand up. Too bad I was too little to witness any of Queen's concerts when Freddie Mercury was still rocking the Earth. But now, with the magic of DVD and the power of digital remastering, you can almost feel as you're there among the other Queen fans. Great DVD for anyone getting into Queen or hardcore fans who do not own this instant classic yet. One of the minor concerns I have that really has nothing to do with the way they made the DVD, but the actual concert itself. The song "Flash" was an intro and was not really a live performance, and I would have liked to have seen it get performed live. Instead, they fly in on the helicopter when the concert starts.
