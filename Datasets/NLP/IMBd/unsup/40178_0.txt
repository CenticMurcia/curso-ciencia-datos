I honestly feel bad for the people who made this movie. You can tell that they take themselves seriously and are hoping something decent will come of their efforts.<br /><br />Unfortunately for all involved, including the viewer, all we're left with is an embarrassing excuse of a movie. I won't get into the plot - there's really no sense. As you can imagine, there's a bad guy, some good guys and a lot of kicking. The only interesting twist in this one is that the star is a woman, and she actually has some pretty decent moves, I guess. Her acting, if you can call it that, is beyond horrific, even for martial arts movies, and she doesn't have much of a supporting cast to help her out either.<br /><br />Even if you are a martial arts movie fan, stay away from this mess. My girlfriend walked in the room when I was watching it and it literally took twenty minutes of viewing to convince her that I wasn't watching a porno. I'm not sure she's convinced to this day.
