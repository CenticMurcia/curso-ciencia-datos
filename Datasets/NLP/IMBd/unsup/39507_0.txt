Every so often, the basest elements of the human race, from the Holocaust to the Great Leap Forward, gush forth and wreak havoc on the world. With the release of this atrocious work, they have struck again. OK, that may be a bit much, but I think I've made my point. Perhaps I'm being a classical snob, but I can't help feeling a bit of annoyance at the Elvis vs. Bach set-up of the movie. However, what really gets under my skin are the silly characters (talking animals as usual, one with a "cute", that is to say pointless, speech impediment), the dull, insipid plot, the heavy-handed narration, and so on. In short, when it comes to Rock-a-doodle, just say no.
