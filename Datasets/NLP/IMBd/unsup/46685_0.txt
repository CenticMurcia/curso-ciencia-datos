I would have given this 1 star, but the acting in it was not that bad, and i don't want this to reflect their performances. It is obvious what the film tried to achieve, a disaster film on a human level without the budget and the bangs, but you get the feeling that this is a failed experiment and should not be reattempted. I watched it with four other guys around the same age (22). 23 minutes into the film and we were asking each other when it was going to start. Maybe this film hits deeply in America because of their fixation with terrorism there. That is the only reason i can see for being taken in by the film. The "twist" does not leave you thinking, wow didn't see that coming, but more, "wow is that it, thank god its over". its a painful watch for the person who chose the film, although with so many positive reviews they cannot be entirely blamed. There are points in the film when you think, "what is the point of filming that", such as when Lexie is on the phone to her brother. you don't care enough about the character to want to hear her talk about nothing to a completely new character. The child; what is the point in that story line. Same goes for the co-worker(?) who comes to take her to the hospital. You just don't care. Please don't waste a night on this film. i will make you so unhappy!
