**POSSIBLE SPOILERS BELOW**<br /><br />I was impressed overall with 'Fulltime Killer'. There are obvious similarities to 'Assassins' starring Sylvester Stallone & Antonio Banderas; its basically the same premise: you have the no. 1 hit-man who's established, and the 'up and coming' young flamboyant hit-man who wants the no. 1 spot...hence the showdown between the two. I'll admit the story kinda went left field with the whole 'former cop write their story' angle. The only real difference between the two films (aside from the minute difference in storyline, characters, etc.) is that 'Fulltime Killer' has the Hong Kong action flavor, and it works. I like what the makers tried to do technique-wise....it adds to the stylish element presented here. It's your basic assassin showdown movie, and overall its executed well. Entertaining...not the best, but good.<br /><br />*** out of **** stars.
