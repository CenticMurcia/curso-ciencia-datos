Anger Management (2003)<br /><br />Top 30 - Best Comedies of All Time<br /><br />Sandler and Nicholson shine in this tremendous comedy of epic proportions. Let me start by saying that this film is solid at most times and has very frequently,scenes of great humour. The acting is good, the lines are good, the characters are good and the story is insane. This is a good film. It's good because of the casting mainly. Nicholson is the greatest non-comedian comedian in the world; if you know what I mean; his exuberant energy and insanity shine in every of his films. Sandler as always (playing the same character) is perfect for the roles he is assigned to. Furthermore, with the exception of the two leading roles, my favourite character had to be Chuck, played by John Torturro with such edge and explosiveness that it is a superb addition to the film.<br /><br />No need to analyse the film further, only to note that this is a very funny film that can be watched over and over again. What more do you want? Stick the DVD on and laugh for 100 minutes. It's great entertainment...<br /><br />8/10
