The ever-watchable Don Cheadle, who has turned in so many fine performances, here does it again, though he slightly overdoes the conscience-stricken angst (an emotion he has not yet learned to portray convincingly enough, perhaps because in real life he has not done anything bad enough to regret it sufficiently). This is a step by step depiction of infiltration into a Qaida terrorist cell at a very high level indeed. The film was written and directed by Jeffrey Nachmanoff, who clearly has considerable talent. The film is uniformly exciting, nail-biting, and fascinating. For most of the film we do not know whether Cheadle is an infiltrator or a terrorist. Some of the Arabs in the film do excellent jobs of acting, though it is a bit difficult to keep them straight, especially in retrospect. The one who really stands out is Said Taghmaoui, who was born in France of Moroccan ancestry. He plays the intense character named Omar, whom Cheadle genuinely befriends.
