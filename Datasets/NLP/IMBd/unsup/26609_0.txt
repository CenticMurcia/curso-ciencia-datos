Famous with the name''Oh My Goddess! '' instead of ''Aa! Megamisama!'', this anime was based in Norse mythology, where the Norns are three d√≠sirs by the names of Urd (the past), Verdandi (the being) and Skuld (what is to come). I personally prefer the manga series then the OVAS, but both of them are very good. What annoys me as hell is the way Belldandy always let people take advantage of her...she is so lovely and sweet, and at the same so fragile and sensitive. My favorite goddess is Urd, for sure! She is sexy and very confident.<br /><br />The varying anime series feature the main characters and are based on the same basic plot line as the original manga.<br /><br />Keiichi Morisato, one day, called the Goddess services by accident when he was ordering something to eat. Belldandy, the goddess who answered his call, tells him that he can wish anything that he wants. But Keiichi thinks that everything she is saying to him is a prank, and then wishes for Belldandy to stay with him forever. Belldandy makes his wish come true, and from now on she will live with him, to his surprise. The story shows their relationship growing, as well as new characters, like Belldandy's sisters Urd and Skuld, who are going to live in Earth with them.(They two were missing Belldandy a lot!)
