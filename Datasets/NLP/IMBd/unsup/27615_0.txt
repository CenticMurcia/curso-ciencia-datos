After the success of Silver Streak it was inevitable that Gene & Richard would be teamed up again & they are here in another very funny outing for the comedy duo. Maybe this is not quite as good as their first film together but it is still one of the best comedies around. Framed for a crime they didn't commit the two new yorkers find themselves facing a long time behind bars. Skips new found talent may be their ticket out of prison, just maybe. The film runs out of steam a bit towards the end, they don't appear to know how to end it! However the chemistry between Wilder & Pryor coupled with some other great characters & scenes make this a classic prison comedy.
