It never happened that i've been falling asleep in a movie theater.. Well, it just happened. Just came back from the play of HP-The Half Blood Prince. After an hour and a half of cheesy college teenage romance i gave up. I woke up at the very end of it and i've never been so happy to leave. Slow paced, out of track and an horrible screenplay for those who've read the book and especially for those who haven't read one of the most exciting book of the series. The book still has excitement throughout all of the story. The movie doesn't at all. At the moment i don't even feel like to trust to go see the very next and last one. After the Goblet Of Fire HP's movies have been going in decadence as far as their quality is concerned. The $10 worst spent for a movie EVER.
