Joan Collins shows true grit facing down giant radioactive ants in this muddy monster-fest directed, co-written, and co-produced by Bert I. Gordon. An island hideaway turns into Hell for vacationers after the ants have grown to enormous proportions, terrorizing the tourists and sending Collins and crew on the run. Despite good photographic effects by cinematographer Reginald Morris--not to mention a touch of class provided by Joan herself--the results are pretty ridiculous. Based on an H.G. Wells story, the film's third act laughably tries sneaking in sort of an "Invasion of the Body Snatchers"-type plot twist--and one is nearly inclined to give the picture some extra points for its moxy. It isn't art, but then it doesn't strive to be anything other than dopey excitement. As for Collins, she performs with conviction; hopefully she cashed a paycheck somewhat larger than these ants. * from ****
