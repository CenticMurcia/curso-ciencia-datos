I feel like I do not need to see another fight or action scene in a movie ever again. Nothing could top this! Not the Matrix, not Star Wars, not Spielberg not even the most expensive Hollywood "block buster." But there's a BIG difference in the originality, creativity and subliminal nature of this action in a story with lots of heart and humanity at its center. I am amazed "Kung Fu Hustle" didn't do better on its opening weekend in wide syndication in the U.S. It took fifth place, even behind new Ashton Kutchner dribble. But I think word-of-mouth will build and this one will be around for awhile in theaters. People will eventually get over going to a subtitled Asian film to recognize they could not find a more entertaining movie -- anywhere. There are scenes, jaw-dropping and breathtaking in their sheer magnificence. They build and build and build until a majestic climax. I saw this in a theater in Queens, N.Y. where the crowd laughed throughout and stood up and applauded at the end. I am also shocked at the R-rating. Beyond a few bloody scenes, mostly at the beginning, there is nothing at all to offend the kids. Most of the violence is cartoonish, fun and with a few exceptions no one actually gets hurt. They could edit out the few lessor violent scenes in order to expose this to a wider audience, especially kids who should open their mind to the real potential of film beyond the stale, clich√©d, forgettable Hollywood tripe sure to infiltrate the multiplexes this summer.
