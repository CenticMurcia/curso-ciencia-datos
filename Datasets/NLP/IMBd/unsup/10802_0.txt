this film was pretty bad i have to say.It was so corny from start to finish it made me and the missus cringe.I would give the acting a 5 out of ten,Afterall they could only do so much with a script like that! plot was none existent and as a werewolf movie fan was disappointed.want a good werewolf stroke comedy then dog-soldiers ticks the boxes that this film did not.Every move was so predictable it was pathetic,i mean a joke cracking werewolf come on!!!! the only good part of the film was the eye candy,and this is where so many low budget movies fall short,trying to cover up the shitty acting,bad plot and overall poor movie up by this. anyway watch this flick with comedy in mind and you might not be as disappointed as me.....good luck.
