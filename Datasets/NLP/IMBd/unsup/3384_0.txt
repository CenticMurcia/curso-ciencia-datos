I had much higher expectations for this movie, and was greatly disappointed. It is a cool movie idea, but all in all, it was poorly adapted, produced, and acted. There are major holes in the plot, and the acting was very unbelievable. It is only a 90 minute movie, but it seems like much longer. The way the parents, teachers, and FBI respond to these children is utterly unbelievable. If your kids suddenly could perform telekinesis, draw ancient mandalas, and vaporize their arms, would you leave them unattended for hours upstairs? These parents do. They even fall asleep when detained by the FBI, allowing their kids to escape into the night. Guess you can't expect too much from the Nip Tuck mom. She's a horrible actress. Yuck- Don't rent it. Don't buy it, and don't subject your poor children to this mindless dribble.
