Doris Day and James Cagney are excellent in this lush Technicolor story that details the career of singer Ruth Etting. Day's bright, cheerful, optimistic, happy persona gradually gives way to depression and alcoholism brought on by the demands of a small-time hood who gains control of the singer's professional and personal life. Day's one desire is to sing and to make it big in show business, and her mentor opens doors for her but at the same time exacts a terrible price from the singer. Cagney is great as the controlling and abusive hoodlum and paints him with most unflattering strokes, yet generates a bit of sympathy because he is so pathetic as he clings to Day in desperation. Cameron Mitchell has a nice turn as Day's accompanist and love interest, playing him with warmth and sincerity. Robert Keith is also good as an agent who has first-hand knowledge of Day's unhappy personal life.
