About the only enjoyment I got out of the first two-thirds of this movie came from the fact that I was a History Major in College. The scenery was interesting and so was the commentary from the mother to her daughter. But other than that you're just waiting and waiting for something to happen. The only excitement, other than the very very end, is when John Malkovich finally shows up. However, I found his character far too fawning and pathetic. And then the final scene! Okay maybe there is some big point about history and civilization, the daughter goes back for her dollÂ… But does this bit of a twist at the end make up for an hour of bad writing and camera work? Who's giving this film a 10/10? Does it really warrant it? Considering all the great films produced (especailly when compared to some of the stinkers from Hollywood) how can this film get such a high rating from people?
