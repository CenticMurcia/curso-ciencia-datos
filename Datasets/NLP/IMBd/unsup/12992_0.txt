Clive Barker's short story is successfully transported from a run-down British housing estate to a run-down Chicago housing estate... The Candyman himeslf could so easily have been made into another Freddy Kruger but instead has been given a certain dignity... you can almost feel sorry for him. Like many of Barker's "monsters" he can be bargained with but you may not quite get what you expected.<br /><br />More slickly made than Hellraiser but lacking that films sense of decadence. Well worth seeing nevertheless... 8/10
