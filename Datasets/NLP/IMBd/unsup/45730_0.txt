This is a bad bad MOVIE. If you plan on watching a good action flick watch anything other than this, yes I said anything, comedies have better action. There is one good side to this movie however and that is it can be used in video classes at universities to show an example of what not to do when making a movie of any kind, for example, don't even make a movie that is so boring people can tell by looking at the actors faces.2 : spend the extra money and get a wardrobe so the actors can change clothes 3: don't use archive footage and if you absolutely must use archive footage don't get footage that doesn't make sense, like a single car exploding next to a body of water doesn't make sense when matched with an explosion or accident of two cars in a land locked area. These are some of the many examples of things that go wrong in this movie (did anyone else see the amazing jerky blue-screen?). So once again I would like to commend the director and editor on making a great instructional video on what not to do when making a movie.<br /><br />
