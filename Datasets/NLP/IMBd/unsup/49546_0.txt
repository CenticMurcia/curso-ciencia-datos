**Maybe Spoiler**<br /><br />Wow man, thats that kind of movie that o starts and get excited about. A promising start, a plot that is interesting, some interesting act at the beginning... but hey, don't get yourself enjoying yet. This movie could be very, very scary and hypnotic but instead, the movie lost itself on the half way and never find the way home. When I finished watching this and saw my girlfriend's face, well, needless to say, crap movie at all. A freak bad ending, boring story about a tale of an Tree that was in some level, connected to the family. Sevy Di Cione really tried to get into it but the hole story didn't help him. Kiralle Hayashi saved the "Horror" category of this movie, her appearances was scary most of the time and she has that look, that side look that makes you really think about if your alone or not in the room. I can't say much of this movie anymore, when it try to connect past/future in real life and kind of strange connection by dream/reality well, thats where it messed every thing up.<br /><br />But, I always think that movie is moment, maybe you like it. Give it try.
