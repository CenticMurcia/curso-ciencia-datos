OK, the reason they called this movie "Hush", is so that you would be quiet in the theater while everyone was sleeping. What a dull film. It dragged on for the first hour, until Gwyneth was "ready" to have her baby, then you think the excitement might set in. yippee-ki-yi-yay. When the most invigorating thing in a thriller movie is a bitch-slap, you know something's wrong. Attractive leads do not mean a good movie... 2/10
