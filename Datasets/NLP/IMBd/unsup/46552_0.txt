Within the first five minutes, I already knew exactly what would happen in this picture and stopped caring immediately after. This isn't a film so much as it is a glorified vengeance flick. The Bad Guys brutally rape Gaily Morton and get away with it, leaving her brother Albert Morton (who conveniently is working on Artificial Intelligence) to seek revenge after her suicide. After making a sexy robot in his sister's image, he sets out to kill each of the rapists in a manner that is brutal and graphic and, thanks to Robot-Gaily's recording ability, shown several times.<br /><br />Obviously the budget was spent on special effects as most of the actors dully slog through the script, which has only one bright spot, when Robot-Gaily begins to wonder who she was before. The rest of the movie has the depth of a saucer. The Bad Guys are the worst example of one-dimensional characters I've ever seen, and the court reporter who starts putting pieces together and stands in as the "Good Guy" is not much more developed.<br /><br />Unless you're in the mood to watch the Bad Guys be slaughtered in the worst possible ways (one evisceration is seen several times as Albert Morton plays it over and over and over) this one is well worth skipping.
