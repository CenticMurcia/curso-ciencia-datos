Being a glutton for punishment (apparently) I still find myself sitting down to watch Asylum movies from time to time. I know it's a mistake. I know it won't be good. I guess I just have to see if it's at least not as bad as the last one. The problem is that it's usually just as bad or worse. Such is the case with Death Valley (and yes, I'm not going for the full title...this movie doesn't deserve it).<br /><br />A big reason I popped this in my DVD player is that on the back of the box it proudly proclaims the movie to be "One of the best zombie movies in the last 10 years!" and I had to know exactly how wrong that was. It's so wrong, in fact, that it would be hilarious if it weren't so bad. The quote isn't even attributed to anyone if that gives you any idea what a load of BS it is.<br /><br />The movie itself has decent production values for a modern zombie movie (which is actually a bit surprising) but it's the same old pseudo-western-meets-zombies-in-a-possibly-parallel-dimension story. Wait...have we seen that before? Even if the answer is no, you'll feel like you've seen this a thousand times before. I particularly enjoyed the fact that whenever someone talks more about the legend of Bloody Bill the whole tone of the dialog changes and they start using words and phrases normal people don't use in everyday conversation to make it sound more dramatic.<br /><br />I guess you could watch this as an alternative to a root canal...but that's even a bit of a toss up. There's a lot of much more capable zombie movies out there that do way more for way less. Save yourself the time and the desire to pour rubbing alcohol into your eyes.
