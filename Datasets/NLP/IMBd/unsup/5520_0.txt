The rating this movie got here (3.0 out of 10) is far too small. It's a hilarious film. Saw it on TV and it was the most entertaining movie I saw in a long time. From beginning to end, it was very funny. Whether if it's the actors or the way it was filmed or the script. It was very well made.<br /><br />If you think the movie will put issues about gay people or transvestites on the table to discuss, you'll be surprised. It's meant to be a comedy and it's about very straight people (with a very well developed feminine side but NOT effeminate).<br /><br />The dialogs went very fast and of course in French but still it was enough to cause hilarity amongst my family. If you're looking for an entertaining film to watch with friends or family and you've got a reasonable command of French, it's a very good choice.<br /><br />I wonder why there aren't more movies like this made.
