What a great indie film! As a fellow indie actor and producer, I understand how difficult it can be to turn a great idea into a great film. Something that Hollywood sometimes finds difficult to do, even with huge budgets, star talent, and tons of marketing effort. "Bitch" is not only a fantastic indie film, but it holds it's own against some large studio films.<br /><br />Although I had nothing to do with the project and only had the pleasure of meeting J.P. once, I absolutely loved the story, liked the characters, and was very impressed with the overall quality and attention to detail. I have seen, been involved with, & tortured through hundreds of indie films and this one ranks in the "Watch it again and again" section.<br /><br />Good job J.P.! Keep 'em coming!
