This movie was really entertaining and well shot for such a oldie. There is love, mystery, honor, humor and a good plot. Every one plays a very good role and even Douglas Fairbanks Jr. plays a " you almost have to like him" kind of villain. Ronald Coleman is endearing and romantic and sexy as the Englishman. David Niven is grand also. The woman tend to overdramitize, but even so, they are wonderful in their roles. I would highly recommend this movie to those who enjoy a good black & white oldie movie!, Ellen
