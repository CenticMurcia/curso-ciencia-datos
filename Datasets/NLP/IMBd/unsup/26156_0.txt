Bollywood crowds were not pleased with this film. For good reason of course. This movie breaks out of the regular tradition of song, dance and predictable drama and creates a movie rarely seen in the Bollywood industry. The direction was amazing. The movie was inspired by many action movies from the past but what makes it different is its setting and culture. Very few Hindi movies have been made with such openness and innovation. If you want a new twist on a classic story watch Karam. It will blends elements of Bollywood and American action. Its an entertaining watch if nothing else. Some scenes are a little graphic but they are not gratuitous. Also, the casting was excellent.
