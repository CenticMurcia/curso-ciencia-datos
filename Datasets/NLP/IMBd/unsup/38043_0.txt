It's really surprising that some people on this thread adore this film. It shows you how low standards have sunk. I watched this late night on Comedy Central (it was uncut and uncensored), and I was appalled at how awful it really is. Artie Lange has absolutely no presence as a leading man. He ends up ruining the film. Honestly, it's not that great of a script (big fat slob who has good looking girlfriend who wants him to get a real job, etc., etc..), but with a halfway decent actor, it might have been OK. But with Lange, it's complete garbage.<br /><br />I had only heard of Artie Lange after a friend of mine sent me a clip of him at a Comedy Central roast of William Shatner. Artie Lange said at the roast that Lisa Lampinelli was seven bad movies away from being Janeane Garofalo (he also called Ms. Garofalo a f***ing c***, which shows you his maturity level). Well, Janeane has made some bad films, but nothing she's made compares to this garbage, and Janeane has tons of screen presence and is usually the best thing in the films she does. Many fans of Artie like him for his standup and appearances on Howard Stern, and say he's not really film/TV material. So perhaps Mr. Lange should just concentrate on standup and radio, and not do feature films.
