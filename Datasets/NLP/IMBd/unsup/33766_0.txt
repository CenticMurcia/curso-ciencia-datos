THIS IS QUITE A DIFFERENT MOVIE, BUT A TREAT TO BE SURE!!! It contains everything that makes movies enjoyable...almost. That is why I'd consider giving it 4 stars. The characters are entertaining enough. But the island locale which promised to be a delight, turned out to be a BUST. Sure, I can overlook the bad special effects... Rent this, if you are looking for an old-fashioned horror show, with a wildly modern twist, look no further. If you don't understand its "R" rating, just watch (or rather listen) to the scene at the beginning, and then you'll understand why. Oh, Kathryn Witt's character of the scientist was just annoying and proved to appear in the most boring scenes. Oh, and the ending, what a disaster! Maybe if WB went back and retook a new ending and then re-released this, they would have better luck. In the meantime, you'll just have to make do with a VHS or maybe DVD if one comes out...
