Vote isn't for this movie, but the original team of hill and Spencer in the Trinity days, cm-on you got to admit to actually make fun of the Clint Eastwood spaghetti westerns, and still have some good gunfighting, it was great. If your looking for cinematography, sound mixing, etc... Go to your local art Indie film house, where it will look beautiful and make no sense at all. But its so avant guard, kinda like feces on a mat called art. Please don't waste your time with my attacking me personally as seen in the past on this board, its a matter of opinion, I don't like art type films, my personal opinion. If you do, and can understand them, then maybe we'll go sometime and I can learn to understand and enjoy, in fact I am always looking to broaden my horizons, in fact just ever get a chance to watch Dexter on show-time, now that will make you think.
