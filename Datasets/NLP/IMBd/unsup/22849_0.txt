Couldn't stop laughing the whole way through this movie, simply because they were trying to be serious. A horror sci-fi.... my ass it is.... pure comedy man. My favourite bit was where the spider that just hatched from the guys body, burst out of the college (bigger than a helicopter) and preceded to run over the grass.... and i mean over, as in about a foot above the grass. No but seriously the plastic spider being dangled in front of the camera was the height of the amazing special effects. Definitely worth the 50p i spent on it. Just don't be expecting good effects, storyline, acting, writing, sound effects, soundtrack, cast or pretty much anything if you try and take it seriously. Oh and there are some wet t-shirt moments. Enjoy.
