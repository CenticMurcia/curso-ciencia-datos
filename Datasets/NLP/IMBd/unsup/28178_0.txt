Eminem meeting Disney and a horror film (you'll know what I mean when you've seen the film), it really has not much of a plot, but it still is entertaining. Due to a few comic lines a few nice songs and a good moral. Well of course you might consider it offensive but I don't (OK I'm from Holland and we've brought you Paul Verhoeven) but still, you can't be offended if you have a sense of humour and if you remember this is ONLY a film.<br /><br />The message of this film (the moral) is the same that the makers of South Park have tried to bring over in their series, only they stuffed it in a better box with this film.<br /><br />7 out of 10<br /><br />To all the people who criticised this movie, because of it's bad language, violence etceteras: You have NOT learned a thing and you'd better watch this movie again.
