I made the stupid mistake of renting this movie out of sheer boredom... 2 hours later, I am in the shower scrubbing myself like I bathed in toxic waste, yearning to have the worst 2 hours of my life returned to me.<br /><br />Avoid this movie at ALL costs. I have seen so many movies that I would not even condescend to pirate (and I don't advocate piracy) and this I won't even condescend to continue writing about.<br /><br />Clearly John Travolta was out of his mind, and while I am the kind of person who would like nothing better than to go on a religious tirade about the scientology undertones of this horrible cinematic abortion, I will refrain and instead urge everyone who owns this movie to break the disc in half without so much as an afterthought.
