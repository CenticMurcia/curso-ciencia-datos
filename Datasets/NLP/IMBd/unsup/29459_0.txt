This is one of the best films made in the last few years ! <br /><br />The reasons being that the story-line though thin, still manages to interest audiences due to its simple story-telling coupled with great visuals and music ! <br /><br />The only point which does affect is the length of the second half of this movie ! <br /><br />The visuals are at par with any Hollywood period film and the music is just awesome.<br /><br />I would suggest that everyone should check this film themselves and then form an opinion....because in my opinion the presentation style of Kisna is something which has not been attempted in Bollywood !
