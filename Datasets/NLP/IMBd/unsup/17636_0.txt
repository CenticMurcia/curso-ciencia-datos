"How can I live among this gentle obsolescent breed of heroes, and not weep? Unicorns, almost, for they are fading into two legends in which their stupidity and chivalry are celebrated."<br /><br />Keith Douglas wrote of his fellow-officers in an armoured car regiment and it might apply to Kenway too. Others have said that his switch from parasite to hero is unnatural, yet in the film the whole of his career and all of his qualities- good and bad- have been shown to be fitted- and only fitted at that time- for war. His good qualities- his sympathy with the lower-class outsiders on the coffee plantation and his generosity and unaimed courage in peacetime- damage him as much as his bad ones. A superfluous man in that peace who can only fulfil himself in that war.
