Now, typically I don't like movies like this one. I'm more into Black Comedies, dark sci-fi, mystery, suspense, drama films. But being a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints myself, and a former missionary in Guatemala, I had to go see it.<br /><br />I hated the previous "Mormon" movie "God's Army", with it's melodramatic portrayal of a missionary's life in L.A. and it's blatent use of church ordinances to stir up emotions in my fellow members of the church. But what was great about "The Other Side of Heaven" was that you weren't bombarded with all the LDS dogma that you wouldn't understand unless you were already a part of the "Mormon" culture.<br /><br />It was just a story of a missionary (to use a generic use of the term) who goes to another country and faces all the difficulties that we all would experience if we were to go to another country trying to express what is most important to us.<br /><br />The love story was believable, since it was true. And it wasn't overdone like the droning love story in "Pearl Harbour" where the man had too decided to leave his woman for a while.<br /><br />Mostly, as a former missionary myself, it brought back a load of great memories from my own mission and my own experiences.<br /><br />I highly recommend it for all.
