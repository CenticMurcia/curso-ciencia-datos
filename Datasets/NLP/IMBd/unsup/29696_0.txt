This is one very boring movie from beginning to end. Jesse Eisenberg is especially so, and annoying as well. The movie is mostly about the competitiveness of those on a college campus, to see who can be the wittiest and most pretentiousness. Eisenberg's clever banter that he uses as a defense, wears thin very quickly.<br /><br />Jason Ritter's acting wasn't bad, but the character that he played seemed to be a bit exaggerated and over the top. One of the minor characters, Mr. Banks (Charlie's father) played by Dennis Boutsikaris was good, but it was a relatively small roll. Sebastian Stan (Leo) seems like a good actor, but the nature of his character seemed unbelievable.<br /><br />There really didn't seem to be much of a story, so of course, it never really went anywhere. I couldn't recommend this movie to anyone.<br /><br />There was a few good songs used as background, but that certainly doesn't make for a good movie on it's own.<br /><br />There aren't a lot of comments on the movie at this point, and almost all of them are glowing in their praise. I felt obligated to post a negative opinion. This is not a good movie.
