Well, I guess there's worse movies out there. I just don't know what they are. There is no real plot, but there is enough nasty perversion in this movie to satisfy Jeffrey Dahmer. I'm not a prude, but I guarantee that you will not like this move (unless you are a serial killer or something). I swear, most pornos aren't this revolting. BTW, it was shown at the 1998 B-Fest--and was a resounding bomb, probably because everyone had to go vomit in the toilet afterwards. I wish I had missed it like my friend.
