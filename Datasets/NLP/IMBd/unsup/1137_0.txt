This movie is extremely hilarious! Eugene Levy and Samuel L. Jackson were awesome together! A dentist named Andy Fiddler is getting ready to go to Detroit to give a speech about dental tools. While in Detroit, he just happens to be at the wrong place at the wrong time, and some gun-dealers think he is a buyer. Agent Vann thinks Andy is robbing the store, because one of the bad guys gives Andy a gun. Throughout the film, Andy is annoying to Vann, who has no time for nonsense. Vann needs Andy to pretend he's wants to buy stolen guns in order to bring the bad guys down. Vann eventually begins to like Andy. If you love comedy, you'll love THE MAN!!!
