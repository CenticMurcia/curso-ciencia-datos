The Living Dead Girl is one of the worst horror films ever because it has nothing to offer the audience, not even schlock or eerie premises, what passes as "gore" is supposed to douse us with some appreciation of this awful film, and yes, it is terrible. Rollin made this simply to cash in on nude horror films, but it doesn't have any atmosphere, story or fright to propel it along and most of the naked women are dead dull ugly. Continuity errors, cheap make up and effects, mics in the shot, film crew shadows and excessive lighting also ruin it beyond imagination. The pacing by all accounts is tediously slow, Rollin drags us through lurid shots and fake eye gougings and rotten acting that wouldn't pass a low budget play. The problem of the film is that it is not interesting, nor even believable, and he neglects to give us any truly frightening moments, instead he overloads us with distracting and annoying fake blood and fully naked waif-like 70's girls who are hideous to behold. There is no story, just one scene after another that is comprised of the Dead Girl looking for more idiotic victims and tons of shots comprised of the boring French provinces shown in wide angles, including a lackluster French band playing corny music. The ending is incredulous and the whole thing is a wasted effort from a limited director.
