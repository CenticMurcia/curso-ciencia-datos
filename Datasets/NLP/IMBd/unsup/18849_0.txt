I will not waste words on plot spoilers or a quick summary. Put simply this movie scared the living crap out of me (heheheh)and I loved every minute of it. If one loves horror such as myself and loves the adrenaline a scary movie arises in oneself "House of 1000 Corpses" evoked just that. I waited so long for The Devils Rejects only to realize they took a totally different spin on the genre. Instead of scaring us to death, director Rob Zombie tried to get the audience to empathize with the serials, which the script accomplished perfectly, however lacking the absolute fear the first movie "1000 Corpses" evoked. Watch it because although in time the movie is considered cheesy it was what I call a horror movie! Had me literally on the edge of my couch right until the final scene!!!
