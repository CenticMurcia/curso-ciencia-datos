Sometimes you just have to sit back and laugh at some of the dumbest things ever to grace a TV screen. 3 Ninjas: High noon at mega mountain equals that. Horrible acting, paired with unrealistic realism, Lines you'd hear hulk hogan say, and a hot chick who was once married to one of the greatest legends in acting, and you get something that ranks in the IMDb bottom 100.<br /><br />So the 3 ninjas are spending the day at a theme park with their nerdy next door neighbor friend, Amanda. during the day, an escaped criminal who calls herself Medusa invades the park and holds it's visitors hostage. this looks like a job for hulk hogan and 4 kids who are faker than wrestling.<br /><br />it's not action. it's just stupid.<br /><br />1/10
