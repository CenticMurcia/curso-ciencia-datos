My first comment on IMDb ... after watching many IMDb Top250 ... After this I HAD to write something. One of my all-time favorites.<br /><br />This movie is fantastic. I have never seen a movie that let's you feel with the main actor like this one.<br /><br />If you see this movie, you feel the feelings the main actor has. This movie makes you curious, angry, sad, afraid and shocked like few other movies.<br /><br />The acting is superb and so is the cinematography.<br /><br />I am so glad I could watch this 'old' masterpiece. Thank you George Sluizer!
