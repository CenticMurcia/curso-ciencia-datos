A few earlier comments express the concern that the film does not "let the GAY man be gay". Some viewers feel that "Stage Beauty" sends a message that only hethero sex is normal and if there was sexual ambiguity at the beginning, all ends "well". Some of the negative critics' reviews on rotten tomatoes also have a problem with the representation of androgyny and sexuality in the movie. My perception is that the movie did not try to send a message or convey a judgment. Throughout the movie Ned Kynaston did not self-identify as either gay or straight, or as a man or a woman. This constant confusion was made clear in several scenes including the end of the movie. Today we understand that sexuality is better described on a continuum (Kinsey) and therefore it is almost absurd to classify anyone as gay or straight. In the case of Ned Kynaston the lack of self-identification was both in terms of sexual orientation as well as gender. Although the two identity crises were clearly related. A critic on rotten tomatoes begins his review with: "Stage Beauty" is "the ultimate fantasy for women who tend to fall in love with gay men". This statement is based on at least two wrong assumptions: 1. Ned Kynaston is gay 2. Ned Kynaston stops being gay. I think one of the many strengths of this movie is exactly this non judgmental, factual representation of the complexity of sexual identity. We seem to be making some progress in understanding these issues better as they are being addressed by more and more movies, like "Alexander", "Beautiful Boxer", "Brokeback Mountain".
