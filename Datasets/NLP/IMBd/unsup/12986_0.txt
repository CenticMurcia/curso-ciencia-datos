Candyman won't go down as the greatest film ever, or even the greatest horror film ever. But in its genre, it's one of the superior films of its kind to have appeared recently.<br /><br />Where the film scores is in its juxtaposition and contrast of two kinds of fear: fear of death by supernatural forces, and fear of death at the hands of other humans. The urban decay into which Helen wanders is as chilling and disturbing as the Candyman's own appearances. Like 'Seven', the film uses its urban setting not just as an unpleasant backdrop, but as an integral part of the film's fabric, strengthening its impact and relevance.<br /><br />Virginia Madsen gives a fine performance (under the circumstances - no Oscars here). She looks older than her 29 years, which again helps the film to stand out since it's not about teenagers in peril but about mature characters about whom we might actually care. The supporting cast aren't bad, either, though this is really Madsen's show. She looks nothing like her brother, does she?<br /><br />Intelligently scripted, and carefully crafted (others have drawn attention to Philip Glass's excellent score - another splendid move by the film makers), this is vastly superior to the Elm Street series. Only the ending disappoints. Otherwise, good work.
