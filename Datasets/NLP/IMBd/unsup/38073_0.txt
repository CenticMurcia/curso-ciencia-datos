This movie was by far the worst movie i have ever seen in my life. The acting was terrible and the story line was so predictable. The deaths were terrible and unrealistic. In Urban Legends it was an actual person doing the killings in this movie they try to make it a supernatural killer a woman called Mary who has been dead for like 50 years. This movie also copied ideas from other movies and in one scene a girl has spiders coming out of her face. Death by house spiders some how i don't think so now lets face it its never going to happen so why try to make it seem as if it is something that could happen in day to day life? This movie tried to gather the same success as the original which i personally thought was a good movie. It is different characters and has nothing to do with the original if you are going to make a trilogy keep it to the same story line! Do not see this movie trust me it was the worst 93 minutes of my life i was counting the minutes hoping it would end soon.
