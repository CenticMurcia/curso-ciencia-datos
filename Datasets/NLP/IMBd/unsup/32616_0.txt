The bedroom scene between Keaton and Nicholson has to rank as one of the all-time bad "sex" scenes I can recall on film. The director should have made up her mind if it was going to be funny, tender or passionate - instead we got a muddle of all three.<br /><br />Way longer than necessary (the movie certainly needed some trimming - this scene would have been the perfect place to start) - and that blood pressure check wasn't even funny - more like a desperate attempt to distract the audience from the obvious lack of romantic chemistry between the leads.
