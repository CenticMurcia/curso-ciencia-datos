My mom and I just finished watching this movie and I liked it a lot. Just the way it was made and what happened. I found the song that the mice sing (At the Ball) was really funny and I was trying to find it on the internet, but I haven't found it yet. I hope that a soundtrack of some sort comes out or they release at least some of the songs on an EP. That would be really cool. I liked what happened in the movie. When I first found out that they were making another movie and what was going to happen in it I was a little upset because I didn't want the story to change and I didn't want it to be turned around in a 360 degree turn, but I'm really glad what happened and it was a really good movie.
