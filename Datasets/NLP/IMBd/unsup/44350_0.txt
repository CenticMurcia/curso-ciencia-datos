Okay okay let me see if you saw this too.<br /><br />This movie and 'The Curve' are exactally the same movie. No way you might say? I dare to compare.<br /><br />Both movies involve the same plot. Two roomies who hope that their third roomate dies so they can get A's because of the 'dead roomate' policy. They both also have the one 'nice' guy attracted to some attractive girl. See thing is its so much better in 'The Curve' a darker storyline and the ending is to die for.<br /><br />If you liked DMOC (Dead Man on Campus) then you should enjoy 'The Curve'<br /><br />Btw they both came out in the same year. Kinda creepy huh?
