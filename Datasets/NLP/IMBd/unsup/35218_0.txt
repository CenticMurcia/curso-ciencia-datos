This movie cracked me up! It was like that guy who ate all the celery at a cocktail party! Especially where Joshuau peed on the food! And there's not even really trolls! His mom has bad hair and his sister can't dance, yet they wonder why he'd rather hang out with his dead grandpa! I didn't get into how Elliot was getting naked with his friends and watching porno stuff with monkeys and bad music, but since your friends are not even worried about how corn and vegetables will kill you, then it makes sense that you button up your shirt when your girlfriend shows up unexpected.<br /><br />I don't want to even think about reading a cook book about vegetables or have some guy try to make me eat ice cream with raisins on it.<br /><br />But its good to know a baloney sandwich can save me from that.
