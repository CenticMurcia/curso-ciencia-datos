It has a real Hollywood psychological thriller feel to it, which will appeal to younger generations used to scary, shocker-flashback movies with surreal, supernatural twists.<br /><br />Though the main character's "dream" sequences were gripping and sometimes harrowing, they weren't too much for me to take (and I hate scary movies) nor were they at all graphic, violent or gory. Those "visions" were frightening in what they implied, and most only pieced together in my mind afterward.<br /><br />There is one heck of a twist at the end in the courtroom. Critics and reviewers are saying this movie meets its stated goals: educating while gripping the audience, not being preachy or propaganda, just telling it like it is. I agree.
