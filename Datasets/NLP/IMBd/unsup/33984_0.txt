First off, I didn't LOVE THIS MOVIE. I was bored out of my mind.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />Did anyone else think that the movie was leading up to the roommate being involved somehow in the whole El Charro thing. Here's some suspicious things:<br /><br />1. Forces lead to go on vacation with 2 people who despise her. That should be relaxing. 2. Takes her out to the desert where El Charro dwells. 3. Goes to her uncle's house with religious statues and altars all over the place. Totally normal, and of course the uncle is never seen (perhaps the religious items were taken from the director's home) 4. Shoves any type of pill down her good friend's throat, even going so far as to trust the evil goth girl, who spits on the ground she walks on, for sleeping pills 5. Low angle shot of roommate looking down at suffering friend smiling and saying "That's what friends are for." 6. Disappears completely for about a third of the final act (When she shows up again she was just showing some dude the house, for 115 hours!) 7. Suddenly changes from good girl to bar tramp, ready to get it on on the hood of a car in front of the house in a clearly lit area. Certainly she'd have to know everyone is dead to do that. 8. Killed off screen (for the life of me I couldn't understand why she was screaming since she was clearly hiding some nefarious, evil pact with the creature)<br /><br />Probably, to answer my own question, she was just a poorly conceived character like the rest of the cast (these people make the cast of The Squid and the Whale seem like Leave it to Beaver. What a bunch of you-know-what-holes). I think this is an example of a the main creative forces (if you wanna call em that) behind the project dumbing themselves down to work in such a shoddy genre. They sat on their pedestals and knew they were only making a lousy horror movie, so don't get worried about anything, those horror idiots will eat up anything. Well, I'll make an agreement, stay out of my genre, and I'll stay out of pretentious student films.<br /><br />P.S. Sorry about writing in CAPS earlier, I just thought it might be funny if the director saw that and got excited, then was let down when he read the rest. Revenge is a dish best served cold.
