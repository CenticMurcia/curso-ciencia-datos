This is a movie that could have been, and should have been good but it wasn't. Bad script. Unrealistic prison and visitation scenes, and just boring. I am not familiar with the NJ corrections systems but if in fact this young man was in a maximum security prison (which the movie said it was when he was admitted) nothing really made any sense. It is almost like the film makers really did not research corrections at all. Even the child abuse flashback scenes were just corny. More like a really bad made for TV but it was worse than most of the stuff even on Lifetime. Too bad a half hearted effort was put in from the makers of this film.<br /><br />4/10.
