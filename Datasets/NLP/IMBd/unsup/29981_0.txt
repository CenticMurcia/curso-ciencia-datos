Blah... Blah Blah Blah... Blah Blah Blaaaaa....!<br /><br />This film is so boring that It makes Groundhog Day appear realistic and interesting. Blah Blah...<br /><br />Bitch Bitch Bitch about random people who will never make a difference and spend thirty seconds deciding on what words you are going to respond with so they sound smart.<br /><br />What's with the top hats? Is it 1932 or 1990?<br /><br />I grew up in this neighborhood and believe me, this film is a load of s**t.<br /><br />Yeah, woo hoof... They used real apartments. Well, the taste of the apartments is that of a drunk white trash bible thumper that stole the coin jar from their local church... Ew!<br /><br />I think this is the first film I have seen where they didn't purposely cast a homo.<br /><br />I think fire crotch is going to be serial killer...<br /><br />And now.. I have witnessed the flooding of St. Pats.<br /><br />I'm out, and destroying this DVD...
