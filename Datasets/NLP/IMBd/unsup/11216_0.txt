I heard my parents talking about this TV movie that they felt was a little too violent and scary to have been shown on national TV. According to them, it would have been better for cable. That TV movie was 'Something is Out There'. They had taped it so they could watch some dumb sitcom instead. I felt a nagging urge to see what it was they were talking about.<br /><br />Man were they ever right. Not only was it really gory and freaky to boot, but it was one of the coolest TV films I've ever seen. You've got the mysterious killer mutilating NY residents, the hot chick who claims to be from from outer space, the drunk/loser detective, and one of the nastiest villains to ever grace the small screen.<br /><br />#1, I was taken for a loop. I thought the killer was jsut an ordinary psycho who loved to eviscerate joggers... but when it turns out to be an psychopathic alien fugitive that can disguise itself as anyone it wants, I was put into a mild state of shock.<br /><br />#2, For a TV film, the FX are awesome (for the time period). This was before the computer FX revolution, so they look 'real'. The alien villain is actually a very sweet looking puppet that is frighteningly insectiod-like.<br /><br />#3, The characters are fleshed out completely making the viewer actually care about them. The acting is impressive as well (especially the luscious<br /><br />Maryam d'Abo).<br /><br />#4, Man is this thing sick. I have to give credit to the director, he's got balls. People get ripped apart from the inside out by the alien constantly in this flick. Not only that, but we get some nasty views of the alien's early victims that it was studying, plus some gross after the fact corpses.<br /><br />In the end, this is probably one of my favorite TV movies... or movies period. Where is this on DVD dammit! It was actually turned into a short lived television series featuring the same characters and actors, but the cool alien killer was nowhere to be found, thus making it pretty worthless.<br /><br />If it's ever shown on TV again, watch it... you won't regret it!
