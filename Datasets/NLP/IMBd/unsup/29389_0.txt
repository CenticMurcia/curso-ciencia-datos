Even with a weak acting performance by singer Whitney Houston, this is a fabulous film as it gives up everything: a wonderful plot, fine chemistry between Kevin Costner and Ms. Houston, the reality of finding love while on the job, and an Academy Award show never to be forgotten!<br /><br />The beautiful Oscar-winning song is sung here with perfection by Ms. Houston.<br /><br />As stated above, Houston's performance is lackluster through most of the film. It did pick up somewhat as the plot thickened. As for Costner, as the over-zealous agent, he was never better. What makes the film so good is the believable plot twists that are discovered. All does not seem to appear what it should be regarding a former agent as well as the woman who portrays Houston's sister and secretary. We have often heard of what happens when love blossoms in the work place and this film is no exception to that rule.
