A ridiculous poorly made mini-movie about Revelations and Science. It's poor science fiction, if that what intended. Direct portrayal of contention between Religion vs. Science is in poor taste for a national network even if done vaguely or for fiction. But there is nothing vague about Religion vs. Science in this mini.<br /><br />My first instinct was that NBC has gone evangelical. But then reason took over. NoÂ… NBC is pandering to the religious and religious right for ratings. Shame on NBC anyway for a bad plot and schlock! The only thing NBC has going for it are all the L&O's. NBC's High Definition is the best but is wasted on Leno.
