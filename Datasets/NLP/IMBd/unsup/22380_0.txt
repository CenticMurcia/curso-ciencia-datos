Believe it or not, as of 1911, this was probably the most in-depth and longest Shakespeare movie made! However, this STILL is way too short for any of his plays (even the really bad ones--take that Shakepeare snobs!) and there is no way this film COULD have done the Bard justice even if it had better production values--22 minutes is like trying to sum up the Bible in a half an hour! For 1911, the sets are pretty good and the length of the film would have made it a full-length film--as most movies were significantly shorter. Plus, if you had a general idea what the play was about, you could follow along well enough. However, if you are NOT familiar with the play or history (which, by the way, is a lot different than the way Shakespeare portrayed it), then watch this AFTER you read the Cliff Notes--or better yet, see the TV series BLACK ADDER I! Otherwise, you'll probably get lost and have no idea what's happening.
