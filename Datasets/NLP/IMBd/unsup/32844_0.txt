I wasn't sure what to expect going into this, but when I watched it on Netflix I was pretty disappointed by the end of it. As far as film-making goes, it's impressive with the film aesthetics. As far as a documentary goes, it was one-sided anti-white propaganda.<br /><br />The main problem with this film is that they only interview black people, gang members and the few white people they do interview come off as retarded and somewhat racist. This is not factual to me, 'nor is it the marking of a respectful piece of media. They do not interview members of the Los Angeles government from any point in history, except they use stock footage in a manner that demonizes the government.<br /><br />I also resent the idea that gangs were formed because blacks couldn't get into the cub scouts, that's absurd, silly and utterly ignorant. This work of "fiction" is nothing more than propaganda to bring hate among white people.
