This was something I wasn't really interested in and watched just because of the fine cast. An I was very surprised, how moving, funny and involving the three stories were made. But my respect goes to the actors who all did great work here, especially Vanessa Redgrave, and Sharon Stone (what's up with her, are there no roles anymore in Hollywood for her??), who both gave performances that to me were absolutely natural and unforced. A true surprise to me was Ellen DeGeneres, who is nearly a nobody in Germany, but who I saw last year in another surprising role in "Goodbye Lover". All in all a thoughtful and yet entertaining piece of work.
