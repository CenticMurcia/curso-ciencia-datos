For anyone who is a true Jane Austen fan, this is a terrible adaptation. It looks good, but the character of Fanny has been totally rewritten to appeal to the modern woman's idea of a good heroine. This film's Fanny is feisty and challenging. Wrong! Wrong! Wrong! In Austen's novel, Fanny is true to herself, but is a quiet fearful person who dreads change. While this may not be an interesting focal point for today's audience, the character's immobility is intentional. Fanny represents England at a time of great uncertainty. Internally, the monarchy had been compromised by years of George III's insanity and his sons' frivolity. Externally, the Napoleonic wars were threatening Europe. England, like Fanny, was searching for stability and familiarity in a changing world. This film totally undermines its source. <br /><br />If you watch this movie, enjoy the costumes and the scenery. Don't be fooled into thinking, however, that this production has anything to do with Jane Austen's "Mansfield Park". There ought to be a disclaimer on the box warning viewers that this is "an adaptation loosely based on 'Mansfield Park'". This version does Jane no credit.
