Having read all of the negative comments about this movie - and having just wasted a few hours of my life by watching it - I can pretty much say that they're ALL true.<br /><br />The scenery is great, but I think my wife said it all. During the windstorm scene, she remarked, "What a tough place to live. Why would they continue to want to live there?"<br /><br />Why did they continue to want to make this movie? 5 stars for scenery, 1/2 star for acting ability, which was SORELY lacking.<br /><br />This probably would have been a good book - something about perseverance in the face of tragedy and everything that nature throws at you - but for a movie to plod along like this without you ever really caring about the characters **Spoiler** such as when the husband is robbed - his emotion and her face as she held him were just NOT there.
