Box..Takashi Miike Miike's entry in this Asian horror anthology was the most visually inspired, I thought. Very surreal imagery punctuates this tale of a young woman, Kyoko, who placed her twin sister, Shoko, in a box as a youngster which led to the girl's death and eventual haunting of the adult Kyoko.<br /><br />I had no idea what Box was saving itself up to be until halfway through and I was pleasantly surprised--up until that point where it all clicked, I thought it was just some J-horror ghost story. I should've known better with Miike. The goodness of this short paved the way for the loveliness that followed it. 8/10.<br /><br />Dumplings..Fruit Chan Aunt Mei cooks up some sumptuous vittles to please the stomachs of her aging clientele and keep their snappers snappin'. This delightful showcase of Asian delicacies had me clamoring for the phone to order wonton soup and fried pork dumplings from the Chinese store at 10:30 PM last night. Oh man, was this a good 'un.<br /><br />I loved this segment from start to finish. It was too gross and wrong not to love, really. I'm hungry again just thinking' 'bout it. 10/10.<br /><br />Cut..Chan-wook Park Korea's contribution to this anthology is a giallo-flavored charmer peppered with sweet set-pieces and sick, sadistic twists. This segment is about a director who is toyed with by a low-life extra from his movies who begrudges the rich man his fame, money, and his easy entry into heaven.<br /><br />This one had a little bit of comedy to it that worked with the outrageous violence and shocks. Beyond that, I can't say too much--it was all money. 8.5/10.
