One of the reasons why I tuned into this show was because I like Bruce Greenwood's work, but, after watching as much of it as I could stomach, I can only hope that Bruce was paid well.<br /><br />This is a complete turkey from start to finish. The script has some serious problems not the least of which is believability. The chemistry between Greenwood and Gilbert is nonexistent and their love scenes seem rather contrived. I finally stopped watching after the scene in the stable. The only performance in this that was any good was Ossie Davis as Mordecai. When Greenwood plays off of Davis he manages to actually put in a effort where as other times he seems to be going through the motions.<br /><br />A friend of mine told me that this movie was based on an equally unbelievable historical romance. Why any network would want to put time and money into a movie based on a bad novel God only knows.
