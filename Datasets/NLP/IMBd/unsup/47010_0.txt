2 bit actors attempting to look as though they are being filmed without their knowledge. I was expecting actual footage of events with people being seen stealing, etc., without their knowledge. This was just terrible. I have no doubt that the average American is captured on camera several times a day but this film exploits the concept and does so VERY POORLY. Don't waste your time watching this trash.... You would be better off doing something constructive like sleeping. The only positive thing I can say is that the actors are complete unknowns. This lends "slightly" toward the sense that we are watching people captured on store security cameras, gas station monitors, ATM's, etc. Other than that....pure garbage. The only thing you'll want to do if you do watch it, is take a bath.
