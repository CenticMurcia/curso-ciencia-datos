I just got the VHS on E-bay, and this is one of the strangest flicks I have ever seen. I first found out about this classic on You Tube by seeing the 4 and a half minute clip on there, and I was intrigued enough to get the movie. I enjoyed it very much. It was a very interesting story. But I felt that Tiger, the lead character, was a scumbag. He used his position and his influence to take advantage of those young girls. He felt that he could get away with it because everyone looked up to him at that school. He was the real leader, not Mr. Proffer. But he does do a nice thing for Ponce, albeit in a sick way, in helping him out with his female troubles after Ponce said that he wouldn't touch a dead girl because he hasn't had a live one yet while being questioned by Telly Savalas's character, Sam Surcher. In conclusion, I would recommend this movie but I don't approve of some of the behavior in it.
