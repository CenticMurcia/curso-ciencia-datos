For lots of people, Requiem is essentially the spiritual ending for the X Files and it's certainly far more rewarding and powerful then The Truth. And as far as going back to your roots is concerned, this is a very well plotted and executed episode.<br /><br />The teaser itself is more of a pace setter and establisher rather than a shocker and a stunner. There's nothing new, although the return of Detective Miles comes as a shock, and it's shot brilliantly. You just know we're in for a hell of a ride.<br /><br />I must profess to loving the fact that the issue of expenses over Mulder and Scully's investigation was left untouched until what at the time was considered the final episode. And the only thing I love more than Mulder beating the crap out of Chesty Short is Scully's amusement when told. For Billy Miles of all people to phone them up out the blue is a real surprise. As is Krycek's stint in a Tunisian penal colony being ended by Marita Covarrubias, last seen looking like a toilet brush in One Son. As a side note, that is one hell of a recovery, both physically and mentally. Kudos Marita C. Turns out that CSM, now dying, has summoned them for one final attempt at rekindling the conspiracy. Inevitably these two events are linked.<br /><br />That would because an alien craft has crashed outside Bellefleur, and is now sitting under a cloaking device. Mulder n' Scully meet Billy, exchange some reminiscing, and we quickly establish that his father has not come out well from his encounter with the alien. The twist that he's in fact the Bounty Hunter might not come as a big shock, making the pretty cool car trunk shot less effective, but it's not blatant. It turns out that the alien craft was on a salvage hunt for abductees, and while Mulder and Scully visit Theresa Hoese (nee Nemman, her of the nosebleed), one of the local UFO geeks is sucked into the ship's shields. Used twice in this episode, the shaking shot I reckon looks brilliant. All the while Krycek pokes his nose around looking for the craft (the sum of which is sitting in his car on the phone).<br /><br />Marita and CSM share some pretty insightful conversations, and it's credit to Laurie Holden that you can see her hatred for him burning while she maintains a veneer of cold, emotionless efficiency. Scully meanwhile begins suffering from sudden nausea, the cause of which will come up later. You have a wonderful scene where Mulder tries to comfort her and states for the first time his wish for her to leave him behind and try and have a better life as a result. Whether this is lucky strike number 2 for Mulder isn't clear, although I believe it is.<br /><br />With their backs turned, Theresa is taken from her home, her screaming baby just metres away, and the friend of shaky boy confirms Billy's suspicions over his father. While Billy returns home to confront him, Mulder and Scully go into the woods and the latter is subjected to the same forcefield rejection. Dismissed as another episode, Mulder and Scully ultimately return to D.C with nothing when Billy is taken by the Bounty Hunter, who had finally convinced him that he was who he said he was. The scene where Billy demands to know why his father never believed him is oddly touching, and stems back to pilot clearly.<br /><br />As a result, we have what I reckon is one of the best X Files moments ever, when a hesitant Skinner leads Krycek and Marita into Mulder's office. It seems they've had the same lack of luck, and are willing to sign up with M&S at the expense of the CSM. We get a scene from the Lone Gunmen and another example of Mulder trying to stop Scully from joining him at the potential ground zero. This time he succeeds, and while Scully discovers that the alien DNA means Mulder is at risk, Mulder and Skinner travel to the site and the inevitable happens. Mulder walks into the forcefield, ignoring the calls of Skinner, and joins the gathered abductees as the Bounty Hunter walks up to him and smiles vindictively. Skinner almost cries, and then another bombshell: Scully's pregnant.<br /><br />Ultimately, it's always going to be the return to the beginning aspect of Requiem that will win us over, and does it must be said. There's a feeling of coming full circle that is both excellent and slight depressing (despite what they've seen and done, Mulder and Scully haven't really gone anywhere). Also, the double headed plot which utilises both Abductions and the Conspiracy is generally well handled.<br /><br />The main issue is that as a one parter, it has holes where they couldn't afford time to use. Krycek and Marita's methods to find the craft aren't clear, and neither is CSM's logic behind rebuilding the project with a single crashed UFO. Mulder and Scully just seem to give up on the case after Billy disappears too. So it's far from perfect.<br /><br />However, it does deliver and is an emotional, powerful episode that could well have ended the show. Scenes such as Mulder watching Scully with the baby, the bedroom scene and Skinner getting emotional are stunning, and we have the satisfaction of seeing Krycek shove Cigarette Smoking Man down the stairs. The revelation that Scully is pregnant is jaw dropping.<br /><br />So basically, Requiem isn't perfect; it's uneven, and slightly constricted by the single episode it was given to resolve the story. However, there is genuine emotion, wonderful recognition of the show's roots, and a great plot and story. The music from Mark Snow is brilliant even by his standards. If Season 7 was all about closure and wrapping up, Requiem does it in spades. Powerful viewing.
