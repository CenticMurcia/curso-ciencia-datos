this movie is kind of a british take on the teen shocker. i thought it was very disturbing (in a good way), and it is definitely more thought-provoking than, say, i know what you did last summer. also, it is not so much of a horror than a thriller with teens in the main roles. thora birch is convincingly british, and i liked the fact that she didn't just play the same role that she did in american beauty (a common problem amongst teen actors these days...freddie prinze jr, i am looking at you...). another nice aspect is the absence of an authoritative adult presence, which lends a strange lord of the flies tone to the film...are you wondering what happens?? see the film! you won't feel embarrassed to be in the theatre, even if you happen to be over 20 as i am...
