This film is a national disgrace. This is the cinematic equivalent of the mad relative kept locked in the attic. This film and it's sequels represent the nadir of British film. <br /><br />Naturally a film this bad has to have a cult following - just check out the number of people who gave it "TEN" - and it's hard not to marvel at just how a film could be so bad. So sit back and watch to see a film worse than you can possibly imagine.
