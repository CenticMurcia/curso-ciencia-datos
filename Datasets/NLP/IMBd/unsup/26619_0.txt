Trying to beat the odds in order to live a normal life is always common for certain people. In "Mask", Roy L."Rocky" Dennis, 1961-1978(Eric Stolz) was born with craniodiaphyseal dysplasia, a rare cranial bone disease that inflated his head. lives with his biker gang mother Rusty(Cher) and family. She was wild, out of control, and very much a loving mother in the middle. She sees a smart, understanding, and determined young man under that visage. It was great when Rocky told that teen that he would "take off his mask, until he takes off his". It goes to shows that people with disabilities got feelings too. Rocky wanted nothing best but going to Europe, and visit the counties he wanted to go. Had a girlfriend who was blind. But everything took a dive. His friend had decided to live with his divorced father, and his girlfriend went to a blind school in another city. Rusty, his mother was a positive figure in his life. Her strong will, and big heart helped Rocky overcome the obstacles. Only his disease did him in. A strong, heart-wrenching movie, that gives meaning, you can do it! No matter what! 5 stars!
