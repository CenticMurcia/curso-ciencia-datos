This movie is better than the second Crow movie, City of Angels but this movie, like COA, could never equal the deeply moving love story of the original with Brandon Lee, nor the magnificent actor that Brandon Lee was. The Salvation lacked any real emotion. The acting wasn't too bad but the dialogue was delivered with an unreal quality like it had been badly rehearsed. The violence was gory, unlike the original Crow movie. The sensitivity was not there, and the scenes, including the background was not made to look real and looked like it was all done on the set. The original Crow movie had me in tears at the end because the love story was so touching; The Salvation had me shrugging my shoulders wondering why I even bothered to buy the movie.
