This action-drama is never really a thriller. That's because the mostly predictable storyline revolves around one man's desire for revenge. Jack Carter (Sylvester Stallone), a trained killer, spends a third of his journey using violence to learn the truth of his brother's death. The other two thirds he spends inflicting death on those he deems responsible for the younger Carter's demise.<br /><br />The dynamic between Carter's niece, Doreen, and Jack does play out beautifully. But more of the screenplay could have been devoted to this relationship. Instead, the writer makes sure that it's just enough to justify Stallone's gun-toting or fist-wielding ways.<br /><br />I began to question the realism of this film early on. For one thing, we never hear a police siren until the final seconds of the movie. Enough people lose their life in this film, that this makes Carter's ho-hum killing spree seem pretty unbelievable. That makes the rest of this flick come tumbling down, since old-fashioned justice is the point of the film.
