Saw this movie after the hype surrounding the many nude scenes present in the movie.The actors and some emotion looked real but then when it came to acting it out, they weren't professional enough. Also the Mexican Culture and ways of life in the Mexican city also adds to the supposed plot.Some of the scenes was not needed (atleast to me) because they really dint add any value to the movie other than extending by a few minutes.Mascos looked good,Ana looked hot,Marcos's wife looked seriously obese and the marching soldiers looked fit and trimmed. I also saw a interview of Carlos and Ana which was taken after the Cannes shock treatment.He said he wanted to show real images and thats the reason he prefers d√©butantes in every movie.Also Marcos is supposedly a driver for his dad at the History of Cultural museum (that obviously explains his inclusion). Well the story could have been much deeper and plot a bit more refined. But its Carlos story so the verdict on this is definitely not very impressive.Still I like some shots of Mexico and the hot girl Ana.. 4/10....If you can watch it .. but don't worry if you have missed it.
