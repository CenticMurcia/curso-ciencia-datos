I was pleasantly surprised with this short film which is quite surprising given that I had my expectations set high for this film. Andrea Corr plays a young psychologist(Mary) trying to relieve her own sense of guilt over losing a patient. When Mary's life gets intertwined with an old man wanting to commit suicide(Simon)she soon is entangled in the old man's life and tries to redeem herself by trying to change the outcome of Simon's plans to end his own life. I don't want to give away the ending so thats really all I can say as your are left to yourself to ponder your own meaning to the film. Richard Raymond does a fantastic job directing the film and the movie is both haunting and beautiful in its own dark way. To me the movie portrays perfectly what we all come across sometime in our lives and how we deal with our own failures and also how we face and deal with death. I look forward to seeing Ms Corr in more films as she is turning into a fine actress. Leonard Felton does a brilliant job in this film also. Andrea Corr has a screen presence you just can't teach.
