A huge disappointment in Siskel & Ebert's rating! The title does not fit the movie at all. This movie was far from a comedy; it was serious and disjointed. I was waiting with expectation for it to get humorous as described but it never did. The script provided little to no motivation for Maureen (Robin Wright) to make the choice she did. The script also failed to explain why Joey(John Travolta) was so enraged he was swearing every other word he spoke. Too much pointless swearing from all the characters. If you find watching an innocent-looking little girl swear & drink beer humorous then you'll probably like the movie.<br /><br />"When a Man Loves a Woman" with Meg Ryan & Andy Garcia, is similar to this movie. The big difference between the two movies is "She's So Lovely" is a waste of time to watch.
