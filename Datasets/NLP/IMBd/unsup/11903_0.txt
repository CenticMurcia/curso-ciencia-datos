Almost didn't see this, based on reviews here. Glad I did, it was a very entertaining film, with many genuine laughs. The only way I can explain the ton of bad reviews here is that I think the movie industry tries to hype every movie as if it was the absolute best ever made. It raises our expectations too high.<br /><br />This isn't a "great" movie, or a "blockbuster," but is was solidly entertaining throughout.
