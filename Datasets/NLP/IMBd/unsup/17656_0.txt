Over the years I have seen John Payne sing and dance in all kinds of MGM Musicals and in this picture, John played an entirely different role. John Payne was an ex-con,(Joe Rolfe/Peter Harris),"They Ran for their Lives",'68, and got himself involved with some hard nosed criminals. Coleen Gray,(Helen Foster),"The Late Liz",'71, fell in love with Joe Rolfe. However, her father, Preston Foster,(Tim Foster),"Law & Order",'53, did not want his daughter to get involved with Helen and did everything in his power to stop this love affair. Neville Brand,(Boyd Kane),"Evils of the Night",'85, played the crime boss who would stop at nothing to blow your head OFF! If you like veteran actors with a good story, this is the film for YOU!
