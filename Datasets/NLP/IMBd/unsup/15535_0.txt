this show was blurry to watch on the comp, but has a lot of potential if ever aired, i don't get why they spend time to make it and then tease people like this. HOW bout play it on TV and give it a shot before u take it off. The show will be much better in the later episodes when the characters history and importance is gone more in depth. Like said before this show has the potential to be as good as smallville if not better. How can the Execs at CW not run a show that the audience has never seen yet. Justin Hartley plays a good AC, he has a nice attractive co star Eva and Ving Rhames does a good job as a wise mentor for Ac. Whois judging it a bunch of middle aged people who the show isn't targeted for.
