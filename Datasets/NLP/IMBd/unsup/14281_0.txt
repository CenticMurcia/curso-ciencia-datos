Borderline camp to be sure, WHIRLPOOL is still a lot of fun. Kleptomaniac Gene Tierney finds herself under the spell of wacky hypnotist Jose Ferrer and is soon doing his evil bidding. The fact that the film takes itself so seriously is part of the enjoyment. Director Otto Preminger seems unaware that he's NOT making another LAURA. Still, Tierney is striking and her slightly off-kilter personality lends itself nicely to this type of role. She was always at her best playing women who may or may not be REAL BAD! Ferrer is his usually hammy self, but this time it works in his favor. How else should one play a hypnotist? Richard Conte is badly cast as Tierney's doctor husband. It might be the role --- he seems to be the dimmest doctor imaginable.
