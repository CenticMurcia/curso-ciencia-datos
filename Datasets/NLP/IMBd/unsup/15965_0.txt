A quiet and very savage thriller that examines the peaceful life that a honest Manhattan archtitect, Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) lives until a small gang viciously attacks his wife and daughter. The daughter survives, but the event left her in a state of shock and the wife is gone. Kersey decides to take matters into his hands and becomes a vigilante, who ventures out onto the dark and bleak streets of New York City with a loaded silver thirty-two pistol in hand. What the movie is trying to suggest is that murder isn't the best solution to crime. The performances are strong all around besides Bronson himself (Vincent Gardenia, Hope Lange, Steven Keats, Stuart Margolin, etc.). I was also impressed with the ultra-stylish musical score by Herbie Hancock, who lets the music express itself and it's fun to listen to. Jeff Goldblum makes his movie debut here as one of the demented muggers.
