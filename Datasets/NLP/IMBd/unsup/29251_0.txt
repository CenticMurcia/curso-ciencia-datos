The script is full of common places and absurd dialog .I find myself laughing my head off with some dialog that was supposed to be serious . The 2 leads are alright but some of the supporting actors perform like "Look , I'm in a Wesley Snipes movie ". I think that Wesley Snipes really enjoy acting in these kind of movies and I like some of them but it's about time that he goes for a more dramatic role cause I consider him a very fine and excellent actor and some of his previous movies show. Still I have watch some action movies that are worst than this one . I think that the direct to video release is fair in this case , the movie is not that good .I will look for his movie Chaos then with Jason Stantham.
