My son asked me, after I told him I had walked out of this movie, if I had checked the rating. Obviously, I had not. From the very beginning there was pure filth coming from the mouths of all the characters. If you're looking for words that used to be only written on public bathroom walls and descriptions of the same, see this movie. Otherwise, save your money and stay home.
