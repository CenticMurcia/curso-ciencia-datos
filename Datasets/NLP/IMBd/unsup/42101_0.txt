The director & co-screenplay writer Jean Jacques Beineix must of thought he was the French personification of the director of Heaven's Gate, which we know or should know was an overlong indulgent movie.<br /><br />La Lune Dans Le Caniveau (The Moon is in the Gutter) is of the same cloth,pretty at times to look at but mostly grim needless artless & uninteresting. A better translated title would be The Moon is in the Sewer. it is that dreary & boring.<br /><br />Now this does have a very well known cast of 1983 & still are known today. Gerard Depardieu was 35 when this was made & he sure was very handsome & sexy. Victoria Abril was very young,sexy and very beautiful.The same goes for Nastassia Kinski.<br /><br />These three fine talents do NOT rise above the base script.<br /><br />This is a very long 138 minute film, I have heard that the director (like Cimino) had a much longer movie. The film may have been a good movie at about 80 minutes.<br /><br />Ratings: *1/2 (out of 4) 42 points(out of 100)IMDB 3 (out of 10)
