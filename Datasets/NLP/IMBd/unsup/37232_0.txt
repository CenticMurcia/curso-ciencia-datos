It's funny, this movie had two subplots but not an actual plot to keep it going. One about a killer crocodile and one about oppression in Africa. Yet neither is what you went to see the movie for. I expected a human serial killer movie with African attributes, not Jaws. From step one I was hoping that the crocodile was a red hearing, but alas. The movie even eluded to how much it was going to suck by the first scene where the actor says "nobody watches shows about alligators" (paraphrased). And as if to let the audience know this was simply a recycled Jaws the cameraman said "This is Jaws baby". Don't waste your time or money even renting it, let it go, don't contribute to such blatant deceit in movie advertising. I actually left the movie angry.
