This is really unwatchable. The acting is generally stiff and the budget is obviously very very very low, like $15 for the special effects budget low. There's really no point in watching this it's utter garbage on a lot of levels. One of the scenes features Germans planting a grenade but the grenade shown is an American frag grenade- it was ridiculous. There are some funny moments but this is like watching someone's home movie movie as far as cinematic quality of editing and stunts. Avoid this waste of time at all costs unless you want to see what someone did with 38 dollars and a video camera. Making something this crappy and masquerading it as a film should be illegal. PLOT: Zombie Nazis are looking for their victims - what connects them to each other? Poor acting and worse stunts ensue.
