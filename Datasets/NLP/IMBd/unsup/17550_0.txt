The Camera-work on the film is complete crap, it looks like it was filmed on a second hand camera brought from a car boot sale in Tokyo, and edited on an old junk yard hard drive. <br /><br />The actors look like they've been pulled off the street or are out of work porn stars, <br /><br />The special FX consist of a fake knife, and some ketchup. <br /><br />Its filmed in some kind of basement, with lousy shots of a city street. <br /><br />In all, it serves only as inspiration to make your own low budget film, you could pick up some techniques, <br /><br />other than that, don't bother watching it.
