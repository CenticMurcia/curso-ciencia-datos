One of the best movies so far of 2004 and that I have ever seen is Hidalgo. I loved it so much. The story was great and the acting and everything. Ever since I was 6 years old (now i'm 15) I loved Viggo Mortensen as an actor, poetry writer, etc..... and i still do love him. I think he is incredible at everything he does or at least tries. What I liked about Hidalgo was the bond Frank T. Hopkins had with his horse Hidalgo. I also liked the humor here and there. I think no one else could of played Frank T. Hopkins like Viggo can. This movie is one I will recommend for everyone to see. It is just great. Hidalgo has also given me a love for horses more than I had before. For any one who loves racing or horses this is the movie for you to see.
