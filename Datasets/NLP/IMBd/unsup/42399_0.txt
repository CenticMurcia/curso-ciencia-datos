As everyone seems to indicate, the beginning of this very strongly smelled of The Thing, but once people started turning up not-dead-anymore the smell went bad.<br /><br />This was only a sequel to the second of the "Sometimes They Come Back" films, by way of the demonic characters wandering about in it. Those who have seen it will probably be aware that the original movie in this 'trilogy' had nothing to do with demons coming to Earth, unless you consider the ghostly bullies being sent Hellwards at the end demonic. But the film makers did try to make this one fit in with the franchise by inserting, at around 44 minutes, the names of the leading characters from the other two films (Jim Norman and John Porter) on the pentagrammed-up map of the demonic world. Nice try, but it's a bit of a weak connection.<br /><br />Plus the whole movie ends up generally ruined by curious spacial continuity (eg. Demons run faster than elevators), general predictability (guess where the ring ends up), unfortunate acting ("Oh my, I can't go on" *collapse* (to be fair, that must have been in the script)) and a dire ending. And, as has been noted by others, Leeta was a much better female lead than Ms Faith Ford. Sorry, I meant Chase Masterson, not Leeta... Silly me.<br /><br />Don't avoid this movie. Just be aware you might not enjoy it...
