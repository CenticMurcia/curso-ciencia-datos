Let me first say, I did not select this film to watch, but it was scheduled on TCM at our movie watching time and my wife and I agreed, what the heck, lets watch John Garfield whom we had not seen in quite a while. I was riveted from the first scene to the last! A superb job of not only acting - Garfield, Palmer, Brooks, Revere, Conrad, et al - but a superb job of directing and editing! A magnificent movie, above all other so called boxing movies, including Rocky, etc. I felt every anxiety and every pain of Charlie Davis, Mr. Garfield's character. Thank you Hollywood for a rare joy! Some critics say the movie should not have had a happy ending. Bull! The best movies ever made have happy endings!
