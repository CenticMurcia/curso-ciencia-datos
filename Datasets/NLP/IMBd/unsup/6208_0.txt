(Sing along to the classic song "Calendar Girls")<br /><br />I did not like, I did not like those "Calendar Girls" I did not like, I did not like those "Calendar Girls" It is so boring this film called the "Calendar Girls" It is the most overrated film in the 2003 world Do not watch it any day of the year<br /><br />The film stars Helen Mirren as an old girl who gets her geriatric peeps to nude it out in front of the world so they can raise some funds for a couch memorial in a hospital vestibule but what we get is dreary story that quickly rans out of fuel Stay Away, Stay Away cause this is too weird <br /><br />That's why I did not like the film "Calendar Girls" That's why I was turned off by the "Calendar Girls" And if you did like "Calendar Girls" then you should be sent to a place where crazy people swirl Every day, Every Day of the year<br /><br />** Needs Improvement
