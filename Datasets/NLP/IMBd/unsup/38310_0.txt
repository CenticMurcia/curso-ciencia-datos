Some previous reviewers of this movie have either mistaken it for The Killer or Hard Boiled. It isnt too hard to mistake them when the people who released this movie retitled it and put some pictures from these movies on the cover. In truth this movie is titled Police Sir (or Be The First) a slapstick comedy more like the keystone kops than a John Woo film. It begins with Chow Yun Fat, a newly graduated officer coming on to his first day on the force. Because he is new he doesnt understand the right way to do things. This leads to all sorts of silliness and humor based in the Hong Kong? culture. There are some hints about corruption and incompetence on the police force that run through the movie. These might have been meant to be funny though at the time I was expecting a serious Woo action film. It is filmed poorly, my copy had huge objects on parts of the film and whole scenes are unwatchable due to dust and hair. Stay away unless you love eastern hong kong comedy and can find a great copy but dont be mistaken that this is a very silly movie.
