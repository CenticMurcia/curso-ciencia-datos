A lifetime regimen of television westerns has left me tired of the genre, sick of the directing, bored by the low budget sets, nauseated by the trite plots and appalled by the goodie two shoes language chosen in their screenplays.<br /><br />Deadwood is something altogether different, and though, by the admission of it's director, short of being an historical treatise it is nevertheless an historical perspective I have never seen before. Instead it is more of a treatment of an historical era lent to a respect for authenticity without compromising entertainment value.<br /><br />The scripting, casts, direction and sets are astounding. It is the first television miniseries (save for the Sopranos) that leaves me wanting for more and truly sad to see a season's ending. If only they could do something to improve new season turnaround!
