I feel sorry for whoever has the misfortune to get roped into seeing this: cliched and dull. A waste of whatever talent one or two members of the cast might have. I just happened to be visiting a friend who rented it...ironically, they fell asleep pretty early into it. (Recommended for any insomniacs with a VCR near their bed.)
