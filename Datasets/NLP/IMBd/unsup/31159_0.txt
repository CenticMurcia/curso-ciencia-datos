In a overview of Feast. I can at least say this....<br /><br />Don't expect your average run of the mill claustrophobic horror movie. <br /><br />This movie has way too much sense of humor for it to be politically correct. Don't take this movie seriously.<br /><br />Creatures kill whoever is convenient for them and don't expect anyone to be safe. Attacks are random and could keep you at the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Don't expect abuse of CGI. Classic monster costuming and effects are used.<br /><br />Expect the unexpected.<br /><br />Feast does its best to throw all Horror clich√©s out the window yet it doesn't try to be anything it is not meant to be.<br /><br />Henry Rollins is in this. Haven't seen him in a loooong time.<br /><br />I recommend this movie for the above reasons mentioned. Don't take this movie seriously and enjoy.
