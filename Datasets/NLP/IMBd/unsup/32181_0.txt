Imitation of Life was one of the worst films I have ever seen. I didn't particularly care for the plot, and it is ironic how the film tries to show that women can be independent (a big theme for the 1930's) but at the same time it portrays white women much more superior to black women. The Aunt Jemiama stereotype that is put onto Delialah proves my point. Audiences in the 1930's might have appreciated this work because of the rights of women suffrage but it totally dismisses the black struggle. Needless to say, this film fits into 1930's American Society. I have yet to see the 1960's remake (or 1950's?) but I would definitely check the remake out for changes in plot and theme because of social change (the predominance of the civil rights movement.) -Joe.
