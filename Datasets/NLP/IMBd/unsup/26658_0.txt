Playing on a theme similar to the one in director Jim Jarmusch's "Mystery Train", "Night on Earth" portrays the relationships between cabbies and their fares in five different cities all at the same time. In Los Angeles, punk Corky (Winona Ryder) picks up overworked executive Victoria Snelling (Gena Rowlands) and gets on her nerves. In New York, immigrant Helmut Grokenberger (Armin Mueller-Stahl) picks up African-American YoYo (Giancarlo Esposito), who has to show the driver how to drive. In Paris, an immigrant from the Ivory Coast picks up a blind girl, and they have a discussion about race and blindness. In Rome, a lunatic (Roberto Benigni) picks up a priest and confesses (warning: what he confesses may shock you royally). In Helsinki, a man picks up three men, and everyone has a sad story.<br /><br />The Rome segment is truly the funniest, with Benigni going all out in every way possible. The New York segment is also pretty funny, with YoYo getting irked by Helmut's inability to drive, and making fun of his name. The Helsinki segment is touching in every way possible. Jim Jarmusch may be an acquired taste, but he does have some good ideas.
