American Gun Mr. Black's Grade: C Starring Donald Sutherland , Forest Whitaker , Linda Cardellini , Marcia Gay Harden , Nikki Reed and Tony Goldwyn .<br /><br />American Gun follows four different story arcs featuring seemingly disparate portraits of people who all affected by the proliferation of guns in American society. The film is very earnest in it's portrayal of the gun problem in the US, but overall it is pretty forgettable.<br /><br />Ever been out in public, walking on the street or riding a subway and see a stranger crying? Naturally you feel some sympathy towards this person, but there is disconnect. Why are they crying? The new boyfriend never returned their phone call? Did they just receive news of a family member dying? Get a B on the Biology test? You have no real way to know. And that's how I felt in this movie, disconnected. Every 10 minutes or so there are these big emotional outbursts, and while you do eventually come to know why, there still is a serious separation.<br /><br />There is some interesting material here, and Marcia Gay Harden's confrontation with her neighbors is handled very well. That's it baby.
