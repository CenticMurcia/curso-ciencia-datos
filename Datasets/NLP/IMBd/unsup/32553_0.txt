This is the worst sleepaway movie I have ever seen.What a travesty and even the killer was lame and overacted.The cast if you can even call them that couldn't act for nothing.Especially the so called victim who was too much of a jerk to care about to begin with .His acting was absolutely horrid as was pretty much everyone else's in the cast and the ending WTH was that made no sense whatsoever and just ended abruptly for no reason.It was hilarious how most people reacted when they were killed talk about BAD acting totally horrid.<br /><br />I mean I've seen some doozy of some bad movies but this one takes the cake and not in a good way lol Granted some of the violence was like the rest of the sleepaway camp movies which was cool.But they edited it like crap because half the deaths you didn't even see just an aftermath which absolutely sucked I expected this sucker to be pack full of gore but I didn't see much of that which was also a disappointment for a Sleepaway movie especially.<br /><br />The movie was unintentionally hilarious literally I was laughing my ass off throughout most of this movie it was as if all the actors were reading DIRECTLY off their cue cards it was hilarious lol <br /><br />For instance 2 actors I can remember off the bat because they were BARELY ON lol <br /><br />Girl: stiff lifeless and wooden delivery: Stop it Allen you retard. Guy: stiff lifeless boring and wooden delivery: Ronnie get Allen to stop.<br /><br />Seriously this movie was a comedy not a horror movie ...to me anyways lol<br /><br />Too bad I can't go any lower then a 1 otherwise this would get a -0 from me.
