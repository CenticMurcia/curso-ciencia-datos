I seem to recall being warned about this one in advance to count it among Bela Lugosi's worst films! Anyhow, my viewing pleasure with this film (if there was any to be had in the first place) was seriously hampered by the atrocious video/audio quality of the print I watched (which seems to come off of a TV recording), replete with missing frames (shortening its running time by about 6 minutes!) and practically looking as if it was shot in the 1900s or something! Still, I suppose with the proper script and performers this could have made for a decent Thin Man/Charlie Chan outing; as it is, it's merely dull with a capital D and fatally clich√©-ridden. Lugosi fared much better in the similarly-themed INTERNATIONAL HOUSE (1933) which was a most pleasant surprise for me when I caught up with it late last year via Universal's W.C. Fields DVD set.
