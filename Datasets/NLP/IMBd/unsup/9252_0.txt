Keith Olbermann counts down the five top news stories you might be talking about tomorrow. The five stories are used loosely on the show, they decrease in seriousness. The first few are usually policy oriented, the next one or two is about the politics and the number one is a Keith Olbermann written special comment or a puff story on celebrities or something very stupid.<br /><br />The show started out as a run of the mill news hour, but as the Bush administration continued their questionable activities, Keith Olbermann started speaking out. His Worst Person's of the World and special comments started laying the blame where it was deserved. This is the kind of show that can renew the fire in an old liberal. Keith Olbermann doesn't have time to debate the other side on the issue, his guests mostly agree with him and expand on his thoughts.<br /><br />If you're a moderate or liberal who believes that sometimes there's not two parties, there's just right and wrong, and the republicans are usually in the wrong, this show is definitely for you. Keith Olbermann is the liberal you can depend and believe in.
