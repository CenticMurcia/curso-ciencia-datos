I have commented on a few of Newmans movies and they were favorable. Sorry to say this one was not. Newman sounded very old ... seems like his cigarette habit caught up to him. Quite frankly the guy did not want to be there. Its a shame because the rest of the cast was stellar. OK but now the plot , it went all over the place and just seemed to me spoofed of the old 40s film noire classics. Thats fine but not a well written film. It was one of the rare times we get to see Reese Witherspoon topless , if not the only time. Guys will want to watch this, but thank goodness its at the beginning of the film. Perhaps though this film, with its ALIST actors might have been better served if Newman played Hackmans part and vice versa. Thats all I will say without giving the movie away. Truth be told , even if this was Paul Newmans best acting performance this could not have been saved.
