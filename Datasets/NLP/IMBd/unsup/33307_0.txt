This being Bergmans first effort as a film director, it has been criticized for being overly melodramatic. First, melodrama is an utterly underrated way of telling stories, second, it was very much a sign of the times, as most films during that times tended to be overly melodramatic by themselves, and as a whole. So, it's not that much Bergmans fault, he just went away and made a film in the way most films was made at that time.<br /><br />The acting is very good, Inga Landgé is so very beautiful as the young ingénue, and Stig Olin makes a very impressionable performance as the two-bit hustler/pimp. Above all, all the small parts are done almost to perfection. And Bergman has some hilarious dialogue, like the old lady at the train, comforting Ingeborg when she wakes up after a bad dream:<br /><br />"You must've eaten something unsuitable. I usually dream about a big negro biting my toes off when I have eaten something unsuitable. Whatever that may mean..." <br /><br />If there was a memorable quotes section here for this film, that line would be there. In the end, this film is not done to perfection, it's not faultless and diamond sharp as Bergmans later efforts. But it is nice craftsmanship, good acting, and an enjoyable experience. A well done first try in film-making.
