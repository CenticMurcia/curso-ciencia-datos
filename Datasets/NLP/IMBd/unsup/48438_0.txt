I'm only 23 but I know a good deal about movies. How could someone sit down and write this screenplay? I'd be so ashamed of myself. I don't know where they found these actors either. I thought this was a parody or something when I watched it. I almost felt bad for the people who helped make this movie. I can't believe someone would put their name on the credits. And why is this rated R? I watched it on encore, I don't think they swear or anything. <br /><br />This is truly one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I wouldn't recommend this cheesy movie to anybody. DON"T WATCH IT!<br /><br />- BriStanley
