More depth, and 20 years earlier than "An Inconvenient Truth" warning. Aired on public television, and hard to find these days. It should be on DVD and circulated to all environmentalists so they can share with their families and friend so they can help prevent a devastating future climate changes. Burke uses early computer enhanced predictions. Hypothasises How, Where and Whats of global warming. Will not make sense to those who refuse to believe in Greenhouse Effects, Ocean Warming, and pollution. Does not paint a rosy picture that would sell his film. It is a little bit more far reaching than the current "An Inconvenient Truth." I.M.H.O.
