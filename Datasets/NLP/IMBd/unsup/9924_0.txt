The very first time I first heard of this hit Korean drama here in my country was when it was reported that many in Hong Kong watched the finale and it broke the record in terms of viewership ratings there. From then on, it had got me intrigued.<br /><br />Based on the life of the first ever woman royal physician in the now Korea, it will definitely pull your heartstrings and move you. The age-old philosophy of perseverance and facing whatever adversaries no matter how big or small is dominant in this drama serial.<br /><br />Lee Young-Ae plays the role of Jang Geum very well. So do the other cast members as well. Those who play the evil court ladies are really so convincing that it made me forgot for a moment that it is only just a show.<br /><br />The spread of food being shown in the drama serial can really make you go mouth-watering. You will be surprised as to why each dish has its own significance and all that. The medical knowledge that Jang Geum has later on in the serial is really impressive but then at times, it got her into trouble as well. But she always persevered and save the day. The scenes with Lord Min are always very sweet and romantic.<br /><br />In this current age and times where the traits Jang Geum possesses really make people try to understand more of the world they are in, this show is definitely a winner. Virtually almost no sex is involved here and this is something Asian societies has been waiting for a long time, given our culture can be conservative at times. But as long as anyone is interested in checking out this drama serial, you need to find out first whether there's dubbing and/or subtitles involved if your local TV station is showing it. Chances are there will be, given the original language is in Korean. As I watched this drama serial through DVD, the dubbing and subtitles really helped me understand what is happening.<br /><br />After finishing watching this show, I understand why so many love it. I do too.
