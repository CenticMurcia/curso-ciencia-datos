Threat is a lousy film. Childish dialogs, amateurish editing and in general a failed movie. That said, it's not a boring flick. I could not find any dramatic line leading to the violent ending, everything seemed to be just pasted, mixing all ingredients without a functional recipe, some of it worked, animation fitted in quite smoothly, in fact I missed more of it, soundtrack is again quite suited to the action. I didn't regret watching it, in all fashion is what this movie is really about, not a line of fashion, but many styles, not only in dressing but also talking and even walking. It tries to present another catalog of urban tribes, but it fails on that too. In general, watch it only if you don't find any other thing to do.
