I rented this video due to the presence of Jefferey Combs, who was the guy who played the demented Federal Agent in the Frighteners. The fact that one of the creators of the all time B-movie "Re-Animator" was directing it. Boy, was I wrong.<br /><br />I have not read the original comic book this film is based on. But judging from the acclaim it got, I have to assume that this film is an inferior adaptation. This film is a dull, shoddy mess, filled with every comic book you can think of.<br /><br />The script is skeletal, a ramshackle construction that rips off many of the most popular recent comics and comic based films. Take a little bit of Batman and Darkman, mix in large dollops of Spawn and the Crow, add some cheap effects and bad acting and presto! you have this thundering bore of a film.<br /><br />Not even the performers can save it. Mark Snow, who plays the lead, is so wooden and ridiculously self-serious, there isn't even any good camp value in his portrayal.<br /><br />Jeffery Combs, who should have been the best part of this, is wasted as a stalwart cop. Why use this guy if he's just going to play the straight man?<br /><br />The rest of the cast are just plain amateur hour. They appear to be foreigners of various nationalities, so the already silly dialog is made even worse by their wooden readings in a babel of thick, impenetrable accents.<br /><br />I can't see how this film can appeal to anyone. It's not bloody or sexy enough for gore and T&A hounds, the comic book elements are nothing you haven't seen in better films and the special effects are laughable.<br /><br />It's not even good for MST-style humor, because the cast and crew seem to be taking themselves far too seriously. It's more boring than inept.<br /><br />Skip this turkey.
