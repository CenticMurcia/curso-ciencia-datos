Don't waste your money with this piece of "work". Boring, underdirected, overplayed, overdramatized, inconsistent -- these are just a few words that come to mind when watching this garbage. The movie promises to keep you in suspense until the very end, however, half way through you realize that you are no longer interested in finding out what's going on. The dialogue is so bleak and uninteresting, you will find yourself nodding off after about 40 minutes. The producers have tried to combine suspense, horror, intrigue, sci-fi, gore, and romance, and they failed miserably. The actors' plays leave you wishing for Pauly Shore's return. To summarize: if you want to see a bad, yet somewhat entertaining movie, watch Biodome. Don't waste your hard-earned money with this garbage.
