I'm all for a nice bit of blasphemy, but sometimes that just isn't enough to make a good movie!<br /><br />During the first half of EL DIA DE LA BESTIA I thought this was shaping up to be a fantastic film. There are some funny scenes with the priest who must summon satan and his unlikely side-kick, a heavy metal stoner. But before long the plot starts to unravel until, by the time we get to the climax, it is effectively meaningless.<br /><br />Alex De La Iglesia has made some good films (particularly La Communidad) but this is not one of his best. The lack of a coherent plot overshadows the movies merits and makes this an unsatisfying watch. Perhaps if the script had been given a few months more attention it would have been an excellent film.<br /><br />3/10
