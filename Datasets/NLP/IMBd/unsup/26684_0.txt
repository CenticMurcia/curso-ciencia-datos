This was my absolute favorite movie as a kid. Foxes were always my favorite animals, and I believe this movie was what started that. This had to be one of the first movies I saw because I watched it for years and years after that. It still brings back many fond memories. I can't quite put my finger on the reason why I liked it so much, but I don't really care to anyways. I liked it then, and I still like it now.<br /><br />Watching it now as an adult I can see the juvenile aspects of the film, as well as the non-North American influence. The animation is very unique (almost like anime, but completely different). This isn't a flaw, but instead a part of the film that makes it that much better. The dialogue is almost humorous in that it is very juvenile, but I can't bring myself to criticize this film. As a children's movie in the early 90's it was utterly flawless, but today's kids are getting smarter and probably wouldn't appreciate a film like this (unless they were very young).<br /><br />I still have the old VHS copy of the movie, but would like to find and purchase a newer copy so that someday my kids could enjoy it as well. They need to re-release it as a classic on DVD. I'll bet many people could appreciate something like that.<br /><br />If you've never seen this film, find somebody who owns an old VHS copy and watch it with your young children. You'll find that it is a welcomed escape from some of the distasteful modern cartoons they put out these days. I can't say everybody who watches it will enjoy it simply because people have different tastes. But you will have to admit that it is unique in a good way. <br /><br />Cheers
