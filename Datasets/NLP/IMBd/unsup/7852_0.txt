I had high hopes for this movie considering what a big deal the box office made this movie into but when I watched it for the first time, not even half way through the movie I was so disappointed in it. First of all, Eddie Murphy does not belong in this movie at all, he just does not fit in with this movie. And the leading lady was a poor choice as a supporting cast as well as the two bratty know it all kids who looked more like rejects from some shelter with crappy one liners through the movie. Even the plot of the story was bad, a man who fell in love with his fiance' in whom he was to marry dies of a supposedly suicide and years later he tries to bring her back to life and fall in love with him again by locating Eddie Murphys wife who we find that she is not his fiance' reincarnated but then she is and then she isn't again and the whole movie is just one mess. I wouldn't even recommend this movie to a child. There is nothing haunted about this movie movie more like stupid mansion is more like it. I don't know what has happened to poor Eddie but he really needs to change his direction in movie roles.
