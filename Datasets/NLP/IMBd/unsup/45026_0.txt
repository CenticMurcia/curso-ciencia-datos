Pretty darn bad. Bad enough for some laughs. At the malt shop a decision must be made; does a group of teens go horseback riding or skiing? Or maybe become zombies...no not yet. Most of the group pack up for a picnic on a remote island not even on the map. What happened to the skiing? The kids go exploring the island and find the home of a 'dragon lady'-like scientist(Katherine Victor) that welcomes the teen visitors; now she will have more subjects for her experimentation with a secret formula chemical that will turn them into zombies. She seems to be in cahoots with a couple of thick headed spies as well as the local sheriff(Mike Concannon). The couple that went horseback riding stumble into a rescue attempt. By the way, there is a gorilla roaming the island. Not only is there some very bad acting; there is some horrid excuse for rock & roll music. Cast members include: Don Sullivan, Brianne Murphy, Paul Pepper and Mitzie Albertson.
