This has to be the best movie of 2006. It is without a doubt the performance of Will Smith's career, and anyone who says that that isn't saying much is crazy. I have just finished seeing the movie in the theater and was moved more than any movie since Titanic. I am a very hard critic, I'll admit, but this was a gem among all the dull stones this year. It is not just the movie of the holiday season, it is a spectacular story. The parts of the movie that have been criticized, mainly by those that have yet to see the film, are easily negated by watching the movie. The story wasn't about Mr. Gardner and his wife/girlfriend-it was about him, his son, diligence, hope, happiness, and so much more. It is so refreshing to be inspired by a film again. There was plenty of chemistry between Gardner and his son. Will Smith can act. Like he says in the movie, and I'm paraphrasing, "People will tell you that you can't do it because they can't." That's what I say to anyone who questions the writing or directing of this film. You mock what you cannot do yourself. This is utter brilliance, ten stars.
