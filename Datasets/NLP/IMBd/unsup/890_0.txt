This is the greatest scripted, live action comedy to hit TV in years. The timing, the stories, the delivery and yes the TORI are all spot on and perfect. Special mention should go to the genuine report Anthony Quinto (Sassan) and Tori have together... it's so realistic it's scary. This show should be viewed and praised by the masses. Loni Anderson has never been involved with a better project. This show is relentlessly hysterical. Tori Spelling is a goddess and a brilliant actress and this is all stuff I never thought would escape my lips. Swithc it to VH1 every Sunday and get your long hot doses of Ms.Spelling and the gang poking fun at everyone and everything to go through Hollywood. -Tori turn down your nipples so I can hear you!- Love SO NOTORIOUS!!!!!
