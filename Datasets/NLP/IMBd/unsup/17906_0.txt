This was OK, but it could have been better. It was known who was going to win the Ring of the Ring title, and not many matches were exciting.<br /><br />Match 1 saw RVD challenging Chris Jericho in a semi final match up. This was very good. RVD got the win.<br /><br />Next up was a semi final match between Test and Brock Lesnar. While this was enjoyable, it was all Test. This was strange because Lesnar is supposed to be tough, mean, nasty and damn right destructible. All this did was make him look like a kid. Next up Ric Flair challenges Eddie Guerrero in a p*ss poor contest. It was boring, crap, slow and useless. OK yeah so WWE had to find a replacement for 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin, but Flair? Give me a break! Next up Jamie Noble challenged The Hurricane for the Cruiseweight in a boring match. Nidia done my head in with her interfering actions. However I must be fair, one good spot was when Hurricane gave a Noble a neck breaker off the top rope.<br /><br />Next up Molly took on Trish Stratus in a usual Women's match. In other words, useless. Then Hulk Hogan took on Kurt Angle. I just fast forward this match, because I couldn't have been arsed about it. Apologies if it was good, but Hogan was getting on for 49 years of age 3 years ago, and he's no Chris Benoit is he? Next up RVD battles Brock Lesnar in the KotR final match. Common do I need to tell you who won?! This was a very good match though.<br /><br />Then The Undertaker challenges Triple H in a passable main event match. This was nowhere near as good as their Wrestlemania 17 clash in March 2001.<br /><br />Overall Grade - C+
