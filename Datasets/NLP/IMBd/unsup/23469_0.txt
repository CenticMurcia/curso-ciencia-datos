After waiting a year for this film, I finally saw it in Hollywood today on the big screen. It exceeded my expectations. This is one of the best horror/slasher films to come around in years. Relentless, gory, and an edge of your seat ride. This is not a "B" grade film. It has an obviously decent budget, a great cast, and brilliantly written and directed by Paul Etheredge-Ouzts. It is billed as the fist gay slasher film. But do no expect exploitive sex scenes. Although there is plenty of sexy male skin on hand, this is a real horror film, with lots of shocks and screams. Filmed on location during West Hollywood's annual gay Halloween parade, this gives the film a freaky feeling of even though you are surrounded by lots of people, you are still very much alone when a crazed psychopath is on the loose!! The cast, including, Dylan Fergus, Bryan Kirkwood, the adorable Hank Harris and Matt Phillips are all very good and each have very good good characters. I don't want to give anything away, instead I want to stress this is a very impressive horror film. It is a great entry in the horror genre, and a huge step in the gay film genre. This movie will no doubt gain a huge cult status, and become a horror classic. The ending is nail biting and fantastic. Hellbent is a fantastic modern horror film, not to be missed!
