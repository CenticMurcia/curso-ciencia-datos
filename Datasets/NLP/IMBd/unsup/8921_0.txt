This movie ended up being a lot more than I expected. I thought it was going to be another one of those zombie movies with three snobby girls and the one good looking jock, but it's far from that. One of the main things that puts this movie ahead in my opinion is that to me it's more about the people and the government's reaction more than anything else. The characters are normal people, living normal lives, and you really begin to like all of them. It's filmed in such a way that you start to feel like you're right in the midst of the terror, right next to them, and you can't take your eyes away. And the 'creatures.' They're terrifying. The idea of rat creatures at first doesn't seem that scary, but they do SO well with these. I'll never have a pet rat again, that's for sure. All in all, this is one of the best horror films I have ever seen. It is absolutely terrifying, and it really makes you think.
