This movie alternated between captivating wine drama and formulaic romance.<br /><br />The wine drama part was held together by the Bill Pullman and Freddy Rodriguez, both excellent. It had beautiful scenery, a love triangle with a pretty girl, an immigrant story, and maybe half a dozen colorful side characters. All ingredients of a good movie.<br /><br />But then the master craftsmen in charge of this masterpiece added the final ingredient -- namely the entire catalog of Hollywood romantic-adventure-drama-comedy clich√©'s. Something like Coyote Ugly, but in wine country. <br /><br />That's it in a nutshell. With a few bottles it becomes fun movie, but not quite film festival worthy. Don't know what they were thinking at Sundance, I'm giving it a 4 (BYOB).
