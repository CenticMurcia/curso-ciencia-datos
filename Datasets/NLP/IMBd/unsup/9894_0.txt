I was forced to watch this movie with a friend. I have never heard of it until then. I found out that Micheal J. Fox was in it so I decided to watch it. It started out very different and then I was shocked to see how the family memebers were treating each other. This movie was a comedy, but a drama as well and I loved it. The humor was different, but funny all the same. I really, really liked this film and this is a deffinate purchase.
