I love short story films, especially when, of one particular theme, they are connected to satisfy a feature length running time.<br /><br />Like taking any subway/underground/metro train, with Subway Stories, if you don't like one particular story, wait a few minutes and a better one will come along.<br /><br />Of course everyone will have their particular favourites, but for me<br /><br />Fern's Heart of Darkness, Sax Cantor Riff, Manhattan Miracle, Love on the A Train, and Underground were simply original and wonderful.<br /><br />I'm English and lived in London for four years so these types of stories are not exclusive to New York. <br /><br />Where there are people, there are possibilities.
