Nice effects (for a home video!) and creative killing are the keywords for this no-budget-what-so-ever-movie. But I imagine they had a good time making this. Another positive thing about this movie is that it spawned two brilliant sequels. Watch them instead. They are available in a German Special Edition, which include all three flicks+ tons of extra material! A must buy for all gore-hounds!
