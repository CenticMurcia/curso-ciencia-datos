I saw this movie and found it extremely puzzling. The child, Emil, is the least sympathetic character I have seen since, "The Good Son." Emil is cold, calculating and manipulates the other characters with no conscience whatsoever.<br /><br />I found the ending the most curious of all. Emil attempts to murder Pat, and because he cries over it, and confesses the Nazis kept him in a dark cell for what his father did, the family forgives all. This seems to be a recipe for disaster. The end credits roll, but does anyone believe a kid that tried to kill before won't try to do it again when he doesn't get his way? Nuts!
