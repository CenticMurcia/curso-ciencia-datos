Regardless of what I though of the movie overall, nearly 24 hrs later and the movie is still with me. Overall, I thought the movie was well done. It managed to mix the thriller genre while successfully (to a greater or lesser degree) incorporating both the sci-fi and spiritual elements. Most of it worked. Most.<br /><br />While trying not to give too much away, the plot can be summarized as the story of a widowed father that has resigned himself to the scientific as a result of her death. After a 50 year old time capsule is opened revealing a list of numbers, he begins to notice a patten defining every major catastrophe over the past 50 years. As he follows the pattern, trying to prevent the events to come, he begins to wonder what all of this has to do with him and his son. It is a good thriller and it kept me second guessing myself throughout.<br /><br />I think the hardest part for me with this movie was the special effects. Now, whoever did the graphics certainly did a better job than I could ever do, but as this seemed like a big budget movie and as we've see many movies with similar visual sequences done so smoothly, I was very disappointed and I actually had to try to convince myself to ignore the music video par cgi so I could appreciate the movie. As an example, the fire at the plane scene was very flat and the subway lighting and textures were not believable. Even movies like what pixar has put out have been able to create realistic flowing so the long grass appearing so outdated, again, took away from the believability. Though I will definitely compliment whoever made the object that caused Cage's character to fall to his knees towards the end. THAT was impressive.<br /><br />I think had it not had so many similarities to things such as Signs, or Armageddon, or Die Hard (high tension action), I think it would have gotten a better score.<br /><br />But that said, I would still highly recommend this movie!
