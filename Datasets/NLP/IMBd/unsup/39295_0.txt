This movie was very disappointing and a major let down compared to the first and second Santa Clause films.<br /><br />In my opinion this is without doubt one of the worst films ever made, it is vile, its is puerile, it is disgusting and I survived through the entire movie, that was enough to have me in a state of life threatening nausea.<br /><br />The acting and story line is terrible and the plot isn't very creative. There should have been more action and adventure.<br /><br />I am certain that some people of a mentally retarded predicament would appreciate it but even then they don't.<br /><br />This movie is ridiculously unfunny and lame, i wouldn't recommend this anyone, it seemed as if a monkey wrote the script, its just a pile of garbage thrown together.
