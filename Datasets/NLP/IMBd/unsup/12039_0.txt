I was very keen in wanting to watch this Rgv movie as soon as I had seen the first look of it in 2005. Upon viewing it I was not disappointed. However the movie had suffered a serious hangover from Verma's previous movies like 'satya' and 'company'.The movie did not have much new to offer. There was an extension of a sub-plot from 'company' This being the 2 sons of a senior crime lord behaving in a negative manner towards their peers.<br /><br />If I compare this movie to Verma's earlier movie 'satya', 'D' depicted a more realistic transition of a individual turning in to a gangster. Though Randeep Hooda's character did not evoke much emotions or feelings as compared to J.D Chakraverthy. Most of the time he chooses to hide behind his shades and speak in a rock stone manner. The movie has a short running time of 100 mins, so the pace was very fast. The director and writer being newcomer vishram sawant wasted no time in moving with the plot. He tells the story from his perspective in the most honest way.Its inspired from Rgv's movies. The grittiness of Mumbai life and the local scenery is authentically used.<br /><br />****************************SPOILERS AHEAD************************* Inner gang rivalry is the subject here once again. But it is narrated from a different angle. Hooda is a mechanic who comes back to Mumbai due to sudden death of a relative. However he becomes a witness to a killing a nd is put under pressure to not testify by a crime boss, while being forced on the other side by the law to point out the culprits in a line-up. Later in wanting to get revenge he approaches goga kapoor's gang to join. But as he popularity increases, goga's 2 sons 'sushant' and yashpal' become jealous and attempt to hinder hooda's attempts to bring prosperity to the gang. The gang becomes segmented and each are designated their area of priorities. However rivalry becomes even more bitter.***********************END OF SPOILERS*********************** Without a doubt vishram sawant has proved that he can write and direct. There are many good camera angles both close and wide that he has used. Howver the dubbing is terrible and the there is hardly any background surround sound. Viewing pleasure would be enhanced if these two elements were given more consideration. The background score is fantastic and really suits the mood of the movie. Different pieces of music are used in accordance with what the scene demanded. Though it was used too much in some places when it there was no requirement for it. Randeep Hooda gives a just about acceptable performance as a gangster. There was room for improvement. He did not seem to get under the skin of the character. He did not frighten either. Goga acts well for his age but acted very confused in the second half. There is a lot of intensity in the second half of the movie as characters turn to brutal ways and creating misunderstandings about others.<br /><br />In the future I hope more good Indian gangster movies should release. However only time will tell. If you like verma's crime flicks, be sure to check this out.
