It's 1934, and the Breen Office is beginning to strictly enforce the Hays Code. Originally put in place in 1930, the Code was ignored for years by Hollywood producers, who plied their audiences with immorality and vice. The audiences loved it, of course, but America's bluenoses had had it with drug use, adultery, and hints of homosexuality, and Breen began to crack down. What does this have to with Kentucky Kernels? Well, gone are Wheeler and Woolsey's nudge nudge wink wink repartee, to be replaced by broad slapstick and agonizing racial humor. The result is an unsatisfying mess, with the boys saddled with cute lil' Spanky McFarland for good measure in this tale of fussin' and feudin' in the old Confederacy. The film just doesn't have the saucy joie de vivre of the pre-Code Wheeler and Woolseys, and the presence of poor old Willie Best (here in his Sleep 'n' Eat persona) guarantees 99% of the modern day audience will find offense with this film. There are a few laughs, but you're best advised to stick with the comedy team's earlier output.
