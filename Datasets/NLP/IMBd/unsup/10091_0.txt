I enjoyed this movie very much when I was a little girl, it was so erotic I din'd want the vampire to be killed at all... But the real reason I'm writing is because I would really appreciate some help to find the name of another vampire film I can't stop thinking about: all I remember about it is that is was in B&W (or maybe it was just my TV, I can't remember) I recall only two scenes: one, there was like a parade and there was this woman who looked very much like a nun, and the vampire grabbed her and sucked her blood inside of a car, and everyone who saw them laughed 'cause they thought they were making out. The other scene I remember is that this vampire (who wasn't attractive at all and looked very much like a mid 40's accountant with a trench coat) made a much needed cash by selling the paintings of the women he murdered. In fact in the scene I remember there was this old lady who was a fan of his art, and the painting she was purchasing was of a nude girl lying in a rock with a knife stabbed in her chest. Does anyone know this picture's name? Is it possible I only dreamed it? Thanks in advance Wendy
