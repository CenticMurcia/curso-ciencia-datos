Sydney J. Bartholomew Jr. should never be allowed to make another film again. How come people are giving budgets to people to make bad films when there are plenty of creative talented directors out there struggling to make their first feature?!<br /><br />The only reason to buy/rent this film is if you think the Sprouse twins are too cute to pass on. Yes they are, and they don't disappoint here either. But trust me when I tell you, that is the only reason (and one other I'll mention in a moment)<br /><br />The scenes are shabbily put together (everything looks rushed). They even used stills taken from the footage for coverage (UGH!). The music is crude with dialogue to match (this is little kid's entertainment?!)<br /><br />A good director would have noticed Cole mouthing Dylan's lines in a number of the scenes and given him some coaching. If he didn't pick this up on set, it definitely should have been spotted in the dailies? Their double-takes in the scene with Cobi Jones' cameo were unbearable to watch. If I'd have been on set... Well, never mind! Two ADs too! Didn't they have a creative brain cell between them?<br /><br />One little gem I spotted in all of this mess was a young actor, Tyler Hervey. Look out for him if you watch this movie. Character is "Mikey" and he plays an angry cop's kid. Got wonderful on-screen presence and would be wonderful to see him in a major role.<br /><br />Anyway... Just for kicks gets 2/10.
