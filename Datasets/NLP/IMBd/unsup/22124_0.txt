First off, let me start by saying that a 10/10 is not enough. Never have I cried so hard at the end of a film. I even cam home no more than half an hour ago and cried on my bed. This movie really gets to you, and I know that this may sound a bit clich√©, but it has everything an excellent film could want. Comedy, drama, romance, mystery. I know some people out there may not agree with me, (like that butt - hole roger ebert who only gave it 2 and a half stars!) however I am finding it difficult to put into words how great this film is, as emotion has swarmed over me. The Curious Case Of Benjamin button is now easily in my top 5 greatest movies of all time. To not see this movie would be a grave mistake. I am so yearning to read the original book. I know this review/comment may sound like someone rambling on but this movie, without a doubt, is perfect. That's the only word I can use to describe The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button...... P-e-r-f-e-c-t. I don't just highly recommend this movie, I hearteningly implore you... nay, beg you to at least watch this film once, as it will leave you swept off your feet with vast amounts of emotion. And that's all i have to say about that.<br /><br />Adios ! Y'all
