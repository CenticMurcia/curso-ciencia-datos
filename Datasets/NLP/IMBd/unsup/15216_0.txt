non-creative way of telling the story of violence of suburban youth in Turkey. No character is alive. They acts as in theater. There is endless violence without a cause or reason. Its main idea is that: "the judgment system is not enough for satisfying victims. Therefore they should use same violence to create justice" There should be revenge. And in this point, the victims become killers. Time mixing, giving role to famous directors (Zeki Demirkubuz, Cagan Irmak, and the director itself) can not keep away the film from being boring. It is excitement without excitement. The only creative idea is that while someone drinking tea or yogurt don't ask what time is it.
