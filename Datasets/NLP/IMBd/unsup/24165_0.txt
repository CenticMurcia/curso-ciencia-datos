Jay Russell directs this fantasy a whole family can enjoy. Very good special effects and interesting story line. A young boy named Angus(Alex Etel)living in 1940s Scotland has been told his sailor father has been lost at sea. In spite of his own fear of the sea, Angus loves to spend his time on the shore of the lake. One day he discovers a mysterious egg and takes good care of it until it hatches into a 'water horse'. He names the little creature Crusoe, who seems to grow larger everyday until he becomes so large he has to be put in the lake; thus becoming the legendary Lock Ness Monster. When German U-boats start to enter the lake, Crusoe's life is put in danger... even if he has grown to monumental size. Exciting, heartwarming story and really a joy to watch. Also in the cast: Emily Watson, David Morrissey, Ben Chaplin, Brian Cox and Priyanka Xi.
