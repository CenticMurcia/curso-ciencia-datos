Please do not blow your money on this DVD, I should have just tuned into the science fiction channel instead of wasting my time on this low grade soap opera disguised as a science fiction movie. Mediocre plot, terrible fight sequences, horrible acting. Don "the dragon" Wilson seemed like he needed a few more lessons, along with his son Brad Tanaka. Dan Mayid was more of a spoiled child than a convincing actor. The cast seemed like a failed attempt to reunite actors who were prestigious martial artists, but lacked a flow. <br /><br />Overall, don't expect much. If you view it as a cult-comedy, you may have a better time sitting through it.
