I grew up in the 1940s, and my sister and I went to the movies all the time. I recalled the name Irene Dunne, but I had never seen her in a movie. Well, last night I did in "Roberta" (1935). What a voice, like a nightingale. Her rendition of "Smoke Gets in Your Eyes" was the most beautiful version that I have ever heard. I found myself wishing she would sing for at least another half hour.<br /><br />There were also the exquisite, exciting, beautiful gowns and furs. My own mother was a real beauty in the l940s, and seeing the fashions of that time really made me wish I was a woman during that era rather than a child. Then too, I loved the sets, done predominantly in white and ever so glamorous! <br /><br />As if that wasn't enough of a treat we had the exquisite team of Astaire and Rodgers. Their numbers were breathtaking, two bodies that moved as one, smooth, free-flowing, what grace! I found the storyline boring, but the talent and beauty that filled the screen sure made up for that.
