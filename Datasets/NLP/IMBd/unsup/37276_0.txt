This movie gives teenagers and pre-teens a bad name, we are not all giggly little school girls who prance around and act all 'grown up' Its so childish, and is a complete and utter embarrassment. Throughout the film I was cringing in my seat and praying for it to end.<br /><br />Various films like 'mean girls' and 'cluless' were genius and I felt 'Angus thongs and perfect snogging' wasn't up to that level at all. Georgia is portrayed as a little brat, and each character has no depth whatsoever, who cares what happens! The acting was awful,they simply couldn't, and compared to 'bend it like beckham, also directed by Gurinder Chadha this is an utter failure.<br /><br />Keira knightly was brilliant and so was Parminder Nagra, but in this film there seems to be no talent whatsoever.<br /><br />Overall i was very disappointed and compared to the books there seemed no connection between them at all, save your money and your time, and watch dark night it 'mazin :D
