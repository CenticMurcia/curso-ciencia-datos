Date Movie was a movie that I thought would turn out to be hilarious, but yet, it turned out to be incredibly stupid, senseless, and unfunny as possible!!!The only real funny part was at the starting when Alyson Hannigan was trying to be sexy,and that wasn't even all that funny.I think Date Movie was a useless piece of junk that should have never been made, because it hurt's the good name of spoof movies everywhere, basically meaning the Scary Movie series.I thought that Date Movie was one of the grossest, sloppiest movies ever as well.I mean, I can stand some gross humor, but this film went a little to far, and I am ashamed that the people in this film agreed to act in this nonsense, especially Alyson Hannigan.So I warn you, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!!!It isn't worth spending money or time on.
