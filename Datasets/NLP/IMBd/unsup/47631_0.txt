Bought the Video for 50 cents, in the local blockbusters 'culling' of 'rust'. Cover looked good,shadowy figures shrouded by mist, a promise of a 'cracker jack' MIB and cover-ups.<br /><br />Pace, energy, dramatic tension empathy with character,there is none there.<br /><br />Eric Roberts, an actor who I was not aware of before this movie,stars as Bob Wilson , a man with very bad facial hair,looking late 70's.There is some scenes in the movie where he looks like he has lost some 'teeth' on the left side and the beard is a beard to hide the fact. <br /><br />It looks and runs like a 'low budget' B,but without the 'whackyness' to become a cult movie.<br /><br />The story has been culled from the 'real' UFO alien abduction case's that were abound during the year 1996 and 1998.These books collectively had concluded the the 'greys' have been here all the time,but are so sensitive to sunlight,they are addicted to 'ray bands' and black suits and cars.Because they are so embarrassed off these 'faults' they are determined to remove any evidence that earthlings may have happened to stumble on, that they exist. <br /><br />The Movie does not get off first base. Dean stock well, who plays the UFO writer Stan Mills adds some , energy' to this movie,but you do feel that somehow Dean is winking to the camera with the thought, can you really believe this.....<br /><br />Howver there was a 'laff', the dog's name was 'anthrax', a sly reference to 'close encounters....' <br /><br />Lisa Dinkins, the desk sergeant, looks more angry towards the director on the set, than to the character who'dosn't make her day'.<br /><br />The Shadow Men, lacks script, and direction.For a film made in 1998 it looks and rides like a 'loss leader'.<br /><br />It deserves only a two, but I'm open to suggestions that it deserves better.
