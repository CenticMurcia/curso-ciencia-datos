this is just a gorgeous film full of tone and color and an absolutely perfect soundtrack. portraying an idyllic time in anais nin's life, the film works to highlight one woman's sensual/sexual exploration which just happens to include another infamous author. worth noting is uma thurman's striking portrayal of june miller. she is unmatched.
