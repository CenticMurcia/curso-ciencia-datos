I have never allowed the hype surrounding Roger Corman's alleged "genius" to cloud my perceptions of his work. Most of his 50's movies are really awful; their cheapness and speed of production is the only reason they got released, to fill the double and triple features of drive-ins for the teenagers who weren't watching anyway. He improved marginally in the 60's but remained more concerned about exploitation than creation. "The Undead" is a perfect example of the former (50s) period. It is goofy, stupid, illogical, poorly written, poorly acted, poorly staged...you name it. Face it - the emperor has no clothes; that is, Corman stinks.
