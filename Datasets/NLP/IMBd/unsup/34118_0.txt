Contamination .7, or The Crawlers as I think it's more commonly known, is set in the small American town of Littleton where Josie (Mary Sellers) has just returned after several years away to reunite with her family there & her ex boyfriend Matt (Jason Saucier) as well. However Josie has picked a bad time to return home as the corrupt head of a nearby nuclear power plant has been stealing the money used to safely dispose of radioactive waste & dumping it in the local woods which has the unwanted side effect of producing mutated killer roots which have a taste for human flesh! Can the residents of Littleton save themselves from becoming tree food?<br /><br />This Canadian production has Martin Newlin credited as director but that's just a pseudonym for Fabrizio Laurenti & the IMDb also claims Joe D'Amato had something to do with it but the version I saw only had one credited director, anyway this has a pretty bad reputation & I can't really say it's undeserved. The script by Laurenti, Albert Lawrence & Daniele Stroppa is an eco-horror with a message, basically pollution is bad. Now this sentiment is all very well & good but it would have helped if there was a decent film behind it & then there's the fact that Contamination .7 is far from the first film to tackle this issue. The character's & dialogue are poor, their decision making is hopeless & at times strange, some of the scenes here are just plain ridiculous & make no sense, it's too long at 100 odd minutes, it has next to no gore or exploitation & it's just very badly written & thought out right down to a none event of an ending. Having said that I actually found it watchable in a really bad kind of way, I don't know why but I was actually glued to it! Maybe just to see how bad it got I don't know but I've certainly seen worse & there was just something here that I liked, I mean I didn't like it much but as far as I'm concerned I saw something in it.<br /><br />Director Laurenti doesn't impress here with plenty of continuity mistakes & probably the single most pathetic model bulldozer special effect ever, the model they use is obviously a kids toy & it looks terrible. Then there's the killer roots themselves who never really do much apart from wrap themselves around people & we never see what they are attached to either. There's no gore here except one scene when the corrupt Sheriff has a root enter his mouth & exit through his eye socket...<br /><br />Technically this is alright, forget about the continuity mistakes, it's quite well made & beats hands down many low budget horror films that are made these days. The acting is poor by an obviously amateur cast some of whom appear to have been very badly dubbed in particular the Sheriff.<br /><br />Contamination .7 is a terrible film for sure & I'm not saying otherwise but for some strange reason I sort of liked it for what it is, don't get me wrong as 99.9% of the film going public will hate it with a passion but I guess I'm in that 00.1% minority & proud of it although I'm not quite sure what that says about me.
