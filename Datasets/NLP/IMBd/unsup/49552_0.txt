I saw this movie when I was a child and I love it. It was one of my favorites movies. Now, after years, I am very disappointed. I saw all the flaws, all the mistakes. The acting is really bad, especially in the first episodes. The movies tries to rely on the book, but its much more compress and much more less enjoyable. The ending, witch is different from the book is not bad, is absolutely awful. One of the worst endings I've seen, no substance, no logic, the ending in the book is much good. If you seen this movie in your childhood, I recommend not to see it again. If you didn't see it, I recommend you to avoid seeing. The book is really good, I recommend you read it instead of watching this.
