Let's Rock! Let's Rock! That song has been in my head for days Sonny Westwood; you rock! Sexy movie, sexy characters, sexy sexy girls and where did Tabitha Taylor come from??? How on earth did they round up this whole cast also and Busey's a riot! I really enjoyed this film and I've seen it 3 times already and it's one of those films that's so intricate that it needs to be seen a few times.<br /><br />At least twice, there's a twist and I have not been that thrown from a movie since 'Usual Suspects' The Director did a great job both with the film and the screenplay, which I think was brilliant.<br /><br />Watch it and you'll agree. I personally didn't like the fact that Tabitha Taylor didn't get fully naked and I was hanging on the edge of my seat, waiting, but I guess that was what the director wanted, who knows. Funny, hilarious and non stop momentum and that's what I like in movies.
