Being a huge Jerky Boys fan for many years, I decided to check out Kamal's new movie God Has a Rap Sheet. The result was an unexpectedly thought-provoking evening. Kamal has truly hit his true stride - the sharp dialog, excellent direction and across-the-board great acting performances made this a film to remember. The plot revolves around a group of misfits from all walks of life stuck in a holding cell for one night. John Ford Noonan's portrayal of a bum/God is amazing and the ensemble cast brings a great energy to the movie. Hopefully they'll release a DVD soon so I can check it out again. Look for really big things from Kamal, he knows how to make a great film.
