This is one of the best children's television shows ever. Grim is great because he is more like an extremely old, six foot tall Yoda always helping the kids, hmm? Billy is the lovable doofus always getting into a load of junk that is really stupid, such as eating an endless supply of magical bubble gum and then flactuating huge bubbles, just before belching all of the gum up and into the atmosphere, covering the whole world in gum. Then there's Mandy, the cute little spawn of Satan, yet more evil than the Grim Reaper, which is weird. I remember the time that she smiled and caused the apocalypse to happen. That was a good time. Well, if you have never seen the show, I suggest you watch it immediately and start laughing as Kurtwood Smith plays Grim's father in one of the episodes!
