I don't know if you've ever seen a movie about vikings, but as far as i know they are few. Of those I've seen this and it's predecessor are the only "true" viking movies.<br /><br />This movie has pretty bad image and sound quality which is understandable since its old. But it wins my heart for it's story, it follows a kind of norm in viking tales, basically an eye for an eye.<br /><br />I am no expert in vikings or history but i have read a lot about them and many sagas (if not all) from the "Edda", anyways i liked this movie because it feels natural and real.<br /><br />Some warnings though: <br /><br />1. It may not be so interesting for you if you're not interested in vikings. <br /><br />2. They speak Icelandic and the one i saw had Swedish subtitles only, so beware, you may not understand a word.
