You go into an Adam Sandker movie expecting a funny movie and to laugh a lot. However in this movie it will make you cry more than laugh. The only one thing good I can say about this movie is it has a GREAT moral. Other than that i can't find one positive thing about the movie. I cried for two third of the movie. And unless of course you want to pay to cry you should not see this movie. Don't buy the funny commercials they're just showing the beginning of the movie and whats going on and not the end of the movie. I will make this promise though if you don't cry at the movie you will most definitely find this movie upsetting and sad and you may most likely cry. That i will promise you. But hey whatever you can go see it if you want to but don't say you weren't warned
