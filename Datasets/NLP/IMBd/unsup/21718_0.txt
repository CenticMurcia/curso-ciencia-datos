Finally a movie about Native-Americans by Native-Americans. Okay, so some of them are Canadian, so perhaps we should add "Aboriginal." Many of the actors have appeared in other U.S. as well as Canadian films of and about Aboriginal peoples but I'm sure I have never seen a film so dominated by them. And one of them has the courage to say it is not the current generations of "white eyes" who stole their lands, but our forefathers, Gen. Custer, President Grant, John Wayne, etc. This should be required showing in every U.S. and Canadian history class but of course the fundies would most certainly object because of the mysticism.
