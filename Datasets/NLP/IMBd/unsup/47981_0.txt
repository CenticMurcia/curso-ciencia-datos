and i want me 91 minutes and 22 seconds back.but,we don't always get what we want do we?i guess this is supposed to be a horror comedy combination.well,if so,they left out the horror part.actually,they left out the comedy part too.mostly,this movie very slow and boring,but believe it or not,there are worse movies out there.Warwick Davis plays the Leprechaun,and it looks like has a blast in the role and is not taking it seriously at all,which is one good thing in the movie.Jennifer Aniston is also in this movie,which came out about a year before "Friends".anyway,this movie spawned 5 sequels so far,and to be perfectly honest,it doesn't merit any sequels.for me,"Leprechaun" is a 2.5/10
