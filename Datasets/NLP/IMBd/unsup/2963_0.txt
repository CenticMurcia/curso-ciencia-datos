I love zombie movies and I always appreciate seeing someones take on the zombie genre. This wasn't an excellent film by any means but it was funny and I really liked what they tried to do. It had some creative moments in it which now a days that is all you can really expect from a zombie movie. I know I just want to see something that I have not seen a million times already and I believe with this movie there are some real fresh moments. I would definitely recommend this movie not because it's perfect or wonderful, but because it's funny and has some new zombie moments in it. I really enjoyed the idea that Zombies are afraid of the dark. I don't recall ever seeing that before in a zombie film and it actually makes some sense. It removes the fear of the night and actually gives you a safe feeling. The quality isn't perfect so when you rent it do not expect top of the line Romero style Zombies, it's an Independent Film and it shows.
