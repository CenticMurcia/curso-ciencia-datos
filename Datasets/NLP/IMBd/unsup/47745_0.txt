I really only checked FACCIA DI SPIA out because of the torture scenes that have been hyped about it - and honestly, that's the only thing of interest in this one. The film is reminiscent of the "mondo" films of the era, and with the "strong" torture scenes, it also sorta reminded me of MEN BEHIND THE SUN - though not nearly as powerful or interesting.<br /><br />The film itself is a propaganda-style fictional recreation of events based on actual situations concerning the CIA.<br /><br />Most of the events portrayed were of little interest to me and most of the film is quiet dull. The acting is sub-par, and again - the only thing I found of any real interest were a few decent torture scenes that included metal-rod-penis-insertion, a strong rape scene, an eel-insertion, an arm-hacking-offing, and an eyeball removal. I can confidently say that this film should be a "pass" for most viewers and would only be recommended for sleaze-film completists - and although the torture scenes are decent, they are short and aren't anything that are so interesting as to make it a must-see...4/10
