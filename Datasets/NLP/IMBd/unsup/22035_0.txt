I saw this at the Santa Cruz Film Festival and enjoyed it immensely. Jensen Ackles stole the show--anyone who watches Supernatural knows he's got great comedic timing--but the other roles were well-played, too (particularly Clea DuVall), and the story/characterization unfolded believably (for a rom-com) and enjoyably. The core of the script, with the team of friends working together at the sub shop, was engaging and smart, and the plot was solid (avoiding the huge leaps that plague many films) and even contained a few unexpected twists. I laughed, a lot; my companion cried, a little. I can't wait until this gets wider distribution so I can watch it with more of my friends. Perfection, no; an enjoyable evening's entertainment, surely. I'll be buying this when it's available.
