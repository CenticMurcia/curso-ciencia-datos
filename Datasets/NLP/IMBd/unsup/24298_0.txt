Ahhh, Robot Chicken. I remember seeing it the first time. I was on the floor laughing like crazy! With it's funny pop culture references and parodies, it just never gets old. I have season 1,2,3 on DVD, and honestly I just can't get enough of it! I think so far the funniest season is season 3, but all of them are also hilarious! Robot Chicken contains references to almost every thing! From old movies, shows, and music. To pop culture in the present. If you love pop culture, parodies, hilarious references, violence, and just plain randomness! Then I highly recommend watching Robot Chicken! It's probably the only show that can match up to another one of my favourite Adult Swim shows, Aqua Teen Hunger Force.
