This movie probably would give an impression of coming from the mind of someone like Ed Wood - completely idealistic and with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. This really is the Ultimate Turkey if you ask me.<br /><br />Aune Sand would probably be best described as Norway's answer to Ed Wood, a young idealistic filmmaker who thinks his movies are a great work of art. No matter what anyone else says. And ironically enough this movie has been one of the biggest domestic commercial successes for a Norwegian film ever.<br /><br />About the plot and characters there's not really much to say except: terrible, dreadful, boring and involuntarily funny. See this movie at your own risk...
