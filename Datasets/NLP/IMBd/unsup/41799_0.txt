I really can't say much about the rest of this show, but after the 5 minutes I saw of it I can't bring my self to ever watch anymore. I flipped on the TV just in time to see Bibleman vaporizing a robot that the dialog described as looking like an old ally of his. Bibleman noted that he should have seen through it because the robot has two blue eyes while the real person has "one blue eye and one green eye, as an unfortunate result of his hereditary lineage." Unfortunate result? WTF? I didn't stick around to hear anymore. If anyones hereditary lineage that produces simple heterochromia is unfortunate in the eyes of this biblical superhero, I don't think I need anymore.
