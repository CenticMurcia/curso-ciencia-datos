I stumbled across this on YouTube and started watching, it had me completely hooked. The story of the Thunder Spirit had me openly weeping, the sadness was so profound. I have since bought this film and on a bigger-than-computer screen it was truly wonderful. This film is such a welcome antidote to the saccharine, formulaic 'opium for the people' tripe that makes up the majority of what is churned out by Hollywood every year. Something with real depth, resonance and poignancy. I am a European and white and feel that this story / these stories, while Native American in origin and tradition, have something of enormous value to teach all of us. I couldn't agree more with the comments of the first reviewer.
