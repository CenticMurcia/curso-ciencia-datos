It was really funny at first, like every show is. But after.. well.. Josh got skinny it stopped being funny. I mean, he yells so much, he does these stupid hand movements that are as annoying as anything. Drake is plain stupid, and Megan just doesn't know when to quit. The person thats aggravates me the most is, of course, Josh. He's just..UGH. I feel like I want to puke because he's so not funny, his jokes and repeating words have gotten old, and he just goes on and on about crap that nobody cares about. 1/10, thanks to Josh. I don't really mind Drake, although it gets annoying that all he thinks about is girls, and Megan gets annoying that she just can't leave Drake and Josh alone for once.
