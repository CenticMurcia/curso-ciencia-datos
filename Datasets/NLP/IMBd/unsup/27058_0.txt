Not a total lost, because some of the women were kinda attractive and wore sleazy sexy outfits. However, that does not make up for such an awful dialogue and terrible acting. I mean some of the lines were over emphasized out of context. The camera angles had me dizzy at times. The plot and storyline (if there really was any) was all over the place. It was like driving along the road and having random exits and turns appear out of nowhere. Yeah, weird and confusing is the best way to describe this poor attempt at a horror flick. The funniest thing in this film was the scene that had the girl seeing a ghost in the garage, and you could see the shadow of the actor against the tool wall. I have seen worse, but this is definitely in the top 10 of the worst. It may sound corny, but I did like the ending song, but it seem liked a 90's pop tune.
