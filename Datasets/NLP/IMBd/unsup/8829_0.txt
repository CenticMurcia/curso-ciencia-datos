More sex scenes with Andrew! I think he's horribly sexy. Followed his career since his first movie "Class" - lots of sex scenes in that movie!!!!! I like Andrew's scenes with Victory. <br /><br />Can't go with Kirby, though - think he's a real turnoff especially after he's filed sexual harassment charges. After all, he stalked her.<br /><br />Nice to see Brook Shields playing a grown up. I liked her decision with the young actress. Too bad Brook's own mother over encouraged her to to stuff beyond her age - it was embarrassing. Nice twist in episode 3.<br /><br />Loved the "b----" written on the coat. It was deliciously funny and not normally seen in prime time.
