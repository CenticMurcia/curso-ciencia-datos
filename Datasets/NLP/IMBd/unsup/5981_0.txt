Great early 70's clothing, a philosophizing folk song (wow, man, it's like, so deep), unspoken drug references, and the undead! What more could you possibly ask for? Deathmaster really is Quarry's movie. His Mansonesque portrayal of Khorda infiltrating and taking over a commune of lost hippies is eerie. The movie's effectiveness really lies in the context that people can be so easily controlled and fall victim to cults, rather than the fact that Khorda possesses their minds because he is a vampire. That Quarry is made up to resemble Charles Manson is a not-so-subtle hint to the movie's theme.<br /><br />Terribly dated, this little gem is really only for the 60's and 70's horror movie freaks like myself. I love this movie. I found it at a convention and watching it brought back a lot fond memories of the Saturday afternoon Chiller Theater flicks like Deathmaster, Lemora, Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things, as well as a ton of bizarre British horror movies and even some old giallo that semi-independent stations like Channels 5, 9, and 11 out of NYC used to run constantly in the late 70's through the mid eighties. If you're in to old trippy horror, this is one to own.
