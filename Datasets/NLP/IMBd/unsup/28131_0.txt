This movie is great in sense of a sad story, but believe me I spent my 1 hour in hell while watching it really in hell and I just want to say that some stories should remain untold, My body was shaking and sometimes I cried like a girl but I will not forgive my self that why I have seen it. There was a guy who stopped me but why I don't listened to him, so guys listened to me please don't watch it.
