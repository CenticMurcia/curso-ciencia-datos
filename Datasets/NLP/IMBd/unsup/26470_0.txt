"Red Corner" is more message than entertainment. However, there is much to like here.<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILER: An American Businessman (Richard Gere), negotiating a deal in mainland China, is framed for a murder he didn't commit. He must defend himself in a judicial system which has been designed to convict, not exonerate. His only real ally is his "public defender," who doesn't even believe he is innocent.<br /><br />The ladies carry this movie. Both the murder victim and public defender have the strongest roles. Gere graciously allows his leading ladies to dominate their scenes. The nature of the story requires Gere to remain passive throughout most of the film. The murder mystery is at once both overly complex and too simple. John Avnet's direction seems sluggish; however this is probably more due to the nature of the plot, which tends to paint Gere and Avnet into a corner. The music is excellent.<br /><br />A small, but worthwhile, test of patience. See it for the ladies and the music.
