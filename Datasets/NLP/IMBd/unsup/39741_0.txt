That Porky; just when you count him out - here he comes with the whole Angel Beach High gang to strike one final blow against a series that degenerated so far down the tubes that even Bob Clark wouldn't have anything to do with it.<br /><br />Now, THAT is bad.<br /><br />"Porky's Revenge", directed as it is by James Komack (yes, THAT James Komack, from "The Courtship of Eddie's Father"), tries to ape the original as much as possible in looks but just doesn't get it right; the material never finds the right tone of raunchiness nor one single scene that has as many belly laughs as the original (if you've seen the first one, you know what I mean).<br /><br />And the "kids" in this one look just a hair shy on the ear lobe of collecting social security. Someone should have gotten a better makeup artist on the set, ya think? Jeez, guys; at least wear girdles or something!<br /><br />But then there's Porky himself. Ah yes, Chuck Mitchell returns and is just as mean, nasty and... well, PORKY, as we remember. And when his little girl Blossom (Wendy Feign) falls for good old Meat (Tony Gainos), it's time for Pee-Wee (Dan Monahan) and the rest of the crew to kick into high gear and save their buddy from a fate worse than death - marriage.<br /><br />Problem is, so much attention is paid to the plot (!!!) that there's no time for laughs, sight gags or even decent use of the foreign exchange student (Kim Evenson). What a disappointment; she even had a cute Swedish accent.<br /><br />All in all, a big let-down, even from part II in the series (which was no great shakes itself, but at least kept Clark at the helm). This is one "Revenge" that just beats out Montezuma's for general discomfort.<br /><br />Two stars. Hey, had to give them credit for the eventual fate of Miss Balbricker (Nancy Parsons). What do you know; those kids had a conscience after all.
