Well well after the 2 first Ringu's that i enjoyed soooo much because of the scary screenplays, Ringu 0 brings us a very different prequel with this on, if you expect seeing as much scary scenes as in Ringu 1 and 2, then i hope you will read this first so at least you know that it won't, it is explains about all what you needed to know, with a end you already know but hehe it is a prequel so what else could it have been. Anyway the movie is different but good with a great acting of Yukie Nakama that play sakoma a perfect way, i mean the way she moves is like ring 1 and 2, gratz for that, she probably needed to train to walk like that all the time :) Only little thing that is a bit dissapointing in this movie is that we would perhaps would have loved to be in a bit more different places, most of the movie is in 1 very same place and start to look more like a theater then really a movie, it gets very good again once they get out of there, but until then the movie had some boring parts, otherwise great movie if you don't see it the same way as Ringu 1 and 2.
