This is the worst Pink Panther Movie. The slapstick is just terrible, and Roberto Benigni, as Clouseau Jr., just does not fill Peter Sellers' shoes. But let's look at it thoughtfully: If Sellers were in this movie, it is true it would still not be that funny, altho it would be somewhat better. However, altho I blame the problem in "Son" more on Blake Edwards, it is also true that if Benigni were in a Pink Panther movie with good scenes, the movie would be only mediocre. Altho Clouseau is such a fool, Sellers plays him with such great presence, so artfully and skillfully, and, yes, suavely, the audience is actually, paradoxically, laughing with rather than at the bumbling Clouseau. And if the scenes are great, everything is great. Benigni does not measure up, but he does not have much from Edwards. The scenes are just not funny, they are dumb, silly, stupid. Look at me I'm a boob. Does not work. Pale shadows of the excellent fun long gone.<br /><br />Some redemption is provided by subplots, as Herbert Lom and yes, Claudia Cardinale return. Dreyfus (still) is involved in the investigation at hand, of the kidnapping of Princess Yasmin of Lugash, played by Debrah Farentino. Lo and behold, we have a revelation about Jacques Jr.'s origins. The martial arts square-offs between the princess and her female captor Yussa (Jennifer Edwards) remind me of the Stefanie Powers mud spa scene in "The Girl from Uncle," altho the forum(s) are different. It is good to see Cato (Burt Kwouk) still around. <br /><br /> All in all, thumbs down. The best reason to see it is just to see Claudia again. Otherwise, there is not much, and much bad.
