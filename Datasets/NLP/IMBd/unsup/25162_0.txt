The movie is absolutely funny, however, to understand the comments and the jokes you have to be raised in Arabic speaking culture and understand the Egyptian background. Each and every character played his or her perfectly. Adel Imam was great as usual. Although their might be some exaggeration in few scenes, I can only see that this might be the case in all comedy movies. One scene is particularly funny, the one of the check point when Adel Imam met Talaat Zakaria. Another scene where Adel Imam showed his real talent was when he fell on the ground in reaction to the heart attack. I enjoyed watching the movie and the same goes for my wife as well.
