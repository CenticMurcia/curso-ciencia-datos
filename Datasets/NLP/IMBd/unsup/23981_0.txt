this martial arts/comedy is packed with fun. mark dacascos is just an excellent fighter and he should do more films similar to this one!! good story line and great fight scenes. one of my favourite films to date. the acting may not be Oscar winning but it sure is entertaining. the special effects are noting special with the explosions for example. i would recommend this to anyone who likes action and a bit of humour. its a good film. it starts of with probably the best fight scene in the whole movie but don't worry there are plenty of fight scenes right the way through it. kadeem provides the comedy for this film as he is always moaning. i'm going on too much so just watch it. maz
