I was expecting a dire film but was shocked to see just how good the camera work, direction and soundtrack was. Some of the shots were exquisite. I know thats not what these films are supposed to be about but I will be looking out for more from these directors. The story was pretty so-so but the presentation and art was superb.<br /><br />Not sure how a sequel will sit <br /><br />Screamers the Hunt is out soon - I'll look out for that as it is by the same director I think.<br /><br />Ten lines needed to post a comment - ah OK. All the cast looked great too.
