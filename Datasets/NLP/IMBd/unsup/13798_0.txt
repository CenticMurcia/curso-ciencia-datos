The first atrocity made by director Prince, whom should know better, was casting Elizabeth Taylor in the part originated by Glynnis Johns. E. T. is a total fish out of water in this film. Filming the stage play would have been infinitely superior to this garbage. Only Hermoine Gingold offers some bright moments.
