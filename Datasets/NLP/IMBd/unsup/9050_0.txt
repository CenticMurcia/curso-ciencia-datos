Disappointing 1957 musical where within an 1 hour and 40 minutes, Jane Powell gets engaged to 3 guys at the same time.<br /><br />The Gauer Champion choreography is its usual greatness. Dancing sequence of "Keeping up with the Joneses" is memorable as well as the scene with all the dancing in Mexico.<br /><br />Powell does nicely in the part but is not convincing in the comedy scenes where she has had one too many.<br /><br />Tommy Noonan is good as her original guy who is an ambitious salesman. Cliff Robertson, who she meets by jumping over-board is young and simple. Keith Andes, as the wealthy guy, looks old for 1957.<br /><br />Una Merkel, who seemed to fit in nicely in the 1950s in mother roles, is along for the ride.<br /><br />The ending is somewhat of a surprise and proves that wealth isn't everything.
