This would have to be the most depressing film. There are no nice people in this movie (suprisingly even Dickie Moore plays a pretty bratty kid)...except Ginger. The moral of the film is everyone has their price - even the lowly janitor played by John Qualen. SPOILER ALERT: Mary Astor plays Hettie Stream, a society wife, who has little time for her husband and son. As the film opens Dickie Moore is bawling out the butler because he is not allowed to play in the ballroom. Throughout the film the father is often seen giving tips to his son on how to be more like him. Warren William plays Alex Stream, who is used to having his own way in all situations. A chance meeting with Lily Linda (Ginger Rogers) a burlesque dancer creates a diversion for him but Lily begins to fall for him. In Lily he finds someone who is sweet and good and delights in simple pleasures. I couldn't believe when Lily is shot ( it happens about half way through the film) Alex callously cleans the apartment to get rid of evidence that would incriminate him. Lily is a good person but no-one cares about her - except a policeman (Sidney Toler). He has been demoted for daring to give tycoon Stream a speeding ticket and he is determined to see justice done. From then on it is as though she doesn't exist. Stream is completely unremorseful and he and his wife renew their love for each other and plan to go away. But Hettie doesn't intend to stand by her man. The ending has to be seen to be believed - especially since it was made in 1934 - so it isn't a pre-coder. Fortunately Ginger would soon leave these sort of thankless roles behind her.
