I seriously don't know why this was voted on average at a 6, so I thought that i should comment. The zombies were not the main point of the story though...the writers were actually smart in the fact that there was a certain step to follow in the movie to survive. There was a story and it DOES deserve a good vote and a good opinion of what a normal, everyday woman will think. OK, I might not be normal, but I generally have good opinions about movies. The women in this movie show power, and the men were intelligently resourceful. The zombies were well played out and were not over-shown. The twists in this particular movie made me watch it twice at the movie theater, once with my family and once with my friends.
