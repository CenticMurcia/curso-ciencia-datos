I am a great fan of bad S&S. I have seen the Ator movies. I have seen the Deathstalker movies. I have seen The Sword & the Sorcerer. This one beats them all. How it ever acquired a rating of more than one star is beyond me. The intentional comedy all falls flat. What humor is present can be found in the poor execution, laughable script, ridiculous props, and the shaky grasp of history.<br /><br />At the time the movie was made, I was working at the Northern California Renaissance Pleasure Faire, which was used as a shooting location. Filming occurred on weekdays, when the Faire is closed. If you look real closely at the half-timbered construction on some of the buildings in the village scenes, you can tell that it's just white painted plywood with brown 1x4s nailed on the front. They're all just closed-up crafts booths (the one in the panhandling scenes sells pewter) and environmental acting areas.<br /><br />Some of the Faire actors were employed as extras. I know of one case where an extra was used to simulate a speaking role, by dubbing a voice in while his back was turned. This added greatly to the humor value for me personally, since the dubbed voice sounded nothing at all like the extra. It is also quite possibly in violation of AFTRA rules, but given the quality of the rest of the movie, I wouldn't be surprised to discover that it was a non-union production.
