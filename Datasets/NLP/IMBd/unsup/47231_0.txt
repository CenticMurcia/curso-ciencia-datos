I can't believe everybody else like this movie! I love Gothics but this one is a snooze. Gene Tierney was a very beautiful and talented actress, but she's totally miscast here. She tries, but she's just not good. Vincent Price is always good no matter what, but he can't save the movie. It LOOKS good, but it's very slow and very dull. It's no wonder that this isn't on video. After an hour I turned it off--I was SO bored! Avoid unless you're a Gothic completist.
