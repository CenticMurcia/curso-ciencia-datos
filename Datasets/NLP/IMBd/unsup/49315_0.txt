I recently bought the DVD - Game of Death (Special Edition) which features 3hrs of bonus footage. Release in 93 it features the original film which is poor (I gave it 4/10) but shows 40+ minutes of Bruce Lee in action in the Pagoda.<br /><br />What is clear from this is that Game of Death as Bruce Lee wanted would have<br /><br />been a totally different film. Instead of one man (Bruce) fighting his way up the pagoda, there are 3. Bruce demonstrates the versatility of his fighting method against a series of exponents in his unique style. Any fan of martial arts will find this footage riveting. Also on the DVD are interviews with Dan Inosanto, the stick and nunchak<br /><br />exponent, and George Lazenby, plus bios of the other characters in the pagoda. Dan Inosanto also gives a Jeet Kune Do clinic.
