After watching this show, I would not recommend anyone to spent money to watch this on the big screen. I happened to have 5 free tickets to bring my kids to watch it. If you have not been reading news and do not know what is global warming doing to our planet, or where do polar bears live (besides the zoo), or how walruses look like, then perhaps this show will benefit you. Other than that, there was really no significantly new or interesting information that I gained from this documentary. The net result - an animal story about animals struggling to survive - non-dramatized. Not entirely bad, I did appreciate the skills and patience of the crew in producing this show. It was well done.<br /><br />By contrast, the "March of the Penguins" was a much more interesting and 'moving' documentary.
