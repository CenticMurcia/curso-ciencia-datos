For all of the above whining about the graphic sex and violence, get over it. Thats what makes Anime worth watching. Personally I have a hard time getting through a Anime unless it does include lots and lots of graphic sex and violence. If ya liked Series like Bible black you'll like this. What I find to be really annoying is these whiners running around complaining about the sex and violence because it " is unnecessary". I say BS! It is necessary and it is appreciated. The more the better. It's because of these dull trolls that the US has an edited version thus making the best and only version worth watching in my opinion harder to find. If graphic sex and violence offends you, quit watching adult cartoons numb nuts.
