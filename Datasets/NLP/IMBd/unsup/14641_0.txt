I watched this movie last night and was quite thrilled with it. Aamir Khan and Kajol were both at their best. One of the other comments already has the story told so I would not tell what happens in the movie, but I will tell this much that most of the Bollywood movies that I get to watch are filled with flaws and stupidities, but this movie by far exceeds my expectation. The movies has a very humorous start, however, the ending is quite sad, but that was meant to be by the title of the movie "Fanaa". The music was quite different and very enchanting. The supporting actors/actresses (rishi kapoor, Haji Ali) did very good in the movie. Overall, the movie is excellent and worth watching, Bollywood does not produce such movies that often.
