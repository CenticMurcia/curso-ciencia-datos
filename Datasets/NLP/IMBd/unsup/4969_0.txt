Very much in the "Get Carter" mode, and ten times better than Ritchie and his 2000 wannabees.<br /><br />This film perfectly captures 1960s London. It also captures the true ugly, psychotic, non-glamorous side of being a gangster. Very violent, but most of that is in your mind. The ending is perhaps a little anti-climatic, but otherwise a good effort.
