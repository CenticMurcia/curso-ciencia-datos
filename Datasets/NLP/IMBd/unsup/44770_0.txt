Galaxy of Terror should have been a good film. It basically is one of those dark, Alien-like space monster movies filled with pop-out scares. I found the character's behavior to be unbelievable given their situation - but that's not all that unusual. In the end I gave it only a "3" rating because the movie falls flat. It seems like the production just got away from the director and actors and came out unconvincing. The movie gives a feeling as though it were done to show off a few gross-out special effects, and not much more, but the special effects didn't come out that good and they didn't have enough money to re-shoot.
