Oh I wish that Joel, Crowe and Tom were still in business.<br /><br />The repeating shots of food being prepared (slice the deer, slice the chicken, slice the fish, slice the vegetables) would make excellent MSTie fodder<br /><br />This movie is disjointed, filled with ham fisted acting and was an absolute waste of 90 minutes of my life. Thank the gods that I only paid $0.95 for it (The rental store was cleaning out their tape collection).<br /><br />It ranks down there with the "Manos, Hands of Fate". *barf*<br /><br />In short, unless this howler of a movie has been MST'ied, avoid this dog at all costs. <br /><br />If you get this tape as a gift, send it immediately to your local HazMat handling unit.
