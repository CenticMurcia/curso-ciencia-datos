I enjoyed this movie. The film well depicted interpersonal relationships in life. All of the guys were different, yet complimented one another. Although the movie was about four Afro-American college buddies, however, I think that everyone could relate to the episodes that often lead up to the wedding. Some are hilarious, and some can be disastrous! The female stars were good, as well. I enjoyed the last scene...everyone could finally exhale and truly have a great time dancing. Nice movie! A lot of fun! Reminds me somewhat of my sister's last wedding! It was 15 years ago, and the event is still fresh in my mind. The actors are a great group of young stars to be. Hope to see more of all of them in films.
