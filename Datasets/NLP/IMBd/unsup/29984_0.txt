A film about ultra-privileged young contemporary Manhattanites romanticising themselves in the doomed spirit of Scott Fitzgerald may sound unbearable, especially as this is a very talky movie. But 'Metropolitan' is actually quite delightful, in fact because of the very quality of the dialogue - the characters are elegant show-offs, which gives the writer the freedom to indulge them with clever lines. And clever in both senses - the characters are themselves clever, but the writing is cleverer, as the protagonists inadvertently give themselves and their absurdities away in spite of their intelligence. However much you may want to hate these people, it's simply a delight to hear them talk. In fact, my main criticism is that the screenplay falls too much in love with its own creations - as it reveals the failings and absurdities of the characters, it starts to forgive them, which is probably more than they deserve. A final kick at the end to remind us (and them) of the nature of real life might have made this great, as opposed to merely good.
