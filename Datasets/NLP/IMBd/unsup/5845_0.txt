Duvall is, without doubt, one of the finest actors on the C20th screen. Unlike so many superstars (Nicholson, Pacino, Hoffman), you forget he's Duvall within the first couple of minutes of his performance. "The Apostle" is no exception.<br /><br />Here we have a completely three-dimensional view of a man carrying personal demons and plenty of psychological baggage. Duvall certainly deserved his Academy Award nomination.<br /><br />The central idea of the movie is also very strong: preacher seeks redemption from past deeds by once more bringing the power of the Word to a small community.<br /><br />But Duvall the actor, executive producer and director is not equalled by Duvall the writer. I sat watching with the constant niggle that something was missing. And as the final credits scrolled, and reminded me that Farrah Fawcett, Billy Bob Thornton, Miranda Richardson and a handful of others had been on screen, I got the sudden revelation that none had had a part anywhere near as round as Duvall's.<br /><br />This truly is a one-man movie. Even though the director is on screen for virtually every shot, it's not an egotistical piece. But it's not a deep as it could have been. Which is a great shame. Because with an antagonist of some kind, this would have risen from good film to masterpiece.<br /><br />Watch it, but only for the central performance. And for the two black children playing their ukelele. They're great.
