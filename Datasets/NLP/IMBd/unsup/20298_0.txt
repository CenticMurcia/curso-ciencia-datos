This is my favorite movie ever.<br /><br />These are the highlights for me.<br /><br />From Groucho's singing "Mr. Grover you are just a quack to me" to the end of the "Sing while you sell" reprise. Virginia O'Brien had me laughing on the floor the first time I heard "Rock-a-bye Baby". I just love the way Groucho takes the big production number, a standard vehicle of the time, and makes it signature Groucho. You got to smile.<br /><br />I think this movie has some of the best Groucho/Margaret Dumont banter.<br /><br />Harpo's harp solo is miles ahead of any of his others. It's just plain fun,<br /><br />Although the Tenement Symphony clearly is lacking musically, you have to love the overriding pun. The Tenement Symphony in four flats.
