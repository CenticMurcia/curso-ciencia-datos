Wow this movie was terrible. Compared to the first movie, it was the worst thing I have ever seen. Some moments were funny but the entire plot line was just a little too....clich√© and rather stupid. The routines weren't nearly as good either. To follow the first movie, which combined routine-stealing and race issues, with this movie, with a plot that basically follows all cheerleader movies, is just bad. Bring it On is a movie that should be left alone, with no sequel, like the Mask. The central characters weren't in depth enough and it was just an all around bad movie. Also, there just wasn't enough diversity in this movie to me. Maybe that's just my opinion but this movie sucked.
