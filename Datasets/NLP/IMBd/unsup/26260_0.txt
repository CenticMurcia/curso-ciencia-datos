This movie is so bad, that it might be a waste of time for you to read any further adjectives that I will use in order to fully describe it's utter suckiness. Think about every terrible aspect that a movie could possibly possess, and then add them up. Now, take that number and multiply it by a million. However, would I recommend this film to you? Absolutely. I have never laughed so hard at any movie in my life. Tears were streaming down my face from this movies level of enjoyment. If you want to laugh for a good 2-3 days straight, please, do yourself a favor and rent this movie. No comedy ever written, however classic and hilarious some are, could come close to bringing you the sheer joy you will feel when the credits roll on this film. All people associated with this film are probably either out of film making or have been taken out of the business from this unimaginable monstrosity.
