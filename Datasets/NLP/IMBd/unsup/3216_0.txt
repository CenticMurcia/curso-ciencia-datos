wow! i think Liza was a star that really made it to the top...and then some. i think she was such a great performer in her day , she still have that great performer in her to this day.<br /><br />she really put a lot of pain and sweat in her performance. she truly is a performer by heart. i could'not believe it was the daughter of the all time greatest Judy gander. i thought she was just a fantastic singer. nobody in the world would have thought that she was Judy's daughter. <br /><br />but some how,she pulled it of. she is just another icon that was in the making.
