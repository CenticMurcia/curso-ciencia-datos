Connor Mead(Matthew McConaughey)is a well known photographer with the reputation of being a 'love em and leave em' kind of guy. Stinking rich with an ego to match; he actually broke up with three girlfriends at once on a conference call. He reluctantly goes home to attend his brother's(Breckin Meyer)wedding and ruins the rehearsal and dinner by professing the faults with marriage. Connor shockingly is visited by his dead Uncle Wayne(Michael Douglas), who forewarns him of being haunted by ghosts of his past girlfriends.<br /><br />Romantic...not exactly. Funny...has its moments. Worth watching...only if you are a McConaughey fan; his arrogance and over capacity of self-loving is really a turnoff. Those that love him will more than likely be beguiled. Douglas is pretty funny. Connor's childhood girlfriend played by Jennifer Garner is beautiful and brings the only sanity to the film. Others in the cast: Robert Forster, Anne Archer, Lacey Chabert and Emma Stone.
