I remember talking about this movie right after it played on t.v. with a "coming out" teen group that I'd been going to. I was the only one who hated it--I thought the drag scene was horrible and I was offended that the older man (and his buddies) would be portrayed as predators like they were. Creepy all around. The only thing that stood out as a positive was the scene where Bobby's teacher talks with him after school and writes "I am gay" on the board (I think it was the guy who played Tyne Daly's husband in "Cagney and Lacey") and tells him he'll be okay. This was one of the first times I'd seen a "normal", everyday guy as a homosexual. I wish they'd made the movie about him!
