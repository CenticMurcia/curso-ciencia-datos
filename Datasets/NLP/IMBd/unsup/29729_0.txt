Tweety is perched in his cage on the ledge and Sylvester is across the street at the "Bird Watching Society" Building on about the same level. Both are looking through binoculars, and they spot each other. Tweety then utters his famous phrase, "I taught I taw a puddy cat." (thought I saw a pussy cat.) Sylvester scampers over to grab the bird. Tweety flies out of his cage and Granny comes to the rescue, bashing the cat and driving it away.<br /><br />The rest of the animated short shows a series of attempts by Sylvester to grab Tweetie - a familiar theme - and how either bad luck or Granny thwarts him every time. The cat dons disguises and tries a number of clever schemes...all of which are funny and very entertaining. <br /><br />In all, a good cartoon and fun to watch.
