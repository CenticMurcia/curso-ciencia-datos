I bought this movie. I had never seen it, but I figured since it had the "Return of the King" name it would be decent. I was horribly mistaken. I have tried to watch this movie about 3 times. Every single time I have fallen asleep only to be woken up by terrible music. IF you must see this film, rent it. Do not buy it. Save yourself from the torment of actually owning this movie.<br /><br />Why is it so bad?<br /><br />1) Terrible music sung by a guy with a terrible voice.<br /><br />2) Really doesn't follow what happened in the book (I know that sometimes movies cant follow a book exactly, but this movie doesn't even attempt to do so). 3) The music was terrible. 4) Very bad animation. Speed Racer has better animation.<br /><br />5) Bad music. 6) Did I mention the horrendous dialogue? Sam has around 15 minutes straight of dialogue that makes almost no sense. 7) I really hope I mentioned the horrific music.<br /><br />Those are only 7 of the many reasons I have for not liking this movie. It really is not deserving of having any name that deals with any of J.R.R. Tolkiens works. This movie is a scar for anything that deals with Lord of the Rings.
