Toxic Zombies is a rather cheesy film made in a rural area of Pennsylvania, and this is a good place to grow pot? Well, maybe, I don't think of that area of the country as a hotbed of that sort of activity. At any rate, the Feds zone in on a bunch of harvesters ready to pick their crop and get out of town fast, especially after they killed a couple other Feds. But, a lunatic government agent (are there any other kind?) decides to spray the area with an unproven toxin to kill the pot & oh, and if it makes the pot growers sick, who will care? Of course, after the initial dusting, the harvesters are puking blood & not feeling too well, but not long afterward they begin to change into...wait for it....zombies. <br /><br />Now, these are not your usual George Romero zombies, they don't pounce on a victim and rip out entrails and gnaw lustily on shin-bones, they just take a bite, and then let blood run out of their mouths as they wander off to do something else. Maybe they're just stoned. Anyway, I did kind of like the close-up shot of one victim with red lines painted on their body and perhaps plastic (or dead) flies lined up, with the buzzing sound dubbed in, now THAT was class.<br /><br />This isn't God-awful terrible, but it's just not a very exciting film. The idea isn't bad, the locations aren't bad, but the actors are wooden & the whole execution of the thing leaves plenty to be desired. I do like cheesy movies but they need more life in them than THIS. 4 out of 10.
