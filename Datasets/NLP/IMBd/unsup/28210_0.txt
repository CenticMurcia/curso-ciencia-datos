Some what unbelievable. Several bad cops try to pin a counterfit operation on the one good cop who is killed early on. Then a brother, in a star wars disguise no less, kills his baby brother in a truncated chase scene; aw come on, give me a break. The dead good cop's sister tries to find her brother's real killer only to discover its her ex-lover who is a bad cop. So she cuddles up to and makes out with the guy who she first thought killed her brother, but who turns out to be a good guy and they live happily ever after on the $3 mil in real and counterfit money that every body was after in the beginning. If any of this makes sense, you are obviously retarded. Be glad you missed it.
