Im actually watching the movie as I write this, I felt compelled to pick up my laptop and vent my frustration out on how CRAP this movie is. It tries to be funny and fails it tries to be Scary and cocks that up too. True 3 of the cast are very good looking women but the story is Bollox and the acting is awful.<br /><br />I saw Matt Damon and Ben Afleck's names associated with this flick? why? what did they do, walk past a guy who went to see this god awful sh~%t flick cos they never looked at the script thats for damn sure. I am now off to take a dump which I know will be more enjoyable with a better ending than Feast (a bag of W.a.n.k)
