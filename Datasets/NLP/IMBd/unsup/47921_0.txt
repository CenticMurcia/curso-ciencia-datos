DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME. This movie is absolute excrement, and I cannot recommend it for children or adults. It's quite obvious they were trying to do things on the cheap; which area they saved the most money on is not so obvious. The "B-list" celebrities for voices? Richard Simmons proves why he never succeeded as an actor. Eric Idle can't decide whether his character is from Liverpool or the Bronx. I truly believe Bob Newhart was disguising his voice so no one would realize he had stooped to this level. Whoopi Goldburg and John Goodman do their best to add some life to this worthless script and fail quite spectacularly.<br /><br />The music? It sounds as if it were written by a freshman music major - who is failing out of college. They had to bring a previously-released Paul McCartney tune to give the soundtrack some semblance of professionalism. The animation is difficult to look at, and I found some of the supposedly happy faces "scary" looking.<br /><br />We bought this in a pile of used movies for 99 cents. FREE wouldn't have been cheap enough for this waste of videotape. I think once they realized they had made such a terrible cartoon, their only hope of making money relied on people confusing it with the wonderful Rankin-Bass version. My advice? If you're looking for a Rudolph movie, spend an extra couple of bucks and buy the original!
