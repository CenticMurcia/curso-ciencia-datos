I've been looking forward to see this movie, since I'm interested in the history of Japanese occupation, korean resistance and korean history in general. But this movie gave me nothing. It is filled with scenes which are so foreseeable and they drag on for long time with many perspectives which repeat on and on while the soundtrack tries to wake some emotions. Especially the fighting scenes are annoying. Another thing is that the beginning is quite interesting - so you watch the movie because maybe it starts again to be interesting - and so you watch till the end.<br /><br />A fighting scene for example: Some bad guys shoot a kid and the hero catches the kid in the moment he's hit by the bullet, so he can die in the heros arms. The scene drags on for long time, emotional soundtrack joins the scene, many perspectives are taken of the hero getting a tear - and all while the bad guys still fire at them. Finaly some minutes later (in the movie, in real it should be a moment only) the hero decides to grab a rifle and finishes the bad guys in a few seconds.<br /><br />camera-work was interesting, so if you are a film-student it may be worth a look - but since I've not seen a korean movie with bad camera you might be better of viewing any other korean movie
