I have to be honest before I give my opinion towards this movie. I was looking for Shannon Tweed's "Singapore Sling" (1998) but by accident, I got this movie. I don't regret. Strangely enough, I ended up liking it. It's a raw movie that goes directly to the point. Also, I couldn't believe what I was watching. I wasn't exactly shocked by it, but I was watching in awe and incredulity. It's just such a weird movie... Black and white cinematography, antique clothes, scatological situations, hard-core sex, fruits, strange characters with strong personalities (each on it's own), and strange fetiches. <br /><br />Expect some violent scenes involving S&M, and a raw fruit masturbation scene that has a major role in the movie. The setting is as strange as you can get; also the costumes of the characters. Not to mention the make-up; most of the characters use black make-up on their eyes and mouth. The black and white cinematography adds another element of weirdness in my opinion. The correct use of shadows and rain in some important scenes made it more shocking. I had the luck to find a sub-titled version of this movie because otherwise, I wouldn't understand the plot, which is minimal, but still explains (or tries) some strange situations of the movie. Not exactly a "sexy" plot but it's strangely a turn-on.<br /><br />The hard core sex scenes are somehow disgusting but great; and also are asked for by the movie's plot. The ending is weird enough to end up classifying this movie as 100% strange. Track this movie down if you are interested in a raw, gory, and brutal sex. <br /><br />I'm glad I didn't find Shannon Tweed's movie. This is the "Singapore Sling" to track down.
