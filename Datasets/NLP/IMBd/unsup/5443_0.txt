As far as the film industry goes. Most A list actors are way over paid, and the movies for the budget, are only OK. I am not saying this movie is Oscar material! However, for the most part The acting is SOLID. The Director is great for what money he has to work with.<br /><br />Now lets talk about the film! The beginning I liked the no sound and just music at first I thought there was a sound problem and I kept turning the sound up and realized it was all action! Very cool! Nice choice by the editor.<br /><br />As far as the set up of the film the consistencies were a little shaky, but I am sure that is a budget thing. I liked the music it really set up the mood.<br /><br />As far as the Cast Gail Bowers (Erica Roby) does a great job as the possessed girl and lead in the film? Anne Bowers(Noel Thurman) as the sister is beautiful, and is probably one of the most solid actors in the film, as well as Thomas Downey as the priest! The rest of the cast holds there own. So all in all this film blows Emily Rose away. I am only judging this film based on a straight to DVD, they have done a good job!
