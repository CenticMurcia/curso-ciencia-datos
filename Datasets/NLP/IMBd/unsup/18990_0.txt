If you're expecting 'America's Next Top Model', "Five Days to Fame The Miss World Canada Story" is definitely not it. What really struck me about this film was that at the beginning none of the girls looked like they had a chance a being Miss World Canada.... they came across as unglamorous, unsure of themselves and quite immature. as the film progresses you start to see a transition in only few of the contestants. I actually like the way the film was done, it was filled with great drama and was exciting form beginning to end. Jimmy Steele was a great character in the film, he really was there for all the contestants and pulled off the event itself single handedly. It was a really well done film that kept me entertained form beginning to end.
