There is nothing clever, good, or redeeming about this film. Parody or not, independent film-making or not, it just fails miserably on all levels. Much like every other film playing at multiplexes nowadays, it just has to have a pop song in each scene (they even dig through the '80s a bit, since teens these days act like they know what '80s culture was like), idiotic postmodern outfits like girls wearing loose-fitting ties over tank tops (wow, how sexy), and of course the obligatory lesbian element that has to permeate everything aimed at the young demographic. Last but not least, they excavate the tar pits with a multi-ethnic cast since you simply have to do that nowadays to show false camaraderie between people that given the chance would otherwise destroy each other. Avoid this trend-propagating, falsehood-edifying dreck as best you can. There's always a Disney film around to provide more intellectual stimulation.
