The lowest that I can go on this rating scale is one?<br /><br />Needless to say, December 31, 2006 will go down in history for me. Me, my friends and I were in prep to celebrate what was a successful year - only to be horribly distracted by this heinous excuse for a film.<br /><br />(In fair disclosure, I haven't finished this movie. I am, in fact, writing this review as the movie plays and sends otherwise happy guests running for the door to their "next party.")<br /><br />To make a long story short, despite the films creative use of popular dance-club tracks as Danny Tenaglia's Bottom Heavy and Smooth Touch's In My House (oh... and Generate Power... OK, and The Pressure... one more, the Witchdoctor (whilst neon penis' flickered) in the opening credits), I've never seen such a plot less farce. Do not, under any circumstances, watch this movie.<br /><br />If you see a copy for sale, purchase it - send me the movie and a copy of the receipt. I will reimburse you for it and make sure that it has been destroyed. Bad acting; bad cinematography; somewhat fierce soundtrack. Don't, don't, don't, don't.
