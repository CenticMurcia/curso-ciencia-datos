We know we're in the hands of a master director to be from the first moments of the film. Enough about its plot and content has already been said here by other commentors - it is certainly impressive. Novello is a perfect choice for the neurotic and odd lead, causing the audience as well as the cast members to suspect him of being THE AVENGER. Here the ending was changed to protect Novello's reputation as a romantic leading man (as was the first talkie sequel in which Novello also played the lead, albeit to a slightly altered script, character and motivation). Here the cinematography and editing match the direction in all being top notch and the exquisite tinting in the restored version adds a great deal to the overall atmosphere of the film. All the players are fine with no real standouts except for Novello, who had a very successful career in silents (16 films) but retired from talking films after only 6 to become one of England's most influential composers until his death in 1951. See this one - it's a classic.
