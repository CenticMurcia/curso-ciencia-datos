Easily one of the best films I've ever seen Shane Meadows and Paddy Considine team up for the second time and deliver one of the best movies of the decade, the scenery and gritty style of filming compliment each other perfectly.<br /><br />The story if you haven't seen the film already is as follows, an ex marine (Richard played by Paddy Considine) returns to his home town to take revenge on a gang drug dealers who Wronged his brother on various occasions and what follows is a violent killing spree of revenge the character of Richard and his lack of sympathy for the men hes hunting down just go to show how enraged and deadly he can be Paddy Considine plays the role flawlessly and rage of the character is shown in his facial expressions, hes such a brilliant actor.<br /><br />But rivalling Considine is Gary Stretch who delivers an equally brilliant role as the leader of the drug dealing gang and the first confrontation between the Considines and Stretch's character is brilliant the scene is very tense shown in both Richards facial expressions and threats and Sonny's (Stretch) sudden turn from being a confident hard man to being terrified of Richard as all his gang are. the soundtrack which is mostly folk compliments every seen especially the the scenes where Richard and his brother are walking through the country side as the scenery compliments every song.<br /><br />All of the actors do very good jobs especially as meadows chose to use mainly local actors.<br /><br />There is a very unexpected twist at the end which blew me away and just proves that Richard has gone insane with rage, the ending is especially brilliant and left my girlfriend in tears.<br /><br />I strongly urge any one to watch this film and i believe deserves a much higher overall rating. ten out of ten from me
