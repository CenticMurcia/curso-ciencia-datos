I have to say, you know, it has been my "sequel weekend". Despite repeated warnings from my family and IMDb users to skip this "Jaws" flick, if you even want to really call it that, but I ignored it and figured maybe it's just getting a bad rep because it would be compared to the first and ultimate classic "Jaws". In the words of Nancy Karogan "Oh, why?! Why?!". That was the only way I could describe the film and sitting throw it.<br /><br />Wither it was the cheesy cheesy cheesy effects, I mean did every horror movie in the 80's have to be 3-D? It's rather, well, cheesy! The plot? Was there a plot I even ask? There was no main story or line for us to follow and I felt the story kept on forgetting to telling us the sub-plot. The acting was horrible, I'm surprised Dennis could even get a career after this. I'm just telling you, please do not be as stupid as me and ignore the warnings! Be afraid! Be very afraid! Of the actual movie that is.<br /><br />1/10
