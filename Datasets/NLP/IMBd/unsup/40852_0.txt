This was the worst damn movie I've ever seen! So I gave it a 2. It was funny, not because of the dialouge, but the dinosaur. It's so awful all the way through. The film at the begining looks it could be used in a travel video. They use 1985 stock footage of helicopters and raids that have the date and time in the top corner too. The dinosaur on the otherhand is the best part. When he takes to the pot from the helicopter all you see is a big green crudley made glove come up and grab at some green stuff in a toy net. IT'S AWESOME! If you're a fan of these horribly bad movies then this a treat, but good luck finding it. I'd feel sorry for you if actually did come across it. so so so so sorry oh yea, "trog"<br /><br />
