As the title says, this movie IS excess baggage in your video collection. The idea of the film isn't (at) all bad, only the resulting movie just lacks about everything in all areas; the dialogue is horrible, Silverstone is no actress and by the looks of this film will never become one either. Benicio del Turro oughtta be ashamed of his work. Never in the film does one believe in the relationship between the two main characters. As a matter of fact, I could have said it better in one brief statement: don't watch this film. Period.
