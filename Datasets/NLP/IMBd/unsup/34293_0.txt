The movie centers on a young woman with a long-term phobia of the Boogeyman, who voluntarily checks herself into a mental health facility with the hope of conquering her overwhelming fears. However, much to her horror, she discovers that some things are terrifying on purpose, and confronting her demons was not the best course of action.<br /><br />Through last year (2007), you might have noticed many direct-to-DVD sequels coming out. There was The Butterfly Effect 2, Open Water 2, Wrong Turn 2, Return to House on Haunted Hill, and now this. I pretty much found the others very bad to decent but I found this just very stupid.<br /><br />This so called "sequel" to the first film have nothing related to it. There's probably one idiotic scene that tries to connect them together. I found it just very stupid, like I said, on how they tried to connect the two films. First of all, Boogeyman ended. It ENDED. There was not an opened ending. I found it really decent if not good.<br /><br />Now this film is completely different. It's more of a serial killer film than a supernatural thriller like the first (probably because they didn't have enough money for visual effects). First, Boogeyman is a supernatural force. In this film, he's just another serial killer in a mask. Might as well make a generic serial killer movie not related to the first film.<br /><br />One could wonder why this isn't a sequel to the "Saw" movies, especially since it resembles much with them, including Tobin Bell (no wonder he decided to be in the movie!). There's also the dialog from Tobin Bell, the deaths from this film, taking place in a "hospital" (get it?), etc.<br /><br />The filmmakers of this film also had enough guts to make one of the most idiotic twist in a film. It seems like they just added in there for "effect." And if you're worried about violence and gore, you should be because it's just very nasty, disgusting, and mean-spirited rather than scary. There's also some very funny moments in the film including the word for "fear of the Boogeyman": Which is called "boogeyphobia."<br /><br />There's a reason why this film is released direct-to-DVD. It's just a very bad movie. However, I will say the character development is quite nice at one point but all got smothered in the next scene. How nice is that? And as you know with most horror movies, there's an opened ending! Should we expect a third "Boogeyman" movie? I hope not. Instead, watch "Jeepers Creepers" (the first or the second), which is a far better, far creepier horror movie.
