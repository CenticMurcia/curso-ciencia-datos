It was the worst movie that I saw at the Toronto Film Festival.<br /><br />Yes, there was some semblance of a story but after the "there and back again" storyline, it kind of gets a tad repetitive.<br /><br />I too find Michael Pitt quite a wooden actor. Kiera Knightley was better I suppose but she played such a minor role that you barely noticed her. <br /><br />The only actor that I really absolutely loved in this movie was Alfred Molina - he was probably the only actor that generated laughs from the audience.<br /><br />The cinematography was stunning though, that is in part why I chose to watch this movie. However like they say, it was all style but no substance.<br /><br />It's funny, about ten minutes or so before the movie ended, there was a scene that looked like the ending of the movie. The couple right beside me breathed a sigh of relief until the "ending" scene continued for another ten minutes. The couple then let out a whimper, "Isn't this movie going to EVER end?!?"
