I saw this movie when I was 15 yrs. old and really loved it. It holds up pretty good after all those years. The always reliable William Holden elevates the film just by being in it as he did with so many other films. The story starts slow but the Indian attack climax is still as exciting as ever. This is a very nostalgic film to me and I waited a long time for the DVD. Unfortunately, the DVD was very disappointing. I'm not sure if it's the DVD transfer or the low budget Ansco Color they used in 1953 but it's very grainy in parts and blurry in others. I wish they'd have used black & white as the Ansco Color is also very washed out and the graininess and blurriness is very distracting. 8 stars for the movie and 3 stars for the DVD!
