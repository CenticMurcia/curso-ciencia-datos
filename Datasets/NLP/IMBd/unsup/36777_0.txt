Dwight Yoakam can't even be bothered to get a proper comb-over for his bald spot.<br /><br />It's Vince Vaughn, Peter Fonda and...uh... Peewee Herman. In a Western. How can it go wrong? How!? But it does, and tragically. This is incomprehensible, poorly shot, vanity-project poo. Dwight adds nothing to the direction but muddle an already blasphemous script with lots of slow-motion and fuzzy camera angles. And there's lots and lots of yelling. For no reason.<br /><br />In the name of all that's holy, do not pick up this movie. Implore your local video stores to remove it from the shelves.
