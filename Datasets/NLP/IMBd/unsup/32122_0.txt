Ann Biller plays Viva, a bored housewife living in LA, during the early 70s. The story of this film takes place in 1972, when the sexual revolution was in full-swing in suburbia. Viva is a gorgeous young woman, married to a kindly hubby. Viva and her husband, want to be considered a with-it couple. So they decide to start experimenting with spouse-swapping, with the hot-to-trot married couple next door. <br /><br />Then, Viva decides that she wants to be a model. In order to make it in modeling, Viva winds-up sleeping with some lecherous men, who can help her further her modeling career. She also tries having sex with other women, and finds that lesbianism is an exciting twist for her. Ultimately, Viva participates in orgies, which she considers the pinnacle of sexual sophistication. <br /><br />But Viva's husband thinks that she's become too caught-up in her sexual explorations, and that she's neglecting him. Viva does become weary, of being treated like just a sexual play-thing. She has to decide, if her superficial carnal pleasures are worth it after all. Especially after her husband threatens to walk out on her, when he gets fed-up with Viva's excessive sexual shenanigans.<br /><br />This film really captures the spirit of the cheesy, over-the-top 70s sexual revolution. The wild 70s fashions, garishly colorful home decors, and even the party snacks served back then, are meticulously detailed in this film. The actors really ham it up. But that only adds to the hilarious, campy quality of this film. As a spoof, this movie is among the best of it's kind. I highly recommend it.
