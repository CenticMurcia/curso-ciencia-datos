I thought that the whole production, considering it was a live presentation, was very well scripted. The acting was great and there were no "Fluffs" of note. The only thing out of the ordinary to happen was one of the actors falling over a prop off camera. The actor could be heard hurting himself.<br /><br />The special effects were not great and practically non-existent, but considering the fact that it was done in real time this is not surprising. Also this was more of a modern story with a lot of characterisation, which makes one forget the absence of the more special effects which one would have if it was not a staged show.<br /><br />Would I buy it if it came out on DVD? Difficult question as I still favour the original version. I might be tempted if both films came out on one DVD or more special effects were added later.
