This was a pretty bad movie. I'm a political liberal, I hate Fox News for reasons that go beyond their political viewpoint, and I like documentaries - and still I thought this was a pretty bad movie. It's guilty of a few of the tricks it picks on Fox for using (fast graphics meant to "wow" and confuse) and adds a few others to the arsenal (interviewing mostly people whose views of Fox may be tainted by personal grudge; taking quotes from news shows out of context; using montages rather than quantitative data to sway the audience). Furthermore, nothing they said was newsworthy - Fox is conservative? Bill O'Reilly is a self-righteous jerk? Who would've guessed?? And the filming technique just wasn't interesting at all - the only "interesting" thing was the complete absence of any directorial narration, and that was the bad kind of interesting. If you find yourself inspired to go see it, donate the $7 it'd cost you to a left-wing think tank instead and save yourself the ninety minutes of vague annoyance and boredom.
