Made right after the splendidly schlocky "Galaxy of Terror," this choice cheesy chunk of early 80's sci-fi/horror drive-in exploitation junk rates as yet another lovably low-rent two-cent Roger Corman gem. This time a toothy, voracious rampaging mutant beast terrorizes a bunch of hapless folks in a remote outpost on a hostile desert planet. Allan Holzman's blunt'n'basic direction maintains a ceaseless snappy pace throughout and pours on the gruesome slimy gore with rip-snorting go-for-it aplomb. The ever-cool Jesse ("Macon County Line") Vint makes for an excellent surly anti-hero as intergalactic troubleshooter Mike Colby. Late, great eccentric character actor Fox Harris (the brain-fried lobotomized scientist who drives the car with the radioactive alien corpses in the trunk in the fantastic sci-fi cult black comedy blast "Repo Man") has a scenery-gulping hammy field day as a twitchy flipped-out physician whose cancerous liver is fed to the monster at the picture's incredible conclusion (the grody thing literally pukes its guts out after eating the lethal organ!). Better still, this fine freaky flick certainly doesn't skimp on the copious gratuitous nudity: adorable baby doll beauty Dawn Dunlap bares her whole bod while bagging a few rays in a sauna, stupendously slinky British blonde bombshell June Chadwick (Lydie on the short-lived "V" TV series) happily hops in the sack with Colby a mere five or six hours after making his acquaintance, and both Dawn and June even take a shower together. Susan Justin's obscenely heavy-breathing score, the cramped, claustrophobic set design, Holzman's rapid-fire editing and Tim Suhrstedt's appropriately lurid cinematography are all likewise up to par as well. A delightfully trashy hoot.
