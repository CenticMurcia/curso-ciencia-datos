I got this movie after reading a review on digitallyobssessed.com and I have to say I was plesantly suprised - a low budget horror film that actually had a brain - this is not your average teens in a wood horror film - a lot of care has gone into the construction of the story line and it really keeps you hooked to the end - there are some nice sfx and a great atomsphere and bizzarley an acting turn by Uri Geller. Further unlike most low budget films these days it was actually shot on film rather than dv so it doesn't look like someone's home movie! Well worth a look - especially if you're after something a little bit fresher and more stimulating than a masked killer slicing and dicing people. Great score also!
