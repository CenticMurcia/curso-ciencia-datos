For a Robin Williams vehicle this is pretty slow. There are few humorous scenes, very few. In fact this movie has been done before. Replace Robin Williams with Chevy Chase and change the RV to a Truckster and you have "Vacation". The desert scenes are very reminiscent of Vacation. Sitting here trying to think of funny scenes and its almost impossible. THe scene where the kids realize they are going on an RV vacation rather than Hawaii, no. The scene where the RV crashes into the lake and Williams goes in and comes out on a bicycle..nope. Really there is very little to recommend about this movie. I don't have a lot to say about this movie really except boring, poor acting, annoying complaining kids, stupid RV tricks. The one redeeming quality about this movie is Jeff Daniels. No matter what that guy acts in, from Dumb and Dumber to Gettysburg to George Washington and everything in between, the guy is an acting genius. If you like Jeff Daniels, go see this movie. If not, then don't waste your money. It will be on late night cable in about 4 months.
