Although I use the words Real World, this movie is more realistically a fantasy of what real love is often dreamed about. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie as I watched it late night on cable. And Although I had seen it before a few other times , I really never paid much attention to it. I just knew that every other time I had it on, that somehow I was forced to stay tuned. And it finally paid off. The acting of the principals was superb. Chenoa Maxwell is a fox. Christopher Cherot is a multitalented up and coming young Black Filmmaker. And although I had to tone down the sound because I didn't want the neighbors to hear all the profanity, in spite of this, I thought they did an excellent job. It was warming to see this movie where two people finally admit to themselves that they were hopelessly in Love with each other. It ended up just the way real people "dream" of. Unfortunately in the real World it seldom happens that way. Shucks...I felt like falling in love with Hav myself.
