Did I miss something....because the review by NormaDesmond69 must be about a different picture....<br /><br />The main problem here....as is so often the case with 'indie' movies, is that the key creative responsibilities such as producing, writing, directing and playing the lead get filled by one person, the one who had the 'vision' for the movie.... in this scenario the ability for real objectivity becomes lost as that individual is far too close to the project.... the reality with this film is that the story was not strong to begin with and judging from the credits, there appears to be no one adding perspective or any objective input... I would suggest the picture was in trouble before principal photography even begun.<br /><br />Clearly though, James Michael Bobby was the absolute saving grace in what would have been an otherwise dire and unwatchable movie. Contrary to other views, I would argue that he totally pulled his weight and did exactly what his character was supposed to do, be menacing, vulnerable and the catalyst for action at a turning/breaking point in a deeply dull and empty marriage (frankly I would have turned gay had I been married to that dreary, needy woman)...I don't agree with anyone who thought that Gregory Christian delivered anything more than a lack lustre energy-less performance in a highly confusing, self-indulgent, yet ultimately predictable storyline for the genre.<br /><br />In Sunset Boulevard, the 'real' Norma Desmond said, "We didn't need dialogue. We had faces!" Sadly in this case NormaDesmond69 seems to have missed the irony that in 'Cowboy Junction' they had neither !
