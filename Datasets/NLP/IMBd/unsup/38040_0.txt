There was much to be appreciated about this HK martial arts flick. The action was subordinate to the plot rather than the reverse as is the case in all too many martial arts films. The characters did have some emotional dimension as well. Its failing, however, was its failure to develop some plot lines to a conclusion. After watching the film, I immediately went online to discover the name of its sequel, but there is none. Maybe there was going to be one and finances did not permit it. I don't know. What I do know is that I felt cheated after it ended with no revelations about the missing daughter and without retribution for the jealous ninja who burned the place where the birthing occurred and contributed to her death. It was as if Kill Bill ended after Volume 1 and Volume 2 was never made. Don't watch this movie if you like plot lines to be wrapped up nice and tidy by the film's end.
