This movie I found very interesting. I liked it the first time I saw it. I think it's a very good thriller. Ruby Baker and Rhett Baker's parents die in a car accedent and have to go and live with the glass's and they also inherit a lot of money. About in the middle of the movie is when you can start to expect the glass's want the money. Mr. Glass is in some financial debt or something of that sort. I never expected the glass's to be bad people in the beginning of the movie but by the middle of the movie I knew something was not right with the glass's. If you like to watch thriller movies I would absolutely recommend this movie. I am a fan of thriller movies and I enjoyed this thriller and I am sure you will to if you go an buy the movie and check it out for yourself.<br /><br />Sincerely, Eric Daniel
