Knowing is a terrific film by the director of Dark City that combines bone-chilling horror with a great story and amazing visuals. There is a feeling of sheer dread throughout, especially if you know how it's going to end. I had to keep telling myself it was only a movie. The musical score is excellent and really accentuates the terror and emotional impact of the whole movie. Nicolas Cage pulls off one of his best performances in years, and even though a lot of what he does ends up being futile, I really felt for all the characters. It seems a lot of the problems people had with the movie had to do with the plot, and while it's not flawless it's still really well told. Alex Proyas is known for being a stylistic director, and for this reason you should probably watch this with a certain frame of mind. Try to feel your way through the movie instead of over-thinking every little detail. It's an emotional roller-coaster ride and one of the best movies of 2009 so far. On top of everything, the action scenes are awesome.<br /><br />EDIT: Upon further review, my opinion has changed about this movie. I still think it's really well made, but I have to comment on the weird symbolisms and imagery used in the movie. For example, the rabbits may seem out of place until you realize that rabbits were sacred to the religion of Baal, a solar deity. This and other things in the film are related to kabbalism and occultism. If you believe in the Illuminati, you know that they control Hollywood and put their symbols in many films, for example the Nick Cage movies National Treasure 1 and 2. This movie may be part of a broader agenda by very sick and dangerous people. Their final goal is to sacrifice all of humanity to their solar deity who they still worship. You may not believe it but its symbolized everywhere. So enjoy the movie but understand what these things mean.
