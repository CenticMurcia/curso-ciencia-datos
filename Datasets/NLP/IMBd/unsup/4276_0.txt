This is a so-so thriller with a pretty boy hero going through a lot of convoluted flashbacks ala "jacob's ladder" and "butterfly effect". I noticed a taste of "identity" in the mix too. This movie has good suspense right up until the end where it just kinda goes limp without delivering the goods in a most pathetic manner. It replaced intelligence with obscurity since the writers only had the latter as a tool for plot development. Basically you are left wondering - huh? And .. do I even care what the real deal is with this story or is there even a cohesive story to be uncovered here? Or is it just some dumb ending slapped on the end in an attempt to tie up the hundreds of loose ends this weird script leaves hanging?
