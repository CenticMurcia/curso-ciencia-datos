This is a knockout of a film. Krumping really is a positive way for children, young adults and even parents to take out negative energy and feel the positive energy that this type of dancing can provide. I was not born to this type of violent society but my husband was and he was very excited when he saw this movie that he said that he was going to buy it. Believe me, my husband only buys the best movies and this one is amazing. I can feel the power of this dance and it is electrifying. I hope more kids that are born into this type of environment have the opportunity to join the clowns, the stripper dancers (which are not sexual at all) or the krumpers because it is a positive way to not be into any negative activities and to be surrounded but nothing else but positive people.
