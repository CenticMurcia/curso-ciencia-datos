After watching the first one, me and my friends were in the mood to watch another comedy, so we headed out to find the second "No Retreat, No Surrender." <br /><br />Unfortunately, we rented it. <br /><br />Since Bruce Lee's ghost starred in the first one, I figured Chuck Norris' ghost would make an appearance. We found out, however, that Chuck Norris' isn't dead.<br /><br />Therefore, this movie was destined from the very beginning to suck hard. It didn't disappoint. From the horrible acting down to the flawed logic (Why is TKD dominating every other martial arts style?), this movie had no upside, unless, like us, you feel like watching a really bad movie to laugh. Then it achieves its goal. Depending on how you approach this movie will determine whether you have a good time, or if you brutally castrate yourself with electric eels and hand saws.<br /><br />Either way, I really recommend this movie. Five (5) stars out of One (1) Million.
