But the ending? What the hell was that about? A load of swirly black shadows and faces never scared anyone, and doesn't explain anything either!<br /><br />Although I did find it quite scary (I cope better with films like Saw than films involving ghosts/zombies/mutants/mental patients), it left me un-satisfied and a little ticked off that a film that started out quite well ended up so crappily.<br /><br />As well as that, I watched the film knowing nothing about it. I thought it would be a proper haunted house (not a mental institution) so the fact that it was a scary place where the criminally insane had rebelled against their psychotic, mental patient butchering doctor was quite a nice surprise.<br /><br />But apart from that, I didn't enjoy it much at all.
