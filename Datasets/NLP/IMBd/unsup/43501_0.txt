As a huge fan of the Hornblower books, I looked forward to these lavish TV adaptations with great anticipation. Imagine my disappointment to find that none of the merits of the books had been captured, leaving only the cheesiest sort of American-style action-adventure.<br /><br />This first installment is the perfect example. In the original story, the key duel is a masterful play by the virtuoso whist player Hornblower: he takes a losing hand and at the risk of his life finesses it into "an even chance." This reveals the essence of his character: the ability to make coldly dispassionate decisions even when his personal safety is at stake. This revelation is not lost on characters in the book, becoming a key stepping stone in Hornblower's advancement in the navy.<br /><br />The TV movie throws all of this away. Instead of a brilliant tactician, Hornblower is now just another military bonehead, who solves his problems by a combination of physical prowess and ill-deserved good luck.<br /><br />Of course, if the film worked even on that level, it might still be entertaining: a latter-day Captain Blood swashbuckler, perhaps. Alas, that's not in the cards either. As appallingly portrayed by the talentless, charmless Ioan Gruffud, Hornblower is little more than an annoying boob, with neither the charisma of an Errol Flynn, nor the gawky believability of CS Forester's original hero.<br /><br />The historical backdrop might still be of some interest, but that too has been horribly botched. The severe realities of naval life, so vividly depicted in the books, are softened and distorted beyond all recognition. There's no challenge here, for characters to rise above; it's more like a tedious commercial cruise, with boring dinner-table conversation being the worst imaginable hazard.<br /><br />I suppose that had these films NOT included the name "Hornblower," they might seem like passable (if mindless and style-less) light entertainment. But only of the most marginal sort. By attempting to pass themselves off as Hornblower stories, though, they become openly offensive. My advice: avoid at all costs. Put on The Sea Hawk if you want escapist nautical hijinks, and read The Happy Return or Flying Colours if you want sparkling historical drama.
