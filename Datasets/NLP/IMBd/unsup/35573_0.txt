This is the Soap Opera version of the Raid on Entebbe.<br /><br />About half of this movie is poorly written, a real shame. I couldn't believe that this all-star cast would sign up to make a movie of this low caliber.<br /><br />I have watched all 3 Entebbe movies. As others have commented, the "Raid on Entebbe" is strongly on point of the story at hand (the rescue of 101 Israelis held by terrorists).<br /><br />"Operation Thunderbolt" is also on-point, and has many of the actual players playing themselves, but it is largely unfocused.<br /><br />So, for the people who want to get lost in the background, "Victory" is the pick. I wish they could have taken this cast, and had them perform the Raid on Entebbe script ... it would be incredible.
