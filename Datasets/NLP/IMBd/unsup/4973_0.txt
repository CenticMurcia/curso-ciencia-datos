Stylish tale of thug's love/hate relationship with famous gangster benefits from a terrific performance by Paul Bettany as a really scary guy. The ending feels rather weak, as we don't see the transition from Paul to Malcolm McDowell and thus the final scenes haven't been properly set up. Still fascinating though.
