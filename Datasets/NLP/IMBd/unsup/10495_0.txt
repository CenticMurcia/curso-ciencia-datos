Of course, you gotta be a masochist to enjoy some people's genius - you know that if you bear with them they will take you to new levels of perception. <br /><br />With Lars von Trier, the voyage is often hilarious. Epidemic is funny. Funny, in a Gummo kind of way: the characters are real, reality is eerie, and we laugh to break the tension; funny in a the characters say amusing things kind of way (preacher: "this bible is in goddamned Latin"); and funny in an Andy Kaufman screwing with the audience (yes, you) kind of way. <br /><br />Make no mistake: you will suffer. If you are afraid, stay away from horror movies, ya pansy!<br /><br />This movie also features some great aesthetic distance! It's bold!
