***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I had already heard that this film was supposedly the most unfunny comedy ever to be filmed on German soil, but for some perverse reason I decided to see it anyway to find out if it could really be as bad as my friends said.<br /><br />It is: the story is right out of a daytime-soap. Kay, a German girl who's given up on love goes back to her home town to help bury her soccer-coach and meets up with her three girlfriends from high school - two married, one not.<br /><br />Soon after her arrival, she's told by her wacky mother that love is in the stars for her when Venus and Mars align - and before you can say "Seen that before" an American hunk named Cody appears (have you ever noticed that these guys are always named Cody or Ken? If they go by Ken, they are made out of plastic; Cody acts like he's made out of wood).<br /><br />The rest is easily told: after some unfunny interludes, all girls fall in love and live happily ever after. Kay gets Cody, who turns out to be the heir to a fortune. The one who's married to an old-millionaire gets the hunky trash man - sorry, waste-removal-technician. The other married one simply gets laid with her husband and falls for him all over again. And the cute one who was after a gay guy suddenly decides for the shy cab-driver, who has helped her stalk Mr. Right-But-Not-Straight.<br /><br />According to the credits, this film is directed by a Harry Mastrogeorge - who has directed it right into the remainder-bin at your local video-store. The acting is universally bad, with the possible exception of the guy playing the soccer-coach, but only because he's supposed be dead throughout the film - the other thespians don't have that excuse.<br /><br />Some of the characters in this film are supposed to be American, some are German, but since the director did not choose to staple the character's passports to their foreheads and the screenplay only offers vague clues, international confusion rules. I guess the filmmakers were aiming for the US-market as well as the German.<br /><br />Guess what guys: you missed the mark by a mile as well as a kilometer.<br /><br />
