This movie was supposed to be the first of a series of movies with JOAN BLONDELL and MELVYN DOUGLAS playing the same man and wife parts, but BLONDELL opted out and another actress took her place. It isn't any mystery to me why she opted out. I found the husband part played by DOUGLAS to be rude, I could actually say in parts he behaved like a pig. I don't know. Perhaps men treated their wives in a different manner way back then that was condoned by the general public, but I was shocked. I mean, I know they probably wanted a different tack then the Nick & Nora approach (William Powell & Myrna Loy), but this just didn't work for me. I've always really, really enjoyed all of the roles Melvyn Douglas played. He's always seemed to play a "frisky" sort of fellow, but always a gentleman. In Mr. Blanding Dream House you actually wished he was your friend, too. But I had a different feeling towards him after watching this movie. It's any wonder BLONDELL didn't want to resurrect the role again.
