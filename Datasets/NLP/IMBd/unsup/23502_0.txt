I really liked the first one, I thought it was well cast and written. So they made a sequel. It was like one of those Star Trek fan videos you see, where they make their own version of Star Trek. It's got amateurish acting, directing, special effects and only the die hard fans would find it entertaining. I don't know if this sequel was made by a die hard fan of the original, but it was written, cast and had special effects worthy of any Star Trek fan movie.<br /><br />Let's just forget about the bad acting and special effects from 1990. How this script was okayed and I don't just mean by the director or producers, but the actors, is a mystery. Surely when they were reading their part they had to have went at some point "man, there's no way in the world someone would act this way at this point." The Sheriff's co-worker is brutally eaten by the croc and he's laughing and and hitting on the woman shortly after. In fact numerous people he knows are killed and he's worried about getting the money for his boats that were destroyed. After a terrible 24 hours of battling crocs and seeing numerous people beheaded, having limbs torn from their bodies and chopped up by the crocs, he drops off his son with a girl and jokingly says "okay, I'm trusting you!" Then in the car with the hot chick, they're talking about going to dinner and "no talking about your ex-wife." Yeah, forget about the fact we just witnessed what should have been the most horrifying 24 hours a human would have to go through in real life, you better not talk about your ex while I'm eating dinner. At no point does the idiot feel any remorse for losing what were supposed to be people he knew well. <br /><br />The acting was terrible and as is the case in every single one of these idiotic movies, we get yet another son who doesn't like his dad and doesn't want to be there. The son is a jerk and hates life. Poor son. Of course in this particular instance, to no one's surprise with this awful casting, the son is probably about five years younger than the dad.<br /><br />Of course, everyone is a jerk in this movie and you don't even get the satisfaction of wanting them to get eaten by the crocs because the special effects are so awful, the amateurs on the Star Trek fan films are actually better. At no point do you actually think anyone is getting eaten by anything. It's baffling that a movie that obviously put some money into it could have effects this bad.<br /><br />The script was terrible and I'll only give you one example of some of the amazingly terrible attempts at humor:<br /><br />Girl: You're a jerk <br /><br />Guy (to assistant): I think she likes me.<br /><br />Yikes. There is someone in this world who actually thought that would be funny. I've seen better written dialog in a porno. I'm not kidding. Some of the dialog will make you cringe. THIS is why you do more than one draft of a script, folks.<br /><br />Avoid this movie.
