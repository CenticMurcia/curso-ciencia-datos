I do not under stand all the bad talk about this movie; I mean come on! this was not intended as a hollywood block buster, it was made for lifetime TV. If you actually watch the movie closely or more than once, you will see that it is really kinda eerie. I watched this movie the very first time it was aired on october 1992 and have watched every rerun on lifetime since. I give it a solid 8 of 10
