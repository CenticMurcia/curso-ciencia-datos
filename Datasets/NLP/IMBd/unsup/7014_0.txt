Greg Collinson (Doug McClure) has devised an experimental diving craft and, along with British scientist Charles Aitken (Peter Gilmore), uses it to explore the depths. They end up in the underwater city of Atlantis, whose citizens intend to have Aitken join them, hoping to exploit his superior intellect. In addition to fighting off assorted monsters, McClure, Aitken, and their associates set off on a daring escape.<br /><br />One could complain about the cheesiness of the whole affair, or the less than stellar special effects, but for me it still adds up to likable, undemanding fantasy escapism. It's quite colorful and interesting. Most importantly, I felt it was reasonably exciting, with decent direction by Kevin Connor and respectable pacing. The monsters may not be that high tech, but I'd still take these kinds of creations over CGI any day. It just adds to the true old-fashioned, Saturday matin√©e type appeal of the whole thing. Michael Vickers' rousing score is simply wonderful.<br /><br />McClure is a stolid hero, and the supporting cast is fine. Special guest appearances are made by Cyd Charrisse and Daniel Massey as high-ranking Atlantians. Especially effective is under-rated character veteran Shane Rimmer as Captain Daniels, with Michael Gothard, gorgeous Lea Brodie, Robert Brown, and future 'Cheers' mailman John Ratzenberger all enjoyable in smaller roles.<br /><br />The kind of picture that we unfortunately just don't see a lot of anymore, "Warlords of Atlantis" is not particularly memorable but is a definite pleasure to watch in any event.<br /><br />7/10
