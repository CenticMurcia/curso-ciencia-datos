First, there are things I enjoyed about this movie. First of all, Salma Hayek. Need I say more? Then, there's the quite honest and accurate depiction of Mexican Americans and their culture.<br /><br />Also, there were some very nice shots of the tourist favorite areas of the American southwest, mainly around the Grand Canyon and Taos, New Mexico. I would have liked to have seen more of the real beauty of the Southwest.<br /><br />Otherwise, this has the depth of a Harlequin romance. The acting around Ms. Hayek is okay, but pretty standard TV level acting. Both main characters seem overly arbitrary in their relations with each other. The complications that separate the two seems a bit overly long making one impatient since we all know everything will end up all right. Salma's lying about her pregnancy struck me as especially lame. And the concluding scene on the Arizona/Nevada border seemed especially silly.<br /><br />I'm sure there are those who will like this and get more out of it than I did.<br /><br />But as for me, I just didn't think it a good movie. Sorry about that.
