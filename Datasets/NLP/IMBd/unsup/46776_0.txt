I rented this film thinking it was the cartoon. Lone behold, it was a Jackie Chan remake of the cartoon. So I watched it anyways thinking that it can't be all that bad since I like some of his other films. First of all it showed a trailer for the cartoon which left me drooling to see it. Then I watch the film, man do I regret that. I always here people saying "I want the time I spent watching the film back." but I never thought I would say it. I believe you can learn something from every film whether it is good or bad. But this film just sucks. The film is dubbed even though you can see Jackie talking english, the backgrounds and action scenes are very low quality, and most of all, Jackie Chan shows us once again that his humor gets old all because of his lack of acting skills. If you want a good action movie I suggest Hard Boiled, or something that you have read about and sounds good. I regret watching this film and yes, I want my 90 mins of life back!!
