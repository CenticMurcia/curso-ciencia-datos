The more I see of this so-called new independent cinema, the more I think "independent" simply means an amateur, shot-on-video production which otherwise never would have seen the light of day because the makers obviously lack the talent to succeed in the real movie business. Case in point, The Vicious Sweet, a very pedestrian offering which only proves that some people weren't meant to work on either side of a camera. Instead of any legitimate acting, we get a lot of self-important posturing while dialogue is delivered so forcibly that you can see the lines leap right off the script pages. The camera work is obviously rock video influenced, something which unfortunately passes for mise-en-sc√®ne these days, while the gore effects are used strictly for shock value in place of any real scares. Whereas shot-on-video productions such as The Blair Witch Project and The Last Broadcast succeeded because of their innovative approach to the format, this film, or should I say video, makes it abundantly clear that affordable public access to video technology isn't necessarily a good thing.
