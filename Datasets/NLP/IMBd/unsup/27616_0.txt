I love and miss this comedy team! <br /><br />This time our two hapless heroes are framed for a bank heist and find themselves in prison.<br /><br />These two actors have a wonderful chemistry together and generate a marvelous feeling of kinship, friendship, and give us the feeling that everything will be fine as long as they are working together as a team. The story here is both touching and creative. The direction by Sidney Poitier no less, is wonderful, and the sets are well designed. This movie gives you a wonderful feeling of hope.<br /><br />I love this movie, as I have all the others these two have done together.<br /><br />It rates a 7.6/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
