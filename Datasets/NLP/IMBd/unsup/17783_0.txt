I could go on & on about this show, as others have, but I don't need to cover old ground--those of us who saw this show as youngsters when it first came out, well... it was an amazing & hypnotic thing.<br /><br />If you like ST:TOS, Dr. Who, in general any sci-fi from the 60s or 70s, this will be familiar territory for you, and I think a happy place to visit.<br /><br />One thing I didn't see mentioned that fascinates me about the show: most of the alien planets & landscapes were *hand painted* by guest abstract artist--and they amaze. When combined with model work far superior to UFO or Thunderbirds, the alien vistas were, for wont of a better word, painterly.<br /><br />Some of it is campy. The acting is inconsistent. Sometimes the science is bad & there are too many 'psychic' episodes, but I have the entire series and it's one of my favorite possessions.<br /><br />Slightly related, incredibly obscure reference that won't help anyone: Once a friend of mine met a fellow who was a big Peter Hammill fan, who had never heard the VDGG album 'Still Life' but had just bought it and was carrying it around. When he gleaned this from the gentlemen, he told him, "My god man, why are you just standing there--go home and listen to that CD!" If you are a fan of (as these things go) smart, complicated, visually striking vintage SF TV & you haven't seen Space 1999--go and buy it & watch it--you're in for a treat--and there are enough episodes you can spend pretty much 48 hours straight with it before you run out of content... I'm a little envious of you.
