I've waded through about 50 episodes of Poirot now, from the sublime to the mediocre, but this episode lowers the bar to basement level. I've never seen such a preposterous collection of characters, few of which make a lick of sense. It seems that the producers decided that the story needed sexying up, so they sprinkled vulgar language throughout, and heated kisses at every turn.<br /><br />Every Poirot has to have an antagonist, but Elliot Cowan's characterization of The World's Biggest Jerk is so far over the top that he turns menace into eye-rolling absurdity. And naturally, since the plot demands it, the most virginal female character just *must* "fall in love" with him, even though she recognizes his purely evil nature. "What am I, a poor, weak female to do?", she sighs, "I'm a slave to love (as of 5 minutes ago)".<br /><br />And throughout, Poirot subverts his beloved character with hyper-emotional exposition (for no good reason, given his lack of connection to the characters), a hitherto unrevealed religiosity, and a penchant for using 50-cent words that he's never before used, while still forgetting the English words for "thank you" and "yes". Asinine.<br /><br />I would warn anyone who feels affection for Poirot and the great body of his work before this absurd farce to avoid it at all costs.
