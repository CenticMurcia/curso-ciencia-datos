I love Stern and love Artie but don't waste your money on this movie. I saw it in the theater and should have walked out about 20 minutes in but stayed until the end. Artie can't deliver a line to save his life. Stick to the radio show Artie, that is what you do best. This sells because of Howard Stern. It has been commercialized like crazy because Artie Lange is a part of the Howard's show on Sirius Satellite Radio. He is not even that good on the show but is just my opinion. Cut to the movie, This is a bad movie! I would not mind if it was a mediocre movie but I'm actually returning it for a refund, that's how bad it was. Has no artistic value, was made for pure profits and to take advantage of Howard Stern Radio Show on Sirius - Free Advertizing.
