Well this is not a kind of a movie where u can shout its amazing after watching but in very subtle ways it does leave its mark.. Ya its a touching film.. may seem trite but thoroughly enjoyable.. It Starts wit a big city doctor who's headed for a major interview to achieve his dream of becoming a plastic surgeon.. Unfortunately or fortunately he has an accident n gets stuck up in a small town where he's sentenced to community service in t hospital..Cant help but recognise t resemblance to t animated movie 'cars'! Yes there r a few predictable characters but many r really fresh n realistic.. T ending may not leave u jumping out of ur seats but this is a movie u can watch wit t entire family..Its moral is very sensibly portrayed n down to earth..Its heart is in t right place..
