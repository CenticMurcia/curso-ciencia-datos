This was truly one of the greatest shows ever to grace my television. As someone stated, some series are so engrossing you begin to dream about them. As is the popular story told about Sliders. The series was unbelievable until the Prof got killed off in, what was it 'a solar flare storm'. It was hard to take but I think most people watched on. Then as the episodes passed beyond Arturo's death you had this sinking feeling that none of them were going home. This should have been the definitive ending. Or something involving the original cast. I have watched all the series only because I stayed loyal to the show. The fact remains though it didn't end the way it should. Seeing Wade Wells' head in a jar was just not on. Yet up to the point of killing off Arturo and even a small part beyond that with the 2 Mallory's it was refreshing and sci-fi magic. Those are the memories I'll remember from the series. It is one of the greatest sci-fi tv programmes ever made. 10/10 for this piece of magic. Can't wait for the DVD to come out!
