This is a beautiful film. Touching, elegant and moving and with a strong moral message, a message which does not beat you over the head but instead gently pushes at your sensibilities. This should be a film that everyone should be forced to watch, especially the most shallow and judgmental demographic, young women. They have made me feel like an Elphant Man myself on many occasions, which is why I had a special empathy with the main character.<br /><br />One of the best aspects of the film is the setting. It is absolutely perfect in recreating late 1800's London, a fantastic attention to detail. Shooting in B&W greatly enhances this.<br /><br />The acting is also superb, especially from Hopkins and Hurt. I think this is Hopkin's best performance and most memorable, much better than Hannibal Lector, which he has unfortunately become typecast as. It's much better to see him as this kind, sympathetic character than Lector. Also fantastic characters were mother's Head and Carr Gomm. I absolutely love the dialog in this film, especially everything Carr Gomm says. He has a gentlemanly charm that we won't ever see again in the world, even in Merry Old England, and that is so unfortunate. Of course the evil characters, Bytes and the guard, were also memorable.<br /><br />There is really only one thing I didn't think was necessary in this movie. The strange montages of elephants and smoke and stars just didn't seem to belong in what was otherwise such a perfectly set, directed and acted film. It's a very minor criticism though.<br /><br />The ending is sad yet sobering. The story, though embellished somewhat from the truth, still carries an important message of simple humanity and dignity.
