I love the original BRING IT ON, a fun, witty, lively look at rival cheerleading squads and I do think that most sequels aren't as good as the originals and don't expect them to be as good, but at least to have elements of the original to draw the viewer in. This movie, BRING IT ON AGAIN, is the anti-BRING IT ON! It is joyless, unfunny, witless and unlike the talented stars of the original, the stars in this turgid sequel have no personality whatsoever! There isn't a funny character, scene, or even moment in this movie! <br /><br />While the original was about high school cheerleaders, the premise (if you can call it that) here is about college cheerleaders. What's weird is that in BRING IT ON, the stars (Kirsten Dunst, Gabrielle Union, Eliza Dushku) were playing high schoolers but looked and acted older, while here these supposed college-age girls (Andrea Judson-Yager, Bree Turner, Faune Chambers) could easily pass for high schoolers, in both appearance and maturity level! <br /><br />The only real plus is when the 2 girls break off and form their own squad filled with those dormitory protesters. The movie started to get interesting there, but again, the humor just wasn't there! But I will admit that the ending routine was fairly impressive. But kind of anti-climactic I would say. And that post-movie 80s song ending overlapping the scene goofs was not nearly as good as the one at the end of BRING IT ON! Although I do prefer Pat Benatar to Toni Basil. But then again, who doesn't!
