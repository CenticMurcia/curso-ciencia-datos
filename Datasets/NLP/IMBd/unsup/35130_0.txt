One commentator below remarked that if you wanted to see every SF movie ever made, sit through this once and never see it again.<br /><br />Well, my objectives were a little less grandiose, but when I got a chance to see this on TCM, I was excited that I would be able to view this, and mark one movie off the IL'IMDb list.<br /><br />Then the movie came on. At first I thought that all the talk and set up would shortly be followed by the blast off. I waited through scene after incomprehensible scene, as cannons are fired, arms dealers jibe, and former Pres. Ulysses S. Grant shows up.I don't mind talky sf pictures when the talk means something (The Day the Earth Stood Still is great), but this is just drivel. By the time the rocket is launch I can't even say whats going on.<br /><br />Once finally in space, the audience is subject to an excruciatingly predictable, and poorly rendered, make-plot about one of the passengers sabotaging the rocket, a pretty girl stowaway and the usual stuff that was done much better in "The Woman in the Moon" or "Rocketship X-M"<br /><br />But what really is the nail in the coffin in this is the romance between the stowaway and the young, blond pilot. It is so obviously contrived, with dialog seemingly taken directly out of mainstream romance movies of that day, that one finds himself yelling WTF?! out loud.<br /><br />An example "Oh, Whatsyourname, all I know is that when the rocket does explode, please hold me. I want to die in your arms" Might have worked for the complete lack of chemistry between actors.<br /><br />The movies one saving grace is its FX. Big budget, color, space movies from this period are actually quite rare, and this is a chance to see some fair eye candy from a relatively early date.<br /><br />Oh, and another quote (Father to girl, after discussing their inevitable death on the rocket) "Well all that matters right now is that you have cooked us a good meal"
