Just one word to sum up this fantastic new dose of Sharpe and that is 'SU-BLOODY-PERB'.<br /><br />It's been ten years since we saw Richard beat the Imperial Guard on the bloody field of Waterloo, and, like many of the life long fans, I believed that was the last time we would see Sharpe on screen. Of course, there was always a rumour that 'Tiger' would be made into a feature film but that hope died after a few years.<br /><br />Now, we have been treated to an extra long two parter that was excellent in every aspect. A plentiful amount of tension, action and valour. Beano and Daragh were top hold as usual, excellent to see the old faces such as fopp Simmerson, Ramona and Wellington back on the screen.<br /><br />The new characters were utterly splendid, Stephens as Dodd was one of the most evil villains ever to face Sharpe and Peter Hugo-Daly as Sgt Bickerstaff was a vile sight, yet a great performance. Even prompting Bean to jokingly remark in the 'making of' feature that he looked 'F***ing 'orrible'.<br /><br />Not enough time to list all of the supporting cast, but none were a disappointment.<br /><br />In conclusion, one of the best Sharpes to date and I would not be wrong in stating that the series as a whole is THE best historical drama to grace British television.<br /><br />To any of the Producers that might browse these boards, I hope that another two movies are made to give a complete feel to the saga. Plus if you want any extras who want no pay, there's a huge fan base out there plus plenty of ready-trained re-enactors.<br /><br />As you can tell, loved the whole show. Can't wait for the DVD on May 1st.
