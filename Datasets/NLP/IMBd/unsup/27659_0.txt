Rent this one right now. I liked this movie, but because it was so bad on all accounts. It was a movie, filmed in english, then redubbed by the Troma Team. That should give you a hint of what it is like. It has a mother saying, "She can't s**t. I made her hot coffee because she can't s**t. Now she will have constipation and a headache." Something like tha. I was laughing so hard. Also, they redub the boy's need for surgery because whenever he is aroused the semen goes to his head, and it will explode. The sister says, "I want to give you a big french kiss, but i can't because it will arouse you and your head will explode." It is extremely funny. It is kind of shocking, extremely funny, and bizarre. Not for the totally normal. Of course, if you are reading this you know about the bizarre, and are not completely normal yourself. Personally i think it is better to watch this in two parts because it gets tiresome after a while, much like i thought MST3K did. I would get bored with both. But, the next day it is funny again. 8/10
