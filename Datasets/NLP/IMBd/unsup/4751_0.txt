OK, to be honest i didn't expect much out of this movie,being a romantic comedy and all,but in the end i actually liked it, yes it's a chick flick ,and yes some things in it wouldn't really happen in reality,and the movie being so sweet and funny,the ending could have been a little better,but hey,these kind of movies always have something that we would like to be different,all in all i actually liked it,and enjoy watching it over and over again...<br /><br />Kate Hudson was really sparkling in this light spirited comedy, and i for one would like to see her more in funny comedies like this...<br /><br />Denny
