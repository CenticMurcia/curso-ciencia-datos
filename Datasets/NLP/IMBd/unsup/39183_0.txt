How to make a film in Italy.<br /><br />A script that has anything original or "important": war is bad, that's it. But it's a "liberal" point of view, so it's good and it's enough.<br /><br />The same actors seen in every Italian film adding the usual comedian out of a night show (Favino) to have a "known one", and an homage to "bigger names" of the director's circle, giving a cameo to Orlando (Moretti's best one) and Cederna (Salvatore's own).<br /><br />Bad acting: in Italian, every actor murmured in some local "patois", and hardly you can understand what they say. That's a clich√© of every Italian war movie, that Italian soldiers uttered strong local accents: war movie or comic film. Not else.<br /><br />Even budget wasn't SO low, no attempt to research what's the right uniforms, vehicles, terms, historical details, as none of the blue-nosed liberal producers wants to talk with the "militarist" who collect or study military history.<br /><br />Spice all with "I'm an artist" attitude, and you have a typical Italian movie.
