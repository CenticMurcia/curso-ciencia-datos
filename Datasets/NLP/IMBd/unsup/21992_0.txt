Priceless. Charles Grodin is in every scene of THE HEARTBREAK KID and in every scene his actions are more cringe-inducing than the last. Insinuating himself into the lives of a mid-western WASP family, Grodin is sickening...utterly insincere and constantly losing. He's head over heels for wholesome coed Cybill Shepherd, much to the constant dismay of her stern father Eddie Albert. Further complicating matters is his new wife! Grodin, in an early leading role, is excellent, Shepherd is charming and Albert steals each scene he's in...his teeth never seem to unclench. Another big plus is Jeannie Berlin as Grodin's hapless bride, a woman with the social graces of a blind hippo. Directed by the great Elaine May and written by Neil Simon. It's funny and smart. Adapting the Bruce J Friedman story, this is probably the most cerebral thing Neil Simon has ever written.
