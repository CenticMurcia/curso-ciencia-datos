This is an early effort of Abbott and Costello, and displays there comedy talents to the fullest. A bit dated now and heavy on music but none the less and interesting offering from this classical comedy team. Recommended for all ages. Don't let the black and white discourage you. I rated this a 7.<br /><br />
