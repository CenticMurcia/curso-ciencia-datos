reprehensible, exploitative, just some under-age quite graphical sexual intercourse to make you shiver a bit (with disgust) among some phony dialogs out of grotesque characters.. most everything is bad, actors (all of them, the child too), photography.. some things, some reactions are so unlikely to take place that i burst out laughing.. just quite a lot of bad taste (where everything feminine is supposed to be whorish and arouse the bestiality of men) and lots of bad intentions. I really don't understand how this could be rated so high but there seem to be thousands of lover of all kind of nasty, cheesy, Italian trash out there (i'm Italian myself, so don't think i'm racist). Who could ever dare to compare this crap to "The spirit of the bee-hive"... oh please!!!!!
