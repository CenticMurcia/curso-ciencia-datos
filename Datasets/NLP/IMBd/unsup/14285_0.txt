Gene Tierney plays a beautiful kleptomaniac married to a successful psychoanalyst who appears more vulnerable than she in fact is. She comes under the influence of a calculating and dangerous hypnotist played by Jose Ferrer, who not only wants to fleece her financially but also has a strong desire have her in some weird way where he can win over her husband, whom he seriously resents for his successes and recognition in his work. Aside from his glaring professional and personal inadequacies which he glosses over with his smooth delivery, he turns out to be quite dangerous. Forget her kleptomania, which is nothing compared to the psychological minefield portrayed so well by Ferrer. The film's best and most interesting angle is his obsessions, which ruin him, a reason to watch this film with a certain fascination.
