To me this was a shameless display of female flesh. I know most<br /><br />men will say what's wrong with that! But when I watch a Movie I<br /><br />want to be entertained by the story and the plot as well as the<br /><br />scenery. To me this was a way for Demi Moore to show off her<br /><br />new body. It was like Charlie's Angels meets the Matrix it was<br /><br />overdone and unbelievable. The story itself was flimsy at best. I<br /><br />enjoy looking at beautiful women as much as the next guy but at<br /><br />least let it be in an entertaining way. I mean it is as if the said let's<br /><br />see how many times can we use our new special effects technology and get away with it. Overall I would call it beautiful<br /><br />women in tight skimpy clothes with Charlie's Angels as a subplot.I<br /><br />certainly hope this is the last of Charlie's Angels. I Also hope that<br /><br />the three ladies will take some much needed acting classes.
