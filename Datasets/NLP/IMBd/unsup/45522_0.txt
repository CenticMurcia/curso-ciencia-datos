A Cheech and Chong adventure, strangely not involving much drugs nor taking place in LA. That also might be the reason this is also one of the least funny Cheech and Chong movies. The Corsican Brothers was much funnier than this movie (which is not saying much). The movie starts out in Chicago, where our heroes work at a car wash. As usual, they get caught up in a strange turn of events that leads them to Las Vegas (this time). The laughs are far and few in between. The musical scene at the restaurant reminded me of old Yeller (someone please shoot him or rather me). The funniest scene is when Chong freaks out in the restaurant dressed up as a woman. His opening soliloquy is also quite funny. If you want to see a pointless adventure, not induced by drugs then see this movie. If, however, you would like to see a good Cheech and Chong movie skips this one. Go see Up in Smoke, Next Movie or even Nice Dreams. The movie can be summed up in a few powerful words : Cheech's man thong. Remember, rock and roll killed Elvis and I haven't done drugs in a week. I feel great. I feel like doing more drugs. You got any ??
