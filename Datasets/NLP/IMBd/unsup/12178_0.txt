This film is by far one of my favorites. I saw it for the first time at the Philadelphia Film Festival in February 2005, and have seen it about five times since then. The American audience seems to regard the film as leftist ideological banter, but they fail to understand the underlying purpose behind the film. Not only is the film a political commentary, but more importantly it is a commentary on human relationships. Once one can understand the motives for the film, one can see how great it is. The ending of course, makes the film. I encourage everyone to see this film at least once, and take it for what it is. Its not a Hollywood blockbuster, but a fantastic examination of both the Western capitalist system, and of human relationships in general. It's a fantastic film, and everyone ought to see it just once.
