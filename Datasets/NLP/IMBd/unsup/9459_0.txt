There are already lots of comments about this one on the website but I just wanted to weigh in on it because I enjoyed it so much. I couldn't find a real flaw with the picture - Direction, acting, editing, photography, storyline all class A. Also couldn't find fault with the pacing.<br /><br />I was particularly impressed by the stellar job turned in by William Powell, showing more depth and sensitivity than in most of his films, especially in the climactic scene. And could anyone but Clark Gable make you root for a bad guy the way he could? I felt this was a gripping and compelling film from start to finish.<br /><br />I feel the picture is underrated and is better than the present 7 it has received. Also feel it was another 'miss' by Leonard Maltin, who misses from time to time.
