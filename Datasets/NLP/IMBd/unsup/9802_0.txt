People that disagree with this film use words like 'lies' and phrases like 'conspiracy theorists' to describe it. One even claims that this film disrespects the victims of 911! On the contrary, I believe it's those that go with the status quo and believe everything they hear in the news and everything their politicians tell them is the gospel truth, that disrespect the memory of the dead! I am not saying that this film has it all right. More questions are asked than answered, but on the whole, I believe the point of this film is to get you thinking and talking with an open mind. It asks a lot of the viewer. It's almost uncomfortable to watch because most of the points covered leave you with a reasonable doubt with regards to the official version of the events of 911. There is more to the story of 911 than we have been told, this film should leave you wanting to learn more about the truth, as long as you have an open mind and are not averse to having your preconceived ideas challenged!
