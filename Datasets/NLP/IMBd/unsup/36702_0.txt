Hugh Grant in the more recent film with Sandra Bullock is mildly amusing. With Julia Roberts, okay. Paired opposite Jeanne Tripplehorn, playing with a terrible accent (cannot tell what it is; it's not NY or Italian!) This film fails on so many levels. "Married to the Mob" with Michelle Pfeiffer was better, and though her accent was off, at least she can act, unlike Tripplehorn.<br /><br />Hugh Grant can be good, but this is not one of those times. Also, I think I may speak for quite a few people who are tired of his boyish, foppish grin- that doesn't play into your late 40's and early 50's, Hugh (someone, please inform his talent agent!). James Caan is miscast once again.<br /><br />If you want a good NY comedy, with this theme, try "Moonstruck" or "Married to the Mob". 1/10.
