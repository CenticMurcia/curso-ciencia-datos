This great flick is directed by and stars well know character actor, Steve Buscemi as Tommy Basillo. Tommy has lost his girl, lost his job, and now doesn't really know what to do. After a weak attempt to find work, he ends up driving an ice cream truck directly into the cross hairs of an old, violent friend played by Daniel Baldwin. Other cast include a younger and thinner Anthony Lapaglia of Without A Trace fame, Mark Boone Jr. who now appears in the FX series, Sons of Anarchy, and a special appearance by Samuel L. Jackson. It is basically a day in the life of a "regular Joe." Another good film directed by Steve Buscemi is "Lonesome Jim.". It stars some of the same actors and the always beautiful, Liv Tyler. If you like "Tree's Lounge" you're safe with "Lonesome Jim.". So enjoy!
