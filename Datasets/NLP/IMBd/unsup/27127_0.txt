I had been interested in seeing Xtro for a very long time, so naturally when Xtro 2 was coming on the Sci-Fi channel late on a Saturday night, I was more than exited to see it. This movie is about as big of a rip off of ALIENS as you can get. People being sent to another dimension, finding a derelict ship or something, and coming back to have a monster pop out of one of their bodies? There's even a Smartgun from Aliens appearing in a couple of scenes ("I'm gonna go and get 'the gun'"). The entire movie moves slow and doesn't make much sense either. The sets are boring as are the characters and the dialogue. The monster looked kind of interesting at first, but when they finally showed it in its entirety it looked like a model with crappy lighting. This is sincerely the worst movie I have ever seen to date.
