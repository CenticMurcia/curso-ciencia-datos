This is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen. I only want to comment in hopes of saving someone else the experience. How could it be so bad with some really great people? Easy,<br /><br />make them a modern Sunset Blvd. version of Bob & Carol And Ted & Alice....Or Ken & Barbie Meet Limeyrocktwit & WholeEarth MotherNympho....You take your girlfriend home and before you<br /><br />know it, she's in bed with your mom...If that sounds like fun, or if you can relate...this one's for you...A poorly directed, nasty story that made me want to shower with kerosene and steel wool. A very ugly story and viewing experience...Avoid this trash!
