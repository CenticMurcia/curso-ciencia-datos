So A1 dreams of the sexy dark-haired plod who arrests him just before he wakes up chained to the lav with D'abo. Ah, happy days. Back then he could hack into computers just like in mission impossible but cheaper and with sandwiches on them. Ah.<br /><br />But back to the present. They cunningly fool the hostile lag by using a snog to teleport their hands from the bog.<br /><br />Then they do various stuff and win the day, hooray.<br /><br />It's all poor stuff except (as one expects in this sort of trash) some junky fun. D'abo's co-pilot has an amazing plan to make them split up, lost, alone, in a hostile prison asteroid full of rampaging murderers. She complies, happily, of course.<br /><br />The baddies' arbitrary slaying of everyone is to my approval, plus it keeps the cast numbers down.<br /><br />Jeffrey Meek is watchable. I find there are not enough openly gay southern belle drama queen mass murderers on the screen and I'm pleased Meek goes for it with gusto. He really is the most entertaining queer sociopath I've seen for some time.<br /><br />The ending is excellent. D'abo and A1 do the nasty (in an old hotel it appears) and they have a laugh about it, probably because they were rubbish and then luckily room service arrives and it's Meek. Nobody knows why, there is no reason, nobody cares, the credits roll, we make a cup of tea.
