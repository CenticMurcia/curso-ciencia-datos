BEGIN SPOILER: <br /><br />The Grey Zone is based on the actual events in Auschwitz during WW2. Teams of Hungarian Jewish prisoners were forced to work in the crematoriums to dispose of the bodies of the Jewish victims of the Nazi regime during WW2.<br /><br />END SPOILER <br /><br />This film in its own way is as harrowing as Spielberg's Schindler's List, but concentrates on one group of prisoners and their captors.<br /><br />This film is just one more in an extremely long list of films which deals with the horrific events in German concentration camps during WW2.<br /><br />Although the film cannot be construed as the best film depicting the horrors of WW2 ever made, it is nevertheless a reminder of what went on in German occupied countries during those dark days from 1939 to 1945.<br /><br />It was well made and well acted and I for one was reminded of what the human race is actually capable of. I was particularly impressed with the performances of Steve Buscemi and Harvey Keitel. Although Keitel is not one of my favourite actors, he made the part his own and I could easily equate him with the man he was portraying, Eric Muhsfeldt.<br /><br />There may be some who feel that this type of film has outlived its usefulness and there is no need to continue to remind us of these black historical events.<br /><br />To anyone who does feel this way I would say that these reminders must never stop until there is peace throughout the world, Firstly because there are still many, many atrocities still occurring in this world which must be addressed, and those responsible must be brought to book and the free world must jointly do everything in their power to put an end to these regimes.<br /><br />Secondly, Although it is over 60 years since the horrors were first brought to the attention of the world, there are millions who were not born or know nothing or very little about how the human race can be, and still are, so cruel and evil against its fellow man.<br /><br />Anyone who watches The Grey Zone I feel will be moved at the plight of these Hungarians who were forced into doing what they had to do.<br /><br />Plutus1947
