Today i received my Nightmare on Elm Street collection and having seen part one it was straight on with number two "Freddy's Revenge" which i found way, way off the mark from the original.<br /><br />The story is set five years after the events of part one and now the Walsh family have moved into the house from part one and the son of the family Jesse begins to have the nightmares that Nancy from the previous installment was having. Its only too long before Freddy begins yet another reign of terror.<br /><br />The film gets off to a quick start with a nightmare which really takes you by surprise and is set up nicely and all i'll say is it goes down faster than the Titanic. Throughout the film you feel that it is just a mixture of plot lines just thrown together in the editing room without a thought to a normal narrative such as the first film.<br /><br />The film is hard to follow and strays heavily from the first film which is not the way a sequel should go but then again we are talking about the horror genre here. Freddy gets little to no screen time in the film which is really a bad thing considering most people watch these film for Freddy so i couldn't understand the logic in this but never the less they did it! The acting is poor and you really feel that Mark Patton was badly miscast in some way or another and i really never bought his whole descent in to Freddy's clutches which i did in the first film. Of course Robert Englund is superb (when he gets chance) as Freddy Kruger and really shows an evil side towards the end. The other actors really aren't worth a mention because of the total lack of respect for their characters shown by the director and writer of the film.<br /><br />Speaking of which Jack Sholder should be appalled by his work here, there is no real direction and when there is it really is all over the place and very bad and shows in no way the brilliance of what Wes Craven brought to the original. The writing too is just mind boggling in terms of how the guy even managed to get his trash on the screen in the first place, the dialogue is cheap and cheesy which is what we expect in the horror genre but just not to this bad extent.<br /><br />All in all this film will certainly go down as one of the worst horror sequels ever as far as i'm concerned but i did give this a four out of ten so there must be something worth watching.... well yes there is and i think its the fact that this is a nightmare on elm street film and for that reason you want to like it a lot but it just wasn't worth the bother and should be ignored from the franchise to be totally fair.<br /><br />As far as horror sequels go this is one of the worst i have witnessed in a long time and is in great distance from the original and that is a shame! **** out of **********
