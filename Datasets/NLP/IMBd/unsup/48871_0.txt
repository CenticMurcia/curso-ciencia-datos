Dreadful sci-fi entry from Germany, which features invaders from space who want the emotion of love from the people of Earth, even if they have to kill them for it. So what better strategy to initiate this cosmic onslaught than to place the vanguard of the invasion force in a dead woman's body disguised as a substitute high school teacher--pretty clever!! This lady certainly intimidates the little brats into doing what they should do, as well as pull the wool over the eyes of the stupid parents in the community. She's on her way to conquering the earth, smashing every human in her path, maybe even becoming the high school principle! The kids know what's going on though, 'cause they've seen the invader eating live chickens in the barn. So, naturally, they have to plan on getting rid of the outer space boogie-sub by themselves. So it goes....not much in the way of a gripping plot or special effects either. And there you have it!
