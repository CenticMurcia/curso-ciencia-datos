I hated this movie, I saw it at sundance and was surprised on how stupid it was, the story is about this poor British women and her fatherless family and how she meets a old friend from high-school/college and decides to go out with him. wow that alone makes this story sad, then to make it better she goes dressed as a hooker and well what do you know she ends up being to poor to afford dinner for her kids and gets them a cola, wow. Then at the end she starts to have sex with this guy as the kids are watching. What kind of mother is this? I mean I didn't buy this actor at all I found it stupid just plain stupid I've seen better work out of student work. Then there was a wasp that the baby son eats, this wasp is a CGI Flat load of garbage i didn't buy that the thing was real and it pulled me out of the all ready sad movie. Aside from the story, poor CGI, and cheap feel of the movie I'm sure there must have been some gem in there.
