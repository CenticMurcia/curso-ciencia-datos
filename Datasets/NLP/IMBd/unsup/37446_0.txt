I love horror movies, I really do. But this film was pathetic. I can't believe it got into horror fest. It had no story. A few teenagers go in, almost everyone dies, that's it, that's the whole story right there. And also, it took thing's from real life and put it in a movie. The ending couldn't have been any dumber. I mean, This "Jonah" is the dumbest horror movie character I've ever seen. It has no moral, It has no plot, It's rising action is just killing and killing and killing. It almost makes you miserable the whole movie. When it's over, you don't feel like you learned anything, you don't feel like you enjoyed it, you don't feel relieved when it's over. I just wanna give the director, the crew, and all of the actors a few fists to the head.
