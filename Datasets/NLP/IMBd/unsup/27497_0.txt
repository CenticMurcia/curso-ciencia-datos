My mother told me that Bette Midler wrote the song "The Rose" for the movie. She gave me the original soundtrack from the movie. I listened to it but didn't really understand it. Then I was looking through the schedual on hbo.com and I saw that "The Rose" was gonna be on and i HAD to see it. So i did and i love it. i cried and cried. I felt so sorry for her. And Bette Midler did a GREAT job in the movie!!!!
