After reading the enthusiastic comments posted so far, I feel guilty admitting I was bitterly disappointed by "Vengo." I'd enjoyed "Latcho Drom" and even went out and purchased the sound-track CD.<br /><br />But "Vengo" left me cold: too much mediocre acting, far too much melodrama, and far too little flamenco for my taste. <br /><br />At one point the main character characterizes the music being played as "flamenco puro!" and bangs his fist on the cafe table to underscore his fervor. I agreed with him--at that moment. But aside from that one cafe scene, I found little in the movie that seemed "puro" to me, and much that sounded "globalized" and tawdry.<br /><br />I am voting only two stars on this one.
