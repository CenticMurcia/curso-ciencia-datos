This is the best killer frog movie ever made. Although for the most part, the Frogs are the conductor of the killing symphony of reptiles that surround a southern mansion owned by Ray Milland. Gators, snakes, and spiders do most of the dirty work; till the finale, anyhow. The frogs are always there though, watching. The one main thing I liked about this movie is that it didn't involve biological mutations caused by the American military, like so many other nature-gone-wrong films. Like JAWS (that came a few years after) this film is plain old nature's revenge on humanity, and nothing more. Sam Elliot is the 'Chief Brody', as it were, of this film, playing an ecologist (so then he's 'Brody' and 'Hooper' combined). The thing I liked also is that he - and the movie itself - wasn't a bit preachy like other environmental sci-fi type movies. The victims of nature aren't really bad guys, just rich and spoiled and miserable. The filmmakers left a couple of unresolved things: like did the African American butler, maid, and girlfriend of one of the dead family members, live? Did the dog live? Well, since we didn't see them die, I assumed they did. Also, the beginning credit sequence is one of my favorite of all time, especially when the title FROGS is shown. And there's a neat little cartoon treat after the final credits roll. Well, all in all, I really loved this movie. It's a laid back gem indeed. Sit and enjoy. And stay away from fancy french food after watching!
