I absolutely loved Highlander part I, but when I saw this movie, I didn't understand the story at all! I've seen it more than once, just to make sure I wasn't crazy, but I still don't get it.<br /><br />spoilers coming your way!!!<br /><br />In H1 it was all pretty normal. Okay, so it's a story written with a lot of imagination, but you could understand it. In H2, everything changes and Conner and ramirez show up somewhere out of space and must return to earth to save the planet. First, I never heard ANYTHING of them leaving earth and second, wasn't Ramirez killed in part 1???!!!??? And another thing, what was that with Conner having to become immortal once again? I didn't get that part, call me crazy if you want to.<br /><br />Oh yeah, for all those who have also seen part 3, I think there's a huge mistake made in 2 and 3. Conner's wife from part 1 dies two times! First in part 2, because of the ozon-thing and in part 3 they mention that his wife had to be scraped of off the road in Scotland somewhere.<br /><br />speaking about part 3... This was a Very good part. Okay, it wasn't as good as part 1, but it made sense (besides the power thing that immortals suddenly owned).<br /><br />
