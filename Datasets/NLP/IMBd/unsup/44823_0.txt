This is *NOT* one of those movies which are so bad they're funny.<br /><br />The screen play was horrid, the directing was the worst and I could continue with every facet of movie making (props, special effects, etc.). Everyone including Louis Gossett, Jr. should be ashamed of their involvement in this piece of garbage. No one should be paid for their part in this sham. Worst of all, it is no adaptation of anything written by Bram Stoker. But somehow Bram ended up with his name in the title.<br /><br />Okay, this was made in 1997. But "Star Wars", "Empire Strikes Back" and "Return of the Jedi" all came out by 1983 and had better *EVERYTHING*, so the year is no excuse. There are a lot of names and well known faces in this movie. You'd think the actors could have pulled it out of the gutter. Other than Louis Gossett, Jr. (who I love to watch act), there is Richard Karn (Home Improvement), an older Lloyd Bochner (tons of character roles, IMDb has him listed in 183 movies or shows), Aubrey Morris and other recognizable faces couldn't save this.<br /><br />Please, for your own sake, avoid this at all costs. You're better off playing Ostrich for 2 hours and sticking your head in the sand. This is purely dreadful.
