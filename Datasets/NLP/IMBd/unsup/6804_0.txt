This film kicks and punches. I have seen a lot of action films, and this one has the best direction for action sequences. The karate is just excellent, the one scene with the neon lights with the two dark combatents is way cool. The big man fight is interesting, and the story melts well with the action. This movie is about the action. The scene with the toilet almost killed Chuck in real life.
