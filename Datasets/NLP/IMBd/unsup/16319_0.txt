I saw Kill By Inches at the Brussels International Fantasy Film Festival 2000 (last year) and I can say it was the most unique and stunningly original film there. Great cast of strange characters. <br /><br />I was truly struck by the studied, chilling atmosphere and dark mood in this story of a young tailor (played by Emmanuel Salinger) who goes insane, inch by inch by inch, by degrees. Very singular, unique film, very rare to see these days.
