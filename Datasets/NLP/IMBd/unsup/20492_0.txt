This is the MJ Fox film that I like the most. Sadly, it was never released on video here in Australia. The story is funny without degenerating into slapstick, the direction is very good and the casting is terrific. MJ Fox is MJ Fox, albeit better than usual and there is good counterpoint from the romantic lead Warner. But what wins for it are the wonderful supporting characters, all of which a played to a tee. I have not seen it for some time but I will never forget the characters of the old doctor (Hughes), the medical centre nurse (Byrde), the mayor (Stiers), the mechanic (Winkler), the quilt-sewing ladies of the welcoming committee, the suitor (Harelson), the Southern escapee (Fonda), the pig and the plastic surgeon (Hamilton). They steal the show and make the whole experience fun.
