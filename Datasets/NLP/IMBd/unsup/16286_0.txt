Don't be fooled by the # of perfect 10's this has been given or by anything over a 7.5 rating. It's not quite that good. It's more your general, run-of-the-mill, movie-of-the-week... another of those oh-so-common Based On A True Story Of A Southern White Trash Trailer Park Woman With A Wickedly Messed Up Life. The story is kind of interesting but the character development fell short as did the script and acting talent. The last 25 minutes or so woke me up and got me re-interested with the slight twists, turns, and wows but the first 90+ was a pretty big Yawn Question Mark Yawn. Why exactly did this woman do what she did? What made her so screwed up? It needed less commercials and a better writer and maybe this story could have been better told. Oh well. I won't tell you not to see this because if you're ever on a game show with a topic of Serial Killer Southern Women, you might be one up on your competition... but surely don't go out of your way to see this one. It's only average to below-average and you won't miss anything.
