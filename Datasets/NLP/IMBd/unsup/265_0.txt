The Birdcage is so hilarious! Oh my goodness gracious, this movie just really leaves you gasping for breath because you can't stop laughing.<br /><br />Past the "Fosse, Fossees" and "John Wayne imitations", this movie can be seen in a deeper level. It addresses the controversial topic of homosexuality and how people who are gay or lesbian are just like any other people. Nathan Lane plays the part of a woman so well that I still find myself forgetting that SHE is a HE.<br /><br />The chemistry and interaction of the characters was played out so nice that the main message is clear. Amidst the sound of a nightclub, the first words the audience hears is "We are family..." This movie reminds people that no family is perfect.It shows the similarities between the contrasting serious and traditional family versus the lively, unorthodox family. Each family had its peculiarities and it shows the reality of family life. It is the love and genuine care for each other that makes up a family.
