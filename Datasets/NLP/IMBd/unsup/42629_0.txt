Hangman is a somewhat interesting thriller with some good things but too many horrible mistakes that completely bury any enjoyment from the viewer and most of all any value the movie could have.<br /><br />The main interest lies in the two `big' names of the cast. Cult favorites Lou Diamond Phillips and MÃ¤dchen Amick hold the movie together and through their solid acting prevent things from going just too ridiculous. I always though Diamond would make it big and it's a shame he didn't. He had the talent and charisma. Amick is still one of the most beautiful and sexy actresses around and one of the most underrated too. Too bad these people are stuck in this type of movie.<br /><br />The script has its moments with some nice suspense but then it tried to be too smart for its own good and the plot turned unbelievable, dumb and a complete mess. <br /><br />The ending however is what really turns Hangman into a bad joke and a waste of time for the public. This has to be one of the most idiot endings I ever saw even in a bad movie. Trust me its awful! There's no payoff at all, people! It's not shocking it's just annoying and terrible.<br /><br />Without the ending Hangman would have been a decent thriller even with some really bad dialogue and plot holes the size of Texas but when the credits roll in you just feel like you wasted precious minutes of your life that you'll wish you had when death comes for you. <br /><br />Only for Diamond fans since Amick really doesn't shine much!<br /><br />Only good thing was the sex scene but don't expect much either. There was no nudity and it only lasted a few seconds. They didn't even get her sexy oufits. <br /><br />Don't see it. Its not even cheesy fun. It's just a bad movie with nothing to recommend at all.<br /><br />Stay away!<br /><br />
