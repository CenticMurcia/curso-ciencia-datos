It was nothing to talk about. Just a sorry chick flick that made no sense at all. Robert Duvall cheated on his wife and she took him back because she watched him riding a horse. Huh? And more senseless stuff like that was all through this thing.<br /><br />I found only two interesting things about this movie. There was a weird camera angle on the staircase using a fisheye lens. They used this shot a lot. The camera angle was mildly interesting for a while. And there was a guy in the movie named Frank Lewis. This was only interesting because I worked for someone named Frank Lewis at the time I watched it.<br /><br />Guys - don't let some girl make you watch this movie!
