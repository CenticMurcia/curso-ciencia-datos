A premise that could have worked for comedy or drama is defeated by amateur acting, writing and directing and the result feels like soft core porn that's been edited for an R rating. Michael Greer, a specialist in swish, has charisma, but the rest of the cast is downright unappealing. The film has no atmosphere, poor pacing, drab set design and dreary cinematography, and it's offensive in its stupidity and gay clich√©s. It's interesting to note that lead Kevin Coughlin played an unapologetically gay character in 1968's Wild in the Streets. Coughlin was killed in a hit-n-run accident in 1975. A child actor, he appeared on The Patty Duke Show, and played Duke's brother in the 1959 feature Happy Anniversary.
