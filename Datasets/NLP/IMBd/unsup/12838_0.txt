There is one major problem with GITSAC and that regards the backgrounds and foregrounds. While the backgrounds, all computer rendered look stunning and detailed, the foregrounds and characters don't really blend into them. Its forgivable since this is a problem with pretty much all animation barring a very few but since it looks as though the producers are putting so much attention to detail, they should'nt have really overlooked that feature.<br /><br />Another problem is unevenness. Not all episodes are equally good and some can be downright boring although the 2nd season/GIG does add more interesting stuff. The fact that each episode is "stand alone" and disjointed means that too much detail that doesn't always make sense, needs to be squeezed into limited time. There is too much attention given to computer generated virtual reality sfx rather than the action in real life.<br /><br />While GITSAC is revolutionary in its own way, it can get quite boring at times. Give me shirow's Dominion tank police instead any day! GITSAC simply has no charm, no soul and seems quite dead at times.
