The previous commentators have succinctly and excellently commented on this film. As a Lieutenant in the USN aboard ships which often went to the West Indies the movie has a nostalgic charm to it aided by the strictures of the Hayes Code and the mandatory happy ending.<br /><br />The only "errors" were the stationary and never moving beer bottles sitting [or glued]on an I-beam despite the fact that the ship is literally falling apart and sinking at the bow.
