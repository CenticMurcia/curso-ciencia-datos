King's Quest II can basically be seen as King's Quest I revisited. It uses the same game engine almost exactly. King's Quest I was a revolution in adventure games for the computer. Most earlier games, like Zork and Adventure, were solely text-based. Early CGA graphics and basic computer sound combined to bring these characters to 2-D. The play of King's Quest II is quite simple. You are the King Graham of Daventry, and you are looking for your bride-to-be. You move the King around the screen with the arrow keys and have to manually type in commands like "pick up book" and "throw knife at dog" to make things happen. A fun game, but it shows just how far Sierra has come when you look at King's Quest V and up.
