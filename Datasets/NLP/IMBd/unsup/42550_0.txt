Yes, perhaps there is some interesting psychological commentary in the movie, but overall it is bizarre, unrewarding, and with no sense of closure. Further, it is not scary in the least. I thought it was supposed to be a horror movie, but it is more like a sterile view of something that could be scary just because of the subject matter, but doesn't come off that way.<br /><br />I had a pretty hard time watching the whole thing just because it was so boring. I was constantly asking myself if the time I was spending rotting my brain with this movie was better used, say, eating a PB&J sandwich...
