This new Galactica is a huge disappointment. The old one (1978) is a masterpiece in a comparison to this. They managed to ruin the complete concept. Everything is not how it should be. The director does a bad job. The fighting scenes are comical. Special effects were better in the old series. The characters are poorly written. Also, they managed to transform Sturbuck, the hero of my childhood, into a female character, although there were some interesting female pilot characters in the old series. If you want to waste your time, then watch this one. I am the great fan of the old Galactica so maybe this makes me too critical, but still I think that the new one deserves only 1 star ( I would give it 0 if I could).
