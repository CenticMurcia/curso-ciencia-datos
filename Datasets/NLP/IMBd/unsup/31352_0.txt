There is simply nothing about NCIS that is not to like. I'll get the superficial stuff out of the way first - every camera angle on Michael Weatherly is gorgeous, and he plays it so well as Anthony DiNozzo. Ziva, his partner, is most adorable with every cultural nuance she utters as she tries to grasp American idioms. It's charming and realistic. Her ability to speak Israeli for some plot lines truly adds to her beauty and character-balancing the serious with the humorous sides of the show. Bringing David McCallum into our lives again brings the emotion of nostalgia. How we loved his British accent in THE MAN FOR U.N.C.L.E. His charming ramblings, his sensitivity to forensics, and his educational lessons are perfect. Characters McGee and Abby play perfectly off each other. and Mark Harmon is the guiding treasure. Tie up in a bow, and they have all played their characters so convincingly that we are invited to be part of their team every week. That's true TV. The bonus: no foul language, machine guns blaring, and no sex (but plenty of engaging innuendos). Please tune in. This show is such a delight.
