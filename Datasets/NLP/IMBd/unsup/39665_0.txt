We've all seen the softcore pornographic films that are aired on Cinemax and Showtime after dark, and they're terrible enough. But "Hidden Passion" is worse; not only is it terribly acted and horribly written, but the fact that it's a cheap rip-off of "Bound" adds another layer to the disgust. And the film doesn't even do a good job at ripping it off, seeing as how it's cast with untalented actors, so it's crammed with sex scenes here and there to lure the viewer away from the fact that the entire movie reeks.
