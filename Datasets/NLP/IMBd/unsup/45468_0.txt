absolute drivel. sadly this amateurish 'documentary' (for it is nothing more than a couple of middle class American boys jetting around Europe acting like teenagers) opened the Glasgow world film festival. the two makers were present to answer questions on the film, not after the screening as one would expect but before it saying that they couldn't make it after the film. i wonder why? the part in the film where they arrived in Finland an hour late due to their americanised thinking (or is that an oxymoron?) that all of Europe works on the one time zone sums them up in terms of intellectual capacity. complete idiots who have jumped on the Michael Moore polemic bandwagon and managed to record with the help of camcorder guerrillas (or is that gorillas?) a mere eighty minutes of mostly this pair of muppets cutting their hair, touching their balls, and drinking coffee. it is people like these who instead of offering a solution to the corporate ills of the world actually contribute towards them. the film has as much substance and integrity as a string vest, and as much coherence as the back room at oxfam. makes that fat guzzler Moore look good. should be renamed the muppet show.
