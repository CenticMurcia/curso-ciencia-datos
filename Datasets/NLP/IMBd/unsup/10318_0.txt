A beautiful simple story, told with no unecessary effects (Ozon respects the natural pace of mourning time). But what strikes most is Charlotte Rampling, who's never been so real, so beautiful, so mysterious. I won't forget her face in this film. It's not usual, that kind of meeting between of an actress and a character.
