This movie intrigued me right form the start because it's an american movie about Afghanistan. Also, the fact that it is about the mass media and war coverage was also pretty interesting. The movie's two main characters are Goldblum playing a sort of stereotypical ani-establishment type, and Lake Bell as his newbie photographer.<br /><br />The good thing about this is that it does show how much personal preferences shape the stories that make it to the headlines. One character at one point justifies his stance with the words "maybe I just love my country", proving that he is not being impartial, and that we cannot truly expect impartiality from the media.<br /><br />The movie goes back and forth between whether the US government is playing games or not and what a reporters duty is and whether or not reporters are impartial. In the end it is shown that the reports will give the story. But this isn't completely accurate given that many reporters are refraining from "asking the tough question" because they feel it would be unpatriotic to do so.<br /><br />The movie left me feeling a little unsatisfied but overall it is in itself (i think) relatively unbiased, showing all types of reporters and also things that may or may not be motivating the US government.
