I started watching this show by accident and have been watching it ever since. The reason is I am hoping for one of the family to emerge as a totally responsible person. The whole family from the father and mother and all children are totally dysfunctional. Every new character is the same. The one who they took in their home because his father was a marine (Martin) came closest, but was also a disappointment in the end. It makes a farce of any religion I know of, but still I find myself watching and hoping. All of the children falling in love with every member of the opposite sex they meet is ridiculous. I am reminded of an Uncle I have who was a Baptist minister. He and his wife were normal people, but he had four sons, all of whom became alchoholics. Both families make me wonder about being a minister with a family.
