Looks so much like a current LOST ... so funny. If writer get is as new idea :) Plane crashes. 2 croups. Odd buildings Experimental stuff. So copy of this original or there some movie of mother of this? I like lost but screed too far. One movie would do it. Kathy Ireland and Beth Toussaint they rules. True babes. So I like to you to enjoy this movie. FX are in low budged and nice to see young Nikki Cox before you can think she is pretty babe. Here she is just kid with serious acting attempt. Just wonder when they found "Monster" in water in LOST then it would be too lame. So lets see what comes. I's say this film is worth of watching for all those Robinson Crusoe lovers.
