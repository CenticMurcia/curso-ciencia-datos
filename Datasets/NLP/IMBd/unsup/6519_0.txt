Why was this movie made? That was what I was asking myself after painfully having to go through the entirety of the utter crap that was Manmadhan. The simple answer is: money. This movie has nothing going for it whatsoever. <br /><br />But seeing as I hated it, let's take a look at the positive aspects of this movie first: - It's excellent for aspiring filmmakers to watch, so they can learn what NOT to do.<br /><br />And that's pretty much it. On the other hand, I can go on forever about the negative aspects. This movie had no direction, one of the worst scripts ever written, horrible acting, and no sense of pacing whatsoever. The thing Tamil movies are (well, were, at least) known for is style. Any style in Manmadhan? No - none at all. In fact, most Tamil movies no longer have any style, but that's a whole other story.<br /><br />Moving back to Manmadhan, let's talk about the plot. The plot had the potential to make this a C-movie. As I understand it, it was ripped off of an old Kamalhassan film called "Sigappu Rojakkal". I have yet to see that film, but I can guarantee it is at least twenty times better than this worthless video (I can't bear to call it a film anymore).<br /><br />The acting in this movie was non-existent. Based on this movie, I hold a strong belief Silambarasan has no acting talent whatsoever. Jyothika's small talents totally miss this... this... I don't know what to call it anymore!<br /><br />The worst part is, after going through three hours of intense pain and suffering, the films ends with "To be continued".<br /><br />All in all, Manmadhan is a film you should never see in your life. I had to suffer it, and I dearly hope no one else will have to do the same. In fact, you shouldn't even be on this page! Leave, now!
