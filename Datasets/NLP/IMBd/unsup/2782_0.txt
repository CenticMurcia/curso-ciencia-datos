This is a comical version of the all too familiar story "Snow white and the 7 Dwarfs"<br /><br />So naturally there is the beautiful brunette, the jealous queen and the 7 "dwarfs."<br /><br />In this version the dwarfs are not really dwarfs in the true sense of the word, (well maybe some of them are), but rather a group of men who have been emotionally upset by a woman one time too many, so when a bout of misogyny sets in, one of them sets up a group of men (limit 7) who wish to live in a world without women, and will go to any means to achieve this.<br /><br />As we all know the queen sets a hunter out after Snow white who escapes into the woods and finds her way to the dwarfs' cottage and...well we all know the story, but this version is filled with it's own twists and turns.<br /><br />Many of the jokes are amusing if not downright hilarious such as remodeling the house to accommodate for Snow white, when Bubi holds the saw, and 2 other dwarfs slide the wood back and forth, or when Speedy tastes what he believes is Cookie's latest dish, only to find out it's actually a can of pink paint; oh, and let's not forget the mushrooms ;). But some of the jokes are not so funny, as others have mentioned there's the Jager/Neger joke, then there's the shooting of the fanfare musicians (would it be funny if someone really did it?) The scene when the dwarfs first meet Snow white isn't entirely a bad thing, although it's probably not appropriate for a younger audience who the original story is directed at. The RSPCA wouldn't approve of the way Tscheko treats Brutus, not to mention Bubi's song which fortunately is interrupted at just the right moment. And most intriguing of all the violence against women. I must admit it is kind of funny in a very twisted kind of way, but at a subtle level it gives the impression that it's okay for men to hit women, even in the most dubious of circumstances, considering that Snow white does actually provoke Tscheko to hit her.<br /><br />Still most of us can probably overlook these unpleasant moments to watch the movie.
