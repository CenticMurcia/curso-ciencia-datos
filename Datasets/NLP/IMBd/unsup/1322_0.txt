The film is telling a story from Turkey in a difficult time slice and place. The time is 1982 and place is Adiyaman from less developed portion of Turkey. Story is using local musicians who are earning their life from night entertainments or from weddings, as a tool to develop around. Scenario is convincing well and many details such as small things, objects, and clothes are perfectly reflecting that time and that place. This is together with the correct dialogs developed between local people and officers, giving a highly realistic atmosphere to the movie. In spite of some accent errors, cast is successful as well.<br /><br />The mood of the film has a spectrum from comedy to tragedy like their life itself. The peak comedy scene in cemetery is really better than many comedy movie, and the last scene showing the changed world after years are really tragedy, or black comedy. Old and fat but congenial singers who are derived from other cities to sing in the nightclub are playing the timeless philosophic minds of such situations.<br /><br />To avoid any spoiler, I will not tell in details but the final public meeting scene and unusual events in the meeting are not realistic. This portion is the only faulty portion of the movie. This is not a masterpiece but a movie not to miss.
