I was psyched to see this movie, and I was highly entranced in this film until the BIG twist, which not only lame, but threw out any emotion towards or for any of the characters. See this movie only to see how well a thriller can be done, and how important it is not to go the cheap way and go for a big shock, that destroys characters rather than makes your jaw drop in awe. This is a film that could've been brilliant if the writers of the script had used their brains.
