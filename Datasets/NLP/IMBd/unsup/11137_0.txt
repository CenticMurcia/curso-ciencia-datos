Lindsay Lohan was cute as a kid and as a teen, but personally, I didn't think she was that good. As she grew up, I think she became a better actress. Life-Size is probably above average. I used to hate it and think it was really lame, bad plot, blah, blah, blah, but after reading all the comments on the first page, it really got me thinking. <br /><br />The plot IS original yet simple. <br /><br />Tyra Banks DID do a fantastic job as Eve. <br /><br />The movie WAS pretty funny. <br /><br />Now I've realized that the movie was good and the actors all did a good job.
