I'm giving this film a awful score. It's entertaining to watch just because it is that bad. There is a scene in the movie where the main character is being made fun of at baseball try outs. He rushes as the kid making fun of him. The one kid sidesteps him and than everyone on the baseball team throws baseballs at him. It's honestly funny only because it would never happen in real life. The coaches would have stepped in a long time ago. If you choose to watch this movie that scene is why you should do it. Other than that is a simply bad movie half fantasy and half real life with unrealistic scenes mixed in. Making it totally unbelievable. But totally worth watching for it's suckyness
