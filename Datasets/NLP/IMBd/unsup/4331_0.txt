This movie does not work. <br /><br />Making a movie featuring over-the-top cartoon violence CAN work, but only if you never slip out of cartoon mode. A part drama/part cartoon is not going to work. You can't, for example, make a scene with a little kid having a touching conversation with a lonely homeless woman and immediately follow it up with wacky cartoon antics. When you do that, your movie stops being funny and becomes extremely disturbing.<br /><br />In the first "Home Alone," Kevin only seemed interested in maiming the villains; in this one he is apparently trying to kill them. Case in point: the scene where he is throwing bricks at Marv's head. Not dropping them, but actually THROWING them at the guy's face. From this point on Kevin turns into some sort of demon child on par with the kid from "Pet Sematary" as he tries burning, electrocuting, and cracking open the skulls of his victims while shouting things like, "Nice night for a neck injury!" (He actually says that). The thought of a theater full of young children laughing at two men being brutally tortured for half an hour really creeps me out.<br /><br />The only possible reason to watch this is for Tim Curry, one of the world's greatest actors and who steals every scene he's in, but otherwise it's a waste of time.
