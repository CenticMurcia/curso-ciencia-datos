The reason why 10 points are appropriate: Eva Pawlik is starring not only as a figure skater, but also as an actress. I have not known anything about Pawlik but my grand-parents told me about her extraordinarily marvellous appearances in the programmes of the Vienna Ice Revue that played for Berlin six weeks a year in the fifties and that was well-known all over the world at that time. I am a musician. So I saw Pawlik´s dancing in "Frühling auf dem Eis" from a musician´s point of view. Every spin, every slight moving is in perfect harmony with the music. Though I am not even twenty years of age, I can imagine that the audience was thrilled by Pawlik´s skating.
