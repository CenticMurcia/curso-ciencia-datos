I still can't describe this story in few words, is one of those one in a life time experience, its very short but great, you have not a full, crude view of any relationship or the bonds among characters but everything is there. I think what you get at the end is: 'we should say what we have in mind every time we have the chance'. The characters were great Ohad Knoller (Yossi) is amazing, you see feeling like it was real in every move, and Yehuda Levi (Jagger)is even better. Some of the characters are not well defined the two girls for example but you fell for them anyway. Ofir and his love, Yaniv and his dream, really great!! at the end you'll understand why a picture can make you cry.<br /><br />this is one of those movies that you'll enjoy in a night after a long day of boring life.
