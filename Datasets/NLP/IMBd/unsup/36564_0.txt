i really enjoyed the original Tremors.it worked on a lot of levels.unfortunately,this sequel doesn't.it seems to be mostly played for camp value,but i don't think it works very well.i found it very mostly very slow and boring.there were a few almost amusing moments,but overall,it was a disappointment.Kevin Bacon passed on this one,and it's easy to see why.he must have read the script.Fred Ward is back,but without Bacon,he his character just doesn't work as well.Michael Gross returns,and doesn't have much too do.also,i thought the dialogue was pretty cringe worthy at times.plus,the movie isn't really original.in fact it borrows heavily from another big movie that had come out a few years ago.i've seen worse movies,but this one still ranks as a major disappointment.for me,Tremors 2 is a 4/10.
