I enjoy watching all types of Bollywood and Indian films, from the serious (Monsoon Wedding, Fire) to the epic (Veer-Zaara, Lagaan) to the lightweight (Chalte Chalte, No Entry). I expected this film to fall into the last category and to be entertained. I was not. I couldn't wait for the film to end. It began with some pretentious speeches by Abhishek Bachchan's character about rebelling against the community's expectations of its youth. Other than that, the film tries to amusing and seriously believes itself to be. It relies heavily on the good looks of its stars, the aforementioned Abhishek and Rani Mukherjee. Essentially the plot revolves around the characters of Abhishek and Rani traveling around Indian pulling heists of various sizes and living it up. None of the heists are interesting (certainly not in an "Ocean's 11" kind of way) at all, and the musical numbers in the film are... well so boring I can't remember a single one. The soundtrack is also terrible. I listened to it before I watched the film, and absolutely hated it! Amitabh Bachchan also stars, and while I can't really criticize his performance, his role is terribly flat. The film is too bland to be truly terrible, however I will still give it a rating of a "2" for wasting so much talent (Rani and Amitabh) and for going nowhere with what could have been an interesting premise.
