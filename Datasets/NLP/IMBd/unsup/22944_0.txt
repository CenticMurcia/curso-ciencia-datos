Murder By Television is one of Bela Lugosi's more obscure movies but at least it is available on video and DVD. I quite liked this.<br /><br />While doing a worldwide broadcast promoting that new invention called television, a man suddenly collapses and looks as if he could have had a heart attack. His death was certainly not caused by his heart, it seems he was murdered by a death ray. The police are put on the case and there are plenty of suspects...<br /><br />This is a nice little horror/mystery, even though a little short at under an hour.<br /><br />Watch it if you get the chance. <br /><br />Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
