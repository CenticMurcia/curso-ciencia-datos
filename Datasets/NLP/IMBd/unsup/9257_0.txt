Mr. Olbermann is smart, witty and funny.<br /><br />He provides an alternative voice to the right wing domination that has lasted for years in the media.<br /><br />Straight shooting, fresh, sharp and antagonistic against the Plutocrats that have seized our nation.<br /><br />Lacking demagoguery, and the mythic trash that comes from the propagandized news from conservative opinions.<br /><br />I enjoy Mr. Olbermann, and look forward to seeing him on other news venues. I feel he is the most interesting news person that has evolved in many years.
