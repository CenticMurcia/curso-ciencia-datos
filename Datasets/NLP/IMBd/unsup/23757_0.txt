I heard about this title from a friend of mine who was really into international (especially Indian) film. I never bothered to look at previews for it, because a) she's really hot and b) I figured the title was self-explanatory.<br /><br />I showed up to the movie theater with my bong as an homage to the combination of good looking girls and my own deep connection to my bong. Unfortunately, there wasn't a bong in the film. Not even a bong with a "For tobacco use only" sign. I was crushed. Had it not been for the gorgeous Peeya Rai Chowdhary shapely suppleness, I would have walked out on my friend and the movie.<br /><br />Another thing that bothered me was that this story told lies about Apu. I saw the episode where they explain his family history and how he earned a PhD. He doesn't even enter the Kwik-E-Mart or say his signature "Thank you, come again" line <br /><br />Obviously, I hated this movie. I wish I could sue the film-makers for false advertising and racism because they really make Indians look bad in this film. Still, I'll give it a 2 because it was catatonic enough to get my hot friend there to make-out with me.<br /><br />Indian movies should be reviewed by IMDb and receive a 7.5 rating with at least 2000 votes before being released stateside. In fact, all movies should go through process. Especially if they are lacking in bongs. Thank you.
