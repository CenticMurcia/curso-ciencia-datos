This is one of my favourite videos in my collection. Jon English is fantastic as the Pirate King, and Simon Gallaher, Helen Donaldson and Derek Metzger all perform outstandingly. With great comedy and audience interaction thrown in, it is a joy to watch over and over again. I only wish I'd been able to see the show live!
