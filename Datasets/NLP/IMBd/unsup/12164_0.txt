I usually have no interest in this kind of film, and if I compared it to mainstream cinema I'd give it about 2 stars. But this film is all about presenting what is truly one of the Wonders of the Modern World, Shannon Whirry.<br /><br />We all have our preferences, of course, and I wouldn't expect mine to match anyone else's (although the film sold well enough to justify sequels), but for those of you with tastes like mine this is a Don't Miss It Under Any Circumstances opportunity.<br /><br />I understand Ms. Whirry is doing "legit" theater now. I hope she's finding success and earning appreciation for her other talents as well. Thank you, Ms. Whirry, for being unforgettable.
