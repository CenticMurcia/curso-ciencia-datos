It seems to be the case these days that successful movies require a sequel. Unfortunately, the sequel is never as good, and quite often spoils the original to an extent. This is better than some sequels, but it just can't compare to the original. The biggest problem is the songs: unlike the original, they seem unnecessary, detracting rather than enhancing the film; every song they played, I was just waiting for it to finish. The only point of the songs in this one is to emphasise a point and there were far too many. Another surprise for me was hearing of Simba's daughter; I seem to recall him having a son at the end of the Lion King I, based on the assumption that 'he' was gold and all the lionesses were brown.<br /><br />Pumbaa and Timon were fooled too! This is not so bad as it allows for a different plot from the first.<br /><br />Another matter I can't understand is, where did the outlanders come from? In the LK1, Scar was certainly alone with only the hyenas to support him; if the outlanders had existed then, wouldn't they have helped him too? I guess they needed new characters to liven things up, and true, they did generate some interest. The plot was OK, I suppose. But I've no great desire to watch it again. 4/10
