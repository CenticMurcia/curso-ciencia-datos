This movie is about as serious as 'Dude Where's My Car?' or 'Dumb and Dumber', if you didn't like those then you won't like this. On the other hand, if you have an open mind and like 'stupid comedy' films then you are in for a treat.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is pretty good for the most part, Jamie Kennedy is extremly talented at being a homie g and he never lets up. I also liked some of the familiar faces I saw, like Anthony Anderson who plays an actor in this film and Kal Penn(the arab guy from National Lampoon's Van Wilder) as another homie g... they really helped make this movie worth watching.<br /><br />All in all, I'd say this was pretty damned good for a lower budget film. A must rent movie, unless you're a boring old sourpuss.<br /><br />I'll give it 8/10
