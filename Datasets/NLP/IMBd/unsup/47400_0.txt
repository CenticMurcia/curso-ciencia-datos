Realistically, how could a successful man who has a beautiful and sexually available wife, two children and a great home, decide to sleep with a stranger and have the audacity to come home without taking a shower? Realistically, how could this woman turn out to be the sister-in law of this man's best friend. Realistically, how could these two hook up again, and then find their respective spouses going at it less than 20 feet away? Come on!!! This movie is a great example of bad filmmaking. People in the socio-economic strata displayed in the film just don't engage in acts worthy of the "Jerry Springer Show." The film takes what could have been a viable premise and makes it into nothing but a laughable farce. Ming-Na Wen's first love scene is a complete joke. What is she supposed to be a coxswain? Give her a megaphone so she can yell 'Stoke! Stroke! Stroke! Stroke!' What a bad film.
