Tom the cat is golfing quite horrible, in my humble opinion, and when he finally does manage to miraculously actually get the ball in the hole Jerry the mouse is there to continually pop it out again. This of course infuriates the poor cat. So Tom captures him and uses him as a tee hoping to improve his game. Of course wacky madcap hijinx ensue. This was a fairly amusing short and it was great to see Tom getting some rather good hits in on Jerry, which it seems seldom happened. This great short cartoon can be found on disc one of the Spotlight collection DVD of "Tom & Jerry" <br /><br />My Grade: A-
