The only reason i rented this movie was because of the cute looking girl on the cover. If I had known, what I know now, not too judge a book/film by its cover, i would just have rented one of the LoTR movies again. I'm not the kind who dislikes movies just because they are unrealistic.. but this is just too much!<br /><br />I think the main reason why this movie is so awful is because of the direction. With a decent director, Azumi could even have bin watchable... but alas, it was not meant to be!<br /><br />Clothes look ridiculous... the action scenes try to be like crouching tiger but look more like a b-movie from the 70's. Story.... what story??<br /><br />The extra star is for the girl who plays Azumi. Not because she's a good actress or anything.. but because she's just so damn cute!
