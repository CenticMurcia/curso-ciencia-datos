I almost forgot about this show and I really wish I had completely forgotten about it because Punched Up was horrible! I hope that they destroyed/erased/burned/buried the tapes of this show because it was so awful I can't even believe it. Who at the comedy channel puts these shows on TV? Whoever is making these important decisions needs to have their head examined and should have been fired a long time ago, unless they have been firing people in which case look at your hiring process because you keep hiring people who don't know how to pick a good TV show and obviously do not have a single idea of what is funny. I gave up on this channel a long time ago but still see pieces of shows when I flip by and they are all terrible except for the reruns which they can't really take credit for. Punched Up had people pretending to do a "reality" show and helping out "real" people with their problems, but the main problem was that the show was not at all funny.
