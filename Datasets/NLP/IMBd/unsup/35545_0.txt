An inane movie, full of late 20th Century stereotypes of 'men finding themselves in war', no comprehension of the contemporary reality. Most of the action scenes are implausible, the only truly chilling moment is the out-take of a real B-17 going down out of control. You can't fake this. Plagiarised poetry familiar to any reasonably well read person, inventing 'in flight surgery', sex in operational aircraft.............oh dear!<br /><br />See Wyler's 'real' documentary, at least he put his life on the line filming it.<br /><br />And do as as I was fortunate enough to do, get inside a B-17. Unpressurised, thin duralumin skin that yields to finger pressure, the young men who flew these craft were true heroes.<br /><br />For those of you in the States find a Veteran and ask him about the truth, while there is still time?
