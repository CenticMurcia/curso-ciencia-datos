I strongly don't recommend this movie unless your a fan of the 70's porno genre.It is quite tame by today's standard,but the plot is just as incoherent as the modern porn plot.Barbara Broadcast is a author who takes tricks on the side because its so much fun!She is not that bad looking of a lady,kind of like a Julieann Moore type.Only thing is she is not nearly as attractive.Attractiveness is not found at all in this movie,plastic surgery wasn't as relevant as it is now.A guy could probably see better looking girls at his local watering hole.There is a dude who has a cool porno mustache that was amusing.If going to the XXX movie theater's remind you of the gold old days than see this movie.Than seek help.
