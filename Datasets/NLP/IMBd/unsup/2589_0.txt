I don't often remember most movies beyond a year or so - if that - but for some reason this movie that I saw as a 14 year old has stayed with me all these years. In searching for that movie on the web, I came across this site and the comments made by another fan. I was struck by her saying how this movie has "haunted her" since she saw it when she was about the same age as I was! Interesting that it had the same effect on us both. I remember that Robert Stack and Lauren Bacall did a convincing, significant job in their roles and made me want to see them in every thing else I could after that. The movie was very touching, and I could imagine what it would be like to be in their shoes. One scene in the movie was Lauren reflecting on her situation, looking out an upstairs window onto the garden -- I can still picture it after all these years. How I would love to see that movie again!!
