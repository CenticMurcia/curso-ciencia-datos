Edith Wharton wrote in a brilliantly minor key, and it is a testament<br /><br />to Martin Scorsese's genius as a filmmaker that he disciplined<br /><br />himself to work within Wharton's parameters, instead of trying to<br /><br />force his trademark kinetic style onto a story of tragic whispering. A<br /><br />beautiful, heartfelt film, with a superb performance from Daniel<br /><br />Day-Lewis(really, what else could you expect?).
