I never felt really bad for the actors when something bad happened to them... the soundtrack sounds like a B-Movie with Dolf Lundgreen. Anyway This movie is spiked with a lot B-Actors who are actually better actors than the average but can't really match up their role. Not even one in there is close to be believed as a mafioso...<br /><br />*** Minor Spoiler*** Not even Vince who is portrayed as a hard mafioso boss (actually the son of the major boss).. he just looks like a normal thug and is not really able to frighten a 6 year old... Actually he looks (and acts) like a normal Italian family father who's into soccer ;). *** Minor Spoiler End***<br /><br />Anyway the movie is OK for an evening to watch, although the story is predictable, (very) hardly believable and the Acting is not really good. So it gets 4 out of 10. Which is average, not more but not less. Watch this if you are done with all the sopranos, godfather, scarface and what not mafioso movies. But if you have the choice take this movie as the last one.
