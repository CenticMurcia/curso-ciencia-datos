Continuing my valiant quest to watch every film Steve Buscemi has ever been in I haplessly stumbled upon this god-awful waste of 80 minutes. The plot is awful, the dialogue is poor, the acting is dreadful (even Buscemi's 3min role is pointless with no real relevance to the story)-I can only assume they needed the money-and to top it all it looks like that the whole thing was shot by a 7 year old after sneaking out in the middle of the night. It is truly one of the worst films I have ever seen. If you seriously need a Uma fix then watch Kill Bill again-hell even watch the Avengers or Batman and Robin-at least they were so bad they are laughable unlike this piece of crap.<br /><br />Don't even bother-trust me.
