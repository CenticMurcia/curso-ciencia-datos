This is an all time fav, own it, watch it all the time. During a recent replay of the DVD, something occurred to me that has somewhat diminished my view of the female character, Lu (Julie Warner). Early on in the movie, Ben Stone stumbles out of his cabin after dreaming of a beautiful woman bathing in water, and lo - there's a nude Lu surfacing and making 'first contact' with him. After getting to know the town's characters, the viewer learns that 'nobody can poop without everybody knowing what color it is,' or something to that effect. Lu would've known of Ben Stone's arrival in Grady, of where he was staying, and may have planned and had an eye out for when he made his way out of that cabin. It's hard to believe she could've stayed underwater ALL that time, and then surfaced at just the right moment (unless she had an oxygen tank under the surface!) In a later scene when Ben 'walks, runs' to her home late at night, the viewer learns there must be some distance between the two homes. Did Lu swim over to Ben's that morning, or drive specifically to the area just to emerge, nude, in his presence? That sorta spoils it for me now, but Doc Hollywood is still a good, clean and romantic view of a small-town romance.
