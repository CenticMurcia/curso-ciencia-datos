Macho jack of all trades Axel McGregor (Donald Pleasence) whose past gigs have included test pilot, race car driver, and writer, hunts a lethal black leopard in the jungles of Thailand. When the beast gets the drop on him, he becomes despondent over his fear, so when it actually gets captured, he lets it go just so he can hunt it again and exact some sort of vengeance for being humbled so badly. This, just as his estranged daughters Leslie and Georgia (Nancy Kwan and Jennifer Rhodes) arrive for a visit, with Georgias' daughter Peggy (Lesly Fine) and local tour bus operator Ross (Ross Hagen) in tow.<br /><br />This material had some potential, and it does have some atmosphere going for it. That said, I don't think it's particularly well made, well written, or well acted. (Although Hagen is very amiable and it's a hoot to see Pleasence really go off his rocker here.) The leopards' stalking scenes aren't bad, but the actual attack scenes left something to be desired. This is never as scary or as suspenseful as I would have liked; it's basically watchable, but barely so.<br /><br />Location shooting in Thailand helps, anyway. The photography is decent enough and the music sometimes effective. But this plodding movie ended up leaving me wanting more.<br /><br />4/10
