While I'll freely admit that in many cases, watching a film as an in-flight movie is not going to give you the best from it, I'll make an exception for this film.<br /><br />I watched this film at 35,000ft on a return flight from the Canary Islands, and this was by far the best way to see it. In fact I *recommend* this method.<br /><br />Without even the benefit of the soundtrack, I had figured out within about 10 minutes what was going to happen.<br /><br />The best points of the film are the reworking of the classic idea of chase scenes through the years that have been shot in San Francisco. I you watch this film for anything, let it be that. Otherwise, drop your hard-earned cash on something more intelligent.
