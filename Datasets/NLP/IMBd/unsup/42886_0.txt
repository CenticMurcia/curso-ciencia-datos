I really wanted to like "Night of the Howling Beast," or "Werewolf Vs. the Yeti" as it's called in the uncut version. Unfortunately, the filmmakers manipulated us into thinking this film was going to be more about Daninsky and the Yeti's battle. It was not. Once again, we get Waldemar Daninsky being bitten by a werewolf while on an expedition in Tibet. After he disappears, his colleagues follow his trail to Tibet where most of them are wiped out by bandits and an evil sorceress and her equally evil sorcerer lover. This leads to a fight between the sorceress and sorcerer, that leads up to the "climactic" battle between Daninsky (in his werewolf form) and the elusive Yeti of the Himalayas.<br /><br />The battle between both was unintentionally funny, and had me clutching my sides from too much laughter. Unfortunately, it was too brief to leave a long, satisfying effect on the audience.<br /><br />The rest of the film is what you would expect of a Waldemar Daninsky werewolf flick. Paul Naschy once again, playing his tortured character who does nothing but whine about his condition, and the quintessential female lead who loves Waldemar unconditionally.<br /><br />The bonuses include a couple of decent gory deaths (a woman who's back is skinned by the evil sorceress, being the most memorable one), and the competent photography that perfectly captures the beautiful locations. Paul Naschy, of course, delivers a competent performance as the tortured Waldemar Daninsky, and Juliet Mills (Beyond the Door) does quite well as Waldemar's love interest. Their chemistry is really the only thing that keeps the story moving along.<br /><br />Overall, NIGHT OF THE HOWLING BEAST is nothing new. It's the same Waldemar Daninsky story but with a new setting. Paul Naschy fans should enjoy this nonetheless, others will feel extremely disappointed. It would have been much better if they had focused a tad bit longer on the battle scene between Daninsky and the Yeti.<br /><br />A word of warning. It is extremely RARE and almost impossible to come by, especially in its Super Video release. You can acquire a legitimate bootleg copy of it on horrortheatervideo.com for fairly cheap. Check it out only if you are a Naschy completionist.
