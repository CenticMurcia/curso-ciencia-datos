This was a spooky movie of someone trying to relive certain childhood experiences and the other trying to block them. It was really tense and creepy. I didn't care for the homosexual twists and conclusions; it could have been quite good without going into that territory. We all have childhood experimental experiences. I don't think most are gay ones, though. This ruined the flick for me, although I'm not really homophobic or have any particular stand on that topic. I just didn't care to get pulled there in this manner. Just beware.
