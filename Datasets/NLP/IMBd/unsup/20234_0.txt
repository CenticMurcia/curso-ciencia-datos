I watched the movie many, many times after buying the DVD. It is inspiring and every time I see it I never get tired of it. I recommend the soundtrack. This movie is very lively. I loved it, and don't know who wouldn't. A movie about people who rise no matter what the circumstances, or challenges in their life, mostly young people. The people in the movie, show the inside of krumping, and clowning. My favorite characters for clowning are Tommy the clown, Larry, Black, Swoop, Little momma, and Big X. My favorite characters for krumping are Lil C, Tight Eyes, Miss Prissy, Baby Tight Eyes, Daisy, and Dragon. Go by the DVD!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />RIZE!
