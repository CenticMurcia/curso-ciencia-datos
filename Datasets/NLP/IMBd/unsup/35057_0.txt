After hearing so many glowing reviews, I was surprised how unpleasant this movie was. Unpleasant in a bad way. I did NOT find Buck to be all that endearing; I found him to be a really creepy jerk. I was not charmed by his arrested adolescence. I did not feel sorry for him because his affection for Chuck was not returned in kind. Yes, I've been in his situation, but I've never stalked anybody or insinuated myself into their lives. I found nothing to like about this movie.
