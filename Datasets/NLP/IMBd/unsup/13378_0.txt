This exceptionally well made, independently produced film is a heart warming tribute to the human spirit. The production team of Mitch Davis, John Corbett, and Gerry Molen(the Oscar winning producer of Schindler's list) are to be commended for the excellent job of presenting this story. It's refreshing to see economic success come for a family centered movie.<br /><br />The special effects in the hurricane scenes were as good as any big budget movie production, yet maintained their focus on the central characters in the film. I hope to see more from this talented production team in the future.
