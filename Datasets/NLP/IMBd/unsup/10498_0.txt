***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** Where, o where are the kids movies that don't have "evil villians"? How could Elmo, of all characters, be in a movie with such a nasty villian ..stealing his blanket away and making fun of him. I watch Elmo's World 5 days a week with my kids (4 and 2) and I must admit that I find the 15 minute episodes to be very well done. From Mr. Noodle to Dorothy the whole thing is all about "can-do" preschoolers.<br /><br />So, why, in this TERRIBLE movie would they create this very unnatural dependency that Elmo has on his blanket? Elmo no longer is the encouraging fun loving muppet . .but he is a panicked, insecure, selfish muppet. The opening 5 minutes are joyless, despite all the Sesame Street favorites being put in every frame in each shot. The people are particularly bad. What would possess any of these talented educators to make such a movie? I could sense the "this is a bad idea but I have to honor my contract" in every single performance by the Sesame Street regulars.<br /><br />My daughter was in absolute tears when the blanket got taken away . .and why not? The movie has just branded on to your brain that Elmo must NEVER be seperated from his blanket. So, why in the name of all things good and innocent, would the movies writers, directors, and producers IMMEDIATELY take away his blanket and thrust it into the hands of an evil person who towers over the muppets? This is sadistic film making at its worst . ..ELMO IS FOR PRE-SCHOOLERS!<br /><br />Huxley, the greedy villian (who is tagged on the packagin with the innocent sounding "doesn't like to share") is very ominous, and taunts Elmo with the blanket and makes fun of his tears. Unbelievable.<br /><br />I didn't get past this part as my daughter was in sobs at this point . .and despite my fast forwarding to the end to show her that Elmo gets his Blanket back . . I could do little to save the evening.<br /><br />While I fast forwarded I could see that the rest of the movie was filled with threats, intimidation, and flat out picking on little defenseless kids. Muppets in cages!!!??? OUTRAGEOUS!!!<br /><br />The makers of this movie should be ashamed of themselves for violating the spirit of Elmo and Sesame Street for creating a movie that will certainly scare little ones and make them cry.<br /><br />This is a poorly written, ill-concieved bit of film making. "Grouchland" is indeed smelly and trashy . . .and so is this movie.<br /><br />
