Usually in a film if the acting or writing is bad, it's just boring or unfulfilling, or so stupid it's funny. In Merlin's case, it was painful to watch. I have never been so disappointed in a movie. I did not have particularly high expectations for a TV movie, but I do like the Arthurian legends, and this movie was a butchery. Particularly annoying were Helena Bonham Carter, Miranda Richardson, and of course, Martin Short. Sam Neill did do a reasonable, but not memorable, job.<br /><br />The Dungeons & Dragons movie, while bad, at least had some redeeming scenes and characters.
