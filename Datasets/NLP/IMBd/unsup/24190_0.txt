It's an ode for good teachers! It's a film that asks you to slow down and inhale the best scents of life's memories quoting Cicero's line about actors leaving the stage quietly after achieving their best! It's a film that brings to mind Mazursky's "Harry and Tonto" and Bruce Beresford's "Tender Mercies".<br /><br />The story is great and performances real. Maureen O'Hara in her eighties is really wonderful to look at (compare her withered hands to her great face) and to hear. Her enunciation of spoken English is a treat for the ears.<br /><br />The film is more of a play on film but the editing is so smooth that you feel one scene weaves in to the next. The film does not stun you but endears you psychologically. The film involved the work of three writers at three stages. Probably Beth Polson had much to do with making the story good for cinema, may be it was Dalene Young. The film is great because of the contribution of three good writers, a charming Maureen O'Hara and fine editing. The direction of Kevin Dowling and the cinematography of Larry Reibman, though not outstanding, was above average.<br /><br />
