Even my kids thought it was trash. This movie stinks. I rented it from Blockbuster as it was the only snowboarder movie (fiction) I could find. But my snowboarding son is watching and I can tell he is not impressed. The acting is bad (I mean Jim Varney is the Draw?) and the storyline weak. Stay away from this movie unless you like to smirk and groan and sleep. You could maybe get the snowboarding extreme sports videos otherwise. Don't waster your time with this movie. Stay Away! Stay Away! I need to have 10 lines of text. ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ. Is that enough? No - I need to add more. Blah! Blah? Blah. Blah!! Blah?? Blah....
