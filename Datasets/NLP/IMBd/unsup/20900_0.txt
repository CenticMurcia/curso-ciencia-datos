The few parts where this movie is somehow mildly funny are totally outdominated by the fact that it is criminally unrealistic. If you get the idea that what happens in this plot is therapy, or might actually work as a therapy, you're out of your mind... if anything this would be the best way to drive somebody completely insane. The only reason this illogic, unfunny, pointless, storyless crap sometimes gets good criticism is the fact that there are some good actors in it... It's just a really cheap idea, not even a new one, splattered across way too much time and resulting in a ridiculous, totally made-up ending that is impossible to believe if you got some sort of a brain...
