This was the first bollywood movie i ever saw, and it's still one of the tops on my list. If you are rating the film based on its historical accuracy, its a complete flop. and, honestly, i was a little disappointed in the ending...or lack of....but either way i love the music, cinematography, and everything else. Shahrukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor have great chemistry together...Kareena is really a great actress when she isn't playing a dumb ditz (such as in K3G....). And Rahul Dev is pretty good too.<br /><br />If this movie weren't "based on the life of Asoka", I think it would have been a lot better. But It it is still totally worth watching.
