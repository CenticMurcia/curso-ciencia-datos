One night a group of friends, more or less go out for a night on the town in New York City. This low budget film explore their lives and where they are going in life. There are four main characters: There is Tom, an aspiring actor, Willie, a welfare case always insisting the white man is keeping him down, Fernando, a Puerto Rican womanizer who passes himself as Italian, and Johnny, a neighborhood supermarket employee who knows there is something better.<br /><br />These four people go out on the town and run into various people, problems, but this night proves to be something different from every other night they go out. This movie is so good because it manages to be funny while having some real good points. The acting here is excellent and the script is excellent. <br /><br />The characters all are realistic. Johnny, seems to be a real nice guy, and seems to be the nicest out of all of them. Tom is the second nicest to me, as he tries to do the right thing, but sometimes is a little sidetracked. Willie is a decent man who hasn't yet learned to get off his ass and work, while Fernando, who tries to pass for Italian is a straight up prick. <br /><br />The movie looks at so many issues, from education, to ethnicity. There are many different things this movie talks about, and there is not a happy ending, something that is pretty cool. It just kind of ends, and you really don't know where it goes after the ending, well you do and you don't. The movie is unique like that. <br /><br />Overall this is an excellent low budget movie with a lot to offer. The movie is all acting too, no violence or elaborate action sequences, making this movie nice and quaint. The movie has a lot to offer and I recommend it highly.
