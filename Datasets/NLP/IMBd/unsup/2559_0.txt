When you watch a movie and you find yourself thinking about it days later...i believe thats a sign that the movie you have seen was a good one....and thats what happened when i saw this movie.<br /><br />I have not seen a darker movie than this for some time....maybe not ever...but as well as the darkness, Dead Mans Shoes also offers some extremely poignant and moving moments I think the acting performances from all involved are first class...but paddy considine is a cut above that. The dialogue in the movie and the way he handles it has me watching in awe......the way he talks to his brother and the fact he seems to have so much love and patience with him....is even more amazing when you see how crazy and precise, the character of richard is.<br /><br />As my title suggests...i don't know why, but some of this movie brought memories of taxi driver to me....a character that has passed a point here he cannot go back from.....and that comparison shows what a good movie this is
