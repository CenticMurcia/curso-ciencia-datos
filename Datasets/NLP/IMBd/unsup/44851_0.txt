If you've seen one of Wishman's "movies", you've pretty much seen them all. Although I wasn't expecting much, Amazing Transplant has the same slow pacing, dull characters, monotone setting, sub-par directing, etc. that characterizes much of her films.<br /><br />A man goes around entering homes of women, strips their clothes, rapes, and then kills them. It's the same thing over and over again. If the women were prettier and the soft-core scenes more arousing, I would forgive much of the shortcomings of the plot and acting. But this movie just drags. I do have to say the penis transplant towards the end was unintentionally hilarious.<br /><br />The ending doesn't make any sense. As a matter of fact, almost nothing makes any sense. Don't waste your time watching this. There are better things to do with your life. Amazing Transplant certainly lives up to it's billing from Something Weird.
