The story of "Hellraiser:Hellworld" revolves around a group of teens who receive invitations through a Hellraiser website to attend a Hellworld party.They then find themselves in a huge mansion party with plenty of sex and booze.The party is hosted by the Lance Henriksen character.Then one by one the gang start to die at the hands of Pinhead and the Cenobites at the urging of the host,who apparently has a hidden score to settle with each of the teens."Hellraiser:Hellworld" is a crappy teen slasher flick with little bit of gore and sex thrown in.The characters are obnoxious and stupid and the action moves at snail's pace.Pinhead is used sparingly and his dialogue sucks.The direction by Rick Bota is uninspired and the script by Joel Soisson is extremely predictable.Like "Hellraiser:Deader","Hellword" is beyond bad and even Henriksen's great performance can't save the film.3 out of 10.
