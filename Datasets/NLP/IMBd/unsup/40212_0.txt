Okay this movie was just plain awful. The plot is rediculous, The jokes aren't funny, and as for the acting well, the star of the movie is Joey Lawrance, enough said. I did however enjoy this movie because my friends and I just mocked it so horribally. Thats really all this movie is good for. You don't even have to be particularly clever or witty to do this either, the movie pretty much mocks itself. I can't imagine how incredibally boring it would be to watch this movie by yourself.
