When I saw "The Doughgirls" was coming on TV, I re-read the comments of the critics, and somehow could not believe that they could find anything comical or clever about it. Let me start with the dialogue, without a shadow of a doubt, it had to be the worst heard in any , supposedly, A movie for years. <br /><br />For stars such as Ann Sheridan and Alexis Smith to have to utter the crap served up to them must have been repulsive to them - while Ann overacts as she has never done before or after. Everything Jane Wyman said was typical of the kind of roles that Warners served up to her in many movies for years, and Jack Carson was his usual goof. As for the role played by one of my Favourites, Eve Arden - I felt embarrassed watching it. Truly, most of the cast deserved so much better. This film was a stinkeroo of the worst kind!
