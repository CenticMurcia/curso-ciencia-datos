A Fine Movie, but lacking in story... A puzzle-box movie, similar to rather Butterfly Effect than Memento.<br /><br />Mostly it turns you on in the beginning, sliding through the story, keeping you thinking - when starts the thrill. Some good moments - similar to the Butterfly Effect.<br /><br />Sarah Polley reminded me her next movie - My Life Without Me - all the time. It's a pity. Ryan Philippe though had his best presentation yet. <br /><br />Still worth a look. Liked characters, and it had some style. Not all the answers will be answered, but still most of the points it lost are due to the ending...
