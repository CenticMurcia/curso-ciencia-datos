Why would an intelligent, well-educated, middle-aged woman like this movie? It's inexplicable, but I did. I don't know if it's because I watched it an hour after slamming my finger in the car door and I had cried myself into heaves and needed something to laugh at. Or perhaps it was because I am a fan of the majority of the movies that Scary 4 spoofs and I took them a little too seriously at the time. Whatever the reason, I laughed a lot during this movie, and while I'm ashamed to tell any of my friends that I liked it, I'm telling you. <br /><br />The great thing about the Scary movies franchise is that they do an exceptional job of copying the original, with some very good special effects that I'm sure cost a fraction of the real ones. They also draw on some great comedic acting talents, which always strikes me as a bit bizarre, but then maybe someone on the producer's team is a great salesman. Whatever the tricks behind the scenes, it works on screen. Are the jokes dumb and predictable? Yes. Is there more potty humour than necessary? Absolutely. Still, it's fun low-brow humour.
