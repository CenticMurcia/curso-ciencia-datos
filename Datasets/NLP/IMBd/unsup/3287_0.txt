Don't be fooled by the stylish DVD cover. You will regret it!!! This movie was annoying to say the least. ZERO action. Breathtaking my eyeball! The lead character was never out of breath except when he ran out of cigarettes. I don't remember him even running a single time. He was never in a hurry to get anywhere. I saw one machine gun the whole movie and it was being carried by a soldier in town. No one fired at the main character. No one even came near him with a gun. So why is the rifle the most prominent image on the DVD cover?!?!!?<br /><br />I got tired of hearing that terrorist on the other end of the phone line after about 10 minutes too. Tell me please how on earth he could see him EVERYWHERE and ANYWHERE. If the terrorist on the phone walked everywhere the lead character did, then why on earth didn't the terrorist just do the job? Silly plot line.<br /><br />The only thing this movie is good for is for its National Geographic-like shots of the slum-filled Philippines. I now know that I would never want to waste my money visiting that country. It's an absolute wreck!
