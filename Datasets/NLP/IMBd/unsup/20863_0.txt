The first time you watch Little Britain, you will be laughing so hard and will keep on laughing for the next half hour. What Little Britain failed to do though was to actually create new jokes, instead favouring the use of the jokes from the first episode all the way through to the 2nd series, and 3rd if there is one.<br /><br />Without doubt it is a very funny stereotypical drama on British people, and was very funny, but what they failed to do and cheaply did was reuse the same jokes over and over again, and by the 4th episode, it gets so incredibly dull I could have more fun watching paint dry for that half hour.<br /><br />In conclusion, great comedy at first, but due to same jokes being used over and over again, becomes in overwhelmingly bored.
