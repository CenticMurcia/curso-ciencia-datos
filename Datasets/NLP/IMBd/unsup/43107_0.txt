It's not great. The film is made up of real, judiciously edited footage and specially filmed sequences. There are talking heads - a speechwriter, head of the divisional FBI and the duty head of the Secret Service. They help narrate the story, emote and get interpolated (clumsily) in the footage with Bush.<br /><br />I was expecting the bulk of the film to explore what happens politically in the vacuum Bush's death creates. It's a gross missed opportunity that the film degenerates into a whodunnit with all the usual suspects. As a result one sees that the only reason the film was made was to indulge someone's fantasy of disposing with Bush and make the consequent point about the folly of invading Iraq. Again. 2/10
