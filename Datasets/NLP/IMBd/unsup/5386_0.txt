In Argentina we have seen many Americans shows, but really lately the Canadians don't have nothing that envy to the Americans. Example this is The Collector, for many years we don't see a show like this, so amazing, so entertainer, please we don't let us shutout the collector. We need him, we need Morgan Pym.<br /><br />The performances are really good, the scrip is fantastic, the performance of Chris Kramer is wonderful, we can't imagine someone else.<br /><br />The boy, Aidan, the autistic boy, his job is extraordinary.<br /><br />Maya is just who Morgan needs.
