For a movie that came out in 1977, this was a very poorly made film. The special effects such as the giant ants were laughable as was the plot. It could be forgiven if it had been made 20 years earlier but it wasn't. Although one of the stars in Empire of the Ants is Joan Collins, it must be one of the movies that she wishes the public would forget. It is entertaining but by no means should you watch this as a serious horror / drama. All around, the quality just isn't there. Although not a complete waste of time, the impression I had was that this was just another blah movie, nothing to go out of your way for but mildly entertaining. I can't say that it was really terrible but on the other hand it certainly can't be called good.
