The 1 star rating is for the DVD which may be the worst I've ever seen, and my first DVD was the original "Blade Runner" release. The print is sadly faded and filthy--scratched, blotched, lined. It jumps, it skips, it ripples, it does everything but the hokey-pokey. Even worse, this early Cinemascope release (2.55) is given a full screen presentation so every blemish is emphasized. Even panned and scanned would've been an improvement. Instead all we're given is the center of the ultra-widescreen image at all times. The result being that in most scenes part or all of the speakers are off screen and sometimes the featured action as well, while most of the image is left empty. Beware Education 2000, who released this abomination--they have no regard whatsoever for their product. If you want it, and it does have its charms however slight, get it off TCM. Their print is lbx'd and in good condition.
