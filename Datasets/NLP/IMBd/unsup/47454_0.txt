I grabbed this movie out of one of those value bins. I think I paid about five bucks for it. That should have been my first clue as to what I was getting. The movie sucked big time... I fell asleep twice on it and just what the hell was this movie about??? Daddy Walton looked like he needed a drink... They could have found some better Kennedy brothers. I was let down because I like the whole time travel concepts in films. There were a lot of missing pieces and they asked us, the viewer, to pretty much fill it in. Run as fast as you can from this movie or face the raft of getting sucked in by the VORTEX OF BAD FILMS. Should have had some Marilyn Monroe sex scenes, now that would have been a flick...
