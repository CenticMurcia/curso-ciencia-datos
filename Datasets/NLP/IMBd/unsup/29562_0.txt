Jeff Lieberman is quickly becoming one of my favorite unknown directors. Not only did he direct the enjoyably silly nature run amuck movie "Squirm" and the very cool backwoods slasher flick "Just Before Dawn", he also directed "Blue Sunshine", an excellent example of what I have dubbed "LSD cinema" about the excesses of the 1960's coming back with a vengeance.<br /><br />One of the elements that makes "Blue Sunshine" stand out from the crowd is the acting. Zalman King, who was also in "Trip with the Teacher", one of my favorite trash flicks gives an excellent performance in the lead role. Likewise I rather enjoyed Mark Goddard's performance as Edward Flemming, a former drug dealer now running for Congress. Beyond the acting, "Blue Sunshine" also contains some very creepy imagery, a nifty score that serves to heighten the overall mood of the movie and a tightly written script that manages to do what few movies have been able to do, create an effective and memorable anti-drug message while avoiding being overly preachy. Lieberman's direction is allows the movie to move along at a good pace, allowing the movie to build slowly and the audience to get to know the characters while at the same time not being overly slow and boring. Overall "Blue Sunshine" is an excellent movie from a sadly unknown director, check it out.
