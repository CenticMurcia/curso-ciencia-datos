During the early 1990s we had this serial going every Sunday on our TV and we were breathless. Such a wild escapade of jokes was, is, and will always be a rare treat.<br /><br />When speaking about super-hero serials, nothing more ridiculous, zany, mocking, and over-the-top lovely stupid has been created, in my humble opinion. Every time I watch any part of it, I lose the number of puns and jokes delivered (when I try to count) - they just go on and stumble one onto another. I don't know if the English-speaking version of this serial is funny but the Russian one is brilliant. I guess it is a perfect example of Disney productions, which deserves to be on DVD.<br /><br />If you enjoy "Mermaid", you will hardly like this title. And if you are adult to the core of your soul, you will not like it. Otherwise: take a wild ride with the utterly obnoxious duck and rejoice.<br /><br />10 out of 10. Definitely. Thank you for attention.
