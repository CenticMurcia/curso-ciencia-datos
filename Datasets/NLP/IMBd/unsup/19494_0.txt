I don't claim to be an expert in Bengali literature (far from it), but I have always found stories coming out of Bengal to be a class apart. The characterization, the depth of the plot, the sincerity of the human emotion in those stories are the among the finest to be found anywhere. Kabuliwala is another such great movie to be based on a Bengali story.<br /><br />Sharmila Tagore is superb, Vinod Mehra plays the grown up Nandu with great sincerity. Rajesh Khanna lends a lot of credibility to Anand-babu despite having turned a major superstar during the making of this movie. Om Prakash is always a pleasure to watch although his role is very small. R.D.Burman and Kishore Kumar top it all off with the great music!
