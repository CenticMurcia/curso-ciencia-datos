*Bad Moon SPOILERS* <br /><br />Ted (Michael Parè) is going to be our lycanthrope for today, a young man who has this 'curse' upon him, and tries to do as less trouble as he can, but his nephew (Mason Gamble)'s dog has other ideas, and begins to attack poor Ted, and Ted's sister (Mariel Hemingway) doesn't understand a thing, because she's as dumb as a rock...<br /><br />Am I going to believe that a mere dog can kill a werewolf? No sirreee! The main characters were so annoying, and Parè was the best of the bunch, so I was rooting for Ted (the werewolf) to make it.<br /><br />It can be read as the drama of a misunderstood werewolf, or as a failed attempt at a horror movie. And for a werewolf movie, the transformation scene is so-so.<br /><br />Bad Moon: 4/10 as a horror, 2/10 as a werewolf movie, 8/10 as a Drama.
