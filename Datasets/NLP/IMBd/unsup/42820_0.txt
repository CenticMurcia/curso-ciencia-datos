I agree that the female lead is beautiful and the photography very good, but that's it. This movie is designed for an illiterate, superstitious audience. It's all about silly religious mythology that most religions have outgrown, and doesn't really go anywhere. <br /><br />The lead as a little girl and an a young teen were also quite cute as were the other young people. The acting was spotty at best. Such things as gold fish, black water, a plethora of beached starfish were all taken as signs from some powerful fairytale entity rather than even considering any natural solution. <br /><br />This is the kind of movie that could have been metaphorical, an allegory, or a morality tale. I figured that would have been its only saving grace,but it just didn't have any of these as the basis for the story. <br /><br />The guy in front of us at the theater fell asleep and his wife had to wake him at the end of the movie. I figure he was the fortunate one. Terrible waste of my time.<br /><br />The only good part was that my girlfriend paid for the tickets as a birthday present for me. I would have hated to throw the admission money away.<br /><br />Jerry
