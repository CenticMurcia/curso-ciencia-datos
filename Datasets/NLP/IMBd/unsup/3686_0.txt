Now I love horror movies, all types like but I just didn't think this was as cracked up as people claim. With some great chase scenes and performance by Marilyn Burns this film amounts to nothing in my mind. What was so scary? Okay so maybe it was scary back in the day and I'm not judging others opinions but I just didn't find anything interesting in this movie. It was boring and the characters were flat and not interesting as they were annoying.<br /><br />I'm glad I watched it and I don't hate it but it's just no classic in my mind. It was just more people go out to Texas to get butchered and barbecued, I just didn't see an interesting enough plot. I also forgot to mention Jim Seidow's performance which was another fine performance and it has some great chase scenes but that's it.
