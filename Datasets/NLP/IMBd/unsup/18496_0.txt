I recently watched this movie on cable. I don't understand why there wasn't a sequel. If you don't find this movie hilarious, there's nothing wrong with the movie, there's something wrong with you. I wish I could find the screenplay. I especially love the 30's movie dialog from Johnny. A co-worker and I often get into a similar dialog during work, ad libbing and reciting classic old movie lines. I especially love the ending. It was classic. I'm going to add the movie to my collection. Being filmed in black and white was quite a touch. The only thing missing was the bad sound and film blemishes. I don't recall the film release. If it didn't sell well, I don't know why. It should have been a surprise hit. I think this would make a great TV show. There's no end to the possibilities in a weekly sit-com.
