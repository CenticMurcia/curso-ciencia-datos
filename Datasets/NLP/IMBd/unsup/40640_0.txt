Just watched this offering on movies4men.<br /><br />I'm not sure if the first poster was watching the same film as the rest of us! <br /><br />An unbelievable plot (or lack of it), dreadful script, wooden acting even from stars like Curt Jurgens, awful sets with absolutely no basis on historical reality, comic book Nazis, and so on.<br /><br />This film was so embarrassingly bad it was captivating viewing. I found myself gasping in amazement at the awful cinematography, poor editing and the final clich√©d romantic scene was just ....<br /><br />Sorry (gulp) I can't take any more.
