My best friend and I have agreed that this is the worst movie we have ever seen. 17 years later and I still shudder at the memory of having seen this in the theater. Stupid doesn't even begin to describe this movie. Two hours of my youth I will never regain. I suppose, though, everyone must have a benchmark 'worst movie ever' to compare all the other movies you watch to. I have seen some other bad movies in recent years, but nothing comes close to this crap.
