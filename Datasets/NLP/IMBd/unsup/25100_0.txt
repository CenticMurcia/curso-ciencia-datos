I have just seen this enjoyable yarn for the first time on afternoon UK commercial TV - not a great showcase . I wonder why I have never heard of it and whether it was not distributed much here. The plot pedigree is obviously "Lost Horizon' and many other films on the "lost tribe " theme but this story was done simply and tastefully, making one long to believe it. I was left wondering if the female academic intended really to document her discovery and how she would do it lacking writing materials and considering the danger of revealing the tribe to the outside world. That would be another story, so the successful reunion at the end of the film was satisfying. Why are such delightful films taken so little notice of and so much Hollywood trash is hyped to the skies?
