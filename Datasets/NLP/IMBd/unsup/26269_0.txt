And here I was thinking all movies from the 60's that ended in "a go go" had to be terrible. I was wrong."Psycho a go go" is a very underrated gangster-horror flick that definitely deserves better than an average of 2.1 on IMDb. It definitely looks very artistic at times, for example, the scene where the killer strangles the girl in a hotel while the neon lights lighten the scene.(This is probably due to expert cinematography from Vilmos Zsigmond). Also, I'm sure this couldn't have been the inspiration for "The Shining" ,because I'm sure only a handful of people have seen this, but the scene at the end where(spoilers, I guess) the killer chases the little girl and her mother through the snow and the end scene from "The Shining" are eerily similar. All in all, this could have been a more well known picture today if the film was cleaned up a bit, had its draggy scenes removed, had the cheesy bullet sounds taken away, and maybe had a more competent director.
