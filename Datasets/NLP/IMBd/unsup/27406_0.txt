¡°Code Red: Rubican¡± is about a soldier forced into exile due to ¡°psychological¡± disorders resulting from a failed mission in the past. When a commando mission in the jungle goes horribly wrong, he is called in to help lead the next team. When they enter the jungle and discover the mutilated bodies of the previous team, they quickly realize that there is more to this mission than they were told. While watching this movie I found it hard not to compare it with another very well known movie of a similar nature. (Predator)<br /><br />Those who like movies where people wander through the jungle and are preyed upon by unknown forces, should enjoy this movie. I was not that thrilled. Late night television only.
