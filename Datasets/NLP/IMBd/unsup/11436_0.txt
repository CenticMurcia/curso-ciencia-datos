I wasn't quite ready for the film to start when it did, as I was agitated with other concerns, but as soon as it began my whole inner world was exposed and eventually the quiet drew me in, literally transformed me. This is an experience, not just a film. One that I'd like very much to repeat again.<br /><br />The filming is absolutely stunning, and the contemplative life of the monks is captured by the filmmaker beautifully. Apparently he spent six months among the monks, during which time he explored and suffered for himself alongside them and in private, becoming quiet enough himself to establish the right mood. Having read this, I now understand why this film re-created the atmosphere so successfully.<br /><br />I would strongly suggest that anyone interested in this film should view it for him or herself, leaving behind the reviews of others.
