I have not read this book, but I read a lot, and something I've found to expect is: Books are 9 times out of 10 better than the film adaptations.<br /><br />My thoughts on the movieÂ… Fabulous work paid to the environments, sets, ambiance, all in all, the entire community and style of ember was very enthralling and interesting indeed. But unfortunately I think the movie suffered from the same things with a lot of movie/book adaptations. As the film continued, too many things are introduced, too many story elements, characters and events are cramming together, and it just starts to feel like they are rushing things to get everything that made a good story in a book into a hour and a half movie.<br /><br />I find I am left far too curious about too many things that they didn't have time to properly explain or explore. (big bugs?? wha?) I am most defiantly picking up the book for a more detailed story of ember, but as it stands now the movie is an enjoyable one. It's just so hard to trump books.
