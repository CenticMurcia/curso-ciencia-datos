This is the worst movie i have ever seen. Since I'm Mexican i know much of the actors and they are talentless, underachieved, lame, performers.<br /><br />The music is also a sad intent of what the director thinks futuristic music will be, Paul Van Dyk has probably never seen this movie and if he did he would probably be ashamed.<br /><br />Its like a third world Mad Max meets a cheap Mexican version of star wars. <br /><br />Its a low budget futuristic film, and all the good comments about this film were probably written down by members of the crew. <br /><br />I suggest this movie gets submitted for the bottom hundred, so if someone wants a bad movie they wont be disappointed.
