***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** The movie had as much sexual tension as a dead frog on a highway. Actually, all the "sex" scenes made me laugh, especially with Loreena McKennitt's beautiful and rich musical scores and vocals played as the background for what must've been the cheesiest and most "tried to be ambitious but failed miserably" scenes I've ever seen. After the one when the main heroine withdraws from the encounter with another guy, and rushes home, I really expected her to reach out and turn a stereo off, or something. The whole action stops, and still the music continues till the scene is changed?? How cheap is that?? And this "Mystic Dream" song was way abused throughout the movie, appearing in every single intercourse scene (I can't bring myself to call it "sex", sorry!).<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD, be warned.<br /><br />Apart from the music, though, the characters were simply... dumb. A policeman sees a woman being literally run over by a car and runs to check if she is alive, instead of just telling someone to call an ambulance and starting the chase immediately, forgetting the basic police rule "NEVER EVER start a chase without calling for backup"?? He chases the black Thunderbird through a Chinatown parade, gets his windows knocked out and stuff, instead of just getting out of the car and running on foot which would've been way faster in that case?? Didn't he have a roof-mounted signal light or something, like most police cars do?? Earlier on, he has to do a full zoom on Jade's face on the tape, to recognize her? Come on, I saw it was her minutes before that! I re-watched this scene several times, certain that he must be looking for some tattoo, or something, to have to look this close at her face...<br /><br />EVEN WORSE SPOILER to the very movie ending!!<br /><br />In the end, it all comes to... nothing! The cause for all the killing was the governor's affair with Jade. So the overzealous policemen are killed, but the governor stays alive and well, and the main hero can do nothing to him... Great going, all for naught, evil still walks the Earth. Together with the woman's husband being yet another killer, and her still being trapped in a very uncomfortable marital situation. I understand bad endings all right, but there was no REASON for this here. It all just... happened. I wouldn't be surprised if in the end the main hero shot himself in the head, all of a sudden, just like that. Who needs logical reasons anyway?..<br /><br />Generally, the movie was dump and cheesy. 3 out of 10.
