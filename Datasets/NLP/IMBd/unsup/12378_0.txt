I saw the movie in class and I have to right a paper on how I perceived it. I have taken the time to read a lot of your comments and a lot of you are right, it is an excellent movie. The part that got me is that a lot of people don't understand why things happen the way they do. You have the right to say that the upper collar worker doesn't go to the inner cities to buy drugs. I would have to disagree with you. I am from the city and see it everyday. I have lost so many friends to the streets. It is sad to say the least. But, the true sad part is this way of life is called "survival" where I come from. This film is to show us that it starts at home, to want better for yourself and your children.
