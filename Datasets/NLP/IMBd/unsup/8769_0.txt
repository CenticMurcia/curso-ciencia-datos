Michael Wadleigh's stunning documentary couldn't have had better timing, being, as it was, in the right place and the right time (a defining, culture-changing moment in the Sixties). That's it's an expertly executed piece of filmmaking further indicates the stars must have somehow been aligned. Wadleigh shows a deep empathy for the men and women in charge of the festival (although you can still take him to task for his dishonorable treatment of some of the foot soldiers, most notably the Port-O-San man) as well as the townsfolk of Woodstock, New York; and he shows just as much passion for the music. The camera seems to be everywhere important and Wadleigh's use of split-screen photography has perhaps never been equaled; the editing (some of which is done by Martin Scorsese and his future editor and wife, Thelma Schoonmaker) is tight with nothing wasteful making it to the screen. Some of it's a little dated (can you remember Joan Baez' husband's last name?) and some of the music is exposed for the sham it really is (i.e. Jefferson Airplane) but if it were released in its current form originally Canned Heat would be today regarded as cultural icons and not merely a pop memory. Oh and Ten Years After stands alone. The nearly four hour film just flies by.
