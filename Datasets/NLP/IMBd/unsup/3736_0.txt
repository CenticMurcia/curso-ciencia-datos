OK I am not one to hate on independent Horror especially since some surpass Main Stream big budget horrors, but I have to take the time to say that this Movie is dire.<br /><br />I was mislead into thinking that this would be an interesting story from the opening scene but I was more than wrong, in fact the film doesn't really have a coherent storyline at all. It jumps from one scene to the next containing irrelevant characters who really serve no purpose to the thin story line the film does have.<br /><br />The characters that do feature have no clear Character traits and little if no back story meaning that you can't relate or care what happens to them. As for the main baddie Edgar, he seems to be a Mix of several other horror baddies and does his best to mimic Tony Todds Excellent performance in Candyman (Vocally I mean) which for me was very distracting.<br /><br />In my humble opinion this doesn't really feel like one solid cohesive movie but like a bunch of Trailers for several Horrors edited to appear as one film.<br /><br />I would never tell anyone to stay away from a movie because we all have different emotional responses to what we watch, but be warned this will leave you confused and wondering 'what did I just watch?'
