I didn't want to watch it, but my husband insisted. I hate "The Sopranos" and all violent films/television. Why did I like this then, you ask? Because this was an exceptional production, and I hope they will do a series. The acting was incredible, big-screen quality. The child who played Cadenas' son was the best child actor I've seen.
