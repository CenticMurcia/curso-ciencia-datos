I gave this 8 stars out of a possible 10.<br /><br />I found it highly interesting to finally get to see this famous black and white film made in 1931, starring James Cagney.<br /><br />Jean Harlow also puts in a too brief appearance, and is mostly window dressing. She wears some gorgeous gowns and other outfits, and looked quite radiant on screen.<br /><br />While the film is dated, as to be expected: with language, the way the actors/actresses deliver their lines, the child-like behavior of the main character's mother, and with other women portrayed as either good girls or tarts--merely there to help and serve their men--the film is nevertheless entertaining and definitely held my interest throughout.<br /><br />The film begins with the main character, Tommy Powers (played by Cagney) and his pal, Matt Doyle (played by Edward Woods)as young boys, possibly twelve or so, already getting into trouble on the city streets and making the acquaintance of shady characters.<br /><br />The story progresses to the era of prohibition and bootlegging with Tom and Matt becoming gangsters and showing what kind of lives they lead, and where their actions eventually take them.
