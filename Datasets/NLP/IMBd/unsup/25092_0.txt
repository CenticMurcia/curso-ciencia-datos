Last of the Dogmen takes you into the past while remaining in the present. Tom Berenger and Barbara Hershey have good chemistry together.Tom Berenger makes an awesome "cowboy" type of romantic lead. Native Americans are well represented. This movie helps open the eyes of what it was like for the Cheyenne Indians plight to escape the forbearance of the Whiteman. Like Lewis Gates says: "I was born a hundred years to late," which is exactly the way I feel. The music portrays romanticism, and boldness, kind of like the westerns of days gone by. The dog "Zip" is an actor in himself. He is well trained. The scenery is awesome! Take me to Canmore, Canada, or is it the Oxbows? Which ever, I loved this movie! Would like to live this dream come true.
