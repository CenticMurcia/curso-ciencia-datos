I had been on the Haunted Mansion ride as kid in Disneyland, and I love it. And I was psyched that there's going be a movie based on the ride (after seeing the trailer), and I when to see it with my Mom; and after that I love it! <br /><br />The film starts when husband-and -wife realtors Jim and Sara Evers, with their children Michael and Megan, visit to Gracey Manor; after Sara received a phone call that the owner is selling the house, and workaholic Jim thinks it's a "golden opportunity" for their real estate business. At Gracey Manor, Mr. Gracey is enamored with Sara, and they discover that Sara looks like Mr. Gracey's old girlfriend Elizabeth (another "Elizabeth" counting the one from Pirates of the Caribbean), who died young and they think it was suicide...or was it? That's all I'm telling you folks, you will have to see it for yourself. So humour, Gothic scenery, and hints of horror make this film a delight to watch...over and over again; I am still SHOCKED by the negativity towards it though.
