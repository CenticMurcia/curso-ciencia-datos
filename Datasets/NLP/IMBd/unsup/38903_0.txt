I see no reason whatever to watch this thing unless it's playing on Joe Bob's MonsterVision (poor Joe Bob will have to shoulder the whole job of junk-embellishment himself, now that MST3K is gone). Dumb, plotless and unfunny, except for the raccoons - who get all the best lines. There's a nice little brotherhood story connecting earnest, good-natured Candy to arrogant blowhard Aykroyd, but it's so badly bogged down that it doesn't manage to surface until the last 20 minutes and that's much too late. One from the bottom of John Hughes' barrel.
