This film is one of those rare treats that you see on a TV channel from time to time. The plot is a standard and unsurprising affair but what sets it apart is James Woods' sardonic, cynical and hilarious portrayal of a tough, world weary cop who has no time for 'do-gooders' and over sensitive types. It just goes to show that the talented input of one actor can turn an unremarkable film into something special. Cinematic magic... If you liked the Onion Fields or is role in any number of films that would otherwise have been pants then you will like this film. Long may he continue to be on of the movie business's greatest assets...
