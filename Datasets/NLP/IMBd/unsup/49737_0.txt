At the start of the movie, the idea seemed good enough, but as it develops, is just a boring story of an evil child that, when kidnapped by a very nice group of people (who just wants to get some desperate money to get a straight life and don't hurt the little child...blah blah), starts practicing his ''art of doom'' with voices inside their heads and a few spooks leading them to get killed. Sounds familiar?!... I rate it 3/10 for some good acting, but that's it. The story is absolutely predictable and done like 1000 times before, the plot is boring and lame as hell, the subplots for each character are so boring, depressive, and badly explored,that i don't think any actor could do any better with such bad material to work on, the dialogues are lame and foolish, etc. I couldn't see any essence on this movie, is just another empty hole in movie making. My advice is, if u'r interested on the ''anti-christ kid'' stories, there's a bunch of movies out there with the same basics, and quite more watchable.
