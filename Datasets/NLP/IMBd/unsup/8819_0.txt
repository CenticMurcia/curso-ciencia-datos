The Echo is a classic ghost story. After being released from prison, Bobby moves in his deceased mother's apartment, in an old building and from there, strange things are felt and heard. The sets are great, the old building is perfect for this story. Jesse Bradford is adequate as the protagonist, a sort of well-meaning bad boy who got on the wrong track through no fault of his. <br /><br />There are lots of pieces to the puzzle, lots of people he interacts with... but nothing really grabs you. It's not that the things are necessarily flawed. The story is just following a conventional track that many fans of the genre have already seen, and it's been done better.<br /><br />There are no memorable scenes whatsoever in this film but you will probably not regret seeing it once if you like slow moving supernatural movies.
