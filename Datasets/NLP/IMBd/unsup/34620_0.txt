I decided to watch this movie on a Sunday night because I had nothing to do and to be honest I expected a lot more.<br /><br />The plot of the movie is the standard one for a movie that has pirates and a treasure in it- the treasure is hidden, the pirates fight among each other, beautiful women etc. There is nothing really surprising about the action in this movie- very boring. There are a couple of funny things that deserve to be mentioned here: 1. The acting is very bad- not surprising considering the low budget 2. The costumes are bad 3. The actors try to speak with British accent and they really fail in achieving it Avoid watching this movie
