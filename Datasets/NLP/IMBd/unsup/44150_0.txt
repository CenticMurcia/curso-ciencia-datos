Yes this movie is bad...the only good part is that Cerina Vincent is hot...other than that....I cried when I watched this movie because it makes Jeepers Creepers look good...I watched it all the way...twice...only twice because I wanted to show my friend how bad it was. Turn your head and run from this movie, other than the "Attractive Female"...and the parrot this movie has no real value to anyone anywhere...I know B movies aren't always good...but this one, just makes me sad. Very very sad. "This part may be a Spoiler": We get no real closure as to what the "Demon" is, if it is dead, or if it will just continue to wait. I'd have to say the story and the way Danny St. Claire goes about calling her boss a 'Protoped' when she herself is still confused on the definition of said word. Also Indian Guy in cave saying "It's not Safe in here", really throws the movie into a, "What is going on" mood for the rest of the movie.
