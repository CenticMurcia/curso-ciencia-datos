Pride and prejudice, by Jane Austen as a book is quite challenging. First time i read it was about 3 years back during my IB years. Some complicated words and many small things, which are hidden within the context. Luckily for us BBC made the "mini" series which aired in 1995. With actors Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, the series is very close and very amiable with the guidance of the book. The moment you start watching the first episode, which is an hour long, you immediately get addicted to watching the whole series. With the clever narrative and handwriting from Jane Austen and BBC it made the series well worth 10 stars. A strongly recommended series to watch on your free time. I also realized after watching the series over and over again the little things in between the characters stand out more and more clearly. Possibly the best English book around.
