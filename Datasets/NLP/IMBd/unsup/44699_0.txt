Well,it made me cry anyway,as i spent money purchasing this DVD to find out it was a waste of time...<br /><br />...I remember seeing this on TV at some point when I was younger and thinking it wasn't bad,but Id only watched it from halfway through so when I found it on IMDb,I decided to purchase it.Mistake.This film,admittedly low-budget,is just too amateur and low-brow, making you feel that half the time the director has forgotten which way he wants the film to go.<br /><br />The skinheads in it are awful,I mean,they purely cant act and there's no explanation behind why many of them are skinheads and why they stroll around in the attire they do,which no actual genuine skinhead would do.The lead (Damon Jones is it?)acts poorly also,usually having a rant then remembering he should be angry so suddenly starting screaming...I could go on and on about how pants this film is but ill summarise:<br /><br />-Cardboard characters -Very disappointing storyline dealt with by earlier movies (eg: The Crow) -Diabolical Dialogue -Very amateur looking<br /><br />Id recommended Romper Stomper if you want a skinhead bashing-fest or American History X,which is thousands of years ahead of this film,despite being made earlier.
