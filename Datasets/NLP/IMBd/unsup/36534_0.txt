Someone said this is the best Farrelly's movie since "There's Something About Mary". Fact is the Farrelly's haven't done much since ".. About Mary" except for "Shallow Hal" which at least had a decent story and good acting. And while "Shallow Hal" won't go down as a classic, it was certainly better than "Stuck On You" - which, quite simply, it shouldn't have been. "Stuck on You" had the POTENTIAL to be an above average comedy, with an original hook (siamese twins) and two excellent actors in Damon and Kinnear. And while there are glimpses of excellent comedy writing, it seems obvious the writer couldn't come up with enough of them to fill out a movie and reverted to standard, clich√©'d comedy bits to fill the rest. What a shame. So much promise lost in mediocrity.<br /><br />This movie isn't worth seeing.
