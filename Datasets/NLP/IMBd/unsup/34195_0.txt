A plague has wiped out cats and dogs, so instead of turning to turtles and hamsters as pets, mankind obviously chooses apes.<br /><br />The apes are unhappy from the start. As if it weren't bad enough that they are not being allowed to pleasure themselves as they constantly do in the wild, they were given dog and cat food which - it turns out - gave them non-stop diarrhoea. Add to that the fact many Belgian perverts switched from pedophilia to monkey-sex and you can certainly appreciate why the chimps started a revolution against the humans.<br /><br />The revolution is started by none other than Ceasar, Sean Penn's son (a striking resemblance: those eyes), who one day finds "Das Kapital" in the library of its owner, Tim Robbins.<br /><br />The rest is history. Ape history.<br /><br />Please someone lobotomize me so I can finally forget this dumb movie: I can't stop laughing!
