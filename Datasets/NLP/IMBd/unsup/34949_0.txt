The story takes on the adventure of a reckless guy who is away from his pregnant wife in the rural-area and seeks to become a singer in the city but things turns out badly (or funny?). He goes through a series of unexpected events and finally returns home at the end.<br /><br />A lack of skills in filmmaking is obviously shown in "Monrak Transistor". The music is somehow nostalgic, reminding me of the old days but the film itself has nothing to do with that feeling . Predictable plot, poor adaptation from country songs to few musical scenes and formulaic ending make it totally dull from start to the end. This film cannot lie itself exactly on what its gene is? is it musical or drama? I guess it's just a drama with some comic elements. Is the stereotype of people livings outside a big city like Bangkok supposed to be funny in a sense? Of course, there are many more ways to portray Thai country lifestyles than a bunch of unnecessary, pathetic jokes that only trigger your physical reaction from your stomach rather than your intellectual reaction from the brain. You might laugh at some gags but later on you might realize that it is a kind of movies that are so bad that it makes you feel you should laugh at it. This is one of the worst Thai films in recent years.<br /><br />
