I can't figure out why people are saying that this film isn't melodramatic, because it really lays on the sap. It follows a formula we've seen before of inspiration and tragedy, all just to get a few cheap tugs at the heartstrings. The story's evolution is not convincing and the dignity of the poor aspect is overplayed for what it is worth.<br /><br />All that said, there are redeeming aspects. Most notably is the cinematography. The images are all well lit for depth and contrast of cool and warm colors. Also, the camera shots from low angles with wide lenses give an overall visual perspective that rings true as the way a child would see the world. There is also some good scenes between the protagonist and his grandmother and his sister. These three were probably the best actors to boot.<br /><br />In the end, it is not something worth going out of your way to see though.
