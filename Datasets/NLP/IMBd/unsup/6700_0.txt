finally! this film gets no respect, which is unbelievable to me...i saw one review by a member who commented on the beautiful score and how romantic this film really is! this movie had a huge impact on my life, as it's pretty much my life story...<br /><br />i too had a sweetheart in my youth who lives back East and i live in California just like Jennifer Corly...his name is even similar to Bob Morrison's! i can't watch this movie without becoming totally entranced and still think about my lost love often...the music is just beautiful and so moving and joe brooks is funny and charming...shelley hack is very lovely and does a great job with her winning smile and poignant tears as she says goodbye instead of goodnight in LA...<br /><br />well, i'm going back East in March and we'll see if maybe one can go back again...i may even move there, since i can't seem to get him out of my heart...it's been a part of me since i was 16 and the strangest thing is the movie came out a few months after i met him in Disneyland and i flew back to Boston to see him shortly thereafter...we've been trying ever since off and on...
