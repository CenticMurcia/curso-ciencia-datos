When the movie starts, you hear pretentious music. Sylveser Stallone is on a funeral with his classy sunglasses and his designer suit. This all wants to look full of promise. It is already way to obvious. The director is still in the conviction that he can move his audience with these simple and obvious tricks. This does not work, at least not with a critical public that has seen some more movies. <br /><br />Sylvester Stallone plays the part of Jack Carter, performed before by Micheal Caine who stars in this movie as well. Jack Carter is mad because his brother has been culled by either Jeremy Kinnear (Alan Cumming) or Cyrus Paice (Mickey Rourke). He wants of course, as it behooves a real hero, immediate retaliation. He is going to scare Jeremy and Cyrus. Our stalwart fellow gets in his beautiful Cadillac, puts his gun in his pocket and drives to the victims he is going to take care of. Actually that is what the story is about. We should not forget the girl, performed by Rachael Leigh Cook.<br /><br />Almost everything about this movie is bad. The story is as shallow as a baby tub, the dialogs are awful and the acting is brazenly bad. Sylvester Stallone plays his worst part ever. Stallone must be either Rambo or Rocky, but not Jack Carter. This man is not able to express emotions. Throughout the whole movie he plays the tough guy, right in the middle however he is this sensitive man who can cry as well. I can't even remember why he actually cried, but it was about something silly. Stallone is a strong man who can run after bears and shoot with bazookas, but he is absolutely not apt to play a normal human being with feelings.<br /><br />The dialogs are horrible. It goes approximately like this: Doreen: Why did you leave when your mother died? Jack: Just because, what is your favorite color? Doreen: Pink, yours? Jack: Blue. Doreen: Why? Jack: Just because.<br /><br />The dialog is as thin as paper. When something is stated, the actors just do not go any deeper. The questions are answered briefly and then the dialog continues with another silly question.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke does, except for his muscles, not add anything to the movie. His dialog is shallow as well, he is the tough guy who should be removed by Jack 'the man' Carter.<br /><br />Of the actors are not culpable of the bad dialogs. It must be terrible to star in a movie which is directed by such an ignorant director. You must earn your money however, otherwise there will be no bread in the cupboard.
