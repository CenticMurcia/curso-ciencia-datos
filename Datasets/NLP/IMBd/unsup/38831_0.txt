Even though the author of the novel (Ronald Giphart) has a cameo in this movie where he states that the movie is in fact a lot better than the book - this film is absolute crap.<br /><br />I love Giphart's books, and Phileine Zegt Sorry is one of his funniest, but the adaptation is too slow, has too little funny moments to be a comedy, the actors are worthless (surprisingly, even Kim van Kooten's performance is below par) and the storyline proves to be too thin for a movie. And as usual in Dutch film, everything is covered up by lots & lots of nudity.<br /><br /> My conclusion: stick to the book and spend your money on some of Giphart's other novels instead.<br /><br /> 2/10
