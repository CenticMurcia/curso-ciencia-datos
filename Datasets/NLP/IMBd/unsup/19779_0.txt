I just love this movie. It has a reasonably original plot and is fairly well directed and filmed. The effects are, in the main, pretty good, in particular the demon. There are some interesting characters, like the assassin priest and the crazy repair-man dude played by Tony "Candyman" Todd. Kevin Zegers as the demons intended victim adds a touch of class to the movie with his well thought out and believable portrayal of Chris.<br /><br />The movie just screams 1980's straight to video horror, albeit with a bigger budget and better effects. Some people seem to think this is a criticism, but when you consider how popular those 1980's horror flicks were, I don't see it as a criticism at all, I just view the movie as a retro-flick. What really makes the film stand out are the great one liners... Priest walks into police station and says "I'm looking for a boy". Police man answers "Isn't that illegal father?" to which priest retorts "F**k off!". You just gotta love it!
