They showed this incredible movie at TV5 in a "Motorshow". I was paralysed watching it! I could not move my body to reach for VCR ... And the minutes passed away - and Whaooo what a moment!<br /><br />So now I´m looking for the movie on European video or DVD - do you know anything about that? It´s available in US video format, but here I am in Europe...
