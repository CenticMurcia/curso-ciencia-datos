I expected a lot when I watched the movie. Hence it did by no means live up to my expectations. I generally agree with the other ratings here, but I think the movie isn't that bad again. It has its thrilling sequences, the story is okay, a bit suspense, and the end is also okay. The acting is a point of criticism, right. Trevor Morgan was shallow as a character, which wasn't his fault but due to a bleak script. There could have been much more accomplished by a better director, as the story itself has some quality. The vicious couple could have been portrayed more credible as well. The tension and the level of suspense could have been higher too. Generally not too good and hardly agreeable.
