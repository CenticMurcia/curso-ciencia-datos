I have seen the movie, and I think it's the renaissance of the Romanian cinematography. I liked it, I've always liked the aristocrat movies, and I think the director Sergiu Nicolaescu has proved once more that he is the most famous Romanian movie director ever. The Romanian cinematography has had a crack-up after the 1989-revolution which demolished communism, but now I think it started to come back again. It was a very nice surprise watching this movie and it gave me confidence for the future Romanian movies. I want to invite everyone to see it and then judge. I felt very sorry seeing some negative comments from some users, and mostly because they were Romanians... It's strange how some people like to pull down every good thing which happens in this country...
