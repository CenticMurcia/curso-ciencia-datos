The WHOLE series is great. 1st was great, 2nd was better, 3-6 were almost as good, seven was more about drama than comedy, but 8 was funny. People keep complaining that '6-8 were crap, not funny, boring, wah wah wah'. SHUT UP!!!! Just because it didn't have as many laughs as the other series doesn't make it crap. If two runners in a race were less than a second apart at the finish, the lesser wouldn't be considered crap, just not as good. Series seven was still funny, but it was more about drama and story. Series eight was funny because the seriousness of seven wasn't needed anymore, besides, Holly was back. Red Dwarf is still a classic series, and will remain so for years to come. I can't wait for the movie.
