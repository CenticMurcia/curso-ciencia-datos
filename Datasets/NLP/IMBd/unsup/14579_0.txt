Great great episode, i wondered when are they gonna make a tribute to movies like 'Wrong Turn' and 'Hills Have Eyes', and they really delivered it with 'The Benders'.<br /><br />I had no clue that this episode will be the one about deranged sick family who hunts people for sport, because its title 'The Benders' would suggest that it's about some supernatural beings who can maybe change their look, like shape-shifters or something like that.<br /><br />Anyway the episode is very well directed, aided by very good acting performances, specially from Dean and female cop who helps him find his lost brother who was kidnapped by the members of this sick family.<br /><br />Episode also tries to tell us that you don't need supernatural stuff and monsters to make a scary TV show episode or a movie, humans will do just fine ! <br /><br />9/10
