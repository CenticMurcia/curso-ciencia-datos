I can't recall when I have ever been so moved by a film. Everyone in the theatre sat frozen in their chairs long after the lights came on after the movie. We were all bawling or just frozen and stunned. The emotional impact of the movie was all at once stunning, horrible, beautiful, and overwhelming. Anyone should be able to relate to this film. Anyone who misses it will be missing one of life's genuine miracles.
