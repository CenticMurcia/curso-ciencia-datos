I admire all the majors in this film. I grew up watching Henry Winkler as the Fonz and he's had success as a serious actor and as a producer. Ron Howard went on from this very early film to grow as a director into one of the finest in his craft. Keaton has rarely made a bad film and is consistently good to watch in both dramatic and comedic moments.<br /><br />Having said all this, I have to forgive them all for having made this film. In the day it was made I suppose this type of humor was acceptable and tickled not a few funny bones. Frankly, it has not aged well and having now watched it for the first time in 2007 it made me roll my eyes in disbelief. The script is silly beyond reckoning and totally not believable. I mean, when we watch "Ghostbusters" for example, we know that the script is a cartoon and no one stops to consider if it could have happened. When we watch "Blues Brothers" or "Animal House" we know that although very exaggerated, they are believable in their own crazy ways. When we watch "Night Shift" then no, it is not believable for these types of lunacies to carry on in the night shift of a city morgue. <br /><br />I know it's a farce but the humor was lost on me. Winkler's character was the most limp-wrist pansy I've seen in years. One get's the impression that a strong gust of wind would blow him over. Keaton, in his debut steals all his scenes and is funny to watch, given the script. <br /><br />There were all kinds of films from that era (I just watched "Nine to Five") that at the time we thought quite funny. Now they just make me squirm or wonder why they were made? Great humor is universal and passes it's message on from generation to generation. Think of Chaplin and Keaton and you'll see my point. This film, while early in their careers is just too weak, silly and in our internet-violent world just ridiculous.
