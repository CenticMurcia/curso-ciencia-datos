Walter Matthau and Carol Burnett are beloved icons of American film, each of whom has given us countless hours of wonderful entertainment over an expanse of numerous decades. Their extraordinary performances in 1998's "Love After Death" lift this story to a higher plane. Watch them achieve the same in 1972's bitter-sweet comedy "Pete 'n Tillie." They have such great chemistry that it's really too bad they didn't work together more often over the years. Watching their portrayals as widowed senior citizens who find love is a moving experience. Burnett deserved the American Comedy Award she won for this film, but Matthau should have been honored as well.
