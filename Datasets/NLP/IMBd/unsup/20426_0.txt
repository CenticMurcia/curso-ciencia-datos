Not a 'great' film by any stretch of the imagination, but not nearly as bad as some of the 'football' experts would tell us in their reviews. I'm certainly no expert on 'the game' but this movie was thoroughly entertaining for anyone that can get over themselves and their knowledge of what the football world might be or is really like.<br /><br />Sure, anyone in any profession or with any particular interest and knowledge of an area, field or profession can sit and pick holes and inaccuracies in a movie about such, but watching a film isn't necessarily about self-validation. This film achieves what it sets out to do, which is promote the game and the players in flashing neon lights and entertain the masses who might not necessarily be football fanatics. <br /><br />The 'star' Santiago rejoins his 'wingman' Gavin Harris from the first film in a Top Gun style opportunity to foot it with the best of the best for the #1 club, surrounded by the best players. He seeks to force his way into the starting lineup but has plenty of competition. Naturally there are plenty of hiccups and setbacks along the way, including injuries and relationship problems, but they finally get their act together and both cover themselves in glory at the end.<br /><br />There are no award winning performances I have to say, but the character 'Gavin Harris' is exactly that, a character, while I can't comment on Rutger Hauer's performance as coach, but he certainly looked the part.<br /><br />GOAL II has plenty of glitz, glamour, flash cribs/cars, eye candy, sweaty bodies, 'football' action and a pumping soundtrack (all that and not an 'F' word or sex scene in sight). I recommend watching it on the biggest screen you can find with the loudest surround sound possible cranked up.<br /><br />For me, it certainly does for European Footballers what 'Top Gun' did for Naval Aviators and I wouldn't have minded being either after seeing the films.
