I stumbled across this gem a couple of years ago late night after a few drinks. Coming into it about halfway through and a bit drunk i was thrown and unsure whether it was supposed to be taken seriously.<br /><br />Needless to say after a few minutes i soon realised that it was in fact comedy gold. I've just rediscovered it on 4OnDemand after someone reminded me about it in work and its just a good as i remember. Glaringly funny at points however it has fantastic intricacies you only catch the second time around (the old C4 logo needless detail but makes a massive difference).<br /><br />The only further comment i can give is ....WATCH IT!!!
