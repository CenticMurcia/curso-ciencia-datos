There are five movies which i consider really great: Contact, Apollo 13, Gataca, The Matrix, and this movie Frequency. It really should have gotten an oscar. Too bad it was so overlooked.<br /><br />To sum it up, it's a sci-fi time travel murder mystery, so it gets the best of three genres! it also involves ham radio, an aspect not usually shown in movies. Now I may be biased since I myself am a ham, but I am very glad to see this fun hobby portrayed in a movie.<br /><br />So the sunspot radio-wave time travel scheme is probably not adherent to your college physics book, but who cares? movies that mess with the space-time continuum are rarely this entertaining. if you suspend your disbelief, this is just one great story! It is action-packed and full of surprises but also emotional and touching.<br /><br />The fire scenes are very well done and the film keeps you on the edge of your seat right up to the shocking conclusion. If you are headed to the video store tonight, I would strongly recommend Frequency. -Rox
