What an awful shame ... with a cast like this and and a basically sound overall plot this movie should be a good watch, but this movie fails to hit the mark - it's films like this that put a downer on the British film industry. The film completely fails to build any character empathy until far too late and there appears to be whole chunks of key story line left on the cutting room floor and they've thrown in some inappropriate music where they probably couldn't afford a proper score. In places the acting was not up to mark that some of these actors have previously made. Poor accents with low budget special effects and scenery also disappoint - I had to watch the film twice just to make sure I hadn't got it wrong!<br /><br />Kelly's Heros does a much better job of the WWII bank robbery story with the bonus of Clint and Donald!
