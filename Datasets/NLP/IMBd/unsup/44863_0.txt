It's not a secret,Arnold Swarzennegger is a very veeeeery bad actor! But after this film,at the beginning of his career,how could it be possible somebody trusts him to use him in other films? Zeus was looking after him!!! He's acting so bad! He's so inexpressive... So transparent... He was good in Conan and Terminator,because he has a great body and very few words to say... But when he talks,when he's trying to be humorous...Aaaarrrrrgggggghhhhhh! Zeus,help me to endure that !!! So this film is made on a big biiiiiig casting error! But,unfortunately,it's far from being the only problem!!! The story is sooooo stupid,dialogs are so awful and the director so ineffective,that this film is simply and terribly boring! Too bad to be funny!!! Lots of bad films can be seen at 2nd degree! They became funny,sometimes great!!! Not this one! Perhaps it could be a little bit,with another (unvolontary-funny) actor like Lou Ferrigno,but Swarzy was always so sure to be good,so self-satisfied,but it's so sure his performances are so bad (exclude Conan and Terminator)!!! Don't look this!!! You want to laugh at bad films with bad actors? Just take a look at "Hercules"with Lou Ferrigno,"Masters of universe" with Dolph Lundgren,"Streefighter" with JC Vandamme,"Invasion USA" with Chuck Norris,"Beastmaster 2" with Marc Singer,"The Barbarians" with David and Peter Paul,"Bronx warriors 1 and 2" and "Thunder 1,2 and 3" with Mark Gregory,or "Oscar" with Sylvester Stallone...And the very best of all: "Hamlet" with Arnold Swarzennegger! No it doesn't exist,but it should be...
