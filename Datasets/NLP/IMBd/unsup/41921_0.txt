Don't get me wrong, I like the Blue collar guys but whoever booked the show has no ideal of the term "Fan Base" You could tell by the expressions on Foxworthy's face that he was uncomfortable and not just because it was a roast. Just when I think it could not get worse they bring out a county rap group. Country + RAP = CRAP. There where some good parts. Larry, Bill and Jeff where funny as always and the guy that did the Bush bit was great. Never quite figured out how Ron White fits in with the blue collar guys but he was there repeating his act. Now I know why they call it a roast, There where several people trying to rekindle the fire to their careers.
