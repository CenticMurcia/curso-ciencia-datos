Young man stalks a young woman by installing cameras everywhere in her apartment and by following her with hidden cameras in bags and such.<br /><br />While the idea of someone using todays technology to stalk the object of their affection is scary, especially since we see how seemingly easy it is, I found the depiction of the story more miss than hit. The problem for me was that the central conceit of the film, namely that we are watching the young man's tapes unbelievable. Call me a heathen but I couldn't get past the impossible cutting to a close-up with in a single camera sequence, or perfectly focused from a moving bag shot or any of the films seeming breaking of its own rules. It didn't help that I didn't really care for anyone in the film and found myself feeling pity for our anti-hero because he was "in love" with someone who seems rather dull.<br /><br />I have a confession to make. I saw this as part of the IFC in Theaters cable service and the movie so disenchanted me that I shut it off about 45 minutes in. Normally I'll hang in there, especially when I'm watching a movie at home, since I can fast forward, but even that didn't seem like an option. I just was bored and distracted and finally got to the point where I just shut it off.<br /><br />There's a clever idea here, it just needs someone better to use it to make a good movie.
