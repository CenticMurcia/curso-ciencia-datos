In my opinion, this movie and Care Bears Movie 2 are the best films I am ever going to watch. Care Bears were there all the way through my childhood. I am 16 and I am still watching these two cute movies. I can't help it. I think this movie could teach anyone a lesson, no matter what age.<br /><br />Care Bears is a film about Morality teaching young kids to share, love and about friendship, unlike Pokemon which provokes the young population to fight and steal each others Pokemon cards.<br /><br />This movie is full of beautiful and catchy songs, but I prefer the 2nd movies sound track. I will never get bored of this movie, and I will watch it till this old tape of mine screws up from old age (where I will be VERY upset). This movie will bring you songs which will never get out of your head, these songs have been in my head all my life and I have had a happy life so far.<br /><br />You may think that Care Bears have no effect on your child, but I grew up with it. Now im a vegetarian, a volunteer for the RSPCA and a success at school. Im extremely bubbly and kind hearted and hate to hurt people. You decide.<br /><br />Please, parents everywhere, show Care Bears to your children, not Pokemon.
