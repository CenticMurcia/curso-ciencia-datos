This is a film about a corporation which, for no apparent reason, is testing a body-enhancing drug on the local 'Ramsey Street' like yocals in an Australian community.<br /><br />A man drinking bleach in the opening 5 minutes?!?!?!?! This was gonna be one bizarre schlock horror experience from the off. A severe lack of storyline and any continuity really reminded us all of why Australia is not a name readily heard when discussing great movie moments.<br /><br />I realise this is low budget but could they not have at least found a body builder who didn't sound like a chipmunk?! Even with Ian Smith (Harold from Neighbours) having a pivotal(!) role as a doctor involved in the trials this film is one big joke from start to finish. Even the video cover has a picture of him with his left ear cut off when it's his right that gets cut off in the film!<br /><br />This nearly overtakes Twin Dragons as the worst film ever! A resounding 1 out of 10.
