Timothy Foster, forced into retirement as a cop. But the years of experience of catching criminals that made mistakes which lead to their being caught has given Foster a perfect plan for an "1,200,000" heist. His crew always wears masks so no one "except for Foster" knows the identity of anyone. Go to different parts of the world and no one spending the "hot" money until each of the four members divide the money are planned by Foster. Find a "patsy" Joe Rolfe played by John Payne, an ex-con that drives a flower truck, but have a duplicate flower truck for the real heist and let the police follow and arrest Rolfe thereby allowing the criminals time to leave the city. All time schedules timed to the minute of the armored car. Everything works to perfection but one thing that Foster did not figure on, Rolfe setting out to track down the real criminals and clear himself. This leads to Mexico. Another thing Foster cannot predict is the his own daughter falling in love with Rolfe. Is this enough to ruin the perfect plan? Watch and find out and you will be surprised by the ending.
