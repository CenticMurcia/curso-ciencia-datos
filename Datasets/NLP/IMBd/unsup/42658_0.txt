STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits <br /><br />A cop (Michael Dudikoff) is experiencing marital problems with his wife (Savina Gersak) who becomes estranged from him during the night, driving off and out into the night. A seemingly innocent hitchhiker (Mark Hamill) jumps on board, and this is only to be the beginning of a night of terror that will bring husband and wife back together for a blistering ride.<br /><br />A far wiser action movie lover than me told me that Michael Dudikoff once enjoyed a screen career at least as great as Dolph Lundgren's. I can't remember this (but, actually, I suppose Lundgren's always been a video star too) but I've certainly seen a few of his definite video stinker works. And this is one of them.<br /><br />The very set-up of the film is naff. The wife just letting a guy like that jump in just seems unlikely from the off-set and, as a result, it's hard to buy any of the character's as real and so it's really hard to care about them. On the performances front, Dudikoff's his usual self and Gersak is an annoyingly wooden actress with a weird accent. And then there's Hamill, who'll always be remembered to everyone as Luke Skywalker. But he didn't enjoy much of a screen career after that and, on the basis of this, I can only assume it's because he's really not a very good actor. Screen legend Robert Mitchum is drafted in at the end as a plot device, and ends up as the most sorry sight out the lot of them caught up in this poor man's Hitcher imitation. Avoid. *
