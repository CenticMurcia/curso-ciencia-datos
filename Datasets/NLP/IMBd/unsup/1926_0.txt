3-D in 1983 was a big concept and another money making gimmick but it just doesn't stand the test of time. With todays studios turning out computer animated effects and creatures, this movie is just plain cheesey by millenium standards. Mostly it's just one of those movies you would watch on cable when reruns are in season-and the reruns suck would you watch it.
