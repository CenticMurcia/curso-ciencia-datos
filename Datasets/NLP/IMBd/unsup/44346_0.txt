"Dead Man on Campus" is not just an unfunny comedy; it's a disturbing comedy. The two protagonists are college freshmen, one a spoiled rich hell-raiser, the other a studious type on an academic scholarship. Of course, their lifestyles collide and the reprobate rich kid wins out, corrupting his roommate. Soon they are both on the verge of flunking out, and their only salvation is if one of their roommates commits suicide. Then the survivors get a 4.0 for their grief. Since neither of them wants to do it, and they have an empty bed in their dormitory suite, they look for a depressed underclassman to befriend, and then try to push over the brink. I believe that this is a very serious offense (like murder), but "Dead Man on Campus" plays it for laughs. And fails miserably. So not only is this movie humorless, it is amoral. It's also made by MTVÂ…which is not surprising. Avoid this mess at all costs.<br /><br />Also note that the IMDb Plot Outline "If your roommate dies you get straight A's for your grief. So a college student fakes suicide and his roommates cash in on it" is wrong. The two murderous protagonists want their roommates to REALLY kill themselves. There's no faking to it. Funny it's not.
