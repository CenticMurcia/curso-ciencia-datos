Parts of this movie were filmed in Excelsior Springs, MO and Henrietta, MO. The house (where he mingled with the "locals" and tried to explain what a "Semantics Professor" was) and the grocery store (where he bought the ice cream that he tossed out of his car), and the beauty shop were all in Excelsior Springs. The Drive In Theater was in Henrietta. It no longer exists. The bar scenes look like they may have been filmed in Orrick, MO, but not sure about that.<br /><br />When they were at the Drive In making out, I was the out-of-focus person in the blue shirt walking back from the concession stand seen through the rear window of the Porsche. I was fourteen. All of us got paid $15.00 a day and got to eat catered food.<br /><br />We all had a blast. But the movie sucks. My attorney is still trying to get me listed in the credits as the "Out-of-focus-concession-patron-guy-#1". I'll keep you posted.
