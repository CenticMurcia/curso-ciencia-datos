Deceived rests totally on the weight of Goldie Hawn's shoulders and she delivers. Goldie plays Adrienne Saunders, a happily married restorationist with a young daughter. Her husband, Jack, is an artifacts dealer whom she met by happenstance years before. Things start going badly for Adrienne when a curator is mysteriously found dead at a museum, and it is revealed that a piece Jack bought for the museum for millions of dollars is a fake. Jack then suddenly dies, and Adrienne comes to find out that her seemingly dead husband was not who he said he was.<br /><br />There are numerous plot holes in the movie, but Hawn works very well with what she has, and shows that she can more than handle serious drama. John Heard does seem miscast, as he goes from charming to psychotic without ever really establishing what makes his character tick, and why he has done what he did. All in all, a decent movie.
