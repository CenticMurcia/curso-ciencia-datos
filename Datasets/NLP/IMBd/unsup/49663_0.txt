Guys, honestly - who rated this a 10? It was shocking and horrendous and as much use as a chocolate teapot. Such an awful storyline, shallow characters, poor plot development - I could go on and on.<br /><br />This is the first movie I have not liked Dustin Hoffman in, and Natalie Portman's performance is also poor.<br /><br />I hear you self-righteous b*stards from the back shouting "But it's for the children..." - er...if my children were on LSD, having eaten 2 spacecakes each, then perhaps this would have entertained them...<br /><br />I urge you not to watch this. Do not even waste your time - you will be begging for it to end. I can assure of that!
