This is a truly awful and irritating episode of the original Star Trek series. Off the top of my head, I can only think of one worse episode. The biggest reason is that the fundamental plot is just annoyingly stupid. It seems that the Greek god, Apollo, is living out in space on his own planet. When the Enterprise comes near, he seizes it and brings down selected crew members to worship him and live like Greek hippies. How stupid can you get?! They meet Apollo in space?! THAT Apollo?! Hello,...is it just me, or is this really dumb.<br /><br />Kirk, always the first to kill a god (see the awful STAR TREK V movie and the "Val" episode for more about this), orders a sexy crew member to refuse Apollo's love in order to tick him off--even though she really does think the guy is pretty buff and sweet. Despite being a starring player, I don't think she ever returns for a follow-up episode--too bad. And, once this occurs, they manage to kill off Apollo!!! Yeah, right. The less said, the better.
