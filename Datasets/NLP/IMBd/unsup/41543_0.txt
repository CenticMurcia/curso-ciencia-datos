When I watched Cold Fish, I had heard rumors that when it was first screened people walked out, not because it was bad, but because it was very disturbing. I recently watched this film, and from the opening scene, I knew I would have to have a stomach to digest this film and its images. What made this so? Well, It wasn't the violence or depiction of drug use relative to the story or it's commentary on what is acceptable to the public from media. It was the use of actual video footage of hangings, shootings, terrorist activity and pure murder that shocked me. Although, the use of these images is attached to the characters, The Henleys, who use them to gain acclaim in the Art world, it's the psychological terror that two people can inflict into destroying somebodies life that makes this film an attention grabber. Violent, disturbing but extremely enjoyable!
