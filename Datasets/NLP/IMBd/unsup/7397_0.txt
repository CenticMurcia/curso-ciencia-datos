During the Dragonball Z series, there were two excellent movie specials that explained the background of characters with relatively unexplained backgrounds. One explained the background of "Future Trunks" and the alternate reality he is from, and the other tells the story of Bardock, Son Goku's biological father, and his fight against Freeza.<br /><br />At the end of the last episode of Dragonball GT, Goku absorbs the dragonballs and disappears without a trace. 100 years later you see an aged Pan, as spectator. at the Tenkaichi Budoukai. Her young grandson, Goku Jr. (who is the splitting image of Goku as a child) goes super saiyin and fights Vegeta Jr.<br /><br />This sidestory follows Goku Jr. on his quest for the 4 star dragonball so he can use it to heal is sick grandmother. Goku Jr., interesting enough, a coward. Its a nice twist and makes for a better story to see a Goku who can't fight and isn't brave enough to stand his ground. This leads to a few comical instances when you get to see a sobbing, runny nosed Goku running for dear life.<br /><br />As you can probably guess, eventually we see Goku Jr. lives up to his name, but not until after a brief word of advice from his hidden guardian angel. This special is great addition to the DB collection of movies. Its has the classic goof ball comedy of the early dragonball stories, without a lot of fighting (so if thats what you're looking for in a movie, watch one from the Z series). It shows your a possible new main character for a new series; one who can fight like Goku, act as stupid as Goku, turn his enemies into his friends like Goku did, and most importantly, one who eats as much as Goku did.
