This remake of the original The Fly is a landmark in David Cronenberg's career. Brilliant lit and cinema-graphed this is one of Cronenberg's crowning achievements in both horror and sci-fi. Re-imagining the whole plot normally kills the original movie but it didn't for this film. In fact it made it more greater. Instead of having a man with the head of a fly you get a man who has almost total transformation into a fly. Goldblum is great as Dr. Seth Brundle a scientist who tries to make a revolutionary design in time-place relationships. Going from the area to another is his idea and with his trusty "Telepods" he intends to be a pioneer in breaking research and it almost works. However the experiment goes horribly wrong and Seth realises that he not going to be the same anymore. I have lost count with how many I have seen this but it never gets tiring. The special effects were brilliant and still are to this day. although gruesome sick and very stomach churning, it compliments this classic in the making back in the 80's. Those who have watched Cronenberg's work will notice his trademark in this picture. One being the horrifying FX done fairly close up and the atmospheric score in the background that share the same style of that in Scanners, Rabid, Videodrome and eXistence.<br /><br />All in all a brill horror/sci-fi movie to be enjoyed by adults with strong stomachs and strong hearts. Just don't watch it on a full stomach. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!
