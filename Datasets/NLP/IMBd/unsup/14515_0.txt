I saw this movie in 1979 (I was 20 at the time, and I actually thought that I might be a bit beyond this particular movie; ha! I was soon captivated by this sweet and tender movie, reliving the agony and ecstasy of first love) and it made an impression that has haunted my heart strings ever since. For the last 25 years I have kept an eye out for a rerun, but have never been lucky enough to catch one. I stumbled on the DVD two weeks ago and was absolutely thrilled-so thrilled, in fact, that I got on the internet to see if this film affected anyone else as strongly as it did me, or if I am having a midlife crisis; thank goodness, there are others!! So here I am, once again intoxicated by the spell of this sweet movie as I meet Prince Charming, get lost in a white lie in the name of love, and struggle with the consequences. The honesty, innocence, and integrity of the characters is the key to the poignancy of this romance. A truly timeless coming of age movie that will leave you breathless. Somehow, the knowledge that there are others out there who share my feelings about this movie makes me feel good....
