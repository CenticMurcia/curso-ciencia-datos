I really hate this movie but I like Jackie Chan movies in general, so what can I say? It tries to be some funny silly comedy but I didn't laugh one time, the jokes are so dumb, maybe if you are like 5 years and under you will find it funny, anyway I didn't watch the whole thing, after about 20 minutes I wanted to rip my head off it so terrible...YUCK...<br /><br />1/10
