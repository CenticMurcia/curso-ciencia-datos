My summary says it all. This film is an insult to anyone who lived through the real thing. No concentration camp even remotely resembled what is shown in this film. No child would ever be successfully hidden from those running the concentration camp. Anyone who acted like the character played by Roberto Benigni would have been immediately killed. If Benigni wanted to make a film about a father protecting his son from the evils in the world, he could have invented any situation or set of circumstances he wanted. He certainly didn't have to, and shouldn't have, totally misrepresented this period of time in modern history. For reality, try watching "The Pianist". Try visiting the Holocaust Museum. Take the time to see and learn what really happened. Life was not beautiful.
