This movie reminded me of a not so much of a hit film of 1993 called "Phir Teri Kahaani Yaad Aayee", starring Pooja Bhatt. Comparing Pooja Bhatt to Kangana, you may feel disappointed, but in her own way, Kangana has tried very hard. Shiny Ahuja is marvelous as always. I don't know why but I came out of the movie blaming him, as if it was he who sought relief of his previous self, when he was a child. At major points, the movie is a direct lift from " A Beautiful Mind". Partly misdirected, the story is strong and actors good. Kangana looks good in the movie. At some points, there is also a "horror" film effect that has been tried. It was meant in good stead, but has been overdone. Also, only a few songs are good, the rest mediocre. Overall, watch it if nothing better to do and a few hours to kill, else can be avoided in favor of Phir Teri....( which would be very hard to find)
