Zombies, rabid canines, bad acting, oh my!! Another example of Hollywood taking a do-able script and running it through the meat grinder. I can't believe that people would show up to the premier of a film like this and take credit for being in it; much less be proud of the film. There were however some cool effects, made me leave hoping that artificial intelligence remains just an idea. Does make you wonder what goes on at our secret government labs??? This film is a rental, save your $$$ and wait till it comes out on video, that way at least you can drink a beer on your couch while you ponder actors getting paid to act this bad....
