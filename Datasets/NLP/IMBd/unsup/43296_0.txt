Why do Americans always feel like they have to take something which is already good and change it to suit them. The show had 8 series in england and easily had more if the actors wanted. so why did the Americans think they could do a better version of the show. Think of your shows. Did i just mention the office?? There could only be one lister ( Craig Charles). There can only be one Rimmer (Chris Barrie). The show was meant to be a low budget sci-fi TV series show because it wanted to be not because it had to be. Please watch the original show of red dwarf not the us pilot shows. Thank you and good night. Don't Forget that one day with any luck there will be a movie and with any luck it will be with the original cast and directors. Is It Over? The Smeg It Is....
