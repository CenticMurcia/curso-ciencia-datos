I watched this movie when it first came out. I remember seeing previews for it and I think i was 10 or 11 not sure but I remember waiting so anxiously to see it because I loved Tiffani Amber-Theissen. When I started watching it right from the beginning I was hooked. I never knew that this was a true story. Now I know and now I cringe even more thinking about the poor girl that this was done too. And her poor mother/family. The "People" that did that to her In my opinion should have gotten more then a slap in the face by the mother who took the one girlfriend, Ellen into her home. The girl that was there and didn't do anything about it, I was shocked I couldn't have A.) Let that happen to someone and B.)Not tell for that long she had a shot anytime she wanted Ellen was automatically locked up as soon as they got word of the killers. Anyways I loved the movie, it was directed great and the cast was great but I'm so sorry for the Monroe's families loss.
