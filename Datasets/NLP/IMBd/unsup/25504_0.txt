I saw this version as a child, and fell in love with Rochester and with Michael Jayston, whose performance is very winning, witty, and believable. That production introduced me to the book, which I have read many times and loved my whole life. I can't believe I was so young when I saw it, because it made such a deep impression on me and I understood it so clearly, even at a young age. <br /><br />Seeing it again on DVD, some of the early scenes made me laugh because the acting is rather wooden, and the production values are very 1970s. However, when we get to the interaction between Jane and Rochester, it comes alive and I forgot the datedness of the production. The dialogue is straight out of the book, and in some places this makes it unrealistic and cumbersome, but the narration in Jane's voice is wonderful, because it lets us know what she in thinking. Other productions have not done this, and sometimes it's useful to know why she acts as she does. The developing love between Jane and Rochester and the enduring nature of that love is the central theme and that is beautifully done. <br /><br />Sorcha Cusack conveys Jane's determination and intelligence very well, even though she looks too old for the part, and Michael Jayston is the best Rochester ever. This is a must see for Jane Eyre fans!
