For the B movie fans, there are films to watch, and there are "films" to watch. This movie falls in the later. Having become a b movie fan earlier this year, I made it my goal to watch a majority of the "bad" films that exist. This not included garbage made today, I'm talking about 90's and earlier. Over the course of last year, I learned of the films from some people on a forum on another website. Claim it as the best/worst film ever made. They consider it to be the best bad movie of all time, even greater then the cult favorite Plan 9 from outer space.<br /><br />The basic plot of the film is that this family goes to another town for a vacation called Nilbog. The town is completely made up of religious vegetarians who love milk for some reason. It turns out that the entire town is made up of goblins hence the name Nilbog which is actually Goblin spelled backwards.<br /><br />The plot itself is just so bad. The actors and actresses are bland and are overacting at many parts of the film. The whole idea of how to beat the Goblins is just goofy in itself. <br /><br />The film itself has NOTHING to do with the previous film, so if you have seen the first film, and expect to see the 2nd film deal with more Trolls you would be disappointed.<br /><br />The film is bad, but there are worse films out there. Trust me I have seen some of the films that are worse than this and it makes Troll 2 look like a blockbuster hit.<br /><br />Overall if you enjoy b movies or bad movies, then this is your film. If you hate bad movies, then avoid it at all cost.
