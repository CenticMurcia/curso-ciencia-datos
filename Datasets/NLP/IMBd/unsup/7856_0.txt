A few cool special effects don't make a good movie. I'm glad I didn't sneeze during the film and blow a hole through the tissue-thin plot.<br /><br />Poor Terence Stamp. He's such a great actor and this is the kind of crap he's getting offered?<br /><br />I'm not particularly a fan of Eddie Murphy, but I felt sorry for him, as well. Even the couple of times he could have been funny, you felt as if he were afraid to let go because he was in a family movie. His performance was dreadful.<br /><br />I won't go into a windy description of the story, what little there was, and give a "spoilers ahead" warning. The spoiler would be having to see this movie in the first place. Don't waste your money even on the rental.<br /><br />It's really a shame Disney bastardized their beloved theme park attraction with this drivel. You can be certain Mr. Eisner won't take credit for this one, even if he did have anything to do with greenlighting it, in his next pseudo-biography of egomaniacal lies.<br /><br />Do yourself a big favor and shun this film at all cost.
