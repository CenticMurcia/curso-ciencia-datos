...I would not have rented this film.<br /><br />The footage and locale are pretty, the actors prettier...but the<br /><br />dialogue is ugly, and the rock and the roll ("highway" rhymed with<br /><br />"my way"), ack.<br /><br />Well the song under the opening titles is catchy, and there's a<br /><br />scene where Daniel Lanois is leading a jam session in a<br /><br />penthouse suite that was sonically interesting.<br /><br />Wait, why am I talking so much about the music. The film is really<br /><br />not worth watching. It tries for frankness, but the connection<br /><br />between the characters just never catches spark.<br /><br />Maybe if they had both graduated from Johns Hopkins instead of<br /><br />Harvard? Or better yet they were both working to become dental<br /><br />hygienists and Frances McDormand's character worked with<br /><br />bands that never really quite made it rather than Bowie, Iggy,<br /><br />Springsteen...and the record release party was at a dive rather<br /><br />than that penthouse suite...<br /><br />But then how would the line "send up another bottle of Dom<br /><br />Perignon" play. Ack.<br /><br />Yes McDormand is gifted, but her performance does not save this<br /><br />latest version of "Young Doctors in Love." Her relationship with<br /><br />Christian Bale as her son, never rises above the lukewarm pool<br /><br />water titillation.<br /><br />
