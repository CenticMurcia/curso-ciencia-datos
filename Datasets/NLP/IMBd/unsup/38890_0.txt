I love to see modern adaptations of Shakespearean drama; I think the texts are more accessible to the general population when they are put into familiar situations/contexts. This setting of Hamlet, however, missed the mark. In the first half of the film, most lines were spoken in flat monotone--the absence of inflection made the plot harder to follow. Making Denmark an American corporation rather than a political state was also unsuccessful, for the continued use of the terms "king," "queen" and "prince" did not fit the new setting. Also, Prince Hamlet's film "The Mouse Trap," which is crucial to the original drama because it seals Claudio's guilty conscience, cannot serve its function in this film because it has been modified from a drama reenacting King Hamlet's murder into a bad montage of random student-filmmaker camera shots which one can scarcely connect to anything in the plot. Those who are familiar with the Hamlet text will be able to make a connection, but if the benefit of modernization is to familiarize those who are unfamiliar with Shakespeare, then this film fails in its office.
