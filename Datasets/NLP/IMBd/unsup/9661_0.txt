I really didn't expect much from it. I rented it because I didn't know what other 'new' release comedies I could watch and enjoy. I'm glad I did. It was really quite entertaining. If you have the time, watch the cast commentary as well. hilarious lol. I def. thought Sofia Vergara's comedic timing was awesome too. she had me laughing every time.<br /><br />another surprise was that the movie was only PG! not even PG-13. awesome. I'm glad there wasn't much over-the-top sensuality. the movie really didn't need it at all. bravo!<br /><br />It's a great movie to pop in when you just want to relax and laugh. uptight arses, do not watch this movie. it's not supposed to be another one of those lame dramatic blockbuster mysteries.
