Synapse films has compiled a bunch of grindhouse-style exploit trailers in 42ND STREET FOREVER - named after the area in New York City that was considered the "hub" of the grindhouse movement. Some of the trailers are fun, others sexy, some sleazy - this disc's got it all. The trailers shown on the disc are:<br /><br />The Undertaker and His Pals (1966) The Flesh and Blood Show (1972) Women and Bloody Terror (1969)/Night of Bloody Horror (1969) Blood Spatter Bride (1972)/I Dismember Mama (1974) Corruption (1967) The Butcher of Binbrook aka Graveyard of Horror (1971) Ginger (1971) Italian Stallone (1970)(a soft-core porn joint featuring a young Sly Stallone...) Creampuffs (1981) The 3 Dimensions of Greta (1972) Hard Candy (1976) The Centerfold Girls (1974) Panorama Blue (1974) Wicked Wicked (1973) Teenage Mother (1967) Charlie and the Hooker (1976) Mantango (1963) The Green Slime (1968) Destroy All Monsters (1968) The Crippled Master (1981) Werewolves on Wheels (1971) The Pink Angels (1971) The Depraved (1974) They Call Her One Eye (1974) Maid in Sweden (1971) Behind Covenant Walls (1977) Secret Africa (1969) Shocking Asia (1974) Chappaqua (1966) Welcome Home, Brother Charles (1975) The Legend of N!gger Charlie (1972) Boss N!gger (1975) The Bullet Machine (1975) Death Drive (1977) The Raiders of Atlantis (1983) Star Crash (1979) Confessions of a Summer Camp Counselor (1977) Sunset Cove (1978) Super Fuzz (1980) Death Will Have Your Eyes (1974) Death Has Blue Eyes (1976) A Black Veil for Lisa (1968) Ironmaster (1983) The Rape of the Sabines (1962) The Deadly Spawn (1983) Devil's Nightmare (1971) <br /><br />Personally, I've only seen a handful of these films - some have been marked for my "want-list", others still look crappy regardless of how "lovingly" they are portrayed in the trailers. A hard film to rate as it's not a "film" per se, and I will admit that watching trailers for over 2 hours can get old (it took me three separate viewings to make my way through them all...) - but I would still consider this a "must-see" for exploit and grindhouse fans...8/10
