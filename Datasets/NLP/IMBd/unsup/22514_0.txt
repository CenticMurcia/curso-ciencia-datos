I watched this not knowing anything about it. I hadn't heard about it and thought it might be interesting. The first few minutes were somewhat painful. Wooden acting, uninspired camera ... It wasn't exactly exciting. But then : I like Cube, and that had similar problems. Then the actual story started, and from then on it went downward. It looks like someone wanted to take advantage of the success of slasher/thriller movies like SAW and Battle Royale but just couldn't think of an original idea, so mixed thriller classics, and added some blood. If you know any of the "10 little n*ggers"-based movies (sorry ... That's the name of the original Agatha Christie book, and somehow she didn't care about being politically correct), you'll figure out what the ~punch line~ of Steel Trap is. This really just a remake of the original story, but sadly it is a very boring one. The characters are all very annoying and the story lacks any kind of suspense. The inevitable come back of the "oh so dead" killer at the end, the frame job ... It's all so predictable it's not even amusing anymore. I give it 4 out of 10 for a few nice lines and the fact that some of the girls actually look kind of nice.
