this series is stunning in every way..the story of Suh Jang Geum, the first woman to ever become the personal royal physician is a gripping story with more plot twists than a plate of spaghetti. the series follows Jang Geum's life in and out of the royal palace in 16th century Korea. Without giving anything away, i just want to say i found the characters very inspiring, as well as entertaining. from a production point of view, the beauty of the sets/costumes, art-dept stuff, the acting from all the major characters was incredible, the story was completely fascinating and the characters were just awesome. if this is the stuff they get to watch in Korea, i'm jealous. i'm thinking of moving. Also, on the DVDs i got (3 box set Korean produced) the English subtitles were really good. which, as someone who mostly watches non-English language movies, is a HUGE point in their favour!!
