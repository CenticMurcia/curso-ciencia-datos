Once again, Robert Duvall comes out of the gate with one of his personal projects, writing, directing, producing, and starring, and delivers an almost perfect film. Well, maybe it is perfect. I don't know. I do know I loved every minute of it. This movie is filled with emotion, suspense, and intrigue but Duvall never cuts corners, never takes any cheap shots. Assassination Tango is as good a film as I've ever seen.
