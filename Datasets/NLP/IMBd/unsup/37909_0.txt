I was disappointed to find that I was unable to watch this film as there was no captions. I would have thought as the film was made in 2006 and in this era of marvellous technology, this would have been available.<br /><br />I thought when I hired the DVD, that there were subtitles available but after a phone call to the Video shop, I was informed that if you look closer, there was no tick beside the word, subtitles.<br /><br />Maybe it would have been better if the word, subtitles, was not written on the DVD cover. Normally, I would look for this word and if it is not there, I assume that the DVD is not subtitled.
