This movie is great. It defies logic at every turn. For example, people are killed by having their hands nailed together. What? The person behind the motorcycle helmet sounds like they're talking through a synthesizer, but when the helmet is taken off, it's just a normal person. What? The sheriff's car is just a normal blue car with no markings. What? The sheriff's badge and shoulder holster magically jump sides the entire film! What? The sheriff and town coroner find a body in the middle of town and then desert it, saying "it's been here this long, it ain't goin' anywhere." What? A woman sits and blubbers simply because her friends have walked into the forest and have been gone for awhile. What? Oh, and my favorite scene, where a guy gets shot and falls over onto some garbage cans. He's draped over one of them, dead, and it starts tipping over, so he reaches out and pushes off on a wall to re-balance himself! What?? Look, obviously I could go on and on, but you just have to see this one for yourself to see how hilarious it is. My grade: A-
