This movie had a great impact on my life, when you think about it, anyone of us can be a victim of someone as mentally disturbed as Kenneth Taylor. The charm of a Narcissist Psychopath which we find everyday. There are so many sick people out on the loose, it's scary. I saw this movie as a teenager and never forgot about it. The book by Peter Maas is incredible, I bought it through the internet and highly recommend it. I am currently studying Psychology and this character is a very good subject for study. If anyone out there knows where I can purchase this film, I would highly appreciate it. Please send me any information regarding this film to camarito87@hotmail.com Thank you.
