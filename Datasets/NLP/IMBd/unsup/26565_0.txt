Yes, this film is all but unwatchable. The unsynched video and audio make for one of the most unsatisfying experiences ever. This is supposed to be a documentary, but what did I learn from this film? If there was a band I didn't recognize, I wasn't told who they were. I don't know when the performance was shot, or where, or who the musicians are, or what their influences were. We don't learn why this generation was called blank by the filmmakers. There are no shots of the audience, so we don't learn what effect the music was having on those who were actually there. This isn't a documentary, it's being trapped at someone's house who you don't like and they pull out their home movies of their kids.
