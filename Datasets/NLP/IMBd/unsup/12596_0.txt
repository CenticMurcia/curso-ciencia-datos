The Baron shines as Don Juan. He does with a period role what Elvis did with a song he makes it his own.There may have been better swordsmen technically but no one had Flynns charisma or showmanship when it came to sword fighting. Today's actors when you dress them in seventeenth century attire look like twenty-first century blow dried wimps dressed in costume. Flynn looks like he belongs in whatever time the film is set. It is impossible to visualize any other actor as Juan. And make no mistake Flynn was an actor.Just because he made it look easy does not mean it wasn't acting.If you want to see how an epic should be made watch this motion picture. There is no CGI here these are real sets and real actors. In this day of remakes I rue the day they get around to Flynn's films no one can fill his boots.
