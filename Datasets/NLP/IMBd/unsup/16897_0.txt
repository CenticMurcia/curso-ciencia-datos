I have seen "A Perfect Murder" twice - once in a theater, once on video. It was a sleek, suspenseful entertainmnet.<br /><br />Does it get points off for being a remake of Hitchcock's "Dial M for Murder"? Not really.<br /><br />In the sense that there's too much talent in the world to warrant droves of remakes, I suppose that can be held against the film. Still, 'The Master of Suspense' did not have a perfect track record. "Dial M..." was one of his weaker efforts. Based on a hit Broadway play, the film was directed by Hitch for two reasons. He owed Warner Brothers a movie under his contract, which, as I recall, had him doing a project he loved [perhaps "Rear Window"] in exchange for "Dial M...". He also was intrigued with the new 3-D process, which was to be used in the Grace Kelly/Ray Milland potboiler.<br /><br />"A Perfect Muder" has many differences from the original. It has had a definite update. It covers very familiar gound plot-wise, but it does so in that sleek, stylish Hollwood mode. In substance, it's a Subaru. In style, it's a Lexus.
