Aaja Nachle is not a typical Yashraj film in the sense of scenery - snow, mountains, etc. But one thing is for sure and that is that this is the return of Madhuri Dixit, whose last film was "Devdas." Dia, a dance instructor, who lives in New York, receives a call that her tutor, who lives in the village of Shyamilee, in India, is very ill and has called for her. Upon her return, she is informed that he has passed away and that it was his wish that she tries to save the arts centre in which she, herself, was once a student. She then finds her best friend, Najma, but she refuses to help her.<br /><br />Directed by Anil Mehta and written by Aditya Chopra, this is a musical genre movie and the songs are memorable, which makes it a change since nowadays, there are only some songs and music that can be hummed to or remembered. The most memorable is the title song itself and off course, with Madhuri Dixit looking so slim and gorgeous, the dances are worth while watching. The cast includes Akshaye Khanna, Konkona Sen, Kunal Kapoor, Vinay Pathak, Divya Dutta and Irfan Khan.<br /><br />Madhuri Dixit's charm is still there and this movie, for all her fans, is worth watching - this is the return of Madhuri. Yes! It is expected that she will work in movies but not so much as before,
