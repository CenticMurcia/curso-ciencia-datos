This movie starts out as an over the top slapstick effort, but then bails out on that and gets surprisingly serious. It's the start of yet another straight-forward slasher, which is pretty unwelcome. Stalk and slash, boring dialogue, more stalk and slash. There isn't much excitement in the plot, but I appreciate the variation in weapons though, that kept the mood lively. The ending isn't too bad either. But throughout I was just wondering who the hell makes a slasher in '92. I don't think people ever cared less. A re-write wouldn't have hurt, perhaps bring in more comedy because this is not really working out. I'm not saying this movie totally blows, there are some cool scenes, but it's so incredibly redundant it can vanish into thin air every second.
