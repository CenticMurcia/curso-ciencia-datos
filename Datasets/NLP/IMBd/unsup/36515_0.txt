Made in the eighties so I was expecting a lot of this so called cult fav. Boy, was I disappointed after watching it. The effects are way below zero. When a face is pulled through a window you could notice that it is a latex face and the zombies are only zombie on their face and hands. The storyline is simple, I will give it straight away, a professor unwittingly unseals a cursed underground crypt, what happens next is that zombies are coming above the burial ground trying to eat those who are on the burial ground, end of script. So it appears on screen that we see the professor waking the dead and being killed himself. After wards the movie is simple, we see zombies arriving, following a victim, victim is killed, zombie is killed, zombies arrive, victim killed and so on and on. The only thing that is so called offensive is the freakish incestuous son. That part isn't for me offensive, we see him reaching for mothers skirt and underwear. Nothing more nothing less. Only at the end he's able to pull out mothers breast and suck it. Maybe the T&A in the beginning is the best part, filthy me.
