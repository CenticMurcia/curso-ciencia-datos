Ann Harding and William Powell are terrific in this strange little gem of a movie which runs the gamut from Pre-Code Drama to Screwball Comedy! (the closing dinner party scene is worth the price of admission). John Cromwell directs with a sure hand, especially in a great tracking shot involving the two sisters.<br /><br />It's incredible how modern films seem to lack any sense of sophistication and style in comparison with even lesser known films from the 30's like this one.<br /><br />A pure joy to watch.
