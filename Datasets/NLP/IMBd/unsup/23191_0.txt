I can't remember any of the other actor's besides Teri Hatcher and Dean Cain, who were horrible as Lois and Clark. She was too wimpy as Lois Lane, no humor, no aggression like Kidder, Bosworth, or Durance, Hatcher was dead to me. I like Margot Kidder (Superman:The Movie), Erica Durance (Smallville), and the lovely Kate Bosworth (Superman Returns). Dean Cain happens to be my mother's favorite Clark Kent and Superman, but to me, their was no difference with the way he acted as Superman or Clark. His characters weren't different compared too Christopher Reeve or Brandon Routh (Superman Returns.) Besides, Cain had a facial that said "Look at me! I'm SUPERMAN!" Loser! He looks really smug and stuck up. I've alway's loved Christopher Reeve, I watch Smallville (Tom Welling is my favorite T.V. Clark Kent, he's not Superman yet.) Lois and Clark is the worst Superman rendition ever! Watch the original Christopher Reeve Superman movies there are four of them on DVD. Watch Smallville. Go see Superman Returns. I see more of a resemblance between Dean Cain and Brandon Routh than Routh and Reeve. But, I like Routh more than Cain, A LOT MORE! I highly advise against watching Lois and Clark on DVD. Worst Superman story ever! "Hang up the Superman tight's Dean, and go pick your nose!" He's a jerk! I once read in an interview where he said concerning the t.v. series Smallville: "Clark is not Superman if he can't fly!" Yeah right! Tom Welling is a much better actor than you! He stands proudly next to Christopher Reeve! Like I said before, go pick your nose! You are not Superman! Chris and Tom are!
