I've been a big fan of Parker Posey ever since DAZED AND CONFUSED, and while I haven't been able to see all her films, I consistently enjoy her work. She reminds me of the actresses of the 30's and 40's like Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck, and Ginger Rogers, who had glamour but also a strong personality and presence. And the role of Jackie O in this movie certainly gives her a chance to go for it. And, to be fair, Posey is good at showing the pain under the bravura front. But she can't save this movie. The fact that it's a filmed play isn't a problem, nor is it being an incest comedy (after all, David O. Russell made a pretty good one with SPANKING THE MONKEY). No, the problem is it's all too obvious and overly symbolic, and the dialogue is annoying because it's not half as clever as it thinks. Also, while Genevieve Bujold is good as always as the mother, the rest of the cast stunk. I've heard Freddie Prinze Jr. is a nice guy, but he's got a long way to go as an actor. For a good Posey film, skip this and rent PARTY GIRL.
