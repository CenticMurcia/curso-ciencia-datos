"The Last Minute" is an abysmal film. I have seen some rather hideous films in my life, but frankly this one qualifies as one of the all time worst, particularly in light of the immense talent of writer & director Stephen Norrington, an otherwise fine cast, and some incredibly gifted technical people such as the editor and the cinematographer. Mind you, the production values are top-notch as are the performances by a terrific cast. Nevertheless, this pretentious as well as cynical commentary on fame and its fleeting quality for some unfortunate folks ranks at the bottom of the barrel. I sat through this ambitious film in its entirety because some very dear, close friends of mine loaned me the DVD and I made a commitment to them to watch it. Furthermore, I have enjoyed Norrington's other films: "Blade," "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen," and "Death Machine." "Blade" was a masterpiece, and I truly loved "The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen." Even "Death Machine" surpassed this depressing drivel. I can understand why this film did not receive a general mainstream release in the United States. Generally, I love all things British, but this dreadful film proved to be an exception to the rule. I don't even want to recount the plot or its place in the context of film history as I usually do in my other IMDb reviews. Yuck! Yuck! Yuck! I look forward to future Norrington films, and I envy anybody who can find anything remotely redeeming about this balderdash.
