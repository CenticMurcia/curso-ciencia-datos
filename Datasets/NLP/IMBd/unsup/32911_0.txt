The main problem with Kiwi movies is that the critics won't review them dispassionately. Go to virtually all the film sites and you'll read that this is some kind of classic. It is in fact a boring art-bullied waste of time. The performance by Fiona Kay is excellent, but she is the only fleshed-out character, and doesn't really behave as a normal person, more an adult's rather twisted vision of what a small girl might do and think. None of the other thinly-sketched characters are in any way sympathetic, the setting is within a singularly depressing sodden-hills landscape, and the screenplay is mean-spirited and unfathomable. Why for instance does the mother spend considerable time sewing a tutu for Toss and then blithely let her go out and play in the filthy, muddy outdoors in it? Why does the mother suddenly take up with a surly poacher who shows disturbingly pedophile designs on her young daughter? Are we supposed to find the differently-sane grandfather and his deranged, self-absorbed prattle somehow endearing? You want art, fine, here's your art. You want a proper movie, avoid 'Vigil' until Bad Movie Night.
