The first 15 minutes were pretty cool, but then the next 20 minutes were deadly boring. I thought too many characters brought the pacing down. There was no need for the other 2 cops. There was no need for a back story about Dwight Faraday. I would have found it more interesting had the character been dating the girl in morgue. This episode could have been awesome had it not been so packed for time. I think another 20 minutes, and a couple of sex scenes would have made this a keeper. Why not show more of the Deer Woman, and what she does to her victims? Why not show a sex scene? We already know it's a Deer Woman because of the title. Out of the 8 or so episodes I've watched I'd consider it the worst. Hopefully they release a full length version in the future. Actually I doubt that would even help it.
