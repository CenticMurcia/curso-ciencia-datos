This movie is a labor of love for its writer and director, who has created this autobiograghical film. A family with a 60 year old business is hit with many changes, and the film loving deals with how the patriarch handles these problems. You cannot help but enjoy the movie, as Danny Aiello once again plays a tough Italian father who tries to hold on. Jane Curtin plays his wife with care and success and the rest of the actors do a fine job, but it's Danny show. Though the themes are clearly universal, anyone from Brooklyn (or New York, for that matter) will feel an affinity for the characters and the settings, and there are a number of items in the film which give a New yorker a warm feel of familiarity. A little film, made in New York, by a New York, with New Yorkers. Go see it and support New York films.
