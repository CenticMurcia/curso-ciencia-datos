<br /><br />Children's Cartoons have long been showcases for slapstick silliness and poorly written humor. Doug stands out in stark contrast to the rest.<br /><br />This movie is sharply written, humorous with a message that is not laid on in a schmaltzy manner. The creative script is intelligent enough to keep the attention of adults while still entertaining children.<br /><br />Doug himself is a likeable protagonist. He isn't really one dimensional, the kid has feelings. Its fun to watch him deal with the pressures of dating, (albeit at the ripe young age of 12...) he and Patti actually have a sort of chemistry (as far as cartoon characters are concerned.) I was actually able to watch this movie without feeling silly for being there....its dark elements are nicely balanced out with some traditional cartoon absurdities. All in all, its a surprisingly intelligent, fun, ride.
