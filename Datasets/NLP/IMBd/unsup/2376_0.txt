I am a die hard fan of this series and part IV is my favourite. It is alot like the orignal but manages to surpass it. Angus Scrimm is at his best in this movie. Dont listen to all the negative feedback. Remember this film was made on a budget of only $650000....thats less than a million...The special effects were VERY GOOD. Bring on part V.
