I love this version of The Legend of Sleepy Hollow. Jeff Goldblum is the best Ichabod Crane I have ever seen. Unfortunately, I have only seen it maybe every other Halloween, shown on various local stations that don't advertise their lineups in the TV guide. Also unfortunately, the film is aging poorly so every year it gets a little fuzzier. But it doesn't feel like Halloween until you see Goldblum's stammering and Adam's apple bobbing and the lovely romance emphasized in this version. I'm crossing my fingers that it will be remastered and put on DVD. Am I crazy? Yes, but I can hope.
