For me, an admittedly huge Stones fan, this documentary was the stuff of legend. I could not believe it when I saw this in an independent music store. I had read quite a bit about this movie, but to actually see and hear it was awesome. <br /><br />The Stones, after an incredible run of great albums, Beggars Banquet, Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers, and Exile on Main Streeet, tour America in 1972. This tour is generally considered to be one of the most decadent, excess filled tours in rock n roll history. They hired Robert Greenfield to write a book, and Robert Frank to film it. Given nearly unlimited access, Frank tries to convey what it's like on a rock tour of this magnitude. I have read that some of the scenes were manufactured, such as Keith and Bobby Keyes tossing the TV out the window, the famous groupie scene on the plane, among them. <br /><br />Some of the scenes are a bit much. Heroin induced rants, rambling naked groupies, shooting up, all by the large entourage of hangers on that the Stones took around America with them. The Stones are in very few of these scenes, sub-titles on who these people are would have been nice. Some scenes are just bad, like the shot of what looks like Mick from the waist down, fondling himself, then you see Mick holding a camera, to supposedly make you wonder if that was Mick fondling himself. Was that supposed to be artsy?<br /><br />Sometimes Frank does break through on what touring can be. Keith trying to order a fruit plate from room service, or being having to sign autographs as he checks out of a hotel. Playing cards. Charlie morosely sitting in front of a TV.<br /><br />The excess as it takes it's toll. While Mick discusses business with Ahmet Ertegum, Keith is in the next room nodding off in the arms of some groupie, who also nods off, leaving them in a tangled mess. Chgarlie has said this tour is when the bulls..t level reached its highest point, particularly when Truman Capote and Princess Radish show up. That scene made me squirm, as these ancient, boring old farts glom onto the tour.<br /><br />Then there is the reason for the tour. THE MUSIC. The music f...ing rocks. The Stones play their tails off. From the moment Mick pops thru the curtain as it rises, and the band is blasting out Brown Sugar, till the encore when Mick leads out Stevie Wonder and his band,(the opening act)to do a killer medley of Uptight and Satisfaction, the music kicks. Watch Mick as he get his rocks off during All Down the Line, as he pushes Charlie to kick it out even harder. Mick Taylor playing beautiful, fluid, perfect lead guitar. I have about 6 bootlegs from this era of the Stones, and he amazes every time, musically the Stones at their best, yet watching him on stage, I can see why he left. Bill Wyman is a whirling dervish in comparison. Ron Wood couldn't carry his guitar case as a player, but I can see why Ronnie's personality has helped keep the band together.<br /><br />There is lots of other great stuff, Keith playing some very nice piano. Listening to a single of Happy, wondering if it should be in mono. Playing pool in a bar down south with a bunch of brothers. <br /><br />This is a great documentary of rock n roll on tour in the early 70's. I personally think the Maysles Brothers, who did Gimme Shelter, would have done a better job, and the shelved double album with the Stones and Stevie Wonder should definitely be brought out of the vault. <br /><br />I would recommend this to as essential viewing for all fans of rock n roll.
