I watched this film (not for the 1st time) on television on the last day of 2004. I hope the day of judgement is not nigh as I would hate it to be the last film I ever saw! I think this is the most over-rated film I have ever seen. With one or two exceptions, Raf Vallone and Michael Caine (though far from his best) the acting was disgraceful. The dialogue was laughable and not very funny. Difficult to believe that Troy Kennedy Martin was seriously trying to be funny! Those silly scenes with the doll-like girls who were probably considered the height of sexiness in the 1960's and the whole business of Noel Coward's 'Mr. Big' was ludicrous to the extreme. It was a truly awful film with a waste of not much talent and a whole gaggle of supporting actors who were incapable of rising above the rubbishy lines they were given. I laughed not once, I winced continually. Altogether a pretty poor show! I know that you should not take these plots seriously but this was impossible to even accept as a joke.
