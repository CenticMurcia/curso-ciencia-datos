Besides being dragged out and a little convoluted, this movie has inconsistencies that give away the ending early into the film.<br /><br />Mrs. Savage is simply too *nice* given all the trouble that's hit that fan. When you first see husband and wife together you assume she's clueless about the affair, just from their chemistry.<br /><br />It's bad enough her husband had an affair with a sexy young blonde , now he's in all kinds of legal dodo. No wife would respond as compassionately as her, without some occasional flare- up of anger and sarcasm from buried hostility.<br /><br />The ending is a mess with a way too drawn out confession. It made me regret sitting thought the film, as much as I like Harrison Ford playing a bad boy now and then. Maybe this role helped land him a much better character in "What Lies Beneath."<br /><br />The film should have simply ended with him finding the blood hammer and then let the audience's imagination fill in the rest. (which by the way is the LAST thing a killer would leave laying around without washing it off - duh)<br /><br />It's also unusually sad to leave the cute little son an orphan because of his dad's bad behavior. The movie's a bummer.
