I looked forward to watching sequel to 'Winds of War'. I must admit that it was not as good as 'Winds of War' The scenes are well done but the viewer seems to be just getting a narrative of all the major events in World War II including the Holocaust.<br /><br />Whereas 'Winds of War' arouses deep feelings and emotions but this one doesn't. Maybe I expected too much.<br /><br />On the positive side, Jane Seymour is much better then Ali McGraw in every aspect. So is the guy who played Hitler.<br /><br />In conclusion, these two series (Winds of War and War and Remembrance) should be very good for history students and scholars
