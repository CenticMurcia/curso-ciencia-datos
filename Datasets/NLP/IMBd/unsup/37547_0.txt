<br /><br />I have just seen this movie and have to say that it was pretty poor, I mean there are hardly any attacks and when there are they are all "stock footage" of actual sharks. There are also many pointless scenes in the movie, and many bits make the viewer laugh. I wouldn't bother with this film, and for starters the back cover of the film stuff it up by saying that it's a hammerhead when it's clearly a "great white".<br /><br />Oh dear.......
