"Lost reality" is laugh out loud hilarious. Its very well done. In fact, it's so well done you find yourself asking the whole time: "Is this real or not"?? <br /><br />After awhile you don't care and you just go with it......<br /><br />A great crowd pleaser!! What better way to spend an hour of your time than drinking with your buddies and watching these incredibly hilarious skits?? All the "shows" are outrageous, and they are all very funny. I particularly enjoyed the prostitute show (especially the way she bashes the men after having sex with them) and the "what would you do for money" show; where people are asked to do various disgusting things for $$$ <br /><br />Comedy never tasted so good.....
