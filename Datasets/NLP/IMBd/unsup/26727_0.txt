I love the show too,, And I was really made that they ended it right where they did, because we never get to figure out what happens like if Nicole really ran over Brooke or if she stopped just in time or if Brooke ran out of the way. I hate how they canceled the show right at that point, it drives me nuts thinking about it.I wish they had of even starting filming the 3 series with those actors now, even though most of them are in their thirties and a few of the older actors are dead, but it would still be interesting. And i definitely would watch it. I still do watch it every night, I'm addicted, i cant stop watching that show, i love it too much!
