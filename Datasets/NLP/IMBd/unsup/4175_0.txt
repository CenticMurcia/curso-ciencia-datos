How horror should be.<br /><br />I was fortunate enough to view this prior to The Call of Cthulhu at the Leeds Film Festival in 2006 and to be honest, Oculus was better.<br /><br />Goes to show that you don't need masses of blood and gore and elaborate sets to produce chilling horror.<br /><br />I found myself holding my breath on more than one occasion as well as looking for a non-existent cushion to hide behind!<br /><br />That's how good it is!<br /><br />The acting was brilliant and it was really well written - the story will appeal to any fan that loves a spine-chiller.<br /><br />Looking forward to other instalments and hoping to get this on DVD someday.
