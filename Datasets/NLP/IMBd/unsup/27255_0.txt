Michel Gondry is a very respective figure in video, movie and commercial business. He's a forty year old french man who still has childish eyes and he sees the world in a very unusual way. Have you ever dreamed about being strong, like Dave Grohl in Foo Fighters video or little, like Bjork in "Human Behavior"? To feel the warmth of a little space, just as the heroes of Massive Attack clip, or to see everything in a rhythm symbiosis, like in Chemical Brother's "Star Guitar" video? The right answer is "YES", but you could have seen it a long time ago, when you were about 12. Well, Gondry has been 12 forever, and a big 2-part documentary placed on this great DVD realize gives a rather detail explanation of everything that influenced on Gonrdy's unusual directing style. Besides this interesting documentary, this impressive double-sided DVD contains a lot of music videos, commercials and even a couple of short films! Not to mention amazing 52-page booklet. Ordinary human brain just can't stand too much of weird Michel Gondry's world, but if you try, you'll see, that world is a great place to be. And a main human problem is that we simply grow up, forgetting our childish dreams and become hungry for materialistic things. This stunning DVD will help you remember yourself, find yourself and enjoy one of the best videos ever made. It helped me already. No DVD collection would be full without "The Work Of Director^ Michel Gondry". Serious.
