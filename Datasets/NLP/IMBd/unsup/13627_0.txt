I kept in mind the technology available to the filmmakers in 1932, and was thoroughly impressed by the tale Capra manages to tell here. Stanwyck's character just needed a little thrill and found it on a boat trip to Havana, beginning a love affair that will test her discretion and tact throughout her life. Like a responsive car, the script follows each turn precisely and truthfully, our heroine responding to each new crisis the way we would hope she does. This is what makes the film so impressive; for such an early picture the characters all ring true and there are undeniable moments of early brilliance - my favorite being Stanwyck gunning down her husband to protect her lover's secret. A lot of Capra's favorite character actors he would use again and again in films to come show up here, making it a nice watch for fans of his work. Despite it's age, 'Forbidden' is still an impressive piece of work.
