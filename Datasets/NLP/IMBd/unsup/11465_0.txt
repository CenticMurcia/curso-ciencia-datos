Animation as it should be.<br /><br />Those who trashed it are too used to the Pixar style. They forget that at one time people had to actually draw this stuff. This animation style was last used in Pinochio. That's about 40 years.<br /><br />I saw this as a midnight hit in New Jersey back in '82. Finally got the DVD in Japan this year. Bargain price too. Brilliant stuff. Reminds me of the early issues. Also seems like issues of CREEPY or EERIE at times.<br /><br />I have the most fun trying to identify the SCTV stars' (John Candy, Joe Flaherty, Eugene Levy, Harold Ramis) voices.
