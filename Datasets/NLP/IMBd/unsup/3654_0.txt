I find it amusing that so many would bash this movie based on what they thought of Blockbuster movies that have come before it. In many posts, I've noticed people mention movies like Scarface, Reservoir Dogs, Fight Club, and Pulp Fiction. People, if every movie was that good, then those movies would not be considered great films. They would be your typical run-of-the-mill movie that anyone can accomplish. The reason they are difficult to achieve is because not just anyone can do it. I thought this movie was funny. Maybe to a lot of people in the poverty ravaged country of Mexico, it's not funny because of the next to life reality of a severed finger and a senseless beating to a sequester victim, but to us in the U.S who have been desensitized by all the smut we see at the movie theaters, this is a great movie. There were some really funny moments in this movie, including the bus chase scene and the romantic love scene at the end involving el cannibal and Cabos' wife. Also, Ana Claudia Talancon was aesthetically pleasing.
