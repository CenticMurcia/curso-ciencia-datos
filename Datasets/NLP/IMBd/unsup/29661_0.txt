First of all, I am not a fan of Bernie Mack and certainly not of Ashton Kutcher, but I liked this movie.<br /><br />While the movie is certainly predictable, it has its humorous moments. Although Bernie Mack plays a little overly protective father, he does not over play it to the point that it is just a ridiculous caricature. Ashton Kuetcher has a good haircut and looks like a nice clean cut male, not the long haired goof-ball we usually see.<br /><br />My favorite scene was the one at the dinner table. Not to give anything away, there were racist comments and racist jokes, but in good taste and fun. That scene shows that both sides can be racist in their own rights but still enjoy a good joke when it is truly funny.<br /><br />While not the masterpiece that "Look Who's Coming to Dinner" was, it was a whole lot more fun to watch.<br /><br />This is you typical formula romantic comedy, but it is heavier on comedy than romance.
