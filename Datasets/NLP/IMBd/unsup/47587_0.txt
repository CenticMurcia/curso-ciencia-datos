Sonny Landham plays a man who is locked up in an asylum after he leaves five people in the desert to die as his way of winning an argument. He escapes only to capture the people who he feels wrongly sent him to the asylum and leaves them out in the desert while he watch over them making sure they don't leave.<br /><br />After a good start where Landham escapes and picks up his targets the film stalls for over an hour as the group is stranded in the desert and begin to talk. Its dull and boring and you can;t wait for something to happen. A few things do, but not enough to fill out a 90 minute movie. If you'll like me you'll scream at the TV et hoping that something happens. By the time it finally does in the last fifteen or 20 minutes its too little too late.<br /><br />A waste of your time
