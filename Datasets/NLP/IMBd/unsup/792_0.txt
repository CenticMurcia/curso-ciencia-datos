The Scooby Doo is a very good show, though not as good as my childhood favourite Scooby Doo Where Are You? and this is coming from a biased Scooby Doo fan. The animation is perhaps a little dated by today's standards, but not that bad at all. The theme tune is perfectly fine too. Scooby and Shaggy have still got their fun and charm, and there are one or two appearances from Scooby Dumb. As much as I love Fred, Velma and Daphne, Scooby and Shaggy will always be my favourite characters, these two never fail to make me laugh. There are some very memorable villains like the Ice Cream Ghosts, The Gator Ghoul, Ironface and the Jaguaroo, and again, I can't decide which one's my favourite. All in all, not as good as Scooby Doo Where are You, but is still an improvement over most of the stuff with Scrappy in. 9/10 Bethany Cox.
