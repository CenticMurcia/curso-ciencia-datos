I saw this back in 1989 and its 1 week long stint at a local multiplex. Me and my friend were desperate to see a horror film. Well--that IS what we got! This is an anthology film about some annoying uncle (horribly overplayed) telling his bratty nephew some fairy tales to put him to sleep. Naturally these are all turned into "horror" stories. None of them were interesting, scary or much of anything. The acting sucked and the special effects were VERY sub-par. The only relatively interesting part was seeing Scott Valentine strip nude in the first segment. All you see is his butt and a VERY brief side view but he was young, handsome and in good shape. Also interesting to have male nudity in a horror film. That aside this was boring and just jawdroppingly stupid. In a way me and my friend sort of enjoyed it. It was so hopeless it was actually kind of fun! Seriously though a must-miss unless you want a textbook example of how NOT to do a horror film.
