... it had the potential to work. Combine it with an actor who apparently wants to make one of those films you can tell is specifically created for Oscar award nomination and ends up being cliché and simplistic and you get cliché, simplistic, and unrealistic.<br /><br />At times it did work. But I think this is a case where the director (also a primary actor in the story) got himself too involved and lost perspective.<br /><br />You could also say this mixes the various sniper/killer films popular at the moment with an xmas film. Either way, the end product would have benefited immensely from someone reviewing it who wasn't personally involved in the film and a bit more plot development.
