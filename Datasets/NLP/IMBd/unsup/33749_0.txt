Well, this is not much more then a big disappointment.<br /><br />The move start-out OK, a little melodramatic though, you get a really good descriptions of the characters and starts to absorb into them in good or bad ways.<br /><br />But as the movie accelerate and the characters personalities starting to evolve in to slighter better. The story writer choose to bring the story to a fast end by descending there good personalities into a level lower then ever.<br /><br />The most annoying is that the story could be good, and the message and thoughts that the movie sends is really important. But thats lost in a depressing slide-show with bad music and a pointless ending. With different ending 7 point, with more enthusiasm and different choose of music it maybe would been given 9 points from me.
