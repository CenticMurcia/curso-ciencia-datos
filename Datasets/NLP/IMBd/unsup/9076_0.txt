If you are a father, and you lose a son you will find this motion picture a little to hard to endure 'till the end of it. A good script, directed almost perfectly. I watch it once and i will always remember as i remember my child. The music was i may say, everything ... Actors doing such a great job... Andy Garcia playing so well that you may think that is not a movie but a Real TV story. A drama who can keep you with the eyes on it 'till the end. You'll never know what its gonna happened next. Dunno if i wanna watch it again. It was a movie that made me cry... something that its almost impossible for me. Maybe i'm a not a good person to comment this movie, because some of what happened there i lived and its hard to be equidistant, but it moved me so bad.
