THE BEST OF THE BEST This movie is fast becoming a classic. It was well written, acted and the cast was beautiful. Though the cast was of African American actors, this is movie for all ethnic backgrounds.It tells of a group of college friends that reunite for a wedding, but the wedding itself is not the story, its a semi-fictitious book written by one of the friends. Why is the book so paramount? Its actually a true account of events that had occurred between the friends when enrolled in college. The movie also gives an accurate depiction of quality of the up and coming African Americans in the entertainment industry. Everyone did a masterful job! I could not imagine anyone else playing in their roles. The directing was great and the ending was expected but moving. I cried!Terrance Howard should have been nominated for an award for best supporting actor. He made this film as realistic as your reunions with your families and friends. Don't miss this!
