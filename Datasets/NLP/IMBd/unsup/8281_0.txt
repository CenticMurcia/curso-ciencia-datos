I actually saw this movie as a child of about 10, and I loved how absolutely scary it was. I must say, that I wouldn't recommend that very young viewers are allowed to see it, as it could terrify and leave lasting fears in them. <br /><br />This is a very dark, very desperate movie, not to be missed. The acting is extremely accomplished, especially considering the ages of most of the cast. <br /><br />Lighting is used extremely effectively, making the viewer wonder what is coming next, or perhaps what might be being missed that might be essential.<br /><br />This movie still sticks in my mind 36 years later as one of the most effective dramas I've seen.
