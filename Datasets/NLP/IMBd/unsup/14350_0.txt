A fine adaptation of Robert Sherwood play about a group of people held hostage by gangsters at a roadside diner in the Arizona desert. The terrific cast includes Howard as a failed writer, Davis as a waitress with big dreams, Grapevine as Davis's sauce-loving grandfather, and Bogart in his breakthrough role of gangster Duke Mantee. The actors work well together, with Tobin and Harvey rather amusing as the bickering rich couple (he refers to her as "my dear idiot wife"). It is is very nicely directed by Mayo. We get an early glimpse of the tough-guy persona that Bogart would parlay into super-stardom. Unfortunately it got him typecast in gangster roles for years until his star turn as a "good" gangster in "High Sierra."
