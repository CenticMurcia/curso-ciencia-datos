Wow. I was really impressed by the pilot. After seeing the Smallville episode 'Aqua', and later hearing about a pilot being developed, I was very excited. I'm a pretty big Smallville fan, and I believe that Aquaman has the potential to be a very good series.<br /><br />Arthur 'AC' Curry (Aquaman) has his mother taken from him at an early age when their light plane crashed over the Bermuda Triangle. Arthur is raised in Tempest Keys in Florida, with more-than-special aquatic abilities - and the curiosity of what really happened to his mother. <br /><br />The pilot is set in present day and Arthur is a dive shop owner with his friend Eva. In the beginning of the pilot Arthur is actually arrested for supposedly freeing a bunch of dolphins from a theme park. Arthur later attempts to persuade Eva to believe him that the dolphins were some how 'calling' to him.<br /><br />I don't want to give too much away, but another character - McCaffery (who will try and convince Arthur of his true destiny), soon reveals himself, and Arthur will also encounter a creature from the deep. Another fantastic storyline is the matter of numerous missing persons from the Bermuda Triangle showing up around Mercy Reef.<br /><br />The pilot is very interesting and I really took a liking to the cast, in addition, the special effects were surprisingly impressive. It is just heartbreaking that Aquaman was not picked up in 2006. I can only hope the network will see the true potential in this series sometime in the future.
