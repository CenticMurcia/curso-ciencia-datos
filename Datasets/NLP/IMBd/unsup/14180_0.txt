Makeup FX master Tom Savini took the role of director for this entertaining remake of George Romero's zombie classic.<br /><br />Strangers must battle armies of zombies when they become isolated in a rural farmhouse.<br /><br />While this remake rather wisely sticks to the basics of the original film, it does differ at some points. Besides being in color and having much more graphic gore, the heroine is much tougher in this version which ultimately leads to a different conclusion than that of Romero's film. Thankfully these changes don't hamper this solid retelling, as it manages to keep the spirit of the original film. The action is strong, the special FX are great, the direction is slick, and there's a nice slice of spooky atmosphere over it all.<br /><br />The cast is a strong point as well. Tony Todd puts on a good performance, as does determined heroine Patricia Tallman. Tom Towles also does a good turn as a truly dis-likable refugee. Supporting cast McKee Anderson, William Butler, and Bill Moseley are also effective.<br /><br />While no horror film will probably ever live up to Romero's classic Night of the Living Dead (1968), this remake certainly doesn't try to. It just serves well as a fun and frightening homage.<br /><br />*** out of ****
