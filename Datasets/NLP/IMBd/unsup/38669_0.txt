I don't like the House series. I think these films were created for teenagers who can't decide whether they wanna watch horror or comedy. But they don't realize the House films fail in both genres. Episode 3, wisely re-named the Horror Show, was an exception because it starred the great actor Brion James (may he rest in peace) He made this film enjoyable and also the story had more horror in it. House 2 is a very dull thing. Two lowlifes hunt down a mysterious skull to keep a 170 year old alive. One of them looks a little like a Jim Carrey clone and pulls very stupid faces all the time. The other one looks like he's 15 years old. Great combination...not ! The land in a jungle and they're being chased by prehistoric birds. I kid you not ! When they come back to the House, they notice a little winged creature came with them and so did something resembling a green dog...And that is supposed to be FUNNY ?!? Well, it sure ain't horror. Before I started writing this review, I spent some time reading all the other ones, written by my fellow IMDb'ers. A lot of those guys will tell you to watch this film because of the good and original story !! ... Now, I am really confused. Did they see a different film, if you give any importance what so ever to a story...you'll see this ain't a good one.
