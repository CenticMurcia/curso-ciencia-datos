When several ships are attacked at sea by what appears to be a great whale, the navy asks Professor Aronnax for assistance in investigating the events. But the adventure is just starting for the Professor, his daughter and harpooner Ned Land when they are washed overboard and picked up by the mysterious and sinister Captain Nemo in a futuristic submarine. Based on the Jules Verne novel by the same name, the movie then tells of further adventures on board the Nautilus, and of a romance not included in the book.<br /><br />This movie was a disappointment in many respects. While I was impressed by the Nautilus, which looked just like a picture I remember from the book in my childhood, and some of the sets and scenery, the movie as a whole was not spectacular.<br /><br />I found that the acting was mediocre, and was annoyed by the romance triangle. The dialog was also okay, but not wonderful. Although there was nothing terrible about the movie, there was nothing really good about it either, and I guess that is what stays in my mind.<br /><br />Compared to other adaptations of Jules Vernes' works, this one is a disappointment, but might be worth watching once if there is nothing else on television.
