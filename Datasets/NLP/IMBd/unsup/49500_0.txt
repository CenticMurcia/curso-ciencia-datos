The only good thing about having rented this film is the opportunity to b**ch about it on IMDb with fellow victims. <br /><br />Where to begin? Maybe with the "femme fatale" theme, which seems to be a favorite of cheap, poorly written movies. Neve Campbell plays a heartless young woman who cares only about sex and power. Realistic? Only if you add some depth, history, and complex motivations, none of which exist in this movie. <br /><br />The sex scenes, which I admit I was looking forward to, were nothing but people rubbing against each other or rubbing against couches and moaning for unclear reasons, while Beethoven and Bach blared in the background. (Wow ... this must be an Art Film.)<br /><br />The gratuitous cameos by has-been minor celebrities ... the less-than-simple plot ... the lame attempts at humor ... Neve's charms and the interesting dialogue in one scene with Dominic Chianese are not enough to make up for the general turkeydom of this flick. I can only imagine that Roger Ebert raved about it because he likes Neve and wanted to give her flagging career a boost. Very sad.
