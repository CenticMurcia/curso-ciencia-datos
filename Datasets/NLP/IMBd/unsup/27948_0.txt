INDIGO is a wonderfully inspiring film that captures the heart as much as the imagination. I came expecting to receive a message, but soon found that what I was sharing with others in the theater was a transformative experience. What is most real about INDIGO is its raw spiritual presence, a missing ingredient that the millions of dollars spent on cinemagraphic "realism" in most other films never seems to deliver. Perfect strangers were hugging each other after this film! It is a wake up call - a prophetic challenge to Hollywood's "conventional wisdom" with layers of meaning that keep unfolding long after one has left the theater.
