Despite what others think, this film is one of the better shark movies in years, it has a good developing storyline, and a couple of likable characters, and at least the megalodon doesn't consist of discovery channel stock footage, like in that other pile of junk called shark attack 3, the film's CGI is acceptable and the cast does a great job with their performances, the storyline is slow moving but not boring in the slightest.<br /><br />Final verdict, its a decent shark movie with great CGI effects, great storyline and a great cast, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />7 out of 10.
