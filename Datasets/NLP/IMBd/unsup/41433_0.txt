Apart from the beautiful clothes, houses and landscapes, this overlong film goes nowhere very, very slowly. I must admit that I've never been a fan of D. H. Lawrence and this French production certainly faithful to its original.<br /><br />I love movies with a slow, contemplative pace, such as Visconti's, and am a decided admirer of European - particularly French - films, but this one just produced an endless stream of yawns. Its director has tried every trick in the book to create a "meaningful" movie: long shots, dreamy facial expressions, gurgling creeks, slow, al fresco sex, pseudo profound conversations. Nothing works. It's just pretentious tripe, so devoid of any interest that it may well get all kinds of Oscar nominations.<br /><br />My advice? Regardless of whether you are in the Hollywood or European movie camp, avoid this one.
