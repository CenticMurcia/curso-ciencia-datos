And I am now suffering from post traumatic stress syndrome. This movie was horrible. It was boring, unrealistic, and the acting was dreadful. The best part of the movie was the end credits because that signaled the end of my torture.<br /><br />Watching Gruner play the nice guy with moves of death and a heart of gold is wearing out its welcome. If I hear him say," I don't want to fight" one more time I will scream in frustration. He has potential, but he is picking the wrong scripts.<br /><br />There were so many things in this movie I could nitpick, I would be typing for days. The worst would be Gruner blatantly plugging his own line of athletic gear. Then there is the gratuitous nudity, the requisite nosy reporter, and the bad guy wearing black. Skip this or suffer like I did.
