Contagion, looked at as a serious or thought-provoking film, is horrible. The storyline and the "scientific information" given in the film is implausible and for the most part false. The movie starts slow, failing attempts to replicate opening scenes of high budget science fiction films such as The Matrix, and eventually evolves into what you might expect from the average Sci-Fi channel movie with low quality acting, choppy storyline, cheap special effects, no real climax, and the sporadic cheesy line thrown in. The most annoying aspect of the entire movie is its lack of scientific facts or supporting information (that is true), such as the movie's portrayal of the virus' effects on humans. Over all this movie's concept seems to be a bit played out and parts of the movie seem awkwardly squeezed and manipulated to fit PG-13 standards, turning this potentially serious sci-fi movie into a low budget comedy.
