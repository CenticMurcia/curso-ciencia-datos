Missing Brendan is an awesome movie. Anyone would love it because it's so interesting, and teenage girls out there: Adam Brody! Need I say more? Anyway, the setting is gorgeous and the acting is phenomenal, I highly recommend it! Go out and buy the DVD, you'll love it, I promise. Even though the movie deals with more serious issues, it's still very funny and you laugh a lot. It's a great combination of drama and a bit of comedy. Most ages can watch it, I'd say 13 and older is fine. I just really want to convince people to get this movie, because it's so interesting ans the storyline is so unique. It's also great for Adam Brody fans to see the acting change from this to the O.C. Two thumbs up!
