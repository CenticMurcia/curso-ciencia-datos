Saw this movie in Cali. at an advanced screening sponsored by the Regional Air Quality Management Board.<br /><br />My biggest problem with this show is that they play it off as a documentary, when it is NOT.<br /><br />Even the Tagline: "A real adventure in the coolest place on earth" implies documentary.<br /><br />The truth is, while every shot WAS taken in the arctic, and was NOT staged, the characters Nanu and Sela were "composite characters" comprised of MANY different animals that were filmed by the directors over their time in the arctic. Basically, the story was made up.<br /><br />Furthermore, many of the shots that we see were "stock footage" (this is obvious, as the quality is SIGNIFICANTLY lower). Also, the editing was poor, and only a child would think that the scenes truly played out the way they were portrayed.<br /><br />The sound is also poorly edited, and, while I can not be SURE, I would guess that many of the sounds did not occur as shown in the film (pull my flipper??!!) Also, I think Queen Latifah's lines were poorly written, and she is a poor narrator to boot.<br /><br />Basically, I think that the issue being tackled here is FAR too important for the directors to FABRICATE a story to show it. Tell it the way it is. If you can't follow 1 bear and 1 walrus, DON'T pretend you did. We can STILL get the point that global warming is hurting the arctic, and that we can prevent it . . . you don't have to make things up to tell us about it!
