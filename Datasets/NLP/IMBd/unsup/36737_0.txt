i had to see this movie today.Gosh,the screenplay must have been created by barney..so silly situations and a Tea leoni trying to emulate a scream queen from a z-movie(let's say...superstition,that's a good example!!!)Adam Sandler with this goofy hairdo that makes him looks like Fat Albert(i think that eight crazy nights is better than this crap fest)and paz Vega...baby,you are gorgeous in these photos from the Spanish edition of GQ,but in this movie,you acted like La India Maria...i think i'm going to faint,i can't support remembering this poor attempt of a movie.The latinoamericans are not so silly and booby faced,do you know?
