The story is about three prisoners and their life in jail captured by a documentary directer Juhi Chawla. As per as acting is concern: Jackie Shroff is average,Nagesh Kukunoor and Gulshan Grover is good,Juhi Chowla is brilliant and above all Naseeruddin Shah is excellent as usual.The script of the film is well written and directed it in a good way. The story comes to end with an unpredictable twist and we can see that how a single incident connects three different peoples for ever just like three walls in a room. The ending doesn't destroys the movie, it makes much more better. I saw almost all the films but this is probably the best movie directed by Nagesh Kukunoor.
