This movie was beyond awful. It is ironic... The original SLAP SHOT was , in my opinion , the best sports movie of all time. This lame piece of garbage is the worst. The Hanson Brothers were fantastic in the first movie and they clearly did this movie for a paycheck. Can not say I blame them, easy money is easy money. The movie went nowhere. The plot was unrealistic and just a boring , depressing movie. The Hansons who were likable goons transformed to boring businessmen and that is criminal. That youthful exuberance was gone . This movie made no social commentary as the original had done. This makes all the ROCKY Sequels look like Shakespare. What can I say , a very unfunny flick, uninteresting flick, with lousy actors. The smartest thing Paul Newman ever did was turn down reprising his 'Reggie Dunlop' character from the original .
