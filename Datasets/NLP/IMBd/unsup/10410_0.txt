One of the most original films ever made, the idea of the invisible camouflage that the Predator uses is unique and well done. Good special effects for a movie from the 80´s.<br /><br />**##SPOILER AHEAD!##** Along with The Terminator, this is Arnold´s best action movie. He portrays Dutch, a leader of a special rescue team. John McTiernan actually succeeds at making the forest a really claustrophobic place, increasing the sensation of suspense and fear. As the victims go one by one, the feeling of "death around the corner" increases more and more. Best line in this movie: "If it bleeds... we can kill it!" Sincerely I was expecting more from the ending, but overall a good movie. The best character in the movie IS the Predator. Some gory images in this one, specially that scene where the Predator takes the skull from a soldier. **##END OF SPOILER##**<br /><br />Good Sci-fi movie, deserves a 9 out of 10
