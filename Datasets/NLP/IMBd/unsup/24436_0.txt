This is a wonderful, well-acted, movie. In fact, it is quite a pleasant surprise. What I anticipated to be just another made-for-TV soap opera was a movie with a story about people whose lives seem ordinary but are actually special. The characters are likable and the action centers around a bar in New Jersey where the main characters, two women searching for relationships, go to meet men. This is a scenario that a lot of people can relate to, especially in a society where people are increasingly isolated and are alienated from the the community around them. For this movie is about the devastating effects of social isolation on people who don't want to be alone and after a lot of struggle finally realize that all they have are each other.
