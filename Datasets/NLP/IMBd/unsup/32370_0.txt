I wouldn't rent this movie. It's a complete wasting of time. Like a vacuum, the movie message just keeps sucking. The writer is persistently shifting the burden of his own psychological problems onto the audience's shoulders, and casually trying to push his old-fashioned beliefs of a 'fate' stuff into your mouth. Behaviour of protagonists is far from being natural, and everything rings hollow. Obviously, no one really loves anyone in this sombre dismal performance. (I actually have to add something, despite the fact that I said all. The reason of it is there is a requirement of 10 lines of the text as a minimum length for comments. I think this is not in a fair and good spirit of a web-site to make such a requirement since it violates the freedom of expression, like, I personally think I've already said what I wanted to say bout the film. ...Well, after I added this flame, I suppose there will be 'nuff lines to finally display my modest comment on the movie.)
