I enjoyed One Last Dance based on the play Without A Word, which is a perfect description for this independent drama - a celebration of contemporary dance in America. Independent film is huge today. Lucky for us! Here, so much is communicated without a word; dance is central, the plot, not sacrificed but secondary. This film lingers without languishing, it draws you in. Emotionally charged, it captivates - truly a thing of artistic beauty! See this film if you love to watch dance. See it if you dance. See it if you want to feel the movement, the heartbeat, the spirit of a dancer. It is a love story. The most delightful unexpectedly tender moments for me were between parent and child. Kudos to the Director, and don't pass up the insightful commentary on the DVD!
