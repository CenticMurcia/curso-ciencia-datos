i have read a lot of reviews slating this movie but i found this to be tense engrossing thriller. Medical student Marty(Justine Bateman)needs a roommate after her flat gets broken into so she takes in Alec(Adam Baldwin). At first he seems like a nice young man,he likes opera,cooks and seems like the perfect roommate till he decides he wants Marty for himself. He begins changing the locks,transforming the flat and finally locking Marty in a padded room.Anyone who gets in his way gets dispatched by various means which include killing someone with a tyre iron. Justine Bateman ,an actress we just haven't see enough of, is great as Marty who thinks she can look after herself till she realises things are out of her control. Sure we have seen this all before in various movies but this film is lifted by Adam Baldwin who is more creepy and evil than one can possibly imagine and he certainly scared the hell outa me. I like the way this film used violence and psychology to put it's point across and it certainly puts me off ever taking in a lodger. Deadbolt i give 7/10
