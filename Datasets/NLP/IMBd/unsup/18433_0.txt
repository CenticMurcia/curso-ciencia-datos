The fighting scene is very cool! What's more, wife(or, fiancee) and kid are always best choices of adding humanity to the story. Yes, I always like this part. Though made before the WTC crashed, this is still a good reflection on highjacking and "sub-jacking". I wonder if these movies provided guides for terrorists.
