As I read the user comments for this movie, I'm shocked at the rave reviews this movie is getting from some users. This movie has an interesting premise, but it ultimately fails because of poor character development and the unappealing actors who portray them. I understand that as the movie goes on we are supposed see the toll these murders are taking on the grad students, but the characters are so unlikeable that I don't know why we should care.<br /><br />As somebody has suggested, this movie doesn't know what it wants to be -- a wacky dark comedy or a morality tale. If it was the former, perhaps then we could ignore the huge plot holes. There are also storylines that seem to go nowhere. What's with the kidnapping storyline? And why all the sex scenes between Annabeth Gish and her Jewish boyfriend? It's just all bee-zar.<br /><br />2/10
