Just watched this, loved it.<br /><br />Truly a refreshing change from the normal sort of tosh that is churned out by the bucket-load in Hollywood.<br /><br />Having read a few of the posts with regards to the end of the movie, I thought I'd throw my hat into the ring too.<br /><br />The end is deliberately ambiguous, relying on the moral standpoint of the viewer to define it. If you felt that the diktators got help from the guy they kidnapped in order to get away and continue their work, then you're probably like me - part-hippie, part-revolutionary.<br /><br />If you felt that the diktators merely predicted that the guy they kidnapped would call the police, then you're probably one of those upstanding citizens we all hear and read about.<br /><br />The truth is what you make it.<br /><br />Some people never change. ;)<br /><br />7.7 / 10
