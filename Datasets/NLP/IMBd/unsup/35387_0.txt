Absolutely awful. I would have given it a "1" but the sole redeeming feature is that it is family safe -- PG rating was probably for the drunkard rock star. Apparently each review is supposed to be 10 lines?? OK, what else can I say. The girl's outfits were very silly. The dual role by Carol Kane was annoying. The story was pitiful. The rockers were lame. Our 3-year old laughed at the destructive parts. I chuckled 3 or 4 times, but it got painful to watch at about minute 20. Is this enough text, I wonder... Nope, still not enough. What on earth is there to say about a lame kids movie? Oh, I know. It did prompt us to rent the My Fair Lady DVD, so that's something good that came out of it.
