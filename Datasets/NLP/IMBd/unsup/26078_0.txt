This was just so crisp and the dialogue so sharp that I actually finally registered at IMDB just so I could publiclly praise this film. The looks, the leers, the wigs! What's not to love? Rented the DVD & after hearing the directors comments I must say I'm so glad that his DP told him he couldn't have white walls. The sheer b*lls out saturation of those colors totally made the movie for me. If they ever really do decide to re-make Valley Of The Dolls the only logical helmer choice is Richard Day. I can't believe there are only those two quotes from the movie. But perhaps the barbs are best savoured in their proper context. In any event, lovers of drag queens, bits of absurdism, and satire should snap this movie up.
