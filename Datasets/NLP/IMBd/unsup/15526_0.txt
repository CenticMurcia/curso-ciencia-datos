Too bad this didn't get picked up. The plot was pretty interesting, and they set up a lot of potential story lines from the first episode. It didn't seem like they felt at all bound by the Aquaman mythos from the comics, but that's fine with me.<br /><br />The guy playing Aquaman was so-so, but his gal-pal Eva was smokin' hot. She would have quickly become a real 'it' girl -- hopefully she still will. Heck, even the evil monsters were drop-dead gorgeous.<br /><br />I wish we could have seen where this show was headed. They put it up on iTunes, though, so maybe if there's enough outcry for it, they'll reconsider.
