I swear at the beginning with the parents, I felt like they were just smiling too much and it looked like they were just going to say clich√©' things like "Oh, you kids!" or "That's coming out of your allowance" while smiling at the camera on cue.<br /><br />Now, granted, this is a movie for kids, but I think we are starting to insult our kids just a little bit. I mean, we do actually have a decent cast for a kid's flick, but these adults really sunk beyond the kid's humor. While it has some good morals and another happy ending, just the jokes got old and I think we are just insulting our kid's intelligence and humor.<br /><br />1/10 <br /><br />PS: Loni, lay off the fake tan!
