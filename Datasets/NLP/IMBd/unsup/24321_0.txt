I thought that "Nola" was a step or two down from movies like, "The Phantom" and "Mystic River". She should stick with feature films on the big screen and musicals. Isn't lifetime movies usually cast with actors that have been around for awhile? All I know is that after seeing "The Phantom" and then "Nola", I was just so let down:-( She seemed almost "average", which she is anything but!! I am hoping that the "Posiedon" will be great, with all of the great cast, including Emma. Kurt Russell and Josh Lucas are wonderful in almost everything they do. Well, I hope I didn't offend anyone, but I had to speak my mind. Emma is just too pretty and talented to be cast in an average, boring role!
