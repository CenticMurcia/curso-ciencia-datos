This man and his family endure, endure, endure and support, support, support through some of the most trying times a family could go through. He inspires the same sort of loyalty and hard work in his employees and friends.<br /><br />It is so refreshing to see a movie about good people not compromising their values under pressure, although it nearly never goes the way they plan.<br /><br />It's easy to believe that the man who pioneered all these safety features, Preston Tucker, would be a man of heart, and that is how he is portrayed here. In fact that is what this movie is; a film with heart.<br /><br />Watch this but be careful! If you get too close you may catch his dreams.
