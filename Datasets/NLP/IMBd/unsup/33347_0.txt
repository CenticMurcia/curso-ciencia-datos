The Frightening was indeed BAD!!!The acting I do have to admit was well,but the story line,characters and death scenes were either stupid,mediocre,or unexplainable.There are other films that are the same genre and fall under the same category as this one,and they all are way more superior.The concept however,was still just a bit creepy.If what had happened in the film happened to you,you would have to put yourself in the main character's shoes.Most of the ways people died were also avoidable.It just seems as if the director told them that they needed to act so stupid in order to make people like this film.Avoid this film as much as possible,but if you absolutely feel the urge to pick it up off the shelves one day,I warn you with the deepest concerns a person can have for another.
