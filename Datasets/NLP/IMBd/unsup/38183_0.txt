What a disappointment after the first one. I guess when they put part 2 on a movie it usually is bad. Well, this one is choppy, and by the end of the film one can not believe they sat through this. I argued with my friend Fred about this one, but he could not change my mind. I found the Karate, which is trade mark for his films, not that great. Well, I guess we can see why he's on TV now, the steam started to run out in his film career. Good luck Chuck, I hate seeing you in Turkeys like this one.
