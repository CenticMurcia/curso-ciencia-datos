This movie does not even try to capture to mood of the drive-in. It is just a place where people go to get killed. With a character actor like flowers, you would expect some attempt at characterizations, but his own talents are not reflected in the script. It is really hard to believe that people thought the "Plan 9 from outer space" was worse than this. That movie is a masterpiece compare to this one.
