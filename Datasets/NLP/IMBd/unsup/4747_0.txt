Benjamin Barry is an advertising executive and ladies' man who, to win a big campaign, bets that he can make a woman fall in love with him in 10 days. Andie Anderson covers the "How To" beat for "Composure" magazine and is assigned to write an article on "How to Lose a Guy in 10 days." They are sure to meet each other in a bar and both tries to get what they want without knowing what they are really doing.<br /><br />This is one of the funnier romantic comedies, if you'd like some laughs. There are many laugh-out-loud moments here and there. The humor was witty and slapstick, which I love in comedies.<br /><br />The chemistry between Kate Hudson and Matthew McConaughey is great. this film is like the battle of the sexes.<br /><br />Don't watch this film if you want lies between romance but if you would like to have a really good time, then this is the film.
