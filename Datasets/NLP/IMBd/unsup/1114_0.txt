Ms. Arquette is hot...aside from that...she has created a film that is one of the finest films about music that I have seen. <br /><br />The lady who inspired Toto's big hit...speaks with a whole lotta musicians about the business of music. They all appear to be coherent...as in Sex...Sobriety...and Rock & Roll.<br /><br />The majority of the artists have been well known for over thirty years...and some of them almost did not make it this far. I am glad that they did. I just hope that Joni Mitchell does not end up like Sammy Davis Junior. <br /><br />I could have watched another several hours of Ms. Arquette's interviews...perhaps not in one sitting...but certainly in two parts.
