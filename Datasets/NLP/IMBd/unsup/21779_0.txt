If you have ever traveled India as a Westerner, considering yourself to be aware of cultural ignorance and stigmata and have discovered that world full of variations, full of true spiritually in every aspect of life (living, death, beauty, ugliness, dirt, colors, poverty and richness), this film will touch you in the most embarrassing way.<br /><br />I have never seen any Wes Anderson film before, in fact I hoped to see a film which makes a clever and funny statement about civilization torn lifestyle .<br /><br />But all I saw was a shallow college movie, taking place in an India which does not exist like this, depicted in a very insulting and tactless way.<br /><br />The plot was hardly fathomable. An upper-class family fell apart some years ago or something... and tries a reunion somewhere on a trip from Radjasthan to Tibet? The three main character's adventures seamed, apart from their stupidity, straight out of a puberty driven boy's daydreams, including conquering princess-like Indian girl servants , rescuing kids of a village from a bridge destroyed by the power of nature, encounters with poisonous snakes and tigers, romantic dates on a Paris rooftop etc.<br /><br />All boring, I hardly laughed once. A film which deepens stereotypes and which is a loss to everybody who is expecting a somehow intelligent or funny film!
