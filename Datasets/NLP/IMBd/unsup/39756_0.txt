Disaster Zone Volcano in NY is about a mad geologist that tries to harness geothermal power under NY to provide unlimited power. He does it under the disguise of a water tunnel and almost makes it. Instead, he unleashes the lava that starts destroying NY. Just like the original Volcano in LA, they find a way to deal with it. The acting just didn't quite make it for me, always a little too much or too little emotion. The characters just never became real to me. The effects were cheap, but adequate. Over all its not too much of a waste of time so I would watch it once just to say I did. Hopefully they will come out with one that's a little more original.
