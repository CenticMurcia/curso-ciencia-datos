I loved the first Michael Davis movie, Eight Days a Week. It was charming and cute. The second one was mostly a rehash of the first but pretty good. This one though is truly awful.<br /><br />The movie tries really hard, all Michael Davis movies do, but the level of humor for the most part is really crass and hackneyed. What was cute and clever in the first two is now bland and bitter.<br /><br />I wanted to at least like this movie, but there is so much here that is truly awful and/or stupid. I could go on, but I won't.<br /><br />Check out Eight Days a Week and 100 Girls. Avoid this clunker.<br /><br />
