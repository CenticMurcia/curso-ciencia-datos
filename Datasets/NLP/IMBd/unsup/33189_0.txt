Written and directed by Al Randall, DARK FIELDS is a predictable slasher flick. At times irritating, but does have its elements of suspense and fright. Five teens were on their way to a killer concert; but run out of gas. Zach(Brian Austin)and jock Josh(Eric Phillion)are irritating as hell with their degrading jokes. Taylor(Jenny Scott)is the leggy hottie with the extra tight low rider jeans. Justine is the off and on again sexpot...off and on IS the best description. Drew(Ryan Hulshof)is the dullard that ran out of gas in the middle of nowhere of course. Seeking gas and a place to warm up from the cold, the teens knock on the wrong door of a deserted looking farm house that does have one sole occupant that has a big ass ax to grind. A missed killer concert, but a date with a psycho killer and a night of terror is more than expect. Randall appears as Farmer Brown.
