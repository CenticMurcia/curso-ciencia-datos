Make sure you are rested and had lots of coffee before watching this one.<br /><br />It may be a little slice of reality, but even my life isn't this boring. The witty banter turns your stomach after a while. You really want to give all these guys a good slap to shut them up. The movie is full of so-so 'stars' who are all capable of better than this piece of work. The dialog and acting are so weak Levinson must have dozed off just in time to yell 'cut, it's a wrap'. What was he doing while all this was going on? What was he thinking when he wrote this? The clothing looked as though it was from the 60s not the 50's. The music, though good, seemed to be inserted as just a device to try to save a bad movie. The camera work and sound were actually very good but there's no substance to this movie.<br /><br />I'm glad to see that Ellen Barkin has done something to improve her looks. She looked awful, no, ghastly in this movie.
