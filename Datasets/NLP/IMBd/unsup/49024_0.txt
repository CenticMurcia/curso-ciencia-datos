This is what happens when creative people think they can do anything and it will work. Its also what happens when "hot"celebrities are allowed to make a joke thats nothing but a self serving in joke.<br /><br />This is a bunch of stories, by different directors none of which is very good. Trying to figure out which segment is better is sort of like trying to figure out which pile of garbage is the best.<br /><br />If you've never heard of this film, I'm not surprised since the film was barely released to theaters. It almost never plays on TV, so unless you've sought it out, something I can't recommend, you've never seen it.<br /><br />Ultimately, other than for money the only reason I can think this was made was so that the directors would know that they never could make a worse film.<br /><br />3 out of 10
