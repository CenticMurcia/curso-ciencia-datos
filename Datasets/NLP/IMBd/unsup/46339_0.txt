AXE is about a young girl and her invalid grandfather, whose country house is invaded by a trio of killers on the run from the cops. In need of a place to hide out after inflicting a fatal beating and unnecessarily tormenting a convenience store clerk, they make themselves at home as the depressed girl, Lisa holds her own by offing the guys one by one with many axes that always seem to be in reach. Written and directed by Frederick R. Friedel, also known as Lousy R. Director. He even acts in this movie, if you can believe it! The gore is minimal, the acting is nonexistent, and it is an overall forgettable movie. Don't bother...
