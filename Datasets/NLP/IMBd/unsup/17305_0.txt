I also saw this movie uncut on T.V. Ontario. I could not change channel. I found it very entertaining. This would be one I'd love to own and am just sorry that I did not use my p.v.r. to record it. I liked the idea of using the boy to go for help. I just wonder how a man could live with himself knowing he was betraying his friends and his country. I thought it very fitting for the woman who discovered he was a German to use one of the Germans' guns to kill him.<br /><br />Who was the narrator at the beginning and end? I'd like to know more about him.<br /><br />Everyone says it is propaganda.Did not the Germans also have their own propaganda? Propaganda or not I am glad I saw it.
