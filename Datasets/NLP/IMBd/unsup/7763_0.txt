Stay the hell away from anything that William Victor Shotten has done, not because it's cheesy, or because the stories are terrible, or because the cast's performance makes you physically ill, but because he makes even the worst YouTube directors look like Peter Jackson, hell, he even makes Uwe Boll look like Peter Jackson.<br /><br />There was nothing good about this movie what so ever. I was bored, the entire time. I want to see an indie movie at least match the original Night of The Living Dead. Nowadays, the ease of making a NoTLD-type movie have significantly decreased. Jesus William, buy some meat from your local butcher or something, don't waste our time.<br /><br />Oh, and apparently William Victor Shotten has a new movie out, Sabbath (www.sabbaththemovie.com). Just finished watching it, just realized that it was his movie. Stay away, incredibly boring.
