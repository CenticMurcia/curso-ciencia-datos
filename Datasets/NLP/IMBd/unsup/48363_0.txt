I've seen first 60 minutes of this movie and it was the longest movie hour ever. The concept of this movie is weak, the bad guys are boring, very unfunny - the good guys totally lack any charisma, and their pranks and jokes are very week to make this movie valuable. The movie is just a sandwich without anything saucy in it. Scenes are busy, unoriginal, plot is hysterically stupid. This movie is anything but even remotely funny comedy. The natural chemistry in "the good guy-good girl" is misisng here, too it doesn't come out of the concept, the main character in my opinion failed in fitting into positive role, somebody viewer could be interested in or laugh at. I normally like easy and dull comedies - for example scary movie series - but this failed even for me. This was below any college movie where bunch of nerdy guys want to get laid. I am greatly disappointed in this title. My recommendation would be to avoid this one.
