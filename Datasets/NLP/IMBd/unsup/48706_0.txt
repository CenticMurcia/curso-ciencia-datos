I watched this movie and tried to put Finding Nemo and, even, A Shark Tale out of my mind. Unfortunately, it was impossible considering the number of failings that this film had.<br /><br />You know those sticker activity books that you buy for your kids, where they can place characters/creatures anywhere they like to make their own story? That is what this movie is. There is no sense of place, environment or even interaction established through the audio/visuals.<br /><br />The central tale concerns a small fish who lost his parents (awwwwww) and then meets a lovely girl at the reef, only to have her proposed to by a big, bad shark and then he realises that he has a month to get trained up and ready to challenge that shark, for better or worse. Like The Karate Kid, but with fish.<br /><br />This review is not a good one so let me just rattle off all of the bad points. NONE of the vocal talent engage us in any way whatsoever, the animation is as poor as anything pre-Pixar, the jokes are almost uniformly embarrassing and pretty much everything here is designed to put you off the movie. Oh, there are a few fart gags - whoop dee dooo! NOT family fun and not enjoyable for anyone from any generation, in my opinion. Avoid. I gave it a 3 because some individual frames in "the haunted shipwreck" looked nice. Avoid. Avast. Avoid.<br /><br />See this if you like: Fish, The Karate Kid, more fish.
