ajith has come with a refreshing movie and although it has a weak story yet it was entertaining. Looking at three ajith was good. Twin son and a father seems old trick but was given fresh injection by KS Ravikumar. Any movie by KS RAvikumar, one can hope for a very entertaining past time. The movie starts a bid slow at the beginning but once you start to confuse why the son is doing all the crap then it takes off. Enjoyable.Ajith really brings out his act especially on the soft character. An entertainment movie for all except for some rape scenes. Definitely a go for Ajith's fan. Plus look out for the final scene after the director say goodbye. tells you a lot of hidden story.
