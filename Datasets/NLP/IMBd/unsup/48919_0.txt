OK...I think I missed something here. Not to mention I did like the ending on this at all. I watched this a least three time already and is still lost. Was Roger supposed to be some kind of under cover terrorist driving around in that cab? OMG...did I misinterpret this film or what. I keep watching and watching and I'm still lost. The ending could have been better. I'm still looking for more. However i did read the synopsis on this and it was nothing like I thought it would be. Overall there may have been some good shots here but I was very disappointed. And if I had wasted my money to go see this in the movies, I'd asked for a refund...No,no,no better yet... I would've demanded a refund. You disappointed me in this one Guenveur.<br /><br />Grumble
