Wow! What can I, say about this movie that it won't say about itself half way thru? Starting at the end and working back the first thing I, take issue with is the dedication at the end credits "To Walter Lord" the one human who strove to explore and find the truth about the wreck of the Titanic and all things related to it (his uncle was captain of the California, the ships captain charged with not coming to the aide of the Titanic, finally cleared of the charges after his death).<br /><br />From the horrible computer generated graphics that are supposed to be the rovers inside the Titanic, to the stupid computer generated portholes showing the actors inside the diving equipment this work of fiction, sprinkled with just enough facts to make it try to appear genuine is overworked overacted and not very truthful. At the very least its not very accurate. The most humane thing I, can do is to tell anyone reading this that if you want a more accurate and truthful representation of the events of that night simply go to the store and get a copy of Walter Lords "A night to remember" it may be black and white but it does get to the truth of the matter. If you want to find out about what happened to the ship since it sank I, would suggest the A&E movie "Titanic: Death of a dream" with Dr. Robert Ballard, Walter Lord, The living (at the time) survivors of the shipwreck and narrated by David McCallum. Since i'm spouting off about this movie and making recommendations about other movies your probably asking what do I, know about it? Simple, I've studied this ship and dreamed of raising it since I, was a child in the 1960's of course these dreams were dashed when Dr. Ballard found the wreck in pieces. I, never gave up reading and researching this and other shipwrecks.
