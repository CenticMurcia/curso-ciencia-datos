Of all the character study movies, most of them are boring. However, Bob Rafelson's "Five easy pieces" was, in my opinion, the most boring of all. In fact, I didn't really see what he was getting at. All I saw was Jack Nicholson playing an extremely depressed man, Karen Black dressed up to be made to sexy as his dumb girlfriend and then there was the rest of the cast. The only good element in this movie is the timeless diner scene which shows just how good an actor Nicholson is. But otherwise, I think it's more of a biography of about a year in a man's life than a character study. I truly and honestly don't think it's worth a watch unless you're a huge Jack Nicholson fan and even if you are, you should watch simply to see the hilarious diner scene.
