this was a great funny movie but it wasnt Adam Sandler's best movie. Overall it was a great movie for everyone, funny andromantic, it had me laughing thru most of the whole movie, i personally liked Adam Sandler best in Big Daddy or Happy Gilmore, i havent seen Mr. Deeds yet but it does look hilarious
