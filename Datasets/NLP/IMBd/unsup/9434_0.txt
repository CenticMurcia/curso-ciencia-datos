'No Good Deed' as the DVD of the film was titled here is an average adaptation of a short story of the 'noire' classic Dashiel Hammet. It is not a coincidence that many of the clichees of the genre are repeated here - the platinate blonde, the sophisticated evil criminals, the good old lady who is not really who she seems to be, etc. The crime part of the story is not very catching, and the really interesting part if the zig-zag the main female character is doing between the different men in the story. Milla Jovovitch is very good in this film, reminding me the role Kim Bassinger got an Oscar for. Also there are quite a lot of mis-matches and not everything makes perfect sense in the plot, the result is over all an agreeable mix, and a fair entertainment. 7/10 on my personal scale.
