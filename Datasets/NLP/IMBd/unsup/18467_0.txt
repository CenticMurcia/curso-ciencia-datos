This wonderful story is bought to life by the BBC in this fabulous dramatisation. Collin Firth makes a wonderful brooding Darcy and Jennifer Ehle makes a great leading lady of Elizabeth Bennett. The humour of the book is also carried through with the banter of Mr and Mrs Bennett which makes compelling viewing. The setting and buildings that are used are very much in keeping with the story and helps to illustrate this fabulous story. The dances are great as they are the traditional dances of the time and are a key event which it would be! The watcher feels as if they are almost there and could imagine walking into the story - well, I certainly can! The casting is fabulous as are the dresses and I could watch it over and over and still watch it again. The BBC have done a fabulous job and I would wholeheartedly recommend it.
