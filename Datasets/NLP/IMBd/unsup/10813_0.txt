Big Bad Wolf is a werewolf film which has the boobs and gore that go great together for a werewolf film like this. The movie was really good for a low budget horror movie and the storyline actually made me want to keep watching it. I actually didn't like the whole werewolf costume but the special effects people made it look realistic and i liked it. If your a fan of Kimberly J. Brown then you'll love her in this movie when shes always cussing up a storm somewhere along the film. The gore was excellent including the boobs and the big body count. I suggest this film to anyone who loves werewolf films with boobs and gore. Even though on the DVD there's not a lot of special features for the film but otherwise the film itself was a great gore fest that keeps you wanting to watch it and besides there's great actors and characters in the film.
