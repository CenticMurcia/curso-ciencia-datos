no no no no no no no!!! Oh my what a let down, promising trailer till you hear one of the actors speak, then its worse than your daytime soap. The film ain't much better, on the plus side the CGI effects are first rate, from ships to Lightsabers, the extras in their Stormtrooper costumes look the part (at times), made for 20 grand, doesn't look it, they should really stop boasting about this , there's a lot of film makers who could make a very good feature for the same amount, I'm a star wars fan, and love watching the fan movies, but I've seen far better done with far less. only saving grace is the CG, thumbs up to the production house who done them, and biggest crime is to see the great john Wlliam's music being used. Complete let down. avoid!!! (sorry bout all the bashing)
