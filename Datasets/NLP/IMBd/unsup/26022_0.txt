I was very disappointed at HM2. I saw this movie since I was impressed by the visual effects in HM1. I hope that the special effects will be better than the first one. However, after seeing this movie, I found that the quality of directing and visual effect look like a TV series that was made 20 year ago!! I would give the 1st one 7 out of 10 marks but only 3 to this one. What's yours?<br /><br />Hollow Man <br /><br />Storyline: 5 Directing: 7 Acting: 6 Visual Effect: 8.5 Overall : 7<br /><br />Hollow Man II<br /><br />Storyline: 3 Directing: 3 Acting: 5 Visual Effect: 2 Overall : 3
