A tour-de-force from Bob Hoskins playing a tough crime boss in London's East End. Living high on success while fancying himself a political entrepreneur, he's about to close a lucrative partnership deal with the Yanks when the Irish Republican Army, bent on revenge, begins eliminating operatives from his "organization", undermining his reputation. Whether prudishly turning up his nose at the unsavory aspects of London's poor neighborhoods or shamefacedly trying to cover up this embarrassing attack on his solid standing within the community, Hoskins never misses a beat and is wonderful to watch. His character, caught unawares when the violence starts, can't figure out who would do this to him (it isn't so much the 'why?' that has him riled up, it's the 'who?'). Unquestionably the finest movie produced by Britain's Handmade Films, with some arty pretensions that aren't too distracting and a brisk pace supplied by director John Mackenzie. Intriguing supporting characters, fine location shooting and electronic scoring (by Francis Monkman, whose repetitive themes are initially off-putting). Funny, scary, gripping and haunting. *** from ****
