this is a film which almost looks like its made for ruining any future pirate films. why... because it looks like its a high school play gone bad. this movie should not be displayed to anyone below the age of 120. if u do try and bite thru the thick layer of rubbish acting and bad scenery and clothing you will surely be surprised to find it irresistible to try and peel the way to obvious fake mustache of the screen which i believe is worn by the main character. i am a fan of movie's even if the budget is low, but this movie is not only low budget but ill-spent too i couldn't bear to watch thru the whole thing. it makes me think that people are still searching for that dare to be unemployed situation because if anyone ever try's to sell this they will surely end up in the unemployed section of the world because of traumatic reasons.
