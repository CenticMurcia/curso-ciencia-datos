I love this genre of film because it shows many facets of life during the time in which it is depicted. The clothing, the style of filming and the cars, my absolute favorite. I have a real thing for jailbreak flicks and this one didn't let me down. How could it with James Cagney at the helm of the gang? The cast of the movie is excellent. Everyone is suited to the part they played because they were believable. I just felt comfortable with the entire production as it included all the dimensions of crime films that are needed to make it successful. Whether it was a box-office smash when it released doesn't matter today. If you enjoy a snarling, conniving crazed character played by the red-headed genius of James Cagney, you'll enjoy watching this film. P.S. Does anyone know what kind of exotic car is used in this film?
