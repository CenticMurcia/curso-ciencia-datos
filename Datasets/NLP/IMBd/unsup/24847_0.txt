I just watched Ode to Billy Joe today because my mother and aunt talked me into it, and I am 13 and I have the biggest crush on Robby Benson(in his younger years of course). I was so shocked at how the ending turned out, but of course I knew he would jump of the Tallahatchie Bridge from the song. I have to say, at the end I was crying a river and I really thought this movie was great. I really think that because Billie Joe was drunk, he may not have realized the reality of what was going on when that man raped him(in my opinion it was rape). I think he was just extremely ashamed because he knew that was totally unacceptable in that time and very scared and didn't know what to do. So, that is why I think he jumped off the bridge. If you ever get a chance to see this movie, go for it. You won't be disappointed, trust me.
