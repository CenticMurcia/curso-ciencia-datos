I'm a big fan of Christopher Guest and his movies. For Your Consideration doesn't deserve any consideration. What a waste of time! Rather than viewing For Your Consideration, watch any other of his wonderful movies for the first or hundredth time and spend an enjoyable evening.<br /><br />The characters are all flat and uninspired. The comedy is weak, tired, and very far from being fresh. It was all so predictable and boring.<br /><br />I was so very disappointed. While many others walked out of the theater, I hung on hoping it would improve. It didn't. It is one of those films where you find yourself checking your watch to see how much more must be endured.
