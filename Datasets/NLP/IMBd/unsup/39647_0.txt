Yesterday I bought this used VHS in a rental without any previous reference first because I am a great fan of horror movies. The very beautiful art of the cover also attracted me. Last but not the least, the reasonable price convinced me to buy it. When I arrived home and saw that Matthias Hues was the lead 'actor', I recognized that I had not made a good deal and I surely believed that this flick would not be good. Indeed it is worse than that, it is a junk! The storyline is horribly plagiarized from 'From Dusk Till Dawn' and is also divided in two parts: the first one tells the 'saga' of two morons hitchhiking and being kidnapped by a psychotic killer. The second one is about a group of persons, including the two morons, trapped in a bar, surrounded by the legion of the dead leaded by Togaio. I believe this flick was supposed to be funny, but it is not. The viewer can only laugh how imbecile a producer can be sponsoring such a crap. My vote is two.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): 'Legi√£o dos Mortos' ('Legion of the Dead')
