Very plainly and very simply this movie is BRILLIANT!!! THis movie is not a comedy. IT is a love story, a true love story in disguise. The college dorm room setting... disguise. The maker, National Lampoon, a disguise. Here is the equation. Life is about love and life is also about pain. This movie is about both of them. This movie illustrates the feelings of love and the pain that goes along with it that we experience in life. The viewer must watch this movie for what it is... not for what it is not. The viewer must watch this movie with an open mind and not expect a comedy. This movie is much, much more than that. This movie couldn't be more about real life if it tried.
