Based on a Broadway play of the same name, this movie shows Cagney in an uncharacteristic role as a mysterious patron of a bar on the "wrong side of the tracks". Bill Bendix is great as the owner/bartender of the place. The dialog is well written and delivered with the skill you expect from greats like Cagney and Bendix.<br /><br />As the story progresses you learn more and more about Cagney's character, but he remains much of a mystery. The sub-plots are compelling. Unusual for a film from 1944, there is little mention of the war.<br /><br />All-in-all, a very touching, often funny and interesting film. It kept several people up well past their usual bedtimes.
