'Attack The Gas Station' is a marvellous movie, and uncommonly difficult to describe.<br /><br />It's what would result if you gave Quentin Tarantino a sense of humour and a sense of good taste. And improved his ability to direct. And gave him good actors to work with. And an impeccable writer.<br /><br />The English subtitles are odd. At times their errors are amusing, and add something to the movie; at other times there has evidently been painstaking care taken to make the subtitles at least try to make sense - the attempt at translating a vocalised word-game is, while not perfect, a surprisingly good try.<br /><br />I've never before seen a movie constructed of a montage of separate scenes that came together so well as a whole. If only it weren't so hard to find this one.
