"INDIGO" Movie review Indigo the movie resonates with an underlying feeling of that which has been conceived in the utmost and purest of intentions. The fruition of this pure intention translates into an extremely creative and awe inspiring endeavor that this reviewer hopes to be just the first of many more to come. The team of Director Stephen Simon (Prod. "What Dreams May Come") coupled with Executive Prod. /Screenplay writer James Twyman (author "Portrait of a Master") and the endearing and talented Co writer/Star Neale Donald Walsh (Best-selling author "Conversations with God") is a winning combination and a literal dream team at it's finest. One can not help but feel the care and love that went into this work as it translates brilliantly through the screen for audiences of all genres. Simon, Twyman and Walsh successfully deliver a priceless message of hope that the children of our future hold Â–the Indigo children. While viewing Indigo, this reviewer could literally feel waves of inspirational subtle energy radiating through the screen permeating an aura into the theater that at times could be described as no less than breathtaking.<br /><br />As for the acting, I was equally impressed with the performances of the male lead Neale Donald Walsh and his co-stars. Walsh brought the character of Ray to life in an astoundingly multidimensional performance. Thereby setting the bar for the rest of the cast who proved to be equally brilliant in their well defined characters. Of course, when good actors have a well developed script to work with, and an inspired director, it's practically axiomatic that the movie will be a true winner. With brilliantly executed editing that powerfully segued the characters back and forth into key points in the past and how they relate to conscious choices that affect their collective future, a tapestry of love was woven tighter and closer until one is so involved in this movie that you realize you are laughing, crying, and feeling an empathy and compassion for even the least redemptive of the characters! This enlightening story magically and expertly relays an underlying theme that we all have the ability to see with the eyes of Divinity while intuitively being led to make conscious decisions for the highest good based on good character and values -such as dignity integrity, and unconditional love. After opening to more than 700 theaters and churches worldwide, I pray that everyone who saw this movie will call their local independent theater and request future showings so it might reach into the fabric of our society and thereby bringing Spiritual Cinema to the for front. The power of the media is so huge, and it is such a refreshing change to enjoy a movie that is interesting, well made and inspiring on so many levels all at the same time. May you leave this experience with a singing heart, a fuller Spirit and a tenant of hope. And at the very least, may this movie remind us to stop and honor with gratitude those precious children within our care; as they truly hold Divinity within their spirits and the future of this world at the tip of their fingertips. Either way, after partaking in the magical mystical movie Indigo you will never again look at the world the same!
