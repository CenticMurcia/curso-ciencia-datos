Ann Fontaine doesn't like to repeat herself. This is as different from Nathalie as that was from How I Killed My Father and equally good. It would be easy to describe this as a cross between Brief Encounter and Le Boucher because it displays elements of both, the former inasmuch as it features a young, fairly unremarkable wife and mother who enjoys - if that's the right word - an unconsummated affair with an equally unremarkable medico, the latter because there's a serial killer on the loose and Claire (Isabelle Carre) slowly comes around to suspecting her medical friend. There are, of course, concessions to the modern world, unlike Laura Jesson, who was a full-time housewife and mother Claire has a job and for that matter her passion is kindled by a vet as opposed to a doctor, albeit one who treats lions rather than hamsters. It's a real delight to see Isabelle Carre building on the success of her breakthrough role in Se Souvenir des Belles Choses and earning co-star (Holy Lola) and now sole star billing which she more than justifies. This is a real gem and should not be missed.
