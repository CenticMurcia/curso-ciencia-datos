I am one of those who quit watching ER back when it was airing because of all the stars who left. I have been watching the reruns, tho, and today this episode aired. Halfway through the show I realized this wasn't the first time I had seen this one. It was Ray Liotta's performance that jogged my memory. I now recall that I tuned into ER to watch this episode because of previews including clips of Liotta. I was impressed by his acting even in the short clips included in the promos. I was not disappointed then and I was not disappointed today. If this did not warrant an Emmy nod, I can't imagine who won it that year. I am not really a fan of Liotta but this reminded me perhaps I should be.
