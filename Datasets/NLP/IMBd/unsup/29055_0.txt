Everything about it was awesome. the imagery rivals those of john woo films. the characters were great, and if you are a stereotypical adult that says cartoons are for kids, this will change your mind. you know why cartoon network imports anime (japanimation for you old schoolers)for adult swim, because there aren't that many if any American animated series like this one. this turned out better than many live action series i have seen. drama, humor and action are rolled into this one great series. the characters grow right in front of your eyes. the musical action sequences are some of the most spectacular i have ever seen and heard. American directors wish they were this good. if you no longer watch animation or are looking for something different, Cowboy Bebop is it.
