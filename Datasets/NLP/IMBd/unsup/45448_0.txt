Now this was a bad, bad, bad movie. The script was bad. The direction was bad. The plot was bad. The beginning was bad. The ending was bad. In fact, all of that was so bad it doesn't even matter that much of the acting was good. The insanely gorgeous and curvaceous Rose McGowan is great in one of her by-the-numbers bitch roles, and nearly every decent line of dialogue is hers. I was also moderately impressed by Judy Greer as Fern/Vylette. Rebecca Gayheart is very pretty, and decent as the good girl. "Marcie" is totally one-note, but she was fairly amusing. Carol Kane was her usual neurotic self, but that's what she does well. I think my favorite part was Marilyn Manson's cameo, and it's just because of the back story. They needed to find an extra to play a skangy barfly, and well, since he was hanging around the set and making out with Rose anyway. . . It's pretty funny, and he doesn't even have a single line. Most of the other cameos seemed kind of pointless. What was up with Pam Grier's cop? At any rate, there are a *few* laughs to be had, and if you have an embarrassing fondness for bad movies or just want to oggle Rose, you might want to rent it on a down night. . .but at least wait 'til it hits the dollar rack, 'kay?
