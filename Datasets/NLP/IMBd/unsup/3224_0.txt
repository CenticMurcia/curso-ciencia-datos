Liza Minnelli's Emmy-award winning musical TV special, directed by Bob Fosse, and coming right on the heels of their Oscar-winning "Cabaret". After listening to this record album for years, I was quite excited to find a copy on video (transferred from the 16mm print). I was surprised by two things: 1) that the LP captures most of the show's excitement all on its own, which says a lot for the command of Liza's singing and the quality of the music; and 2) that Fosse is irreplaceable in the business of musical-comedy staging. The dancing on numbers like "I Gotcha!" and "Son Of A Preacher Man" is incredible, with Fosse's sensual style of choreography bringing down the house. Still in all, it's Liza's singing that is the show's centerpiece, and she's in fine, clear voice throughout. Dramatic, comedic, self-effacing, flirtatious, silly, giggling, Liza proves to be a virtuoso performer of great magnitude.
