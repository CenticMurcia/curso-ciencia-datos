Not filma making's finest hour. I felt this movie was just to obviously silly. Nothing really memorable or interesting about it, in an odd way it reminded me of "Weekend at Bernie's". I think the movie tried to be funny in a very obvious,contrived way. Not the worst film ever made but certainly not one that makes it's mark in any way, shape or form.
