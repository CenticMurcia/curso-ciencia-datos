This combination of comedy, drama, and adventure were the three main ingredients of this movie. Richard Pryor(who also produced the movie) stars as an ex-con who is given a second chance to redeem himself. He's hired to transport a bus load of kids and their teacher to Seattle for a better life. At first, Joe doesn't like the kids at all, but slowly begins to develop a friendship between them. Richard Pryor came up with the idea probably for the audience to see a different side of him and not the usual foul-mouthed comic we're used to. He does his best to keep the profanity to a minimum, but there's still adult language in it, but nothing inappropriate. The sudden change from comedy to drama is kind of jarring, since you don't know what's going to happen next. The music score, however, is amazing. Its use of piano synthesizers fits well with the non-comedy sequences. This is one of Richard Pryor's underrated movies and is definitely worth a look.
