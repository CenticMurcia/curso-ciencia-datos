The film is good, though in the 21st century it shows it's age, and the violence of warfare seems so, so small compared with our daily fare on television. In one point, this film is still a must for those who enjoy water sports. It features excellent underwater photography (with special proccesses created for the film) and a hand-to-hand duel at the film end in a river that is memorable. Indeed, many of the natural scenery where this film was shot take us to mountains, valleys and rivers or swamps that western folklore effaced in the Sixties and Seventies. This is entertaining fare for family viewing, too.
