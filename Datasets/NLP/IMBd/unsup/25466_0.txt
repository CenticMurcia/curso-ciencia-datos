The fact that some people thought this film was good, shows how subjective the film experience can be.<br /><br />The fact that this happens with every <br /><br />film on the IMDb only supports that theory further.<br /><br />However, this film seems to go out of its way <br /><br />to reach new levels of badness.<br /><br />When I saw that the co-writer and co-director was also the film's composer, I knew I was in for a treat.<br /><br />Sure enough, the music consisted of two things, repeated over and over again for the entire movie. One was a piano arpeggiating a minor chord over and over, and the other was a pitiful attempt at some Bernard Herrmann marcato string lines, ala "Psycho".<br /><br />The rest of the movie, acting, directing, writing etc... was just as bad. The ending was incredible- "They're testing it again!" End of movie.
