The film is a poorly made attempt at 50's film noir, complete with hack narration from Paul Newman. The film has the potential to be very good: a good director and top stars (Newman, Hackman, Sarandon etc). It isn't. The plotline is thin. How many more times are we to have a washed up cop as the lead character? The script and dialogue are poor. Worst of all, the acting is wooden. You get no sense that the actors have been given the time to familiarise themselves with their characters. Even if they had, the script is so poor that they would have nothing meaningful to say anyway. This is a film equivalent of painting by numbers. The film has the look and feel of something that has been made quickly and with a minimal budget. It might be made by the same team who made "Nobody's Fool", but don't be fooled by the comparison. Nobody's Fool is a good film. This one is a dog.
