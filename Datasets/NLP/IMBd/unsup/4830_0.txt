Mafia Vs Ninja is a cool film. I saw it today, and i think that it was entertaining. It included ninjas, kung fu fighters, opponents from all over the world, a good gang and a bad gang, a false love story and so on. In fact, its climate had a great ninja scene.<br /><br />The story is about a new guy who arrives at town, and this new guy is a great kung fu fighter. Later on, he is adopted by a good Chinese gang whose leader is killed due to his disagreements with the Japanese gang that sells heroin and so on. Therefore, the new guy goes to revenge the bad who have killed the leader of his Chinese group.<br /><br />Mafia Vs Ninja has many fights, but no monks, no temples, no pupils nor masters, while there is a fair share of ninja attacks and kung fu fights that aren't always cheesy. In a nutshell, I recommend that fans of ninja cinema and kung fu cinema check this film out, it can provide you with an hour and a half of entertainment 7/10
