As the newly founded Dodge City teems with violence and chaos, an Irishman reluctantly becomes Marshall and tries to tame the West in this standard but enjoyable and colorful Western. Flynn makes a dashing hero in his first Western, one of five films he made with de Havilland and Hale. Individually, he made nine films with de Havilland, 15 with Hale, and 12 with director Curtiz. de Havilland, looking lovely as always, plays the wholesome love interest. Sheridan is a saloon girl who warbles a song but is wasted in a small role. Cabot makes a slick villain while the supporting cast includes such familiar faces as Travers, Fowley, and Bond.
