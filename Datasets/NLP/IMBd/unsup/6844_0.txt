I love action movies. Die Hard, Lethal Wepon, you name it. I would have said exactly the same thing as the previous reviewer. The shootouts were a joke. Why would anyone take the time away from watching their prisoner to drag dead bodies into a helicopter, destroy it and try to get a helicopter to fly away in? He should have just left in the first place.<br /><br />There must have been 10 million shots fired in this movie. They were all expert marksmen yet no one was ever hit by a bullet. <br /><br />Not only was Eric shooting at the president who was shielding the bad guy, but he flew Tarzan style across the pool with a gun in one hand shooting as he swung. No aim. How dumb..dumb..dumb.<br /><br />The actors seemed embarrassed to be in this movie. They should be.
