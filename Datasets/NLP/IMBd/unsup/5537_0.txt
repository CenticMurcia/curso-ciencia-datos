Slaves of New York, is a lovable, bittersweet portrait that gets better with age. It captures the essence of the late 80s art world inhabited by those on the artist food chain: future superstars, struggling unknowns, narcissists, star-f*ckers, martyrs, creeps, losers and hangers-on. Eleanor's battle with finding her place in the world while in the shadow of her ego maniacal boyfriend is a story as old as time. Slaves is a thinly-veiled art-world "A Star is Born" and there are many characters to love and hate. The main focus on Stash and Eleanor is both<br /><br />frustrating and believable. Stash being immensely insecure, Eleanor being quietly talented, the actors portray their roles with such intensity, it must be noted that the casting is perfection. Everyone from myopic art dealers, lazy femme fatals, bloated benefactors and competitive artists are here waiting for their chance for their big score, whether it is buying low and selling high, getting into the "good" gallery or hooking up with the "right" lover or muse. It is satisfying in the end to see how Eleanor, by just being who she is, basically fumbles into her true calling while trying to navigate a world so cutthroat and critical. She eventually finds satisfaction with her lot in life and realizes that, that in itself, is an art worth mastering.
