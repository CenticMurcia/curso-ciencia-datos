I recently viewed this film for the first time and found it to be intriguing if not especially satisfying. I apparently viewed this film from a somewhat different perspective than many other IMDb voters. I don't know the director's intent, but I felt the film exemplified the drawbacks and pitfalls of extreme positions and/or lifestyles. The central character, vividly portrayed by Mimi Rogers, leads a very loose lifestyle in the initial stages of the film and converts to an overly rigid lifestyle in the latter stages after becoming disenchanted and seemingly depressed with what was transpiring in her life. Viewers can judge for themselves whether one type of extremism is preferable to the other. In my opinion, many types of groups or cults (politically or religiously inspired) capitalize on people searching for a person or group who can dramatically change what they perceive as an unrewarding existence. This film may draw, intense positive or negative, response from people with extreme religious positions. Not placing myself at either end of that spectrum, I was deeply interested in the film but felt that it lost some of its impact and possibly a couple of rating points, over the final half hour of the presentation.<br /><br />Mimi Rogers gives a strong performance in a film in which she is required to shoulder the burden. It's not that the other actors give sub-par performances. It's just that the film is so primarily structured around Mimi's character that she is required to carry the load and does so extremely well. In my opinion, an IMDb rating of between 3 and 8 would seem to fit this religiously provocative drama. I personally gave it a 4 out of 10 and would recommend it for viewers who are not offended by loose sexual lifestyles or exploring intense religious attitudes.
