I'd heard Jamie Kennedy was funny. Whoever reported that was on crack. Kennedy makes Pauly Shore seem like Laurence Olivier.<br /><br />I brought my 2 sons (11 and 13) to see this movie because one thought it looked funny. I'm a pushover for going to movies with them. I figure a movie with a PG-13 rating will not be crude or offensive, simply it will have a few curse words and possibly some implied sex.<br /><br />I think I laughed once and thought my sons were laughing a little early on. When they got to the part about teaching the formerly comatose break dancer some moves for getting with his love interest (using a short fat Hispanic "actor" with a wig and bra as a sex doll -- he looked like Chewbacca with that wig. They showed him how to grope and squeeze his "boobs".), I was utterly offended because of what my children were seeing. I was about to tell my family we were leaving, when my 11 year old asked, "Can we GO, now?" <br /><br />The rating was wrong. There should be a rating for offensive, insulting, pointless, no redeeming values. I only wish I had seen a manager on my way out so I could have gotten a refund. This is only the second movie I have ever walked out on in my life.<br /><br />I agree with several of the other reviewers. I felt that my evening out was worse than ruined (we bought 4 tickets, 2 drinks and a tub of popcorn -- easily $40). Time was stolen from us. If I were a fighting man, I would already have beaten the crap out of the people who released this movie. I also agree that the positive comments could only be coming from people who made money on the movie, or who are friends. This ca-ca stinks. "Lex Luthor" Rosenbaum was fine in it. Christopher MacDonald must have been paid a lot to stoop this low. The love interest was good looking.<br /><br />GARBAGE GARBAGE GARBAGE. I'm getting mad just thinking about how awful it was and how much it cost for that lesson. I will never watch a Jamie Kennedy movie again, unless he's uncredited and I didn't know he was in it. If this movie comes on TV and you have a chance to run away, do so. I'd rather watch a political debate with toothpicks under my fingernails.
