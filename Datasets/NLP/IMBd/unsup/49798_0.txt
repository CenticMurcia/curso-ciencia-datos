This film accomplishes nothing. Even the tagline is exaggerating, far reaching crap. It should have been: <br /><br />"Because we're small time and couldn't get an interview- it's never been so hard to get Michael Moore in front of a camera." <br /><br />The film shifts tone, focus, and favoritism with each interview or point. What's the big deal with Moore doing the same thing as Republican politicians with their tainted media? It's like fighting fire with fire- you lie, we lie. It's obvious he does it much better than this group of filmmakers trying to ride his coattails- and by the way- they're late. This film should have come out decades ago so it's dated and tired out already. If it had a point to prove, they blew it by waiting decades to state it, because with time facts and footage are lost- so if this films investigators couldn't find facts or footage it must be because Moore was lying...dumb way to prove your point. The only thing this film achieves is letting the audience realize what a bunch of amateurs this group is by comparison to Moore. If you're going to lie, do it well...and for a frigging reason at least. Moore has moved on to other topics, other films, and new focus. This film lives in the past, so there's nothing compelling about it other than a cover design featuring graphic art of Moore as a caricature. <br /><br />LMFAO "Unbiased" my ass. They'd be more credible, in my opinion, if they just said this was an anti-Moore film. They're lucky Moore wouldn't waste his time discrediting these hacks, because all this film had going for it is Michael Moore's name. This film has been made before at least twice, so come up with an original concept for once- instead of remaking Republican propaganda that discredits Moore. Instead the filmmakers waste our time telling us something we all know already. It's more about their self- importance and how they're 'worthy' to continue on their journey to discredit Moore. This is a bitter and resentful documentary with jealous undertones and I'm sorry- but they don't have the chops or charisma to win over Moore's popularity. <br /><br />Aren't their more prominent world figures to discredit? Like ones who influence the world because they RUN IT- and not watch it on CNN while eating chips and thinking up conspiracy theories? the man may throw out a lie here or there, but at least he gets his audience to think with a different view or mindstate- unlike this film, which has nothing to say other than: "we're as good as him"- which they also are not. <br /><br />sin-surely, <br /><br />RF <br /><br />"This is me...ya anonymous bitches" http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=PREVALENTMIND
