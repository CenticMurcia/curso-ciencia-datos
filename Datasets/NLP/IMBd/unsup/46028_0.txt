Any old time college movie has one plot: the big game, the big race, or the big dance, and the only way to bring it off is to sneak in a ringer from outside the school. This time it is the big race - a rowing race. (The rowing practice all takes place in front of a bizarre and inexplicable rear-projected vista of OIL WELLS.) Not even Mantan can pep up these proceedings - it doesn't make you suffer, nor is it anything to write home about. A pretty harmless way to kill an hour or so. If there is one memorable thing in the movie, and there is exactly one memorable thing, it is Gale Storm's first musical number - she is incredibly vivacious and sexy, in a dress which emphasizes her charms in a remarkable yet very chaste way. I may watch it again just for that. I don't think it's a spoiler to warn you that EVERYTHING TURNS OUT ALL RIGHT IN THE END. You already knew that.
