In some ways, Goldie Hawn would seem like the only cast member who should be involved with the zany "Death Becomes Her", given that Meryl Streep is best known for serious roles and Bruce Willis is best known for action movies (not to mention that director Robert Zemeckis is best known for the likes of "Forrest Gump"). But believe you me, everyone does a great job! Portraying two women vying for a man - and going to literally any length to succeed - this is one movie sure to blow your mind. Of course, the best part is what happens to Hawn and Streep. How anyone came up with that I'll never figure out! And then they fight! Ha! Overall, this is just a really cool flick. Whether we interpret it as a jab at Hollywood (and movie stars' obsessions with their looks) or as plain old wacky fun, it's still something else. Also starring are Isabella Rosselini as the woman who gives people the potion, and Sydney Pollack as a physician who gets a really, REALLY big surprise.<br /><br />I guess that you could say that Meryl Streep's character was "neck-in-neck" with certain other parties, and that Goldie Hawn's character had a hole in more places than her head!
