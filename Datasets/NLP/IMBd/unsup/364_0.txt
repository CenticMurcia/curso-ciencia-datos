I've never seen the 1st one but this movie blows, I'm having a hard time finding something positive about this movie, well no, i will say good job on the special effects and the werewolf costume and head, whoever made those is good. now onto the crap, the two main characters Bridget and ghost. the whole time i watched this i seriously wanted to punch both of them, if it was possible i would have. especially Ghost, whom is a little too crazy for my taste, not to mention one of those people who hope will get what they deserve, in which this movie does not give. so thats a huge mistake. i was hoping shed get it for all the crap she did. o well. and whats up with the sequel, a prequel set in the 19th century with two sisters who happened to have the same names and look just like th girls in the 1st movie LIKE O M G WHAT ARE THE ODDS!!!! geeeze its like they didn't even try.
