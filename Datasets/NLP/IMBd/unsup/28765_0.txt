This movie is one of the better goofy teen movies of the early 80's. The movie gets a bad review by people who don't see it for what it is. This is a movie that when nothing is on you will gladly waste 1-2 hours watching. Movie is clean and silly. Think of what you would do with the powers Scott Baio has in this movie. Soundtrack is typical early 80's cheese.
