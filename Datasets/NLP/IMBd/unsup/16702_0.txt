This movie teaches us a lot of useful things. First: making good movies about political issues is possible. Second: You can make a good chilean movie about chilean aspects of chilean life (many chilean directors want to do French, Italian, or New York look-like movies, ashamed of their own roots). Third: You can a good movie about political issues, about Chilean stuff and have success in both theaters and critic. A very human and poetic love story during the Pinochet's dictatorship is shown in La Frontera, when oppositors were sent to little villages far away from everything and a series of strange relations start. With great performances of and Patricio Contreras and Gloria Laso. The scene in the bar when the men are dancing between them is just memorable. Hector Rios' cinematography is superb. If you can see this movie, I recommend it.
