Out of all the Scorsese films - I would have to admit this ranks in the top five. After Hours draws you into it's dark and surreal world with fantastical wonder. The characters are all interesting, the acting superb - especially Griffin Dunne - and the pacing is great.<br /><br />It was made in 1985, and I can already see the techniques Scorsese used in Goodfellas - and the quick editing. It is directed and edited really well. So if you were a fan of Scorsese's frantic camera work in Goodfellas and Casino, this film is for you.<br /><br />It really does put you on edge - as a viewer, you really want Dunne's character to get back home - but everything possible that could happen to him - happens. This is not just a evocation of soHo in the early 80's - it is a deeply black comedy. All the rules go out the window for Dunne's character, because after all it is after hours.<br /><br />Scorsese really is the best living director at the moment - so do yourself a favour and watch this movie - it's fantastic.
