Robin Williams has a few stinkers in his otherwise distinguished career: TOYS and DEATH TO SMOOCHY are chief among them. But, this piece of crap is un-funnier than 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN and LADYKILLERS put together. Both of which I walked out in the middle of...just as I did with this one.<br /><br />I mean, something must be terribly wrong if I can sit through forty-minutes of Robin Williams' one-liners and literally not laugh, even once! Those butt-ugly Cabbage Patch robots, I can understand. Social studies teachers use the same technique, in real life, among high school students. Although, the dolls they hand out probably don't resemble bald versions of "Chuckie" from CHILD'S PLAY.<br /><br />Yet, illegally bugging the engaged couple's apartment, with the help of an adolescent Gomez Addams, after innovatively teaching some other kids about the Ten Commandments? Correct me if I wrong. But, I think the official term for that is "contributing to the delinquency of a minor." And, cops can arrest one for that! <br /><br />So, even if this review gets voted as "zero-out-of-a-hundred found it useful," I'm still urging my fellow movie-goers to boycott this movie, and spend their money on a full-fledged vacation. Preferably, in Amish Country, Pennysylvania, where's there guaranteed to be no movie theaters showing this!!!
