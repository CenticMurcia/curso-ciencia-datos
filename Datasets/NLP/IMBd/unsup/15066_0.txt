I don't speak French. Yet, when I found myself in Montreal for one night with nothing to do, I asked around for a Canadian Film that I could check out. I ended up watching Un dimanche Ã  Kigali. I was able to follow the film without needing to have known the language -- until the end. **Spoiler coming -- I was totally surprised at the ending. I couldn't understand why the leading man did what he did -- until I read some of the other film comments and found out about the "promise" made from earlier on in the movie. Overall, I liked that movie. We all have our different opinions about "life and death", BUT, considering ALL that the two protagonists have gone through and their strong bond of love and sense of survival, I wonder if they should/could have allowed that strength to carry them beyond the moment and face the new challenges (AIDS, disfiguring scars, etc).
