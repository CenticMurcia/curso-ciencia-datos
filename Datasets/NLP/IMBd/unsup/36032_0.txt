Well, I hate to burst everyone's bubble before me, but IMAO this was a very ordinary film that was mildly amusing at best. What's worse is that it invokes a hefty glorification of gratuitous violence, so much so that it ruined the film (again IMAO). The violence wasn't ridiculous enough to be a mockery, but an essential part of the film, overstating other perhaps more interesting plot aspects that might have been developed further to a more satisfying - and original - whole.<br /><br />This is a pity, because it was very well acted (these guys shame some of the more recognized Hollywood stars), and the character development wasn't too bad either. And there was definitely potential, some of the peripheral themes were definitely candidates for further development. What ruined it was that the plot was so bloody stupid. This could have been a great movie if the central plot theme wasn't so banal.<br /><br />Sorry I couldn't give it more than two points out of ten, but this is an absolute (rather than a relative) scale, it was definitely a masterpiece for the budget they had. Shame about the subject matter.
