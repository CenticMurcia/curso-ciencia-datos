It's interesting that for a time, the best music written for the stage was being introduced in animated features, mostly by Disney. This is one of the best and it translated well to Broadway. From the opening sequence of Belle, with her strong character, to the dancing household items at the Beast's castle, this has got to be one of Disney's finest productions. It has heart and soul. It has Gaston, a great villain, with a great song bearing his name. He is the epitome of male chauvinism. It is remindful of Miles Gloriosus in "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum." The fairy tale plays itself out with delightful pacing. The beast is a complex being who has a second chance for rebirth and reconciliation. That there are forces in the universe makes this a positive film. The scare factor is there as well, with the thorny forest of the Beast, providing a barrier to all who dare enter. It shows that love can be easy, but true love without sacrifice is empty. Until the Beast knows this his lot will continue on. The songs are complex and varied, some of the best every. All the characters have purpose. This is an outstanding film.
