It was refreshing to see John Wayne looking so young and healthy. I hadn't seen any of his earlier movies in years. There is a great surrounding cast with the gorgeous and mysterious Marlene Dietrich, and the ever so calm and collected Randolph Scott. In this adventure Randolph plays a villain. Who would have thought it. He plays the part very well and is almost likable with his sophisticated charm as he attempts to devour all the gold mines with swindling "illegal" paperwork. But in the end his evil ways show through and he is undone by his own greed. But we want to see the good guys win, that's what makes for a great ending. And what a knock down, drag out fight it is. This is one of the best saloon brawls I have ever seen. The plot is straightforward and easily followed, with a plot twist or two to keep it interesting. The sets and props look real enough to convince one you are in Alaska. If you like any of the top ten listed actors/actresses you will enjoy this movie. I got my version from Netflix. It seems they are stocking up on some great older flicks for folks that don't need ten cars flying through the air or over the top special effects,to enjoy a movie. Look for it, enjoy it. I did
