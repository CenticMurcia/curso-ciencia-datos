Anyone who liked this movie was trying way too hard. This movie isn't science fiction it is impossible. The product placement was terrible and sad, which went right along with the story line. I do not know what Steven's problem is about ending movies like A.I. for instance but this movie ran on like a marathon. I could not belive the part where they said these precogs were just crack babies in the future, that could see the future. Please if you want to spend 10 bucks that bad throw it out the window or maybe rent "Magnolia", Vanilla Sky" and A.I. After seeing those three you may never be in the mood to see another movie again.
