Well, since I watched this movie for the third time, I must like this rubbish, no? Damn right I do! This is one pretty bad PREDATOR rip-off. Actually, this movie borrows so many elements from so many other movies, you can't even bother beginning to count them. JÃ¼rgen Prochnow looks like he's on cocaine or something, over-acting every line he speaks intensely. He looks pretty insane as the mad scientist with no conscience or morality. Mark Dacascos plays a doctor (haha!) who suddenly turns into Rambo (hoho!) or (more appropriate) into Major Alan"Dutch"Schaeffer (hihi!). The special effects are hilarious (that helicopter crash!!!) and the monster-suit is cool (with red & green colors). Of course it looks extremely rubbery. Plus: that annoying native kid gets killed! Way to go scriptwriter! So yes, this is rubbish, but of the enjoyable kind!
