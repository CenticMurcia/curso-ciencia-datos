This movie truly seemed as if it were written by a pair of stoned fourteen year olds that just discovered softcore porn and boobs. To say that the humor was sophomoric is an understatement. There is no sign of intelligent life here; not that one would expect any. Yet slapstick humor serves a purpose and this title just falls short in every category. Nothing but crude and unfunny dirty jokes, sexually repressed writing and bad characters. The lead in this movie may just be the most unlikable character in recent comedy history. Somehow stalker tendencies turn into sweet nothings whispered into the ears of fourteen year old perverts in the middle of the most disturbing nocturnal emissions. Disgusting film with a ridiculous plot, pitiful and childish writing followed by terrible performances from actors portraying annoying characters. If you have any semblance of a brain, you'll do some good and stay the hell away from this garbage.
