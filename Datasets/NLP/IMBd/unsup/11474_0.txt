This movie is barely worth criticizing. Ironically, it could have been an interesting movie. I liked Sci-fi more as a kid but still think it has its place, and the premise of linked tales in the future is not a bad one. Even the mix of the exotic and mundane in the future had some potential. However, this movie took the easy way out and went for stories that almost all hit below the belt. Even the animation was a disappointment because it was so sub-par--more like a bad version of those forgettable Saturday morning Transformers cartoons that started running in the 80s--Warner Bros. and Disney did it much better decades ago. Shame on anyone involved in this piece of trash. Since when does the future have to be overrun almost exclusively by trashy people? The creators tried unsuccessfully to mask poorly written stories and cheaply drawn animation with hard core violence, meaningless adolescent fantasy sex, and illicit drug use. Wow. What creativity. If their aim was to appeal to socially misfit adolescent males brimming with violent urges and unfulfilled lust, then they hit their mark.. <br /><br />Not recommended for anyone with a modicum of taste or decency but perfect for wannabe serial killers and misfit males mentally stuck in their teens. . 2/10
