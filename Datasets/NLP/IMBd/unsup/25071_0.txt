SO, I am probably one of the first people in the whole world to see this movie.<br /><br />All I can tell you is its soooo great. I am not even sure what else to say.<br /><br />The writing is wonderful...funny, and has the rough, Indie feel to it. Is never boring. Gets and holds your attention for the entire flick.<br /><br />The Characters in the film are amazing. Very well written and the actors do a Fantastic Job.<br /><br />This movie is definitely not a PG-13 Flick. It has its raunchy moments...but is never over the top. (Well, OK..maybe a bit...at times..) I would call it a Clerks meets the Billiard Sales World. ;)
