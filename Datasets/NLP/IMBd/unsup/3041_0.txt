Mildly amusing and predictable story. Four ghetto friends get into trouble when one kills a store owner. The shooter goes nuts and begins to cap the other 3, one at a time.<br /><br />If there is nothing else on cable or free tv then it's worth a look. (I wouldn't pay to rent it). It is interesting to see Samuel L. Jackson in an early role but other than that, there's not much there. I gave it a 2/10.<br /><br />
