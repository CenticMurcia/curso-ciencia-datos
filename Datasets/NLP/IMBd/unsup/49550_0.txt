"Shiryo No Wana 2: Hideki" is a vile and repulsive movie which tries in vain to emulate the success of the first "Evil Dead Trap" but ultimately ends up as a vastly inferior sequel(in name only). While "Hideki" is visually quite intriguing, the story is a contrived mess filled with unlikable characters, an inane plot and cheap gross out effects that are more laughable than terrifying. Unlike genuinely creepy Japanese Horror films like the recent "Ringu", "Uzumaki", "Ju-On" and "Spiral", "Hideki" has less to do with atmospheric horror and more to do with over-the-top splatter similar to late 80's and early 90's films like "Hellraiser", "Re-Animator" and "Naked Lunch". Director Izo Hashimoto (who directed episodes of the campy Japanese TV show "Sukeban Deka" [Juvenile Cop]) tries too hard to go for the cheap thrills and scares. This is a real disappointment as I liked his "Sukeban Deka" TV work. To be avoided.
