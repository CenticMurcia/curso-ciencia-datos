Talk about over use of melodrama. I cannot understand how audience is expected to digest this pathetic excuse of a movie. Something like this is better left as a reality show or made for TV movie or for some saas/bahu kind of soap opera. From the time Madhuri received the call and has the first meeting with Ahshaye, the rest of movie is entirely predictable. There is absolutely nothing in the movie that is worthy of mention apart from a couple of good scenes by Raghuvir Yadav and Irfaan Khan, which is why this gets 3 and not 1 out of 10. Melodrama is not alien to Bollywood movies, but this was way too much. I mean at the end of it the goonda politician who would sell his soul for power and money is shown crying and business man who would bribe one and all has had a sudden change of heart! Please!! Is this the best you can put out?!! Also, too many musical numbers and none really catchy. I detest movies like these, they make me want to quit watching desi movies...it is that bad.
