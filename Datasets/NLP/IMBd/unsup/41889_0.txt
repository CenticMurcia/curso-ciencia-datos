After reading the reviews that have been written for this god-awful piece of crap, I can't help but think that the only people who have voted for this junk are the people involved with making it.<br /><br />First off, this movie isn't close to "action-packed." In fact, it's horrendously boring. It's laced with some of the worst acting ever captured straight-to-video, and that bad acting is helped on its journey into the pits of much-deserved obscurity by an editing job that doesn't even deserve to be praised as amateurish. The script seems to have been dreamed up by some religious fundamentalist with a monosyllabic dictionary. The story is terrible, terrible, terrible... just terrible. It's all been done before.<br /><br />This film is an amateurish rip-off of "Jacob's Ladder" with some bits of a Night gallery episode thrown in (the one with Roddy McDowell as a man who murders his rich uncle and then cowers in his house as a haunted painting depicts the victim returning from the grave to wreak vengeance). Anyone seeing even a few minutes of this lousy excuse for a horror flick will quickly note the BLATANT theft of plot device after plot device from "Jacob's Ladder," right down to the head-swiveling demons -- although this low-budget turkey obviously didn't have money for special effects, so the demons just shake their head from side to side accompanied by sound effects that resemble someone shaking a tin of peanuts.<br /><br />None of the cast can act worth a damn. Seriously, not a single person in this film EVER delivers a convincing line. "Wooden" is a mild description for how bad the acting is.<br /><br />I watched this film at a recent horror film fan convention, and at the screening at which I was present there was a continuous stream of groans and jokes directed at this intellectually-insulting, abysmal garbage. There was supposed to be a Q&A session with the director and one of the actors after the screening, but everyone who'd watched fled the theater as quickly as possible ... because nobody cared what those involved with such a TERRIBLE film would have to say about it.<br /><br />To top it all off, the ending of this movie is not only predictable, but it smacks entirely of religious bigotry and is just plain INSULTING to anyone who isn't a fundamentalist Christian.<br /><br />In short, the only reason to ever buy a copy of "13 Seconds" is to BURN IT. This is perhaps the worst movie ever made. Having been a fan of obscure, z-grade horror flicks for some 30 years now, I do not say these things lightly. This film has NO redeeming qualities, and should be buried somewhere safe, where it can never see the light of day again.
