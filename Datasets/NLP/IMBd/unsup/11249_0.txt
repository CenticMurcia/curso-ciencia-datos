this is what made hk films memorable in the early 90's. I love this film when i first saw it, and once i watched it again it got even better. Pure slapstick comedy is included, and great acting by the actors/actresses. Stuff like the 'wink' that tony lau kar fai gave followed with a mesmerizing wing going pass bridgette lin, you dont see that stuff anymore.
