<br /><br />Light entertainment which might have you smiling from time to time; all so implausible, the world of make-believe. Even the actors appear not to be acting, but just playing at acting. Easy-going so as to keep children happy, but most certainly if only about 7 years old, or if you are 97 years old and want to sleep for a while. A far-fetched fantasy for over-anxious minds, perhaps, and I cannot really believe that anybody concerned with making this film could have taken anything even slightly seriously. However, if the planet keeps on warming up, and rainstorms continue getting worse, who knows whether in the next twenty years you will be building ships in your garden in Dakota? It is worth thinking about.
