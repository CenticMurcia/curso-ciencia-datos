what a waste movie, where is the acting??? where are the scenes???<br /><br />i don't blame Indian audiences, they have lost the taste long time ago. how can this silly movie be a big blockbuster.<br /><br />other than Lata mangeshkar's voice nothing is good in it. a boring story line that only starts from the second hour.<br /><br />how can this movie be hit??? and a great classic like Lamhe flop ?? plus Madhuri Dixit didn't deserve that years award. I think Sridevi deserved the award for her powerful performance in Laadla. really there is no match.<br /><br />i really advice u to avoid this movie. One star only goes for Lata's voice nothing else
