Lon Chaney (as Alonzo the Armless) is a criminal posing as an armless circus knife-wielder; he amazes by throwing knives with his feet, notably at assistant Joan Crawford (as Nanon Zanzi). Actually, Mr. Chaney's arms are tightly girdled to his chest; he suffers from an obvious deformity, which would identify him to authorities - he has two thumbs on his left hand. Evidently a victim of sex abuse, Ms. Crawford has an unusual fear of arms; so, she rejects the advances of circus strongman Norman Kerry (as Malabar the Mighty). Instead, she warms up to the armless Chaney. He mistakes Crawford's affection for love, and decides to make himself her ideal, by amputating his arms! While Chaney recuperates, Crawford overcomes her fear, and begins to enjoy Mr. Kerry's muscular arms. When he returns, Chaney is understandably upsetÂ… <br /><br />Chaney and director Tod Browning are superb in this disturbing, horrific drama. Browning builds great suspense in the wonderful ending, wherein he winds up disturbing images in your mind, and teasingly leaves them on the verge of exploding - as usual, the horror unseen is the most unsettling. Crawford excels in one of her best early roles; she plays falling in love with Kerry exceptionally well. Of course, no one can match Chaney; though great throughout, his scene realizing Crawford never truly loved him is emotionally wrenching. Great character actor John George (as Cojo) has a fine role as Chaney's helper - the scene where he first unwraps the girdled "Alonzo" should have your eyes glued to the screen. There appear to be some portions of "The Unknown" missing, but the amputation of footage hasn't spoiled the film. <br /><br />********* The Unknown (6/4/27) Tod Browning ~ Lon Chaney, Joan Crawford, Norman Kerry, John George
