If you don't want to lose your time don't watch this movie, I can really say it's one of the worst movies I have ever seen.<br /><br />This story is supposed to be funny but it is not, not even because of the bad language used that is supposed to be funny you can really laugh.<br /><br />The only good thing are two of the actresses that are beautiful, but just that.<br /><br />I thing there are great Mexican movies but this one cannot be included between them, If you are looking for good Mexican movies look at Amores Perros for example.
