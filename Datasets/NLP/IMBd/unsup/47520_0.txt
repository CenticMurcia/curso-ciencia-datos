A movie that promises a lot, but doesn't deliver especially when you<br /><br />realise it is a total take on "The Shining" ! The actors are excellent<br /><br />and, at first, the mystery is well drawn, but when the main actor (A<br /><br />writer falling under the spell of spirits - rings a bell ?) thries to<br /><br />emulate Nicholson, everything falls apart, leading to an overdrawn<br /><br />finale (The cop arriving at the right moment to save the day and the<br /><br />"What the heck ?" sudden appearance of Fulciesque living deads)<br /><br />Granted, there are scary moments, but all in all, we are left<br /><br />disappointed. Besides, like most German TV movie or series, it tries<br /><br />pretty hard to hide its origin, sacrifing any originality whatsoever. So<br /><br />far, the Spanish still deliver the best Euro-horror so far. Maybe we can<br /><br />have hope for "Jeux d'enfants", a new French horror movie whose trailer<br /><br />I saw before this one. Keep
