Seagal wears a suit-jacket in most of this movie. This is quite welcome to those of us who are tired of seeing him in Frigidaire size leather jackets and Big'n'Tall XXL kimono's. This movie is 10% better than most of his recent direct-to-DVD schlock (look at my rating and do the calculation).<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie if you are incarcerated or bed-ridden and don't have any other films to watch, or if you lack self esteem. You might also enjoy this movie if you are blind, comatose, or named Pauly Shore. As for me, the reason I enjoyed this film so much because it was - by definition - awfully good.<br /><br />Besides, give Seagal a break, he's been busy making music albums lately.<br /><br />Don't let the critics get your down Steve, it's not about quality, it's about quantity... and big man, you pump out the DVD turds as if you lived on a cabbage-only diet.
