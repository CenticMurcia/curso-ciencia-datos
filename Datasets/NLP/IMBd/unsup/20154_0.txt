My wife and I saw the movie last night. We felt a full range of emotions during the movie and even shed a few tears. The movie did not preach but it gave some great examples of how to live your life. Too bad only 3 other people were in the theater for a 7pm show in Ann Arbor. <br /><br />I did not give it a 10 because there were a few choppy parts that could of transitioned better. I didn't understand the part right before the ultimate gift. The older main characters were wonderful. I agree with another post that Drew Fuller could have done a better job.<br /><br />Take your family. This would be a good movie for youth groups to see. You won't be sorry. There was nothing objectionable that I remember.
