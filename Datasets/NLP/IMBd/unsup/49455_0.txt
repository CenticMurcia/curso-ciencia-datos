I liked the previous two installments of the series so I gave it a try and rented this stinker.<br /><br />First of all, the story had no suspense or action whatsoever. Only the last 10 (or 5) minutes show a little action when the main character (a peeping Tom who only lives to take photos of other people) kills some bugs with an explosion in his kitchen while he hides in the fridge.<br /><br />The film moves along at snails pace and although it only runs for about 70 minutes or so it feels like 3 hours.<br /><br />The story also makes little sense and offers no or very little explanation. If you don't know Mimic 1 or 2 you won't have any clue whats going on, where the bugs come from, why they are so big, why they mimic humans and so on. There is NO explanation at all.<br /><br />All in all, a waste of time and money. When the end credits rolled I was thinking "WTF, it can't end like this?". Very lame.<br /><br />And what was a great actor like L. Hendriksen doing in such a movie? Did he really need the money?<br /><br />Guys, avoid this movie. Rent Pitch Black or Aliens instead if you want to see a good monster movie. No wonder this stinker went straight to video. 1/10.
