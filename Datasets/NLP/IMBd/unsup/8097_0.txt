This film was a disappointment, my cable provider described it as a witty comedy, but it was awful. The cast proved that light romantic comedy is harder than it looks. Avoid this movie it's not very funny and doesn't make any sense.The script from Peter Morgan (The Queen, Last King of Scotland) was weak, the plot feeble and you didn't really care about any of the characters.<br /><br />Martha (Monica Potter)is an American woman on the rebound. She escapes from a failed romance in Minnesota and hops on a cheap flight to London. At the airport she meets Daniel (Tom Hollander), a short but successful music executive. Everyday he meets attractive women but falls in love with Potter at their first encounter. Martha does not reciprocate Daniel's advances but because she only has $35 to her name she accepts his hospitality. Martha meets Laurence (Joseph Fiennes) and promptly falls in love with him. Fiennes and Hollander are best friends. The series of coincidences and chance meetings defy credibility.
