I was hesitant to watch this movie based solely on the first ten minutes because it was so cheesy, but after a while I eased into it and found that this movie was so bad and so cheesy, it was good. It had the mood and mindset of the old fifties movies except alot more gorier. The killer in this keeps a scarf over his face like "The Shadow" and he sounds ridiculous but it's always so comical yet tense. The plot and movie are so goofy, and it never takes itself seriously. The funniest part is when they're setting the stake - out and the librarian faints. Watch this for its humor and campiness, but don't expect a masterpiece.
