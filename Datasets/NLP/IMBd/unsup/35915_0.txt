It wasn't stupid, boring, retarded, or confusing. Don't take reviews that say any of that too seriously, because those are all things the movie was going for.<br /><br />That said, it's also not that good. Mainly that was due to the lack of any plot line at all, and lack of any major action sequences at all.<br /><br />I don't ask for much plot in movies like this, but a little bit of a cohesive story wouldn't have hurt anything. A little less boring scenes and more actual focus on the sheep and their attacking wouldn't have hurt either. It had an INSANE amount of potential, but it didn't use even half of it. Instead it tried to characterize clichés with legs and tried to have some sort of plot that collapsed in on itself. With such an original premise (well, compared to yet another monster movie) it's just sad to see such clichés.<br /><br />Funny? Not really. As I said, way too much lame characterization and "What's going on?" dialog.<br /><br />Gory? Once again, not really. There is one scene with comical mass bloodbath, but other than that the movie is basically goreless. And the gore that is there is so generic and "seen a hundred times" that it's really nothing to get excited about.<br /><br />Overall, worth watching on TV for free. Maybe worth a rental. I don't see why anyone would go out and buy this, though. It had a lot of originality, but just as much wasted potential.<br /><br />1/10
