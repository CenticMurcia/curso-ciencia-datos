Joe Eszterhas co-authored this screenplay (from an original treatment by he and Richard Marquand) about a convict (the able-bodied but colorless Jean-Claude Van Damme) who is on the run from the law after a prison-bus breakout. He takes up with a small town single mom (Rosanna Arquette) who seems ready to love him no matter what his crimes! Vehicle for action-star Van Damme begins quite well but quickly degenerates into sap and silliness. Eszterhas' plot is thin and derivative, not to mention ridiculous, and Arquette is pretty much wasted. There's a surprisingly minimal amount of visual excitement after the opening bust-out; that's all well and good, except that nothing of interest takes its place. *1/2 from ****
