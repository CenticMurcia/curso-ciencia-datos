...And it's not because of the B-grade gore!<br /><br />First of all I need to address the fact that a lot of people are comparing this movie to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, saying that it's essentially a remake.<br /><br />I just watched it and it probably feels that way because the entire movie is just a pastiche of cult horror... All I can say is that I REALLY HOPE that The Devil's Rejects is better than this, because this movie probably ranks amongst the 10 worst movies I have ever seen (and don't worry, it isn't worse than The Abyss). Reading a review of the movie here claiming that anyone who doesn't like this movie "just doesn't get it" and was probably looking for more artsy-fartsy films and [ insert pretentious/derogatory comment here ] really made me feel ill; people are ACTUALLY comparing this movie with greats such as Suspiria and The Dead series?! If you rank this movie with those movies there's nothing wrong with the guy questioning the legitimacy of your rankings... but there's definitely something wrong with YOU!<br /><br />The movie doesn't start out all that bad and has a kind of wacky, goofball-horror that sort of works. Anyone who doesn't either laugh or groan at the moniker of DR. Satan (muahahahahahahahaha *lightningbolts*) has probably never watched B-grade horror or can't appreciate unintentional comedy (and this movie is hopefully not both). When the hook of the movie starts the whole movie begins to plummet into a sea of bad ideas and impulsive directing. The only thing I really like about the movie is the stylized americana feel... it's kind of cozy in a way.<br /><br />All in all this movie is yet another movie of the times, yet don't dismiss it because of the violence; dismiss it because it just isn't that good! Unlike the Saw movies that are ridiculous beyond belief with bad scripts, goofy traps and twists made to make you feel intellectually inferior to the writers this movie is actually all about shock and gore and good ol' fashioned fun at which... it fails. Regardless of how you rationalize it no amount of gore, camp or references to your old faves in the horror genre can save a movie with over-the-top acting, a weak script and uninspired directing. <br /><br />I hold no prejudice towards anyone who likes this movie. By all means, revel in the gore if you so wish! Because when the day is done that is why you watch this movie. Some might call it a study in misanthropy... I just call it an 89 minute waste of life.
