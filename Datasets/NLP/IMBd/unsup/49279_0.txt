The trailer certainly did its job attracting this viewer. I was not sure what type of movie I expected based on the trailer, but what I saw was nothing like what I thought I'd be seeing. The actual storyline was somewhat silly. The characters were by no means believable. I thought I liked Paul Giamatti, but his acting seems be the same as in the Cinderella Man. Bryce Dallas Howard is someone I cannot place, although she has been in a few big movies. She couldn't act her way out of a wet paper bag, much less out of a swimming pool. I have grown really tired of stereotypical Asian butchering of English. My wife is Chinese. Her second language is English. She doesn't sound like the Young-Sook Choi character. For that matter, few to none of the people I met and taught over my three years in China sounded like the Choi character. Overall, I thought the acting was fairly bad. I should have waited for it to come out on video.
