Let me give the pros first. Brigitte Nielsen looks really good in this film and actually acts capably. She is also killed off in about 10 minutes. There is an attractive actress at the beginning who gets naked and then killed stupidly.<br /><br />That's it. There's nothing else to recommend about it.<br /><br />Matt
