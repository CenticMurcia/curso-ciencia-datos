As moronic as one would expect. For the brain-impaired this is a treat: one explosion after another, and a whole bunch of "tough" guys snarling and threatening each other in almost every other scene. Woods makes the most (which isn't much) out of a standard psychotic-bad-guy role, while Stallone is not only unconvincing but quite laughable, as well. Sharon Stone tries hard to be even worse than Stallone, which she manages quite often. Eric Roberts is his usual menacing "or-I-'ll-kill-ya" self, and his character hasn't aged a day since he killed Stone's parents some decades ago (a scene which is shown as a flashback a couple of times), or are they implying that the nearly middle-aged Stone is eighteen in this movie? (For those not convinced that Stone's small breasts come from a land called Siliconia, this movie will be a disappointment; the shower scene removes all doubt.) Steiger neither looks Latino nor does he do a Spanish accent that goes beyond silly. The dialog begs for a MST3K treatment.
