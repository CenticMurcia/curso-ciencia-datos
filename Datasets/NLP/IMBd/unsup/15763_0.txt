This movie is Charles Band at his classic best. It has; living toys, midgets, a man with his face painted like a clown for absolutely no good reason, a guy with a head the size of an avocado, a female rock band in a cage (Again, for no good reason.), S&M, torture, dismemberment and did I mention that it continues Mr. Band's obessesion with living toys? Oh, I did... Sorry about that. If you love everything that is bad about Full Moon go out and buy this movie today. That's right, I said buy it. Don't waste the three bucks on the rental!
