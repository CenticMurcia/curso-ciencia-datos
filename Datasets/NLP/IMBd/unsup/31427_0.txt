(my comments are based on the uncensored 85 min. director's cut. stay away from the butchered 72 min. cut R-rated version)<br /><br />everytime i have seen this movie i always have the same reaction. What a strange, f**ked up film!! <br /><br />the film has a real sleazy look to it and it fits the subject matter like a glove. the movie is basically stating that todays teenagers are basically damned souls creating and existing in a hell of their own creation.<br /><br />Rose McGowan fans should take note that she basically stays nude and in some provocative and graphic sexual situations throughout practically the whole movie. i've never been that big of a fan of hers. other than having fantastic breasts, up until seeing this movie i never found much to like about her. she seems to exist in her other movies just as window dressing.<br /><br />well, for some reason she seems to really connect with her character in this movie and bring a highly believable sense of in your face sexuality that really makes an impression on the viewer. the other actors in the movie do pretty solid work but in my opinion this is really a Rose McGowan vehicle.<br /><br />when violence occurs in this movie it's usually very quick, explicit and bloody. the numerous sex scenes and dialogue are also more explicit than most people would care for. the filmmakers leave nothing to the imagination and that is this movie's strong point in my opinion.<br /><br />if you really want to check something out that is different but at the same time a good movie, check this one out. but be warned it is a weird, weird movie.<br /><br />rating:7 (unrated version)
