I bought this film second hand for real cheap a couple of years ago... I was drawn in by the cool cover art that Medusa pictures made for it. Now, despite what everybody else says...this movie really isn't bad at all, its got great soundtrack, style and actors.The main actor Vince Colosimo is perfect as the good looking hero of the story and makes the character sympathetic as a tough guy who's just from the wrong side of the tracks and is really a nice guy!Watch out for the part were he hits one of his teachers in the face when she bullies him...cool scene! Also the song on the end credits "Every Beat Of My Heart" by Jon English is such a cool song.The only slight fault of this movie is that it is a tad too long but hey, we cant hold that against it... so my advice would be to get it despite of the bad comments from others...and definitely check it out if you love eighties style movies and eighties rock music cause there's tons of that cool stuff!!!I should also mention that this film is hard to come by but you should try get it one ebay because it is worth it.The story to it is about a young dude called Vinnie who does boxing in his spare time but keeps getting kicked out of school.His mother is going out with a real scumbag guy because the father died.He often beats her and Vinnie thinks hes no good for her!Vinnies mother asks him to join the school band because she thinks it will keep him busy and off the streets away from all the bad action and maybe help him with a future career! All during this film there is some really great music by rare rock bands like Dragon...some of the cool songs are "New Hero","Wilder World" and "No Angels Tonight" all of which are brilliant tunes that you'll find yourself humming them for the following couple of days!
