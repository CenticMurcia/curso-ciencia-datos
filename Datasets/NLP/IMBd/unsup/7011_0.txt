OK a lot of folks complain about this film. It is a great storyline with great SFX for the time. Its like comparing a 08 Cadillac XLR with a 59 Coupe DeVille. Ya see back in the day...movies relied on good acting. Instead of mind candy SFX. This is a good buy and a joy to watch. I saw this movie as a kid at the Whalom drive-in Leominster Massachusetts. I remember it vividly! Dinosaurs and wicked cool sea beasts make a kids imagination come alive. A classic take of betrayal and good guy beats bad guys and wins girl. Anyone who complains about this would be the same person complaining about the guy in the rubber godzilla suit. Its about the story and the acting. 1978 guys! Star wars came out about the same time ya know!
