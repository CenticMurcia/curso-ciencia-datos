I felt as though I had been hoodwinked about fifteen minutes into this movie. The trailer made it look like it might be funny and charming, which it was not. Men dancing in a silly way and men wearing silly hats are highly suggestive of comedy, warmth, and charm. That and nice scenery (inherent in Asain cinema) were what I was expecting. Instead I got a sermon told through the stories of completely flat characters. When I used to work at Cheddar's, I was the world's worst waiter for about two weeks, but it wasn't entirely my fault. One of the things I got in trouble for was constantly spilling Margaritas. However, the management at Cheddar's had selected Margarita glasses that were much more like plates with stems than anything meant to hold a beverage. I would come to the bar with wet sleeves and ask for more over and over again. The customers got angrier, my sleeves got drunker, and eventually I quit, preempting being fired. These characters were like those Margarita glasses. This was a shabby, preachy fable, which could have been told more artfully with my nipple hair directing and my toenail clippings as actors. Shame on everyone for giving this a high rating. I fear I have fallen victim to the because it's foreign and independent it must be good and I'm a filthy commoner if I don't enjoy it crowd. Don't do the same.
