This video nastie was initially banned, but allowed release without any cuts. Supposedly it was the cover and the subject matter that was found offensive, and not the actual film.<br /><br />Of course, many would find the film offensive. It was poorly shot, had no real actors, had really boring sex scenes, and was just a cheap naziplotation film.<br /><br />I have not been able to confirm that this was used as training material for the torturers at Gitmo. The limited torture in the film would probably not make it of much use. There was no water-boarding, for example, but there was an interesting use of boiling/freezing water.<br /><br />If you are looking for a cheap film that makes extensive use of full frontal nudity, this may be just the thing. If you love Bush, then you will find a forest here.
