OK, before watching this show, it is important that you are aware that the next 30 minutes is going to be full or randomness, silliness, and general surrealism. For example, Vic's assistant Les, is scared of chives, but smiles in delight at spirit levels. A pair of talking carpets, who's catchphrases are "You lying get", that could get tiresome, but they manage to keep it fresh by adding surreal quotes in between. If I were compare this to anything, I would say it would be like the 'Trout Mask Replica' by Captain Beefheart of the Television. At first you'll be thinking "What the hell is this?", after a while, you'll love it. If you enjoy this, be sure to get 'The Smell of Reeves and Mortimer', it is funnier, and is more of a sketch show, but equally surreal.
