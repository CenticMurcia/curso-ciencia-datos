Having not seen many John waters films I certainly can't call myself an avid follower of his movies. One thing I can say is that having seen this one I won't be rushing to see any of his other films. A dirty shame tried to be funny and I got the feeling it was trying to make a point on peoples views on sex but I just didn't find it funny. I wasn't particularly offended by anything in the film although I can imagine some people would be. I'm sure there will be many John waters fans who will love this movie and think it's hilarious. I will just remember to avoid ever watching this very trashy unfunny film again. If John waters was aiming to be trashy he got it spot on. If he was intending it to be funny he missed the target completely.
