This movie is beyond incredibly bad. The first half hour shows promise, but goes laughably downhill immediately after the real story comes to light. Save your money and precious time out of your life by avoiding this movie like the black plague. I kid you not...it is REALLY that bad! The acting was laughable, the dialogue cheezy and the story, although different, was grasping at straws to be TOO different. I threw it in the trash right after watching it. It starts out suspenseful, but turns comedic shortly after. Even my normally jumpy wife was disappointed and laughing at the sub par acting and ridiculous storyline. How this movie even made it to release is beyond me. I've had commercials grab my attention more.<br /><br />Satan drinks buttermilk!!....lol
