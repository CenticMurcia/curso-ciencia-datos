I enjoyed the stephen king tale, i thought it did a good job from adapting from the book and it was creative, but the second story, was the most god awful thing ive ever seen on film, it was just horrible, i was in pain watching this, do your self a favor turn this movie off right after the first story, the second one is so bad. 3/10 for a good first story the only thing that gave it points
