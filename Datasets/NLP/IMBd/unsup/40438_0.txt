This is undoubtedly the worst movie EVER in cinema history! The jokes are lame (the whole movie is lame) and the quality is just plain crap. I watched the DVD interviews and every actor said that they had faith in this piece of junk. Skeet and Leslie even commented how funny and fantastic the script was. <br /><br />I rented this out thinking it would be a good adult comedy, but it proved too childish for me - heck it might even be too childish for children. Now that I think of it, this movie has some rude (unfunny) jokes that are not suitable for children. I don't know who the movie was trying to reach, but it sure as heck wasen't me, or the 98% of people who have seen this movie.<br /><br />NOTE: See this movie to mock it only.
