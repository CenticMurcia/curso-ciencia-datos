An interestingly boring film which I managed to watch all the way through. I don't know how I did though. The acting was appalling and the story line was mediocre.<br /><br />A story of a man who was taken from his family as a baby and turned into to a human telepathic machine where he can move anything with his mind. He escapes and finds his sister and they run form the army and a select few special ops officers.<br /><br />Only watch if you like bad acting.<br /><br />I mean that!!<br /><br />My rating - 3/10
