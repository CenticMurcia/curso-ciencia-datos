You can pretty much choose sides from the other User Comments here. No need to rehash it all again. If there is ANY sympathy for boys or men here, I missed it. I say: This is a whiny, preposterous fem-biased look at several inter-related love relationships, told by Mandy Moore at the center. I say: if women were described this way non-stop for a whole movie, this film would be ripped from the malls and somebody would have to start apologizing.<br /><br />As talented as Moore is, she needs to put a lot of "pout" on just to get through this film.<br /><br />Why? Because Dads, Moms, new boyfriends, boyfriends of friends, parents of sister's boyfriends -- everybody is just so inept, shallow, faithless, and NOT to be counted on. NOBODY COMES THROUGH FOR US KIDS.<br /><br />About the only people who really understand love, or can practice it with any decency are teen girls. And even they confess, it's hard to do. (A show of hands if anyone believes that -- besides teen girls.)<br /><br />And just when you think the film will deliver a laugh or an insight, all it can manage is one of those cheap, spur-of-the moment comments that kids make up in the hallway between classes when there really isn't any time to think things through.<br /><br />Bad. Bad. Bad.<br /><br />
