I respect both Corman and Scorsese, but this early effort by Scorsese is not up to even the average work by either. Poor performances by the leads (including Carradine, who simply can't act) and the phony-sounding dialogue don't do justice to this depression-era piece.<br /><br />Another problem with this film (and one that Scorsese would learn to avoid in his future work) is that everything looks too clean and orderly. Everyone is well-washed (unless they've just been in a fight or fallen in a puddle), the camps are neatly laid out, and the interiors of the boxcars are almost spotless, with just enough nice, clean hay spread around so you won't see the actual floor of the sound-stage.<br /><br />The IMDb "Trivia" section includes a comment to the effect that the sex scenes between Carradine and Hershey were not simulated. You would never guess it from the film itself, since they are some of the most tepid you could imagine. They would probably get a PG-13 today, for brief frontal and rear nudity.<br /><br />Finally, the credits are up to the best Corman standards...hokey.<br /><br />This film was a disappointment, but I can suggest it as a curiosity for Scorses fans. All others need not waste their time.
