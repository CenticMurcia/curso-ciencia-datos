Just finished this B- action movie. and i have to say i liked it a lot!! Echavaria show he is indeed the new J.C. Van Damme(Average acting, Great fight scenes)But the coolest part has to be the chemistry between Echavaria and Kong Li(Kickboxer's Tong Po)They Try to Copy the Rush hour routine and succeed. Some scenes are very funny!! especially the car scene, Were echavaria Gives a great ricky martin impression(i laughed my ass off) you have to keep in mind that this was a pretty low Budget production, so all the credits go to the actors who really keep this one moving!! The direction is pretty good and especially the fight scenes at the end are the best i've seen in years! Latin Flavor All The WAY
