Bernie Mac show is very hilarious. It's a different type of show in which it seem to be a down to earth story of Bernie's experiences in every day life with his sisters kids,him and Wanda. The kids and his wife are excellent actor and actresses in their roles. If any of these things happened in real life to Bernie. all I can say is 'God Bless America.' I like the show because it really gives you a good belly laugh sometimes, its clean comedy and sometimes you can ID with him from things that has happened to the viewers own life experience. The show always make you laugh. It is a nice family show. I also like the the way Bernie talk to the viewers during the show.
