This film was made in the late 1960's, when the Soviet land troops (a so called "Warsaw Pact") was threatening a big part of the world. The main tune was to emphasize a Polish-Russian friendship during the 2nd world war. It was not true as Russians invaded Poland in 1939 together with Hitler and committed even worse war crimes than Germans.<br /><br />The purpose of the film was to attract young boys from Polish villages to join the army, especially armored units. It was very funny, but in each episode the food and common meals play a significant role (mainly canned food made in USA and supplied for the Red Army). As under communist yoke the food supply in Poland was very poor, scenes of eating full cans of meat might have attracted young boys to join the army.
