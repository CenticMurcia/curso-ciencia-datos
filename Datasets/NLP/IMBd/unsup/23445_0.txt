Eddie Murphy is at it again in his movie Imagine That. He plays Evan Danielson a Financial Executive who is on the brink of getting a promotion to head Executive. New Executive Thomas Haden Church (Johnny Whitefeather) puts up a fight with his so called Indian background. When close to loosing his job he discovers something to help with his odds in his favor. This movie also starring Nicole Ari Parker, Martin Sheen, Stephen Root, Yara Shahidi and Richard Schiff. The thing i liked most about this movie is how Evan spent more time with his daughter and how he realizes family is more important than work sometimes. This movie is a really great one to watch with the family. Be sure to check this one out at your local rental store. See my Reviews on getthenew.com, thanks ahb.
