As I understand it, Turkey made a bunch of no-budget versions of some of our most famous movies. "Seytan" is a prime example.

It's exactly the sort of movie with which "Mystery Science Theater 3000" would have had lots of fun. As this is a pretty obscure movie, probably one of the only places where you can find it is Portland's video/DVD store Movie Madness, under Turkish Action Cinema. Mind you, the subtitle translations are almost as moronic as the stuff that we find in kung fu movies. So check it out.<br /><br />I am gonna have to Google "zemzem".
