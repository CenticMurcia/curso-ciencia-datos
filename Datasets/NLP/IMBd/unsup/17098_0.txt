Though slightly better than its predecessor (CROW: CITY OF ANGELS), this one follows Crow numero dos by ripping off the scenario of the superior original film rather than acting as a sequel.<br /><br />Some decent acting, and the mood of melancholy keeps it afloat, but the extremely routine storyline is difficult for the viewer's emotions to overcome.<br /><br />** out of ****.
