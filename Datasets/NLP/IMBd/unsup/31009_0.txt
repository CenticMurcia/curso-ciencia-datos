"Meet the Spartans" is the only movie-movie after Scary Movie that was funny enough to keep me entertained. This has got to be the worst. The only funny part of the film was the opening titles, which was just so ridiculously awful that it made me laugh. Makers of the movie desperately in the need of easy money? Very likely.<br /><br />I really hope they stop making these money and time wasting, worthless peaces of dog sh*t. It seems that they're just repeating the same "jokes" over and over again and thinking that it still makes people laugh. Luckily this came out of the TV and I didn't need to waste anything else than electricity on it. I switched the channel after an hour of TRYING to watch it.<br /><br />Anyone who is interested in seeing this, stop being interested. Spend your money on something reasonable and skip this one. Ugh, even "Superhero Movie" was better than this, can you believe it? 1 out of 10 stars.
