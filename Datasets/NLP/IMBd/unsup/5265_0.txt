Apparently early space travelers is allot like what happened on Earth. They left to escape religious persecution and these pilgrims are hated for some strange reason. Bigotry is not to be tolerated by any means, race, creed, religion or style. It's just wrong and the main problem is this subplot of everyone hating this guy just because he's a "pilgram" decent. It's just wrong, now I don't know anything about the game series this movie is based on. I really don't. I can only judge by the movie. The effects are good, the Kirathi are cool, the story for the most part works. I know enough of the game that they got the first person outside the ship view and that's cool. It's cool. I give it...8 STARS
