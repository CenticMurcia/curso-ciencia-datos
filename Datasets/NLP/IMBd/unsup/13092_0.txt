While following the tales of local filmmakers, its usually fun to find Jersey films in Jersey theaters. Not this time. I read the "user comments" that have preceded mine and I noticed something odd. The positive reviews all came before the movie opened. Were these privileged viewers part of the "premiere" screening. If so, its likely they were part of the crowd that made this misfire. This film was average at best because of the fantastic, underused supporting cast. The always real Pat Hingle, the subtle Betsy Palmer, the hilarious Grant Shaud, the gorgeous and steady Emmanuelle Chriqui, the rock Marcella Lowery...and the list goes on. You could see the editors trying desperately to hide the blemish - Robert Capelli, Jr. They would obviously cut away from him often, leave him out of focus, dub his lines. Nothing worked. I notice this guy's done 3 movies in which he is the lead! I also notice he is either the producer or director on all of those films. Coincidence? He's either really wealthy, or a really good salesman. Give him credit for continuing to try. I admit I'm jealous. I'd love to have others financing my quest for fame. Hey, don't take our word for it-Check out Village Voice, Daily News, NY Post, Cinematical, etc. Can they all be wrong?
