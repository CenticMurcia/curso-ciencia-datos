One of the best Rts ever, and one of the best game ever made, everything in this game is almost perfect, the story, the characters, the playability, the soundtrack, the graphics, the videos, everything.<br /><br />"Starcratf" is one the most well succeeded internet game ever,it moved millions of people to play in the internet(battle-net). Starcraft have three races: Terran(humans), Zerg (a primitive race of alien) and Protoss(an evaluated alien race), they fighting each other to take control of the entire universe.<br /><br />Personally i like all "Blizzard" games, but this one its special. If you like Starcrat\BroodWar i recommend: "Warcraft 2 and 3"(Blizzard), "Comand and Conquer: Tiberian Sun" (Westwood)
