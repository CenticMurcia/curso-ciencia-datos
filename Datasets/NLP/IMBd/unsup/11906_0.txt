Remake of 1970 Neil Simon-scripted movie about an older couple (Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn) whose children have moved out. They travel to New York City so he can go to a job interview - and they endure practically every sort of misfortune imaginable.<br /><br />I definitely liked this one because I actually laughed a fair bit and I like it that the film doesn't overstay its welcome or go TOO far over-the-top. Top-notch comedy cast is a strong asset, with a well-cast John Cleese (as a hotel manager with a kinky secret) an enjoyable scene-stealer.<br /><br />Some people may find it amusing that one of the "Sex and the City" stars, Cynthia Nixon, plays a woman in a support group who is a sex addict!<br /><br />Trivia alert: that's Hawn's actual son, Oliver Hudson (star of a TV series that I think is called "My Guide to Becoming a Rock Star"), playing her and Martin's son in the airport scene.<br /><br />It's been a while since I've seen the 1970 original and I can't remember if I really liked it or not. Anyway, this is a decent comedy and I'm going to give it seven out of ten.
