Now i am a 15 year old and i just bought this movie a few days ago for a trip. I was think "Son of the Pink Panther," can't be all that good. But i was wrong! WAY WRONG! A BIG FAT WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!! This film is great i am not a fan of the first few films (The Pink Panther - Shot In The Dark) they arnt bad just not as funny. But the mid 70s ones are fantastic and now this! It was so funny i am still thinking of that line, "Hurry or they cut off my nipples!' it makes my laugh every time! Yes, Sellers is not in it. Yes it takes place ten years after the last one and yes it has a new guy. But it is good and worthy of a rental and even a buy! Not for the 40 year olds and up but for the teens and into the 20s.
