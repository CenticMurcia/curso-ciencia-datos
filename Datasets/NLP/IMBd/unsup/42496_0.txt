The Game RFM is brilliant in graphics and gameplay. the ps3's gears of war...but the game is very racist and insulting to any English man like myself. Monsterouse outbreak spreads round the world gets to Engalnd we can't handle it so Americans save the day.....what aload of bias,racist sh*te now my fellow American cousins reading this you have to understand my concern now if resistance fall of man was set in the US and England came to save the day im sure they would be many complaining (including me i think its bias for both country's both way round) . now it would have been nice if the story writers would have been more considerate and had it like all the world ad been taken over and the US,UK and the USSR joined forces to eradicate and had you fighting in different country's it wouldn't be as insulting to any one would it <br /><br />Summary: now you can either agree with me (i doubt it) or disagree but at least give it abit of thought before you agree or disagree I've made my review and i stick with it.... Good Graphic Good Gamplay just racist maybe without intent but it still is racist
