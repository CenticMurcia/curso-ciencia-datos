What a scream!<br /><br />Oliver Platt reinforced his greatness with me, perfecting his role as a neurotic Mafia man, and there were so many classic lines in this movie ("I can't even go to the bathroom without getting in a pissing contest.") that I will have to add this to my personal movie collection soon.<br /><br />I would think that this is a love/hate movie with most people, but I can't imagine anyone not laughing during the newspaper theft scene (with Oliver Platt and his neighbor). I am glad my eye caught this movie at the movie rental place!!
