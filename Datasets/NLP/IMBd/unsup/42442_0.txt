I totally disliked this film, because it just went ahead and threw the James Bond of lore out the window. The suave, sophisticated & witty super agent is gone. I'd rather not offend Mr Craig, but I must admit that he is the worst casted James Bond ever in the history of the series it's not his fault though because the filmmakers were the ones who chose him. I feel that if Mr Flemming or Mr. Broccoli were alive, they would not approve of the casting or even the spirit of this film. The film isn't terrible in a movie sense, but it doesn't fit as a James Bond film. James Bond has been well established in the cinema. Here James Bond has been reestablished as something else. You can either accept or reject it. I'm only 21, but even I will not accept this reinvention of Bond for a new audience or generation. I first discovered Bond as a child in awe of the magic of the films of old.I consumed them all, cheered for Bond and indulged in these adventures. Sadly that magic has faded, and boring realism and drama has taken the forefront in an attempt to reinvent Bond, though it may have been acceptable if the Bond was right and if the Bond spirit was still in tact. The attempt at believability was destroyed by an unbelievable James Bond, the original foundation is too great. Connery, Lazenby, Moore, Dalton & Brosnan were all good acceptable James Bonds. Even Niven in the original Casino Royale, bond spoof was acceptable. They were all debonair gents. Craig doesn't portray that and he doesn't look or act right. I'd argue that Craig would be a good Villain in a Bond film.
