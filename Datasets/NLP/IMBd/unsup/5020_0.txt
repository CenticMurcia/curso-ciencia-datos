I'm a huge fan of romantic comedies and when I saw this movie on family channel I instantly loved it.This is not your average romance story but it's filled with humor , love and revenge. Brian Austin Green from Beverly Hills 90210 and Carly Pope made an adorable couple and Sara Rue was funny and brilliant.Once in our lives we dream of going back and changing the past for Melissa Rochester (Pope) that time is now. Back in junior high Mel (Margel)& her best friend Gabby Castellani (MacIssac) were the biggest nerds, she had a huge crush on Drew Hesler (Knox) the school hunk and total jock. When word gets out of her secret crush he plays a cruel and hurtful joke by pretending to be interested only to turn her down and humiliate her in front of the entire school. 11 years later the two girls have transformed into beautiful women, Mel is a PR executive and Gabby (Rue) is a department store clerk. When she's given the task of handling the publicity for a new restaurant she's shocked to discover that the owner is Drew Hesler (Green) her former bully. Gabby comes up with a plan to have him fall in love with Mel and then break his heart just like he did to her. The situation is further complicated when Mel actually falls in love with him.This film totally rocks and in my book it's an adorable romantic comedy 8/10
