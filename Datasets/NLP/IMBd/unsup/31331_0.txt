I think this an excellent program, the power of this show is not the visuals (CSI looks 'smoother, cooler') but the characters really work great together. All very different people, but with a magical chemistry between them. I personally very much like the character of Abby, and the interaction between DiNozzo and Todd (I know she isn't in the series anymore. but we here in the Netherlands haven't got to that point yet). All in all it is one of my favorite shows, and it sure as hell beats CSI, if you ask me, but then again "its a matter of taste".<br /><br />The fact that it focuses only on the 'naval criminal investigations' maybe limiting the possibilities of where the producers can go with the show, without going 'over the top'. Then again, if you were to let the show be about any sort of murders, on any place they might also be tempted to go over the top. Lots of things to think about, and enough things to there may be wrong or weird about this show, but the chemistry works. And it is that working chemistry that I think makes a good show.
