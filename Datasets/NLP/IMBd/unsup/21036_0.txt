After reading handfuls of good reviews on this site, and then reading many comments that said the bad reviews are wrong, I sought out to purchase this film. Big mistake. The negative reviews are a spot-on match. The acting itself is horrible, and the plot makes no sense. The whole premise of the movie is that these brothers or "saints" are trying to rid the streets of evil. Now it is easy to understand if you kill innocent people, that is wrong, but what about going to a strip club? Is that evil too? I don't want to be judged by two brothers cracked out on a power hungry drunken binge. How does this make sense for all of the fans? I seem to recall one of the commandments that states something like "thou shalt not kill" well then these brothers must have slept through that part of their heavily religious upbringing. I don't know what all these people are thinking that rate the movie so highly, it is awful.
