Fortunately, I neither rented nor paid a dime to see this movie. A friend of mine who I actually like highly recommended it and lent it to me. I must say that I now evaluate everything she says and does in a different light. The whole plot is a series of impersonations and characters that Dana Carvey can easily handle, but this movie's funny points could have been a 3 minute stand-up routine at best. I only watched the whole thing to be able to discuss it with my friend. The highlights were the Robert Shaw bit and a very small amount of the Al Pacino bit. The first time Brent Spiner farted, maybe. But the Turtle Club scene and some of the dialog was so mindless that I refused to let my six year old watch the movie. It definitely belongs in the bottom 100 of all time.
