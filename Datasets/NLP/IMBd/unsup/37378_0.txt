This was not one of Shirley Temple's better films and the cast didn't help much. There are several actors and actresses in the film that I like but they couldn't bring the film through to a good movie. The acting was so-so and the script didn't help much at all.<br /><br />Stepin Fetchit did well in a non-credited role but didn't save the movie.<br /><br />In addition Frank Morgan seemed to me to be sleepwalking his way through his role.<br /><br />Some of the cast did what they could but the vehicle didn't allow them to do what they could.<br /><br />All that said, little Miss Temple did what she did so well and almost managed to make it a good movie. She was, however, cast in a mediocre film but was still entertaining. Watch it for her performance.<br /><br />I did winced at the blackface ... 70 years DOES make difference.
