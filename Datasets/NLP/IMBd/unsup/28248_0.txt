This is my first written movie review ever.<br /><br />I never heard about Astro Boy before today. I decided to go ahead and watch it based on IMDb grade. And only thing left after seeing it was a wish to warn others not to see it. Except if your a kid up to...let's be generous... 9 years old.<br /><br />Characters are one dimensional and stereotypical, plot is just plain stupid and unimaginative and at (lots of) times doesn't make much sense. Only mildly interesting characters were the RRF robots. Didn't get the point when President is still speaking of reelection after being absorbed by a giant robot destroying city.<br /><br />You were warned.
