I really don't know what to say about this film that could help someone understand it. I think this film stands for what is good and fun about Canadian cinema, like 'Paint Cans' stands for what is bad and awful about Canadian cinema. Not that I didn't like 'Paint Cans'. I haven't seen this film for quit some time either. So if you come across it somewhere, pick it up, I have a feeling that it is a rare find. Those more contemporary film buffs out there may be impressed to find Mr. Coltrane playing an American visitor (most recently starring in the Hughes Bros. 'From Hell' and 'Harry Potter', who is actually a Brit with a very stellar international career). This film is just a plain good time. And for anyone really in touch with Canadian film culture, this thing has its finger on the pulse of quirky. FORE!
