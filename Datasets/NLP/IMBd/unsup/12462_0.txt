A !970 GTO Judge. The humble growling of the 455 engine. Mr. GTO (Warren Oats), claims at one point that he got bored flying jet fighter planes, so he bought the Judge to get back the excitment. This movie is a cult/classic for car buffs.James Taylor (the driver) and Dennis Wilson,(the Mechanic) are incredible. You really get the true feeling and passion for their love of cars and street racing. This movie will be enjoyed by all car freaks, and is of special delight to GTO lovers. Once you see it, you will want to see it time and time again. Too bad it's not available on video.
