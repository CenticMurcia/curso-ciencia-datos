to be honest, this is one of those movies you just come across on TV and watch it just to kill some time.<br /><br />at least, it was that way for me during the first couple of minutes but then i realized it was more about the man behind the cars.<br /><br />enzo ferrari is one of the most powerful figures for racing and one doesn't become as powerful for no reason and this movie is all about him.<br /><br />people who want to see lots of cars and technical stuff shouldn't watch this movie but there is the struggle of a man trying to create a company that will eventually become a legend.
