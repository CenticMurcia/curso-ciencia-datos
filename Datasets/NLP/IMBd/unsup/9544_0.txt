it is simply funny, amusing, watchable movie, full of colours, commercial and video - clip aesthetic but definitely one of the best movies I've seen lately. Doesn't let you bored for a single minute as it presents amazing characters of a teenage homoerotic gang, a man who is trying to kill his wife who is ever more powerful and beautiful coming back from the grave, a daddy who becomes a bird in hypnosis, his hypnotiser who gets killed on stage by a British professional murderer whose ideal answer to a question "What is your function in life?" is "Nothing". Five separate faiths are suddenly connected by a murderer, each in its own way, all the stories which are not connected at the first glance suddenly make sense. Absurd, surrealistic, glam comedy:)))))
