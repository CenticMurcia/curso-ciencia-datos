This is by far the worst movie I have seen from Disney Channel. The story was weak and so was the chemistry between all the actors. Most appalling was the sexual innuendos. This is the Disney Channel! Please! My kids didn't even like it. Completely inappropriate and not even fun to watch. Another comment was posted comparing it to "Hook", "A Series of Unfortunate Events", etc. I have yet to figure out the comparison. We enjoyed the other movies. This one left a negative impact on us toward Disney. If it was on any other channel I would understand. Although, it still wouldn't have been good. It was choppy and the reaction from some of the characters at times made absolutely no sense.
