I think we all know that every movie, whether it's comedy, drama or otherwise puts our main character through some challenges and awkward messes. It's basic storytelling. So it's no spoiler to note that this film does just that. My problem is, it just goes to far with it and spends waaay to much time there, over a third of the film, about 40 minutes and then cleans it all up in less than 10. Maybe it wasn't so much the length of ACT2 to place the blame as it is the fact that it has zero elements of comedy. It is way to serious, uncomfortable, scary and sad. This film should have never been made with this script. Act 2 needed serious work and any college kid would have certainly received a poor grade with it in a scriptwriting class. It really annoys me when big stars get away with making junk just because of the weight their name carries.
