The show Battlestar Galactica is like a roller coaster ride and I don't mean that in a positive sense. There are some brilliant episodes such as episode 4 of this series (Exodus: Part 2) and there are ones like this one with all the pointless and constructed drama of a soap opera.<br /><br />There were more of those long slow scenes with Admiral Adama and President Roslin staring at each other. Unfortunately some might call this great acting but to me it seems like they're just filling in time.<br /><br />I cannot surely be the only person dreading having to watch through more of the tedious Apollo vs. Starbuck melodrama. Starbuck is a train wreck and seems to be eternally heading for her comeuppance but never seems to get it. She is just a poor replacement for the beautiful and pleasant Anastasia Dualla and Apollo is obviously an idiot, but then a lot of the characters on this show are idiots.<br /><br />The episode was also inconsistent. At the end of the second series just before the arrival of the Cylons on New Caprica there was a feeling as if everyone more or less hated living there. It was cold, there were strikes and it seemed that people were dissatisfied. In this episode one got the feeling that life on New Caprica was good and they were all loving it. Oh, and one other thing, Chief Tyrol's baby was not born on the Galactica, as indicated in this episode. Since his wife was pregnant at that union meeting just before the Cylons arrived (which was led by the then-civilian Tyrol), his baby was obviously born during the Cylon occupation.<br /><br />Perhaps the idea with the boxing match was original and a change but all in all, a poor episode.
