Hilarious early 80s cheese fest, worthy of the MST3K treatment that this masterpiece garnered. I watched this in the early days of cable so it has a certain nostalgia; it truly is amazing how these brilliant and tiny number of scientists can swiftly interpret the data at hand to come up with staggering conclusions to reshape mankind as we know it. Truly stupendous. A must for conspiracy theorists and fans of ultra cheesy sci fi. As movie critic Leonard Maltin stated: "Clickly made, but about as credible as the three stooges in outer space." I loved that line. As for the movie, it has a spot on my list of guilty pleasures.
