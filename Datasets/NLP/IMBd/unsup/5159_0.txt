Lucky break is one of those rare movies that basically went straight to DVD and one you rent if you've got a coupon from Blockbuster. Pay the $3.00 bucks and you won't be disappointed. I found the story completely original and an unpredictable but great ending.<br /><br />*** out of 4<br /><br />P.S Watch the ending credits.
