"Big Night" came off to me exactly like a movie that a bunch of actors who were friends decided to make together and of course each one wanted at least one big dramatic scene for themselves, so those of their friends that were writing the script and the friend directing gave them each one. And that was pretty much the entire story. They forgot that acting is not about "playing a character," it is about giving the audience an experience. My experience was that they were not in the least concerned with me, the watcher. It was all ego on the screen. I was bored throughout.<br /><br />I felt the same way about "The Imposters," which Tucci also co-wrote.
