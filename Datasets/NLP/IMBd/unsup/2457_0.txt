I keep hearing about the loss of what made the other films great. Well to me T3 was recycled garbage with no style and no excitement. And my fondest moments of T2 are the best action sequences in film history, the heart pounding suspense of the action scenes are what made that film great along with good humor. It was never really the story telling that made it classic even though it was good. If you believe it was you are lieing to your self. MCG does mess up somethings like the intro, but not the action. This is the best pure action movie in awhile. Many better action movies but not as dazzling in action sequences as this. Iron man on pure action left more to be desired and Dark knight is magnificent but still a little to grounded.<br /><br />This movie is the first since Transformers in which the action had me stunned. Not to mention the style is back. From the wasteland to Skynet the production is magnificent. Especially the last fight scene in Skynet with the T-800 (the colors and look are beautifully reminiscent of the steel mill from T2). Bottom line is that I critique movies very tough. But with all the great reminiscent moments and dazzling effects I don't see how this movie is being torn apart by reviews like it is. X-men Orgings was a mess and was a disgrace to X2. How is this movie in that same league I don't get it. There have been worse movies than how this is getting attacked. Bottom line is I love T2 and am proud to say this was a good movie of which I had a great time viewing and look forward to the sequels. Other than what I think the critiques can all go to hell. Right!!!
