Contagion. I suppose that if I tried hard enough I could come up with an adequate review of this movie, but it just does not even seem worth it. Contagion is one of those movies that is so terrible that one finds themselves loving it for the sheer comedic value it holds. The special effects were shabby to say the least, and at some parts the camera work was enough to make one sick. The storyline sounds like it was written by someone with the IQ of a soap dish. The dialogue between characters was so incredibly staged and unrealistic it was as if it was being read off a prompter as the movie was being filmed. In addition, THE MILITARY CANNOT JUST BLOW UP A CIVILIAN HELICOPTER! That's the least of the unrealistic plot elements. So many parts of this movie just do not make sense. The twists and turns of the movie were terribly overdone. There were too many of them and none were even realistic. If one event occurs that defies all odds, that is fine for a movie; it adds a little "miracles are possible" feeling. However, when every other change of pace involves something that defies all odds, it gets old. Quickly. All in all, the movie was just plain bad. To try to explain it more in depth is truly not worth it. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad.
