East meets West as Mifune and Bronson hunt for a golden sword and a stolen treasure, respectively. Some quite good action scenes, particularly the climax in the cane field on fire -- some wonderful images. Andress has only 2 dimension to her character (as written, not her fault in particular), but at least one of them is her breasts. Has a bitter edge and somewhat ambiguous ending: Bronson ditches Andress but gives back the sword, saying: "I don't have much else to do."<br /><br />If you're a fan of westerns of the continental variety, watch it.<br /><br />Excellent music by Maurice Jarre -- anyone know where I can find a copy?
