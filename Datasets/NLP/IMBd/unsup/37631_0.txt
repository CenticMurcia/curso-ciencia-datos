I used to love this movie when it came out when I was like 7 or 8. But now I look back on this and all of the no limit stuff that I liked and I wanted to...starve myself for 5 days as punishment. Now that I look back on this movie I simply think of it as okay whereas when I was 7 or 8 I thought this was the junk. I'm glad I have come to my senses but I do think that this movie is worth renting for those who haven't done so yet. I have 3 lines to burn now so I'm gonna use them bad mouthing other no limit movies. Hot boys. Horrible friggin' movie I didn't like that movie when I 1st saw it and i now haaaate it. Actually in general, i hate all of these stupid shoot em' up movies with rappers in them. DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! DIE! Not the rappers, the movies.
