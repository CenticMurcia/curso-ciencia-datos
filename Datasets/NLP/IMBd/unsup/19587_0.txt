This is both awe-inspiring and goofy at the same time, when Senator Bulworth, tired of what he's doing, suddenly decides to speak the truth to voters. It's all about big money and they mean nothing. At first it's not well received but then apparently folks decide that they like it, too bad he's put a hit out on himself to end it all though and the guy that arranged all that has a heart attack before he can call off the hit. This is somewhat of a brave movie but then again it doesn't hold together very well at times. Halle Berry is one of 3 young ladies that hook up with the Senator and follow him around, and she herself may have another motive for doing so. Most amusing is Beatty in South Central garb going down to the cleaners to check on his suit and hooking up with a bunch of little street hoodlums and buying them ice cream, only to end up having to defend them from the bullying cops in the area. I can't say this is a comfortable movie to watch, nor a family feature, not only because it has lots of bad words but it's also against other things that are apparently revered in this country, like the golden rule (he who has the gold makes the rules). If you have an open mind and a sense of humor then you may like this. I myself don't care much for hip-hop or rap but in this it was at least tolerable. 7 out of 10.
