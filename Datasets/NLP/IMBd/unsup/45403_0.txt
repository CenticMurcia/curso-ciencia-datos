No great lines, no memorable scenes (okay, maybe one with the<br /><br />old lady near the end), no interesting twists of fate, no comments<br /><br />on the human condition. A downer of movie, with unrelentingly<br /><br />unpleasant people being unrelentingly unpleasant. You never get<br /><br />to know any of the people or find out their motivations; just as well.<br /><br />If you're going to rip off David Mamet, you should at least have a<br /><br />real nude scene, not just some steamy pillow talk.<br /><br />Some decent acting (notably Ed Harris) and okay cinematography<br /><br />saved The Prime Gig from oblivion, but I could give it no higher<br /><br />than a 2.
