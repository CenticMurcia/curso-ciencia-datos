This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. Johnny Depp is normally outstanding, but in this he is woeful. His accent is all of the place and the script is modern not period. Robbie Coultrane took the money and run as he gave his best ever Cracker performance.<br /><br />This Jack the Ripper mystery is incredibly dull. Johnny Depp plays a detective with clairvoyant powers, and you might think those powers would come in handy when looking for Jack the Ripper, but you'd be wrong.<br /><br />Heather Graham (who's accent also slips out - when it should be her tits)is gratingly out of place as a prostitute her colleagues all look like hags while she looks like a model.<br /><br />It doesn't more pompous and poor as this.
