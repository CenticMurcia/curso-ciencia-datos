I found the basic premise of this movie to be quite interesting. A craft designed to go into space that ends up sinking beneath the ocean. The special effects were a bit weak, but I found the opening sequence where the mission goes bad and they have to abort to be rather exciting.<br /><br />Then the talking starts. It seems the one woman crew member gets around NASA pretty well. She is married to a NASA commander who did not fly on this mission, and has told him she wants a divorce. There's some history with the commander of the current mission, and despite the fact that he should be focusing on the crew's survival, all he can think about is getting back together after her divorce is final.<br /><br />This soap opera is doomed once the focus changes from survival to who Amanda is going to choose to hook up with. And then when her husband climbs into a mini-sub and drops into the shuttle at the bottom of the ocean - all plausibility is completely gone! It's hard to describe how horrible this movie becomes. When you stop caring if the characters live or die and want them to just shut up about their stupid relationship, there's really no point in watching any more. I, like others reviewing this film, want my two hours back. I will never understand how such totally inept, weak movies get made. Who pays for them? And why? And doesn't anybody ever look at what they are doing and realize there's absolutely NOTHING of value getting onto the screen?
