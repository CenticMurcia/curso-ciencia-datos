This is the story of a man who works as an enforcer within a building company but who also harbours the desire to resurrect his piano playing.<br /><br />Yes it sounds ridiculous but the lead actor does his best to play a modern James dean type role where you do care about whether he will recover his piano ability.<br /><br />There are nice cameos from this business partner's wife as well as his piano teacher.<br /><br />A couple of the scenes don't quite run as smoothly as most of the film but you definitely follow the path of this moody wanna-be musician trying to live the "2 lives" that he does.<br /><br />Worth watching if you like good dramas. There is an element of romance here but you can determine whether you think it was worth it...<br /><br />best
