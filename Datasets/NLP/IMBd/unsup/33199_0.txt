I saw this about a month ago because it came on-demand and I was bored. What a mistake! This is one of those movies that gets you angry just watching,everything about this movie is horrible.<br /><br />There is one major flaw in this movie that made me go crazy during the whole thing: A couple of friends are headed to a rock concert and they run out of gas. Of course, they are in the middle of nowhere and no gas station is near. Why would they wait till they got to the concert to get gas when none of them have ever been in that part of the state? It would take the same amount of time to get gas in their home town! The second most hilarious thing: Something goes wrong with all 5 of their cell phones, I think most didn't have service and the others phones died or something. That is the most unlikely thing possible.<br /><br />The third most ridiculous thing: Two girls are being chased by a killer the whole night, a man in a truck eventually drives down the road, he picks them up. He has blood all over his shoes and the girls flip out and try to jump out of the tuck. The man says "oh I work in a butcher shop down the street". The girls without any argument completely believe him 100% and continue to stay in the truck.<br /><br />Well you probably get the idea of this trash movie. There are many other flaws and mistakes throughout this flick. I advise to NOT watch this, don't even look at the cover in the video store. THIS IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME.
