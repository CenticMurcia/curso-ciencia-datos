I will begin by saying that the only reason I watched this movie is because I like Zac Efron and was curious to see his other work. Considering the film hasn't received much attention outside of the Zac Efron fanbase, I had my reservations about how the film might turn out. Unfortunately, I wasn't mistaken.<br /><br />'The Derby Stallion' has a very straightforward, some might even say clich√©, storyline: a boy befriends an older-mentor archytype (think an old, black Yoda) and needs to learn how to ride steeplechase in order to compete against his rival and win the big derby at the climax of the film.<br /><br />The film starts out with 15 year old Patrick in conflict with his dad who wants him to become a star baseball player. Instead, Patrick spends his time hanging out with the local town drunk, Bill Cobbs' Houston Jones, who regales him with tales of being a steeple chase rider. Naturally his parents disaprove of their friendship but this changes when Patrick takes an interest in riding and wants to compete in the big derby. Everything is going great until Houston passes away and Patrick, consumed by grief and lacking in confidence, decides to quit riding. At the last minute, he changes his mind and everything is set right. The film ends with a shot of Patrick leaving his trophy at Houston's grave, his family at his side.<br /><br />The film is typically corny, rife with a very predictable storyline and the usual conflicts/resolutions that one might find in most family films. However, the ending of the film is so hasty and anti-climactic that I couldn't but help feel like it was done in a very half-assed way. Also, as many others have pointed out, the fact that the Patrick character becomes so skilled in such a short period of time defies logic and the so-called 'relationship' between horse and jockey is seems shaky at best.<br /><br />The one bright spot is Bill Cobbs who does a fairly decent job portraying the relationship of Houston's 'Yoda' to Patrick's 'Luke' (yes, there's even a line in the film that is essentially paraphrases "Do, or do not. There is no try."). Other than that the film is forgettable. I'm sure there will be enough interest generated by Zac Efron's celebrity to get the film seen, but any serious rider, as others have previously posted, will find the premise and execution weak.<br /><br />Edited for typo.
