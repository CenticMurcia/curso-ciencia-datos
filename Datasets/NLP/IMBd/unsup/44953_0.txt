The writing is horrible - even for a campy teen movie, it plain sucked. The acting was very bad, the direction was bad. I feel bad for the cast who probably worked for peanuts, to be portrayed in such a crappy film. I'm glad I was able to see it for free. Don't waste your $3 to rent, OR buy this - wait till it comes on Spike TV at 3am, that way you can sleep through most of it. Diane and Taylor have the only bright spot in the movie as a goofy couple, but it's not enough to carry this film. Frankly the only thing remotely worth seeing is the beach and scenery of Costa Rica. I give it a 1 simply out of pity, and because a negative option wasn't available.
