I didn't know quite what to expect about this film, but when i saw it on television i was hooked from the beginning. While i'm not a huge fan of beauty contests, i thought that it was a really well done film. As a teacher, it really made me think about what the purpose of beauty contests are in this day and age... and after having seen the film and the girls involved, i believe that is nothing more than just a beauty pageant. The judges in the film kept talking about how the contest was "Beauty with a purpose", but i never got that was truly what the event was about. I think that we should see it the way that it really is "A Beauty Contest". I really enjoyed the drama of the film and the ending. As a big fan of documentary films, I thought the approach to this film was very fresh and it was exceptionally well done.
