This movie is terrible. It is a toe-squirming example of the pointless sludge Hollywood is so keen on  there is no message, no edge, no beauty in it. It's not even funny.<br /><br />I don't understand how they insist on blowing perfectly good money away on a terrible sugary film like this one. This story could have been pretty good in the hands of the right people, but here it's told just so smoothly and dishonest. I hate these kinds of movies that play with your emotions, actually succeeding in making you well up, but leaving you feeling hollow and sick.<br /><br />One of the major lows is the girl that plays the main character: she is just obnoxious overacting (is she on speed?), showing no real emotion (the way she was standing there with her face covered in snot and tears without wiping it off  I felt like slapping her in the face, I actually shouted at the screen. And then there was that terrible dog and the way she talked to it  I want to shoot it dead), awful! You don't for one moment believe that she even loves her boyfriend.<br /><br />The rest of the cast was actually rather good (did I detect hints of fear in some eyes sometimes?), especially the girl with the freckles, though Holly Hunter was fairly annoying.<br /><br />To each his own I suppose, but i cannot see the value of this vehicle.
