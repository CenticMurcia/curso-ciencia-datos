I love non-sequitur humor. There's nothing like watching Peter Griffin pop off, "Like that one time..." or watching Cartman say something stupid again. Robot Chicken has some of the best non-sequitur humor I've ever watched or heard, only Family Guy ranks higher in the non-sequitur humor. There's really no plot in Robot Chicken. Seth Green (Austin Powers Trilogy, Family Guy) voices many of Robot Chicken characters (along with a bunch of cameo appearances by celebrities) in random skits. For example in one scene you see a snail riding a turtle exclaiming, "WEEEEEE!". The next scene could be something as random. You really never know hat to expect while watching this show. Robot Chicken is a great show to watch when you just want to kick back and watch something on TV without having to think that much about the plot. Five stars!
