For the technicals, I am sure they could'nt have done better for 1895, but this is quite pathetic... I can easily see the camera moving a little when the actor is replaced. I expected something horrorish but it was'nt at all! The 'video' does also not really appeal to the reality happening. I would not expect a woman to be so easy during the beheading scene, since it would be that she would fight for her life and struggle or at least cry during the process. None of this is to see. You also see the head moving when the actor gets replaced by the dummy of which you can then easily see the fakeness. This was like an experiment of trying to make an early ghost picture.
