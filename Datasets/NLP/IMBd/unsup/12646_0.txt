A film that splits people in to two groups indeed. first of all lets look at the bad reviews, well to begin with there are no ghost moose's. The tension and horror in this film does not look to supernatural or alien things to scare us. Their might be a hint of that but when it comes down to it its about our imaginations, our superstitions and beliefs that trigger our responses to situations. The exorcist had a massive audience compared to this but it was all made up hokum and mostly hysterically funny. At least "The Last Winter" tried to take in to account cause and effect from a scientific point of view. it may not do it very well at times but the film has consistency. Apparently most Americans don't even believe that global warming is happening let alone that humans are contributing to it so its not surprising some of the films messages are dismissed. A gas that causes hallucinations and paranoia? We have made them so I'm sure nature can. If you are not a gore fest carnage freak then this is a film for you
