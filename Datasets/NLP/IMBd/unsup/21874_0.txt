This is a documentary of the nationwide tour by Michael Moore to resurrect a failing Democratic election campaign. The intention of the tour was to get the people who normally don't (the "slackers") to get out and vote This is an entertaining and at times fascinating documentary, but whether you will enjoy it will entirely depend on whether you like Michael Moore.<br /><br />The documentary takes place not just during the final phase of the election, but when American emotions over the Iraq war were in flux. This documentary puts you in the middle of that emotion.<br /><br />Michael Moore said in the introducing this movie at the Toronto International Film Festival that he usually tries not to just preach to the converted, but with this movie he openly admits he did. So this is a documentary that has a one-dimensional viewpoint: Democrats are for free speech and care about the poor and Republications are religious fanatics. It is frightening to see in this documentary Americans, in supposedly the country that invented individual freedom, being perfectly happy to not allow or to even actively prevent any beliefs other than their own. And there is tremendous value exposing those people and Moore does it by simply letting them talk, which of course is what they would not allow him. However, the possibility that there are Democrats who may also be intolerant isn't considered here.<br /><br />I think this documentary also shows, unintentionally, why they ultimately failed. It ends by stating that their tour succeeded with young voters, but older voters went with Bush. Anti- Bush sentiment was largely due to the Iraq war and not other social issues. Rosanne Barr's rant at the end of the documentary might appeal to some, but it would have completely alienated older and middle-America.<br /><br />As with all Moore documentaries it's utterly watchable.
