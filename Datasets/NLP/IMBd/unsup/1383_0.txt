Elaborate, star-studded movie about a jewel thief (Joan Crawford) falling in love with a man she's supposed to rob...or something like that.<br /><br />This is a horrible movie--just one of the worst I've ever seen. It is beautiful to look at, has a great cast and they all give great performances (especially Crawford--she's gorgeous and letter perfect in her role). <br /><br />Then why do I hate this so much? The dialogue and plot. The plot is as old as the hills and the script is chock-full of totally unbelievable dialogue that no human being would ever utter. Virtually every other line was so bewildering that I could not get into the characters or the story. Also the film is very static--it feels very much like a stage play filmed. And it's very, very slow and dull<br /><br />Maybe I shouldn't judge the film--as it is I tried to watch it twice and fell asleep both times! I made it through an hour and then dozed off. I think the stupid dialogue kept me awake for that long.<br /><br />This film was unavailable (for some reason) from the 1960s to the early 1980s. Unfortunately it's now out there. Do yourself a favor--if you're a Crawford fan (like I am) don't see this. It's really terrible.
