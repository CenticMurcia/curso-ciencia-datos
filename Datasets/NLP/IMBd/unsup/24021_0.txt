.... But that`s probably because I was expecting the worst movie ever made . This remake of the classic Brit thriller is far from being the worst movie ever made but it is rather substandard . Director Stephen Kay seems to have been influenced by MTV and this shows up in his directing , a funeral scenes is accompanied by a Moby song , a punch up is accompanied by Rush Holme With Love by Mint Royale ( A track that seems to be to film soundtracks this decade what Voodoo Chile was to film soundtracks the last decade ) while the final sequence closes with a track from Grove Armada . I do confess I do like MTV but if you don`t you`ll hate this directing style .<br /><br />There`s two aspects to the script that I disliked . One is the dialogue that tries to be super cool with lines like " Hold on there slick , all of a sudden you`re the f***in` good guy " and " We`ll take it to another level " which sounds false and unconvincing . The other is changes made to the original 1971 movie . I won`t spoil it for you but nearly everything from bleak original has been changed to a completely inferior story . If you liked the way everything worked in the original you`ll dislike the way everything plays out here <br /><br />The cast are very uneven and strangely for a thriller it`s the female cast members that give the best performances especially Rachael Leigh Cook and Miranda Richardson . It goes without saying Sly fails as a violent anti hero while Alan Cumming is very annoying and camp . Mickey Rourke spends the entire movie posing , John McGinley seems to be on speed while Michael Caine makes little impression .<br /><br />This remake isn`t as bad as some people have made out though it`s not nearly as good as the original . I give it four out of ten
