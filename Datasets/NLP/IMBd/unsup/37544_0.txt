There is only one word to say about this movie and that is boring. The plot: A marine biologist heads for Port Amanzi in Africa after his friend, Mark DeSantis, is supposedly a victim of a fatal shark attack. DeSantis had been conducting research on a series of shark attacks in the area prior to his death and now his friend, along with DeSantis' sister, takes up the research and finds that the sharks may not be the only threat in Port Amanzi. 3 Things you should never do.<br /><br />1)Buy this movie. 2)Watch this movie. 3)Don't watch it again just to review it.<br /><br />The worst think about this movie was that the shark was real underwater and every time come above sea level it was fake, i don't even get me started on the fake blood!. There is one good thing i can say about this movie is the acting from small part of cast is Okay.
