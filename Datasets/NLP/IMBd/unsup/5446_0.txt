OK I have seen all the horror movies ever made so on that basis, this exorcism is better than expected. I admit I did not like Emily Rose much so I watched this one with a preconception that it was just another boring Exorcist movie as I found all the sequels were pretty lame compared to the original. I was pleasantly surprised. The casting was great because the main actress does a good job acting and her eye shadow gives her a scary look. 2005 was a great year for horror movies and while this one would not be as good as Skeleton Key and story not as good as Death Tunnel, it sure starts 2006 on a good note. I enjoyed this one much more than the Fog 2005 because I fast forwarded through most of that one and that one is successful only because it is a remake and it had popular actors/actresses. Gail bowers on the other hand features unknown actors and actresses which made it much more fresh and enjoyable.
