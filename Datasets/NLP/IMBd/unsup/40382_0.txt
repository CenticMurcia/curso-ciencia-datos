And to think that I've always felt sorry for some of the trash Boris Karloff was reduced to appearing in late in his career. But this thing that John Carradine made late in his career makes Karloff's Snake People look like Citizen Kane. It's embarrassing. Carradine is some sort of Shakespeare spouting vampire who uses a trio of vampire babes to help him lure his victims. It's supposed to be some sort of horror/comedy, but it's neither scary nor funny. The obviously plastic-toothed vampires in Vampire Hookers couldn't scare a three year old. And unless your idea of humor involves an overweight vampire who has a problem with gas, you won't find anything to laugh at. Oh, I suppose there are moments that are so bad they're almost funny, but the intentional attempts at comedy are utterly ridiculous. I'm being more than generous by giving this one an extra point on its rating for these moments of unintentional humor.
