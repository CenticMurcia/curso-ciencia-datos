I really wanted to like this film. But the bad acting, horrible script and horrific directing made me hate it. And LONG! It's bad enough when a movie "seems"to drag on because it's so bad. Well, this movie is worse as it is BAD and clocks in atjust under 2 hours. This film makes "The Titanic" seem like a short. This could have been such a great little film too. But it is just too tedious and too poorly executed to qualify for even a movie to fall asleep to. "Attack of the killer tomatoes" seems like an oscar winner compared to this stinker. If you want to see a great gay themed movie, skip this trash and go rent "Edge of seventeen" or "Trick." I am not kidding, this film is alful.
