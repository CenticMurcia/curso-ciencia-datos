I was positively surprised by the film. First of all that was Rebecca DeMornay?! She looked really familiar but I didn't recognize her.<br /><br />Great story and with enough twists to keep me guessing. I really enjoyed it.<br /><br />The movie managed to creep me out just in the right kind of way. Especially near the end when Cusack's character is figuring out what the connection is with the driving licences.<br /><br />Jake Busey as Robert Maine was good, although a small role. He freaked me out in Contact and he managed to freak me out in this one as well.<br /><br />The movie wasted Clea DuVall's talent though with that small role.<br /><br />Pruitt Taylor Vince, I LOVE that guy. He will forever be the freaky dude from the X-Files episode Unruhe.<br /><br />John Cusack did a solid performance as did Ray Liotta. Amanda Peet was also good in her role.<br /><br />Identity is an enjoyable thriller and totally worth the rent.
