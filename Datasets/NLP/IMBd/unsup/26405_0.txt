LIVING DOLL doesn't live up to some of the other necrophilia-themed horror films in terms of sleaziness or "graphicness", but I personally found it enjoyable, despite it's flaws. It's no NEKROMANTIK or anything - but I got a kick out of it...<br /><br />Howard is mildly obsessed with Christine, the girl who runs the flower stand in the hospital that they both work at. Christine already has a boyfriend and hardly knows that Howard exists. When she dies following a car accident - Howard decides now is the perfect time to get to "know" her a little better...<br /><br />LIVING DOLL is not a very graphic film, though there are a few gore scenes, and the decaying corpse make-up FX are top-notch. This film reminded me more of a Frank Henenlotter type of film, but with a more "serious" tone. I think that watching Howards sanity decay at the same rate as his new "girlfriends" corpse, is an interesting thing to behold. My only gripes with the film is that there's no even slightly-graphic necro-action, as the story is more centered around their (or I should say, Howards PERCEIVED) "relationship" - not the sexual aspects of it. That was a let-down as I feel that any proper necro-film should have a good "shock" sequence in it. The other thing that I found somewhat distracting, is that this is a British film that did some very short filming in New York - and is obviously supposed to be set in the States, but the actors are obviously Brits and have a hard time deciding what accent to use. Not a huge problem - just a minor annoyance. Personally, I recommend this one, but I don't think everyone will dig it as much as I did. I think it's going to be considered too "un-graphic" and tame for those that are expecting some hardcore necro-sickness...8/10
