Yor, Hunter From the Future easily falls into the "it's so bad it's good" category. I have never laughed so hard in my life at a film. No comedy has every produced the side-splitting, tear inducing laughter that Yor has. It's too bad this film was not intended as a comedy, but rather as a science fiction/ fantasy epic.<br /><br />This movie just screams cheese. It features a story riddled with plot holes (caveman on a quest to find himself runs into a superior race of beings that want to kill him... but don't explain why); randomly occuring events (random laser fire demolishing cavemen villages); criminally bad dialogue; an 80's cheese rock score; horrendous special effects (lasers firing out of weapons at obviously wrong angles); and possibly one of the most ineffective movie villains of all time: THE OVERLORD.<br /><br />It's so bad it has to be seen to be believed.
