9 years have passed since the original "Children of the Corn" appeared in theaters, but it looks as if this movie had been done the same year. That can't be good.<br /><br />Only a very low budget could explain why the movie looks as it does, nevertheless, as people like Robert Rodriguez and Sam Raimi have proved, a low budget is not an excuse for a bad film.<br /><br />The plot is as follows: After the events in Gatlin described in the first "Children of the Corn", the surviving kids are adopted by the people of the nearest town, Hemmingford. Meanwhile, a failed journalist and his son arrive to Hemmingford. They will find that the Gatlin events are about to continue as another boy is possessed by He Who Walks Behind the Rows.<br /><br />The first movie was not as bad as most people think, it was actually enjoyable, but this movie does not keep the elements that made the first one a fine movie. Gone are the eerie score and the creepy atmosphere of the first one.<br /><br />The acting is bad most of the times, and even when the acting in the first one was no Oscar-worthy, John Franklin's Isaac is in many ways superior to Ryan Bollsman's Micah as the leader of the cult.<br /><br />A forgettable sequel that looks like it was done to the TV, it has a few good moments, but it falls down. Specially when compared to the first one.<br /><br />4/10
