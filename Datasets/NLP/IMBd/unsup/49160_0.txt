I can't believe anyone can spend one penny to produce this... thing. This... thing has good things: some nice visual (and some means maybe two) and some (maybe three or four) witty lines. And the witty lines are abused going further... Things that are missing: the script (unlikely, offbalance), the characters (superficial, two-dimensioned), the direction (an ethilist baboon could do better).<br /><br />Incredibly, you start being bored after just ten minutes, as the first of many endless dialogues flows quietly.<br /><br />Shortly, I strongly recommend that you carefully avoid this movie. It is not worth the price, and it is not worth for free, because it is deadly boring.
