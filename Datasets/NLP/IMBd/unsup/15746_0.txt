When I think of Blood Dolls, I become saddened to think that someone had to star in this movie and will forever have it on his/her resume. My best friend, sister, and I were looking for a good movie to watch. When we read the description of Blood Dolls, we simply knew we had to watch it. One of our favorite things is watching the worst movies and making fun of them for the rest of our lives. Other favorites include "IT", and our mega-favorite "Nightmare on the 13th Floor". While watching Blood Dolls we muted the dialogue and spoke our own during the marriage scene, and videotaped it. I have never laughed so hard. So, only watch this movie if you want to laugh like you've never laughed before! Don't watch it expecting to be fulfilled afterwards.
