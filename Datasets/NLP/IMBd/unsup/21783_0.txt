This is such a DAMN GOOD MOVIE. <br /><br />It's this bright, expansive, random, happy, sad, funny, stupid, and wise trip that these 3 brothers take, and I'm not here to give you the play by play. Watch the thing, and you'll see how it's not something that adds up to the sum of its what-not. It's just Not One of Those kinds of movies. <br /><br />Instead, it's one of those that has to be seen to be believed, and is worlds-better experienced than recounted. It's a Trip. Through the spaces between people, as well as within India.<br /><br />And Yes, it has much in common with the rest of director Wes Anderson's stuff, visually and thematically and tonally, in the best ways, if you ask me. I think he was really hittin' his stuff on all cylinders in this one. <br /><br />Just So Much that's implied rather than stated. So Much in the way that people and relationships can be both lamented And celebrated. He just brings So Much to the screen, but always leaves that space that demands the audience step up and meet him on the platform, with our own individual "baggage" we've brought along. It's Great.<br /><br />And maybe it was the way it was shot and cut and directed and acted, all very subtly, vividly, kinetically...<br /><br />Maybe it was the way the characters felt really REAL, fascinating and absurd and pathetic and majestic, all at the same time.<br /><br />Maybe it was because India is so bright and beautiful and exotic, to the tourist's and movie-goer's eyes.<br /><br />Maybe it was just random enough and specifically-rendered enough to really hit me RIGHT THERE, but IT DID.<br /><br />I enjoyed this more than any movie I've seen in a long time. <br /><br />Real Art made with Real Heart.<br /><br />So Sad and Funny and Just Damn Beautiful.
