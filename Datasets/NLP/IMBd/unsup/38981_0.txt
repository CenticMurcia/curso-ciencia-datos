You saw DNA and you think it is the worst movie on Earth? Believe it or not, The Being is worse than DNA! I don't know if this one's a joke but I know that it was very funny...when it was supposed to be scary. Actors are so bad, the scenario is so stupid and what about the special effects( if you can call this special effects!!!). I give it 0 out of*****.
