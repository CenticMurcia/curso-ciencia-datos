I have no disrespect to any believers, but I was moved into watching this movie as it appeared to be historically relevant, however, as the movie progressed history turned into religion, and the message was more about god than the actual Chinese historical plot. It was a real let-down in this sense; showing deception through disbelieving and the mischief it could cause in ones life.<br /><br />There is some relevance to the events that took place, although I can also say there is a bias to towards an anti-communist ideal. If you're looking for an informative movie about the revolutionary dealings that took place in China, this surely is not what you're looking for. It is true that brutal things took place, and baring in mind the fact that I am not writing here as a socialist, it carried typical anti-communist western values.<br /><br />The caption of the movie claims "courage" to be the main element, where as I would change that to "faith". <br /><br />In my opinion, I'd say this film is over-rated.
