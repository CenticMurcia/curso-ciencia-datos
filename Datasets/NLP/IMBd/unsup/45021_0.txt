The film was started post HAHK(even the title was HUM AAPKE HAI SANAM that time) and it took 8 years to complete<br /><br />When the promo was shown i was shocked considering SRK and Salman haven't shared screenspace since KARAN ARJUN and suddenly a film with them and Madz comes <br /><br />The movie is regressive, outdated and could be better in 90's<br /><br />The back story of Madz- Salman is so cringeworthy even there is too much sermonising<br /><br />But there is one plus point and that is SRK in this film, well normally he overdoes his scenes here he is in full control and plays his role with a straight face and brings a lot of fun in the movie<br /><br />Sadly the film never manages to sustain the tempo and we have tripe like GALE MEIN LAAL TIE.etc<br /><br />Also it's funny to see the appearances of actors Salman suddenly in 1 scene looks straight out of JUDWAA days with his medium sized hair and with his overacting but lively acting and then he comes to 2001 days where he looks dead The dubbing too is inconsistent and also his acting which goes from amateurish and then to dead acting SRK too suddenly has short hair, long hair and also his looks keep changing and so his dubbing and acting Madz too, in 1 scene she has brown hair and then the ponytailed black hair look<br /><br />The film also has the late Laxmikant Berde who wasn't much seen in 2002 Also we see Atul Agnihotri who was rejected post 1998 i feel and was just seen as an extra <br /><br />Direction by KS Abdiyamaan is outdated though good in parts Music is okay, most songs sound old Cinematography is inconsistent<br /><br />Acting SRK though looks inconsistent yet he delivers a wonderful performance and rarely hams which is a relief Madz is as usual, she does a good job but her role is too regressive Salman khan is inconsistent, at times lively and at times dead below average overall Laxmikant Berde is okay Alok Nath is okay in a small role Atul Agnihotri is a reject and he annoys
