At least that is the strong impression I got from the episode I just saw.<br /><br />The episode begins with two men being chased through the forest, with Black "natives" chasing them. The heroes blow the away what turns out are BLACK CANNIBALS. What an age-old and horribly racist stereotype. You would think by the 21st century we'd be past such brazen bigotry. <br /><br />At one point one of the main characters complains [in the midst of cavalierly blowing away Black cannibal one after the other], "This place is INFESTED with 'em!" as though they were cockroachs, or vermin of some sort.<br /><br />It seems not much has changed in "entertainment". Movies before the 50's were packed with such stigmatizing, defaming, and historically inaccurate depictions of Black people. And "The Lost World" seems to be keeping that racist legacy alive.
