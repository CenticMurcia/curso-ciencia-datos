I have heard about this show for a while and one day, I decided to watch some episodes of My Super Sweet 16. It's a pretty interesting concept for a reality show. I am turning 16 in four weeks and it's intriguing what types of parties these rich girls/boys have. Speaking of gender, why are there episodes about a guy having have a Sweet 16 or whatever? Last time I've checked, none of my brothers had ever had a 'Sweet 16' or whatever the hell these boys have. They just had a family party and cake. I consider myself pretty lucky that my parents can afford to throw me a Sweet 16 party. I don't care if it doesn't have celebrities or if I don't get a car, as long as I have a decent party. The only thing that bugs me about this shows, is that these kids are so bratty and ungrateful for the things they've got. I cannot even believe that there are people out there who are like this. Okay, fine, I'm lazy as hell at home and I ask my parents for money and I don't have a job yet. However, I appreciate a lot of things my parents do for me and I happen to get good grades in school. My least favorite episode is with the two Indian girls. The younger one needed a huge slap on the face...taking away an invite for 'touching a divine human being? Please.<br /><br />But otherwise, it's an pretty entertaining show and I can't wait to see Exiled.
