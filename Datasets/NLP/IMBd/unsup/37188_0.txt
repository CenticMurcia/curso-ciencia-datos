As one of the people who had already read the books, and loved them, I was enthusiastic about going to see this film. I had been quite pleased with The Lord of the Rings trilogy, and think the Harry Potter adaptations were fairly good. To my utter disgust the movie started with a young boy with an MP3 player. I was ready to walk out then but decided to stick with it. Then came a long drawn out boring introduction to various family members I can not even be bothered to remember. When things started to happen the special effects were fine, but the whole way through I kept wondering if Susan Cooper was dead to allow this to happen to her book.<br /><br />I am sorry but if people think that unless a film is set in the current day people won't be interested in it then we are letting ourselves sadly down. The setting for the book held half of the mystery as did the time when it occurred. Is anyone really going to believe that a missing twin brother is going to suddenly appear and no one is going to question it.<br /><br />If this was an attempt to enter the market the Potter and Narnia series have created then it is very poorly done. Unfortunately it sets the scene and tone for the rest of the books and if they try to set them correctly people are going to get confused. I doubt I will be going to see any of the others.<br /><br />Cnarla
