In 'Baseball Bugs' we see Bugs Bunny playing baseball. He alone is one team and he is playing a team called the Gashouse Gorillas. It is a little too much of the same at the beginning but the very funny second part makes up for that. The Looney Tunes short are almost always funny and this one didn't disappoint me.
