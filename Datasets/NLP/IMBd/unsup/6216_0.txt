This unpretentious movie offers some joys,I watched it because I wanted to see Mrs. Mirren and Mrs. Julie Walters,as I think they are gorgeous. It is a piece of exploitation.<br /><br />Its acknowledged premise is that this is an earthly naturalistic comedy, unashamed and unassuming. Beyond this, the reality of the movie is quite different.<br /><br />Is it morbid, perverted? Of course it is, though it strives not to be. It pretends to be a joyful naturalistic movie, but it bets on the very unhealthy joys it offers to its fans (or is it too much to believe this comedy has fans?). It is indecent and deliberately perverted. On the other hand,it is wholly indifferent as cinema, the directing is banal.
