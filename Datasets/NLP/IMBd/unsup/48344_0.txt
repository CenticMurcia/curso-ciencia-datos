DEADTIME STORIES was released a few years after the release of George A. Romero's CREEPSHOW. However, Deadtime isn't anywhere close to the caliber of quality that CREEPSHOW is. This movie is comprised of three stories, all of which totally suck. The first story deals with witches, as they perform stupid experiments. The second story is based on a guy that gets his pharmaceutical prescription screwed up with another patent's. This causes him to change into a werewolf. Finally, the third and final story is a black comedy that has the viewer forced to follow the path of three escaped mental patients who shard a country house with a character by the name of Goldi Lox. The bottom line is that all of these stories suck. It's a shame a producer thought that this project would be a success. I wonder what he was smoking?? The movie has a cool box cover, but that is all. AWFUL.
