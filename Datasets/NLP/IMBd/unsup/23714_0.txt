I'm a big Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing fan. I love to see them together in the same movie. However, this one happens to suck out loud. An island gets big heat. A married writer (Patrick Allen) has an affair with his young secretary in a totally pointless subplot. Lee goes around there with his trademark villainous face. He happens to be a good guy, but Lee acts his part as if he was playing Dracula or something like that (as opposite to e.g. 'The Devil Rides Out', a truly great movie, also by Terence Fisher, where Lee plays a good guy the way a good guy must be played. So he CAN do it). The cause of the big heat happens to be an alien invasion of giant fried eggs.<br /><br />Cushing is very little in the movie, crashing his car while in his way to defeat the aliens, and dying. Fortunate he is, as he won't see what seems to be the stupidest alien species ever: My dear extra-terrestrial fellows, if you want to invade the Earth but water destroys you, don't choose an island in England where it frequently rains. I'd suggest Sahara for you... but that way the movie would never end.
