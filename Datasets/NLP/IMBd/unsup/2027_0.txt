No matter what some may say and no matter the voting is not favorable, I think it is a great production - it has action, new technology, a sensitive story line about love between sisters and between an assassin woman and a man that almost changed her life. It has an unexpected situation turn that makes it very original. But almost everything about this film is quite original. I love this movie and I believe it is one of the best that the Hong Kong movie makers did. It is a good choice for every moment, if you have the chance to see it, don't hesitate! If you are not crazy about Asian movies, at least watch it for the special effects and the lovely girls in it. :)
