I won't go into a lengthy synopsis as have so many before me but yes, it's an old 1940s Universal vampire movie with someone other than Lugosi as the antagonist. I haven't made up my mind whether I prefer Chaney Jr. or Carradine as Dracula (literally the lesser of two evils) but the saving grace of this movie is that it has one of the best plot twists I have ever seen in this genre. I watch it again and again just for that. Forget the fact that Dracula's coffin must be airtight to keep the swamp water out but permeable enough to let him, in mist form, seep out. Go get some popcorn when that part comes on, but don't miss the last fifteen minutes.
