This movie was (unfortunately) mired in a scandal in that it was completely scripted. There were no genuine scenes. Anyone who would dare challenge this known fact needs to view the piece and note that several of the scenes involve as many as 5 to 7 camera angles. There are several other points that scream a totally fabricated piece of work. It should have been reclassified as a work of fiction or standard movie fare since it is no legitimate documentary. <br /><br />Though the movie was well intentioned and the people in it are truly genuine the crew who filmed it broke every convention of true documentary film making. This is a sad fact since it was nominated for an award at the time it was released but failed to receive that award when the truth came out.
