This is a classic with Carole Lombard. In one of the previous comments, it was mentioned that the color was off a bit and the DVD was blamed. Although the DVD transfer may be awful too, I think this movie may have been made in the original 2 strip Technicolor process (since it was in 1937) which always has a blue tinge to it. It was probably not the vivid and beautiful 3 strip process which I think first appeared in 1939 with Gone With The Wind and The Wizard Of Oz (at least for major studio releases).<br /><br />Can anyone confirm this?<br /><br />The movie has a wonderful performance from Lombard which I find her second best, the best being her performance in My Man Godfrey. the supporting cast is excellent with the exception of March, who I always found to be a "hammy" actor. That style of acting was pretty normal back then - and widely accepted as "correct".
