Dreamkeeper shocked me with wonder when I saw it on regular ABC TV a few years ago... many moons ago... how time has flown. I caught only a part of it. I just finally requested it at local video / DVD shop and they have it. I viewed it entirely tonight on DVD. I am so thrilled with Dreamkeeper that I shared in with a project that I am member of --- The Mankind Project New Mexico. I love Native American culture and philosophy. DREAMKEEPER has really done the job of giving the Native American USA message. Dreamkeeper is extremely different and powerful. I may buy copies to give as gifts. How wonderful that Red brothers and sisters have shared this vision with us. How great that an international group of artists have given me this wonderful gift of joy and power.<br /><br />I love that Native Americans have commented on the film and were depicted in such a wonderful manner.
