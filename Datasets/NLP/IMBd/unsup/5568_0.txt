This is an awesome show. The idea of a soul being sold to the devil and then being forced to do the devils dirty deeds has been seen before but not like this.<br /><br />3 things makes this show great.<br /><br />1. Acting. This is a great bunch of actors, giving the show a feel of character. Bret Harrison is doing a great job of holding this show on his shoulders while Tyler Labine and Rick Gonzalez deliver an amazing comedic backup duo. Ray Wise is real convincing as the Devil always trying to convince Sam that what he is doing is a good thing whilst showing the audience that you should never forget that he is actually the Devil and the cruelest thing existing.<br /><br />2. the Writers. I simply love the script in this show. They always find a way to make an everyday unpleasantness to something everyone can enjoy.<br /><br />3. Special effects. The special effects in this show is actually only above average and yet you are never disappointed in what you see.<br /><br />I can only recommend this great show. And i hope everyone who likes a little dry humor will give it a shot.
