I didn't like this movie at all! I mean...it was so UNREAL. As if you would sneak to a concert, see the rock star you love, save his life, your dad and him become best friends, he turns up at a party and returns your a necklace and then you and him get together and become best mates. !. Its like a fairy tale. It's a waste of money - I recommend you watch it or ACTH the trailer before you buy it. The plot was really uninteresting and its meant to be a comedy. I didn't laugh once. I love drama, and Lindsay Lohan is one of my favourite actresses but this movie was really bad. I don't know if it was the director, writer or producer - it's just dull. When you hear the title 'Confessions of a Teengae Drama Queen' you think it must be good as the title sounds really cool. BUT. It was more about Stu and the concert then drama! So it should of been a different title. People say that the book was better. You can read a bit of the book on Amazon. And I agree. A pretty dull movie...
