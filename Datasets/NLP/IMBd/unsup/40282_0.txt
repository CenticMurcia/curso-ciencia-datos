I cannot believe all I'm reading about this movie comes from people who claim it was beautiful and well-done. It was well done, all right, if you ignored the tedious lines, the "absurd theater" construction and the utter lack of imagination which rendered the situations as completely uninspired and made you go "ahhh come on..." I will not even waste my time on explaining all the reasons I thought this movie was purely awful, I just want to know how anybody can think it was beautiful, clever or touching... And I would also like to know how a movie which is as "real" as Liz's life is considered authentic and worth watching. Everything in there is completely unauthentic, situations are poorly constructed, the love story is a sick twisted tale which escapes the rules of common reasonable sense, and that does not make the movie great. When a movie surprises you it just becomes unpredictable and that effect can be easily obtained once you completely turn a situation upside down, this does not mean that if you are taken by surprise you should bow to the imagination of the writer.<br /><br />God, this was one of the worst ever. EVER
