Due to being a fan of the first Scream and having liked James Tobacks Black and White.I was keen on seeing how this film would be with both of them working together,and though it tries to be a smarter Indicent Proposal (a film that is referenced a lot during the movie)is just ends up becoming very boring and painfully slow. The plot:<br /><br />With her family having just brought her a very up-market New York apartment,Vera wants to start a new,by living the high-life.But sadly she is having trouble reaching that level due to her low down "small hustler" boyfriend.Though when her boyfriend says the he wants her to spend some time "entertaining" a big media mogul,who will pay her what ever she wants (but only when it is just him and her alone),and with this Vera starts to plan away the she can con the media guy and her boyfriend in a very big way.<br /><br />View on the film:<br /><br />For the first twenty minutes writer/director Toback gives the film a bit of a similar feel to Richard Linkletters great first film Slacker.With the characters meeting up in very loose over-lapping scenes.Disappointingly after this,the camera for some dumb reason is kept about half a mile away from anyone in the rest of the film,and whilst this could have worked for a few part of the film to give it an "intimate" look.but due to it being constantly used,all the passion and intimacy in the interview in naked scenes is completely lost.And for all of the apartment scenes Toback has a very loud piano playing the same three or four notes,for the whole of the film,which gives the impression that there is a ghost badly playing a piano in the apartment!!. Final view on the film:<br /><br />A enjoyable start,the is ruined by extremely bad directing.
