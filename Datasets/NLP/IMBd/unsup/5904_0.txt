In Chicago, the special collections librarian Henry DeTamble (Eric Bana) has a genetic anomaly that allows him to travel in time; however, he is not able to control the moment or the destiny of his voyages. When the stranger Clare Abshire (Rachel McAdams) meets him in the library, she invites him to have dinner with her in his favorite restaurant Beau Thai where she confesses that she has been in love with him since she was six years old. Henry leans that he had visited her many times in the real state of her parents and he falls in love with her. Sooner they get married, but the life of Clare becomes troubled with the successive unexpected travels of her beloved husband. <br /><br />"The Time Traveler's Wife" is a delightful love story with an original romance of a time traveler that wins the heart of his wife when she was six years old and he was older. Therefore he does not know her in the present time. The chemistry between Eric Bana and Rachel McAdams is wonderful and makes their love absolutely believable. However, the girl Brooklynn Proulx steals the movie with a marvelous performance. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Te Amarei Para Sempre" ("I Will Love You Forever")
