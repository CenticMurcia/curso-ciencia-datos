I thought that this was a very fun film with interesting characters involved in an interesting plot. <br /><br />"The Brothers Bloom" reminded me a lot of a Wes Anderson movie. Wes Anderson is one of my favorite directors, so I did enjoy the fact that this movie struck me as one of his. <br /><br />The movie not only showed good character development, but also had an interesting plot. It kept the audience with the action the whole way through. The cons also added to the interest of the plot. We were never really sure if what was happening was fact or if it was yet another con.<br /><br />I liked the setting of this movie being in Europe as well. It seemed like this movie could work being set there a lot better than if it had been set in the United States. <br /><br />This is a fun movie and one that I would really like to see again.
