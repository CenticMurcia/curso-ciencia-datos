This movie begins on a weak premise and has a predictable plot with dumb characters. Every aspect seems to be pulled from other films, which is a cheap way to make a movie. This is the kind of movie where time and again you find yourself asking "now where have I seen that before?" <br /><br />A few of the predictable story elements are as follows. A female member from the much larger cannibal pack infiltrates a young, buff group of survivors hold-up in an abandoned hospital as a wolf in sheep's clothing --- but no character even suspects this. As members start to disappear/be killed, the infiltrator is questioned and found to be with-holding information. But, since the group needs a leader (they're all too dumb to think for themselves) they elect this liar to basically set them up for the kill. The one guy who is smart enough to leave/escape, stupidly returns to rescue a girl who then doesn't want to leave until she can save the rest; the guy stupidly follows and gets killed while saving her sorry back yet again. None of the survivors bother to pick-up a weapon and defend themselves until half of them are already dead. Since it takes place in a hospital/lab setting, someone gets splashed in the face with acid, and some chemicals are used to poison people. For the final battle scene, the girl whose back was saved way too many times stops to put on war paint like in the movie 'Braveheart', and then single-handedly goes off to kill the cannibals as they are cooking her friends body parts over an open fire. Just when you think it's over, you see that there is one cannibal still alive which implies the real horror of a sequel.
