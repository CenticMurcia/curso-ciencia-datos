I really wanted to like this movie. And just to preempt what the critics may say about this review...I am a woman. but i'm not your typical "ew blood!" woman. I write copious horror and gore and my favorite movies are Glory, Night of the Living Dead and Gettysburg. That being said, it isn't really the 'violence' in this movie i object to so much. unless i object to the fact that there isn't really enough violence. No. it's the extent to which this movie is so god awful boring that in the first five minutes i already wanted to shout "LET ME OUT" in the middle of the theater. And for everyone who says, "You don't get it! This is an allegory for modern American society!" I say two things...<br /><br />1. If it is an allegory for modern American society then I'm moving.<br /><br />2. It isn't. Because people don't act like this. Hell, as devoid of culture as America is, it isn't this bad. Not at all. And there was no cohesive story line or moral or even style. The last 30 minutes of the film feel like they were made by a different director.<br /><br />In short, I can't think of a single thing about this movie that I like from the cinematography and the script all the way down to the makeup and the incongruent little details that make the story entirely unbelievable.<br /><br />Honestly. Watch the ice. It's cheaper, more interesting and it takes less time.
