This movie is the best movie ever made. If I were to rate this movie... with 1 being not so extreme, and 10 being extremely extreme I would definitely give this movie a 10.<br /><br />The only other thing I can think of off the top of my head that is actually better than this extremely original story-driven movie is Armen and Bullik (quite possibly the best TV show ever).<br /><br />I mean seriously there is no movie better than this one. It has everything you could possibly ask for in a movie. Drama, Action, Suspense, Supreme Martial Arts tactics... I mean everything!<br /><br />This movie is a must see!
