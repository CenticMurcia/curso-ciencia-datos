I read the director said he made this movie because he wanted to restore Jim Dougherty's place in history. Of course, if his first wife hadn't become you-know-who, he wouldn't even be a blip on the radar.<br /><br />All of her biographers have noted that Monroe was furious when Dougherty told Photoplay in 1953 that she was so in love with him, she threatened to jump off the Santa Monica Pier if he left her. Little wonder how she'd react to his claims that he created "Marilyn Monroe;" that she was forced to divorce him; and, even when she was the biggest star in the world, she yearned to return to him. How do I put this? Hogwash! Not only is there no evidence they stayed in contact, according to the 8/6/62 New York Times, when her "dedicated friend for life" was informed of her death, he merely said "I'm sorry," and didn't attend her funeral.<br /><br />He also makes another claim: that he created S.W.A.T. It was, in fact, LAPD Officer John Nelson who presented the S.W.A.T. concept to then-Inspector Darryl Gates.<br /><br />One of the posters said the film tells the truth; the only "truth" is the pack of lies Dougherty has been peddling for over 50 years in interviews, books, and now this movie. The director should have taken his cue from Norma Jeane herself, and kicked "Jimmie" to the curb like the loser he is!
