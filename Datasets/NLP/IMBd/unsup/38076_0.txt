They should have watch supernatural first that bloody marry was fantastic<br /><br />it was just Horrible, The movie didn't make it sense at all<br /><br />The plot: On Homecoming night, Samantha (Mara), Gina (McCormick), and Mindy (Rulin) are having a slumber party at Sam's house due to being black-listed by the sexy football players. Since the dance and game are out of the question, the trio stays up and entertains themselves with Urban Legends..all leading up to BLOODY MARY. With nothing better to do and a whole night to waste, Sam chants "Bloody Mary." Her friends laugh... "Bloody Mary." More laughter. On the third and final "Bloody Mary," the friends are kidnapped by three jocks and return soon thereafter, shaken but well. Sam begins having hallucinations and soon bodies turn up - is it all a high school prank taken to grisly extremes or is it Bloody Mary, who's youth was taken far too early?<br /><br />Worst think about this is that they don't even use a mirror REALLY Then marry pop up anyway not scary not creepy.<br /><br />This is the only one good part in the movie - That part is when spiders come out girl face was really good it is bit over the top scene but the Rest of the movie is garbage 3/10 just for that scene
