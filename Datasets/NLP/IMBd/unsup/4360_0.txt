I know, "it's only a movie," but it's a movie that takes totally unfair aim at my city, the greatest city in the world, where anyone with half a brain can see the city isn't at fault for any of the couple's problems.<br /><br />George and Gwen Kellerman, two hicks from Ohio, are flying in so George can accept a job at an interview the next morning. The plane can't land, so off to Boston they go. It is on the plane where we first start to see George as a total moron - he's not too bright, blames everything and everyone else for his own problems, and whines all the time like a child. His wife pretty much just obeys his commands.<br /><br />In Boston, they tell him his luggage is missing, and he flips out. He has to get to NYC, so he finally manages to catch a packed train. Simply renting a car to drive to NYC never seems to cross his mind.<br /><br />In NYC there's a transit strike. A NYC transit strike makes worldwide news. Doesn't he read the paper in Ohio? He gets to his NYC hotel six or seven hours late, and his room is gone, because as his reservation CLEARLY stated, after ten o'clock if they don't hear from you, the room is then open to anyone. Despite that George was too stupid to call the hotel and keep the room for he and his wife, he flips out on them.<br /><br />At the hotel desk, he gets a call from the airport in Boston, his luggage was found and can be at his hotel in the morning. Great news! However, not for George. He yells at the guy and then HANGS UP!! And with nowhere to go at 2:30am, despite George's stupidity of not calling ahead, the hotel kindly offers him a room FREE OF CHARGE at 7am when others leave. He REFUSES THE ROOM!! THE MORON REFUSES THE ROOM!!! So who's fault is it they get mugged, sleep in central park, mug a dog for crackerjacks, get kidnapped by thieves, etc? Who's fault is it that he gets caught in a limo with attacking protesters, a chipped tooth, no bath, no food, no money, etc? New York City's fault? No! GEORGE'S FAULT! HE'S A MORON!! He even makes a big speech on the corner of W. 65th Street how NYC won't beat him. Hey stupid!! YOU are the reason you are in trouble, NOT New York City! And the ending, his wife makes a big speech about how bad NYC is, and that they should go back to Ohio. Hey, GO!! Don't let the door hit you on the way out! His wife is a total dim bulb, and with a husband as moronic as he is, they wouldn't have a chance.<br /><br />There are a few laughs in the film, but really, NYC isn't the culprit here. It's a total fool of a husband who is completely clueless (I know I've said it, but he REFUSES THE ROOM!!) and the dim bulb of a wife who obeys his commands. Forget NYC looking bad - if all couples in Ohio are this idiotic, Ohio must have an average IQ of about three.
