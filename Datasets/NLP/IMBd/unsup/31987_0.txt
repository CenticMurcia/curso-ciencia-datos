There movie is the epitome of awful. Even with the obvious plot devices this movie is one you should not spend money on. Do not go to see it, do not rent it, do not add it to your Netflix. Marisa Tomei is wonderful as always and Kyle is gorgeous. You should not have to go on the internet to understand a movie. Definitely skip it. This movie is not worth the price of gas to go see it. It actually is not worth the price of the movie channels to see this movie. People who say they can figure this movie out on their own are lying. Or they simply do not want to agree with those of us who appreciate good movies. The only good things about this movie are Marisa Tomei and Kyle.
