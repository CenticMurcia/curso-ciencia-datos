Would love to see them release the show to a DVD set!!!!! I was told I actually had my name pulled from Bimbo's pocket and announced on television. I would love to relive those times when I was young and show my nephews and nieces what we use to watch as children. Plus us older adults would love a good laugh. I think they should release the show to a DVD set, look at all the other shows that are being released. I'm sure other people that had their names pulled from the hat would appreciate the chance to hear/see that happen again. Uncle Bobby was an awesome show and I watched it daily when I was young! I can't get the Bimbo the Birthday Clown song out of my head.
