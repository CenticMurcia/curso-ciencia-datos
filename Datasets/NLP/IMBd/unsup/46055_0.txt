There is something even more embarassing to environmentalists than "Captain Planet", Carol Browner or Bruce Babbitt. It is...Godzilla vs Hedora.<br /><br />A movie about the terrors of pollution, it starts out like most any other Gojira movie, except that a James Bond film suddenly breaks out during the credit sequence. A Japanese woman starts singing something. Heck, it could be "Goldfinger" for all I know; it was in Japanese, so I couldn't tell. All that was missing were the flipping nude girls.<br /><br />Anyhow, the movie stars a boy named Ken whose father is a scientist. Now, aside from the fact that every Japanese boy born in the 1960s must've been named Ken, we are forced to watch said boy parade around in air-tight shorts WITH SUSPENDERS!!! It's enough to give a non-alocoholic the DT shakes. Ken plays with Godzilla dolls, sending them down the sliding board for kicks, as well as helping his dad combat the smog monster.<br /><br />Hedora, besides being an absolutely lame monster, gives Gojira his best fight. Of course, Hedora gets his strength by taking bong hits from the local factory's smokestacks. Hedora is also a shape-shifter, which helps him fly through the air with the clumsiest of ease. In response, Gojira discovers that he too can fly (perhaps after listening to that Seal song), which allows them to take their battles all over Japan.<br /><br />Overall, there were a lot of things done differently in this movie, but not many of the risks paid off in the entertainment bottom line. Next time, Toho can feel free to leave out the cartoon sequences, bad jazz music, and little boys in tight shorts.<br /><br />Sterno says Gojira tai Hedora is an EPA Superfund cleanup site.<br /><br />
