I'm not a Mormon now, nor ever have been but I sat down to watch this video out of curiosity. The run time isn't too bad at just under an hour but it is obviously a biased production. Supposedly, all the experts on the video whom they cite for evidence for their case are, of course, Mormon scholars (which I doubt). There is not even the smallest hint of another opinion other than that the producers are trying to make. Now I'm not Mormon so I don't think I'm knowledgeable enough about the BoM to make a good argument either way, but I've got to believe that there is/was an entire other side to this argument that wasn't given a second of airtime.<br /><br />THe intro was good filling in and explaining some of the background of the Mormon movement and BoM history but the evidence for the whole DNA thing wasn't there, IMHO. Just feels like an hour of Mormon bashing...<br /><br />Avoid this if you can.
