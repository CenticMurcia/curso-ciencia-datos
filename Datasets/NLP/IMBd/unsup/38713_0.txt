I thought that this was quite a good take on the dickens classic apart some of the acting. Julie Walters as always amazing bUT some of the main characters were terrible espessialy oliver played by sam smith the casting was bad if he was the best child for the job he was awful he can not act to save his life i hope never to see him on screen or stage again but he was quite amusing he was so bad but apart from him it was good
