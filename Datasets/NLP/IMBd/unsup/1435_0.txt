Actually I watched it when I was very young with my Mom and it scared me! I never forgot it and I was hoping someone here would know where I could get a DVD copy of it for my Mom's birthday in March! Anybody? I would really appreciate it! I have looked and looked to no avail. Please let me know as soon as possible~ Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! I know my Mom will love it! Thanks! I am sure there is someone out there who has this DVD! Just sitting on a shelf somewhere! I just wanted to ask this one question but it says I cant post it at all till I make ten whole lines of text so please pardon the rambling lol! Thank you~
