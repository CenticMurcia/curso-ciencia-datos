I am a very big fan of the physical sweating comedian Lee Evans. Every time I see one of his live shows I know it is going to have new mad, wild and ingeniously written and performed comedy from the excellent stand up. This "Live at Scotland" show is another great example of Lee Evans excellent physical jokes and hilarious bad language genius. He always does good jokes that are not only funny, but also true to life, e.g. restaurants, airports and planes, food, television, etc. The highlights of the show for me were me were the "Lee Evans Trio", and the song at the end called "Suicide", one of my favourite of his songs. Lee Evans was number 23 on 100 Greatest Stand-Ups, and he was number 14 on Britain's Favourite Comedian. Outstanding!
