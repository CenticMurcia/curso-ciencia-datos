First off let me start out by saying that I am not a huge Martin Lawrence fan. Big Momma's House 1 and 2 were pretty good for some dumb comedy movies (me owning the first one and liking it)but, National Security with Martin and Steve Zahn was passable. OK, now on to Rebound. Hot Head Basketball coach Roy McCormic (Lawrence) gets fired and loses his fame and decides to win the press and basketball league back by coaching a small middle school team called The Mt. Vernon Smelters. So he meets the kids, Keith, best player, One Love, loves shoes, hair and ego, Goggles, best spirit, always hit in the face, Ralph, two older brothers, lots of experience, and Fuzzy, the junk food addict (no offense). So bit by bit he starts to teach them to win and later they add two more players, Wes, the shy tall guy who Roy calls "The Sledgehammer", and Big Mac, the school bully who is not afraid of a fight. They get better and better and slowly make their way to victory. Some of the side joke adult characters such as the principal of the school (Meagan Mullaly of TV's "Will and Grace") and an over enthusiastic competitive coach (Patrick Warburton of (Kronk's New Groove). Overall I thought this movie was good and entertaining. It teaches a lesson to not be self centered. It was very sad in my opinion that the girl who played Big Mac died from a gunshot and was rumored to be in a gang. She would have become a "SuperSta". All and all very entertaining.<br /><br />2 out of 4 stars
