This is a very good Indy film, and I give it a 7 out of 10 stars. I had seen it previewed on the Independent Film Channel a couple of years ago and found the video recently. However, there is something a bit 'off' with it: It seems to take place in the 1970's and there is some hint about the "Bicentenniel Room"....which makes you think its circa 1976......but instead, it's modern day L.A.. It just happens to be about a has-been 60's/'70's actress, who refuses to see that she's over the hill! (Poss. Spoilers?) The 'odd' thing about this film is: The actors are males in drag as females, and each one are hilarious in the roles they play. This is no 'Priscilla, Queen of the Desert', with Patrick Swayze & Wesley Snipes acting all swishy, these are men who honestly look & sound like real women - and they are playing "straight women", as in, you have to go into this believeing they are real women and forget they're really men underneath the wigs & dresses, okay? Once you get past that (if it doesn't distract you too much), you will laugh your head off, seriously! Very funny, with great "drama Queen" moments, temper tantrums and bitch-slaps! All the emotions are covered: anger, jealousy, vanity, you name it! Really, it's a fantastic situational comedy, well worth seeing by anyone, if they go into it with an open mind! I never would have known about it if it weren't for the IFC. I showed it to some friends and I swear they did not realize they weren't females, until about 5-minutes into it! They just wondered what was up! "Hey, that's a guy!"<br /><br />It is a bit 'odd', but it's also a great, raunchy, adult Indy film! (IFC produced it, I believe.) If you can find it used, buy it!<br /><br />That alone is enough to show it to everyone you know!! I give this one 7 *'s out of 10! *******
