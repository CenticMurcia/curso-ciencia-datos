Cute fifteen-year-old Zac Efron (as Patrick McCardle) doesn't have friends his own age. He skips baseball practice to spend time with boozing horse enthusiast mentor Bill Cobbs (as Houston Jones). In flashbacks, Mr. Cobbs recounts his love for a wealthy white woman, and a passion for horses; his doomed romance led Cobbs to alcoholism. Parents William R. Moses and Tonja Walker (as Jim and Linda) don't like Mr. Efron's close relationship with the older man; especially, Mr. Moses wants his son to play baseball like his dad. Efron doesn't know much, but "I know horses like me." He decides to join the horse races, with Cobbs as trainer.<br /><br />Be advised, there is heartbreak ahead for Efron! <br /><br />Efron is less affected (and made-up) than in "High School Musical" performances, which is a plus. He passes for a mature fifteen, but doesn't show much prowess as an actor. The prerequisite bully and pretty girl roles are adequately filled by coolly-coiffed Michael Nardelli (as Randy Adams) and lightly-tressed Crystal Hunt (as Jill Overton). Cobbs adroitly makes the most of his predictable character role. And, ailing musician Billy Preston has one of his last gigs. "The Derby Stallion" gallops with missteps and continuity problems, obviously enhanced by budget restrictions. Filmmakers found a great semi-circular tree for a background shot.<br /><br />*** The Derby Stallion (7/4/05) Craig Clyde ~ Zac Efron, Bill Cobbs, Crystal Hunt, William R. Moses
