Story of a spoiled rich kid who begins to sell Ritalin and advice to the student body of his new high school. In doing so he begins to find himself and his life.<br /><br />What you think of the film will depend on what you think of Anton Yelchin as Bartlett. To some he's a charming rogue, to me he comes off as an insufferable twit in the same way that Frank Albertson could be annoying in the B movies of the 1930's and 40's. I found him abrasive and had an impossible time getting through the film. To be certain the film is witty but with out a central character you care about all the clever lines in the world will fall flat, which was what happened here. In all honesty give me Juno any day.
