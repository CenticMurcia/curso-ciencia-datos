CHIM CHIM the Video Monkey (akachimchim@yahoo.com) says "That Dave Francis, writer/director, really knows his zombie stuff." Man, who are you trying to kid here ?!?! This was by far the worst zombie movie I have ever seen !! And I hate the fact that the creators of this movie pretend to be someone else and get on here and give this movie 10 stars. I don't even know if I wanna give this poor excuse of a film any stars at all.<br /><br />Okay, first of all: The acting, GOD AWFUL. Who the hell casted these nobodies, Helen Keller ?!?! The location was crap too. The movie is supposed to take place in a post-war ravaged world, right ? Gee, never would've guessed it what with the cars passing by in the background on a freeway.<br /><br />I am not gonna blame the budget whatsoever on why this movie was crap. Hell, George Romero made a movie with less, and look how great he is. And that's another thing, the script sucks because all it did was rip off Romero.<br /><br />And another thing that's kinda lame is the fact that the zombies only come out at night. I will admit, it's something a little new with the zombie genre, but the fact is that it makes the zombies less threatening, so that sucks !<br /><br />Okay, and get this, the bad guy, Derek, he keeps screwing people over and he even kills a girl, and the "leader" of the group, Dave, lets him go. Okay, if i were Dave, I would've shot him in both kneecaps and let those zombies eat them. AND WHERE THE HELL DID ALL OF THE OTHER CHARACTERS COME FROM ?!?!?!?! God, I wish Dave Francis would just give up on film-making, but no ! He's making a sequel. He better get it right this time.<br /><br />So I understand that someone died during post-production, now I'm sorry for this loss, but seriously, don't use that as an excuse to pass off this movie as a good B-Movie. This was an F-Movie, all the way ! 1/10 ... though it deserves a -10000 / 10 !
