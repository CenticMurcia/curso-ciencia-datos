Dreary sequel, despite resetting the narrative to the tale's original location of New Orleans (with flashbacks to the Candyman's grisly fate). This time around, the heroine discovers she's related to the Candyman rather than being a re-incarnation of his white lover; that said, Kelly Rowan is no substitute for Viriginia Madsen! In fact, apart from Tony Todd's titular character (who's even less scary here but, at least, he's intelligible), Michael Culkin's ill-fated professor is the only link to the first film.<br /><br />Other than the requisite gore (and Philip Glass score), again, we have a subplot involving a black child who lives in fear of the Candyman; additionally, however, we get a bit of irrelevant sleaze (this being conveniently set during Mardi Gras)! The presence of veterans Veronica Cartwright and Matt Clark is welcome; predictably, though, they both end up as meat for the Candyman's hook.<br /><br />While director Condon may have started in horror (this is the only one I've watched, actually), he really came into his own when he branched out into other genres Â– and, quite frankly, I wouldn't have bothered watching this hadn't he been involved...
