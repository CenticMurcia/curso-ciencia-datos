All i can say that i cannot find a single mistake in the movie, The Movie Direction, Shot Composition, Cinematography, Music, Acting all were Absolutely Perfect<br /><br />John Abraham's Acting was really Flawless, as for Priyanka's Role, As far as i can say A Very Hard Hitting Challenging role it was indeed it was by far her Best Performance, <br /><br />Direction was like WOW!!! Sanjay Gupta, Truly did his best!! Cinematography: Oh My God i was AWED by that The Composition Was PERFECT!! Music: The Music was Great, Vishal Shekhar Showed Their Techniques as Master Musicians, The Song Tinka Tinka, Has a Soft Groovy Effect to it, The Song Tera hi Karam, Was Brilliant!!!<br /><br />When i watched the film MY EYES were Hooked From Start to End<br /><br />You Will Find it Very Brilliantly Directed Even though I'm writing about this 2 years later but it is Definitely Worth Buying<br /><br />Go and Grab a Copy of the DVD out on EROS
