i really liked this spoof of Sherlock Holmes,starring Don Knotts and Tim Conway.Knotts is Inpector Winship and Conway is Dr.Tart.Winship is a variation of the Holmes character,but dumber.tart is a variation of Watson,but also dumber.the story is that Winship and Tart are dispatched by Scotland yard to investigate the death of a British aristocrat and his wife.the kicker is,both are American.it's funny seeing two Americans detectives working for Scotland Yard.Winship dresses just like Holmes and Tart dresses just like Watson.both are inept and clueless,and have caused no shortage of chaos and trouble in the states.apparently they are put on the case as punishment or to keep them from trouble,as they are an embarrassment to their superiors.as part of their investigation,they end up at the huge mansion of the aristocrat,questioning the large staff contingent (who are also very quirky),and bumbling from one false clue to the next.from the opening scene slapstick is the order of the day,and there is a lot of it.the characters are so dimwitted and the situations so absurd,it's hard not to laugh out loud frequently.i really had a blast.it's not high art,but it is entertaining. 8/10
