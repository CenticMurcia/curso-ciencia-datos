I love zombie movies. Even bad zombie movies are entertaining. Or, so I thought until I saw this movie. It was horrible. Badly acted, a script that makes little sense, bad editing, and audio that isn't even matched up right. There's not really much else that can go wrong with the movie.<br /><br />The time line of the movie makes little sense, but thats OK because the script is so bad, the characters are so poorly done and the execution of the film is so bad that you'll be screaming for someone to hand you the remote before one more minute of this clich√© ridden, badly written waste of disc space goes by. I threw my DVD away after watching it. <br /><br />Avoid it at all costs.
