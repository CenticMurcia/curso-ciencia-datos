This definitely makes my top 10 plot a man named randy peltzer is looking for a present for his son billy Peltzer just as he seems to have run out of luck he discovers a small Chinese shop and a strange creature known as a Mowgli after a small argument with the shop owner randy finally gets it when the owners grandson gives it to him as well as telling him three rules 1. Don't expose him to sunlight 2. Don't get him wet and finally never feed him after midnight And so Randy takes it home. Billy is 22 and works at a bank (just a little bit of information) Any way Billy as well as his dog who seems to get on rather well with the creature who Billy calls Gizmo Randy tells Billy to remember the three rules. Billy being the typical person that he is breaks all the rules At first gizmo multiples creating 4 more Mowgli who then eat after midnight turning them into Gremlins viscous nasty goblin like creatures With help of his mum Billy succsefully kills off three gremlins except there leader Stripe who escapes to the swimming pool and jumps in all hell brakes loose I'm not really sure why i like this movie probably because of the music and because of the gremlins them selves there cool
