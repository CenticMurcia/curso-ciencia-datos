I saw this movie on an airplane, and I considered walking out halfway through. The one good thing about this movie is that I now know why plane seats are equipped with vomit bags. But seriously folks, this movie was a big disappointment. Skeet Ulrich and Leslie Nielson are certainly not great actors, but they usually satisfy. This film's intentions are undoubtedly good considering the numerous Hollywood-approved family comedy standby techniques, but the quality of the acting, directing, writing, and cinematography is deplorable. In short, do not see this film. Do not purchase this movie as a gift for your kids or for your friends who have kids. Do not even rent it as a joke to laugh about with your buddies. And if, like me, you are subjected to viewing it midair, do yourself a favor and tune the headphones attached to your armrest to one of the radio stations; I recommend the best of Boz Scaggs, which I think is #4.
