Clint Eastwood has created a masterpiece of film. Flags of Our Fathers is poignant and moving; awesome in the literal sense of the word and awe inspiring.<br /><br />At the conclusion of the story, there was a long silence among the audience, then one person began to applaud. It grew into a soft, respectful applause of acknowledgement. A handful rose from their seats and stepped into the aisle, but stood frozen in their tracks as archival photographic images from Iwo Jima flashed on the screen during the credits. Each and every person in the theater was in a state of enrapture. It was a moment I will never forget.<br /><br />The portrayal of Ira Hayes by Adam Beach deserves particular recognition. Hayes is a tragic, tormented figure. Adam Beach carries it off with tender sincerity.<br /><br />Special effects technology has evolved to a new level in the recreation of war. The battle scenes, sometimes gruesome, were realistic.<br /><br />It deserves Oscar nominations across the board.
