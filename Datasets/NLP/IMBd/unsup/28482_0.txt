Stray Dog together with Rashomon are the two films that boosted Kurosawa into international popularity as a great filmmaker.<br /><br />Murakami (Toshiro Mifune) is a young police detective. One day during a crowded bus ride, he realizes that his pistol has been stolen. He soon becomes obsessed with finding the pistol and feels especially guilty after he finds out that it has been used to commit multiple murders. He makes it his duty to track down the thief and along with his partner (Takashi Shimura)they realize that the case is far more complicated than they thought.<br /><br />The plot is extremely well crafted and ranks up there with the best film noir. But the film is uneven at parts and some scenes drag a little too long. The film is well worth your time though, and offers an early glimpse at the amazing technique that dominated Kurosawa's later films.
