It's easy to see why the Beatles has always been such a phenomenon. For a person like me who is born in the late 80s actually, I am do aware how huge the four lads from Liverpool are.<br /><br />As this is about the life of John Lennon, from his early days to the time he was with the Beatles, the TV movie is more focused about him and his life. The time when Beatlemania is everywhere, it was not ignored in the TV movie as well.<br /><br />Given I am only aware of the Beatles' success, so much of what's happening in the TV movie is an eye-opener for someone like me.<br /><br />It's quite an insight.
