Djeez.....<br /><br />This movie is, without a doubt, one of the WORST I have ever seen.<br /><br />After watching "gems" like House V, Hide and go Schriek or Berserker, I thought it could not get any worse, but it did.<br /><br />First (and most important of all) this movie is so S-L-O-W, nothing happens in the first 60-70 minutes, except for a anxious woman hearing sounds, and her husband cheating her with the local grocery ho.<br /><br />And then after a long and sleepy hour, at last some werewolves appear (hello are you still awake, it took me a lot of coffee to achieve that) and then there is some action.<br /><br />This movie is such a utterly waste of time and money, that I wonder what idiot invested money in this atrocious product, that person was not sober, I'm sure.<br /><br />In other words, this movie is a wothless piece of junk, and I'm surprised that it doesn't rank among the 100 worst movies on this site, allthough I cannot believe there are enough crazy people who watched this miss-product.<br /><br />Howling IV sure was a nightmare, in the negative sense of the word, and I warn everyone, do not spend your time or money on this one!
