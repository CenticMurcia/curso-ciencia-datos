This is one of my favorite mystery movies. Not only does "Somewhere in the Night" have a great supporting cast, but John Hodiak's performance as one suffering from amnesia has you with him every step of the way on his search for his true identity, missing money, and the reason he is being pursued by others. This plot has so many twists and turns you will not be bored!<br /><br />Look for an uncanny resemblance between John Hodiak and a very young Martin Landau of "Mission Impossible" fame.<br /><br />I saw this movie four times and rate it SUPERB!
