I saw Derailroaded at the ICA in London and I am thrilled to see it is being released on DVD. This film stuck in my head for days (as well did the song "Merry Go Round"). I was not aware of Wild Man Fischer, or any Outsider Music for that matter before seeing this film. My sister was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1998 and I often watch films with themes of mental illness. This is one of the best films I have ever seen about mental illness and definitely the best documentary about a rock musician I have ever seen. I find that most rock documentaries and "bio-pics" about musicians share the same theme: Talented musician gets hooked on drugs, falls in love, gets off drugs, dies. Many studios feel that if they find someone that closely resembles Ray Charles or Johnny Cash, it is an excuse to make a film. Obviously, these films make money and become popular, but to me they are growing very old. Wild Man Fischer has lived a one-of-a-kind life and has a one-of-a-kind-mind...and Derailroaded is a one-of-a-kind experience. An amazing, heavy, unique rock and roll story, told with passion and sensitivity by the Ubin Twinz. It is often humorous, but not exploitative. This is a BRILLIANT film and now it's one of my new favourites.
