If a 'zero' out of ten could be given, then it should only be reserved for this film only. This is truly the worst film I have ever seen in my entire life. <br /><br />If watching a countless young madams prancing around whimsically on screen, fresh out of acting school (and I mean fresh), then this is your cup of tea. However since no-one likes that, then this film is not suited to anyone. <br /><br />Acting does not occur once in this film by the lead girls, their actions and their mannerisms are portrayed totally unrealistically; for playing the roles 14 year old English school girls they did not act like this in any way at all. The picture house was packed with young girls, ranging from around 8-16 years old and none of the supposed 'funny' parts of the film received any laughter. The film was very hard to like from the start, not being able to relate with the actors' poor portrayal of the school-girl demographic (not because I'm not a school-girl, but because they were such disastrous actresses), the hypocrisy of the storyline itself, and a general dislike for most of the lead characters, meant that I didn't care what happened to them at all. Everyone loves a love-story, a sort of 'princess and the pauper', or in this case, 'maid and the prince'.But when the lead actress, trying to woo this 'prince', lives on a quiet street in a seaside town, in a three story house, with wealthy parents and a scholarship at a grammar school, the story is meaningless. Its actually the princess and the prince. Who cares if little miss moneybags doesn't get her boy, she still has her thousands of pounds, her family and friends and her otherwise amazing life (the boy who, by the way, is referred to as a 'sex-god', and is also 16 years old, two years older than her.) <br /><br />The film confuses its morals, and doesn't know what it's trying to preach to its audience, and as its audience is school girls, this is a little worrying. You should be yourself? Love your friends? Value your family? Enjoy being intimate with older boys?! The climax to this 1h 50m slow motion car-crash is a large birthday party held for the lead girl, and I'm talking large. A sort of 'my super sweet 16' kind of thing, but she's 15. If you already didn't like her character enough, this was the final nail in the coffin. The lead girl didn't travel anywhere throughout the film, she was wealthy and unlike the majority of all 14 year old schoolgirls at the start, and she was wealthy and unlike the majority of all 14 year old schoolgirls at the finish. The film was truly awful, even the film music was poor, arriving suddenly and impromptu, thoroughly curdling the already thick cheese that this film was. <br /><br />You know you're watching a bad film when a cinema room filled with the film's key audience, young girls, is deathly silent throughout what was meant to be some sort of modern girly coming of age comedy, and the only laugh you get is when a Steve Jones makes an almost cameo-like appearance, and turns out to be a homosexual, which for every one who watched the film who was over 16 had already guessed. <br /><br />Â£4.10 was wasted, and so were about 2 hours of my life which I will never get back. The film was so bad it made me angry. This was not entertainment on any level, and should have been a straight to TV movie, straight to Nickleodeon. It was deserving of going straight to VHS. And yes, I am aware VHS tapes aren't made anymore that is why. <br /><br />Avoid this film, and definitely do not confuse/upset your children with it.
