Don't be fooled by anything that you have ever read about this movie, no matter how good someone has said it is. There is NOTHING good about this movie. I won't bother getting into the story, but I will say that the story is horrible, the end makes you say "who gives a crap?", there is barely if any gore at all in it, and this might very well be the worst movie ever put on film.<br /><br />I bought the DVD for $3 (US), and I feel as though I've been ripped off...that alone should give you an idea how bad it is--and it's not the kind of bad horror movie that is so bad it's good. This just goes beyond bad. I could never explain how horrible this movie is.
