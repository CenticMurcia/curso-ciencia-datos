I've been watching this stupid movie for an hour and boy does it suck! Rhames just saved a woman from a fate worse than death and she had a hissy because he called her "baby". That's just an example of one in a long string of stupid moments in this unninspired, unoriginal amateurish junk flick. If it gets better, I'll let you know before posting this comment. Otherwise, just pass on "Sin". (C-)
