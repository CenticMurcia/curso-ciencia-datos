"Peaches" is a naive li'l sexpot who attends her father's wedding, who is getting hitched to another, although somewhat more rou√©e, li'l sexpot. After the wedding Peaches drives off, gets knocked unconscious in a car accident, and consequently raped by two drifters. When she comes to she suffers from retrograde amnesia and can't remember who she is. Her two friendly rapists take her in but stipulate that she has to get a job. Trying to remember who she is she sees a doctor, who turns out to be a freak and gives her an enema to her anguished pleas and some skiffle music. Meanwhile, her father is worried about her but has to attend to his nuptial duties first, and when his maid complains he includes her in the wedding night proceedings. And so on.<br /><br />I saw Pretty Peaches about two months ago and already can't remember a thing about it. I guess this is some kind of "the mind protecting itself"-mechanism because Pretty Peaches is god-awful. For one, call me a square, but I don't find rape and forced enemas sexy. The plot is nonexistent and just rambles on. Desiree Cousteau in the title role is sexy, but she can't act for toffee. Everyone else isn't nearly as comely, but can't act either. It's not funny, it's not sexy, it's not entertaining, it's boring and quite often plain sick and disgusting. Not really what I hope to get out of a porn movie. I mean, BDSM isn't my cup either but at least it's between consenting adults. If you're into enemas and scat, have it your way. But rape and forced enemas are just beyond the pale.<br /><br />This is all the more disappointing as I have seen incomparably better stuff from director Alex de Renzy. I don't usually give the lowest ranking of 1 out of 10 points, but I'll make an exception here because of the rape scene. Let's keep our scud movies clean, folks!
