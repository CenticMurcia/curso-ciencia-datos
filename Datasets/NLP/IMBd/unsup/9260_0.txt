I faithfully watch Keith Olbermann's Countdown on MSNBC. He is articulate, sometimes humorous, and really fair to both sides. I consider this to be the one hour of can't miss TV. If you miss the 8 o'clock hour, it replays again at midnight (on the east coast). He brings on informed guests to review the day's news and often brings out facts that are missed by the quick synopsis given on other shows. Each story is covered in depth rather than spending 10 minutes endlessly debating a few points that other shows do. He and guests discuss the topic with a genuine interest in the facts rather than the spin. If you want news with ALL the facts, and how it may relate to other issues, watch Keith Olbermann and Countdown on MSNBC.
