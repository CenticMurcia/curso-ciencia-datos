From what I remember this was a fairly bad movie... but it had one redeeming feature. The best part was the plastic surgeon's office, which was decorated nicely with autographed photos displaying of each of his female patients (unclad chests only). I find this scene particularly entertaining, because my brother went to college with the son of a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon, and in this doctor's office, almost the exact same thing was on exhibition.... So that was cool. Otherwise, the movie pretty much blows. Don't see it unless you're really desperate to view one scene showcasing several faceless boob jobs
