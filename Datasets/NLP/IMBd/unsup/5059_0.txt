I don't know what it is about Almodovar's movies that is so arresting, so captivating. Maybe it's the colour - his leading ladies always seem to wear red. So many visually stunning scenes, particularly the one where Elena is in bed with Victor. No salacious treatment here, just beautiful classy cinematography. <br /><br />The storyline is good, but it's the camerawork that is so beautiful. Almodovar sees beauty and captures it like no-one else. His use of colour, black, red and yellow... coincidentally, the colours of the Spanish flag - or maybe it's no conincidence.<br /><br />The opening scenes with Penelope Cruz are superb. I've never seen childbirth depicted so realistically. Being used to a diet of English and American movies, it is so refreshing to see movies that are exciting and visually stimulating. Minimal violence, but so much humanity and sensuality. This movie was a joy to watch.
