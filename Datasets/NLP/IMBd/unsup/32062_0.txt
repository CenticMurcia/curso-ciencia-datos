This film is very disturbing. It reminded me of the love and affection and materialistic things that we all want for ourselves. It's a movie about how fame, fortune and a notion of that being rich will make your life better, might end up destroying you.<br /><br />It's been almost 60 years since the films release, and yet today, it remain as relevant as ever, as still the biggest stars in the world, gets destroyed for the exact same reasons as displayed in the film. Britney Spears and Michael Jackson comes to mind. Like Norma in the film, these people are kings. But no amount of money or fame can save them from their own destruction. And that is the tragedy.<br /><br />And yet the world goes on, and we keep dreaming about fame and fortune. Will we ever learn? This film Disturbs me. It's like looking into the state of mind of human beliefs. We all wanna be pop stars and drive around in fancy cars. We do think it will make us more happy. Will it, Norma?<br /><br />VIII/X
