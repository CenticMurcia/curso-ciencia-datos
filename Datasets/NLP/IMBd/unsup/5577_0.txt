Reaper stars Bret Harrison (Grounded for Life) as Sam who works at a Best Buy wannabe store and is afraid he'll be stuck there his whole life. He then finds out the hard way that his parents sold his soul to the devil before was even born. Now the devil wants him to pay up and hunt down demons that escape hell.<br /><br />The result is a show that goofy fun with the cast in top form. Bret Harrison who was the geeky but hilarious b/f in Grounded for Life handles the lead role perfectly. While Missy Peregrym is adorable and hot at the same time as Sam's crush Andi who works with him and is also a good friend. Ray Wise is simply a show stealer as the devil. Tyler Labine is also great fun as Sam's bestfriend, co-woker and sidekick Bert and he gets to show his comedy talents more than he did in abc's Invasion. Rick Gonzalez is also funny as Sam's other co-worker and friend who also helps him catch demons.<br /><br />Don't miss out on this show just because it's on the CW. It's not sappy teen drams show that wants to be Dawson's Creek. It's clever and fun and is an original comedy horror series.
