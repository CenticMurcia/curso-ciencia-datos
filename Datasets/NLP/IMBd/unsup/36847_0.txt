This movie had potential. I love time travel. And the idea of a paradox has infinite possibilities for a script. I actually enjoyed the way the Back to the Future movies dealt with the concept. <br /><br />However, from almost the first few minutes this movie is a bomb! The writing is terrible and the acting is bad. I can't believe the actors actually could keep a straight face while quoting their lines. And the make-up for the robot looked like something from 1969, not 1989. <br /><br />The best part of the movie happens in the first 5 minutes. The plane crash must have used up most of their budget. <br /><br />The only good thing I found was looking at Cheryl Ladd !!
