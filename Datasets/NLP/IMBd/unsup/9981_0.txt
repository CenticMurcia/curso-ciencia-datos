Hey, it's not a time machine, it's a "time transport"! I don't care what they call it, it's still powered by a Comodore 64. I own a watch with more features and memory. Oh well, I still like this movie. It's no masterpiece and it doesn't pretend to be. It's funny(maybe unintentionally). I've seen it with and without Mike and the 'bots and it's fun either way. Nick Miller, played by Matthew Bruch, has little or none of the qualities generally associated with a hero. He's weak. His humor falls flat, and that chin. WOW!! I think it has it's own SSN. He is good at getting beaten down though, which happens in this movie a lot. His love interest is kind of pretty, kind of Julie from the Love Boatesque. <br /><br />I must say that I admire the spirit that an independent film like this shows. A different subject might have been better on a limited budget. However, that being said, I think David Giancola showed some promise here. I hear he was 23 when he made this. I recall my occupation involving the culinary artistry of making and delivering pizzas when I was that age. I guess he has my act beat.<br /><br />I recommend this film. Like I said it won't remind you of Back to the future(unless you see the cleverly placed poster in the movie) but you will laugh at and with it.<br /><br />For Castleton!!!!!!!
