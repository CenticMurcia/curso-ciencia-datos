Just horrible, horrible, horrible.<br /><br />We didn't laugh - not once.<br /><br />Just about every scene is set up to deliver a flat joke.<br /><br />Honestly, we LOVE comedies, but this was neither comedy, or romantic. The plot about the Mum (Meg Ryan) whose son is in the FBI (Colin Hanks - who here acts as though he has a large plank inserted right up him especially in his scenes with Selma Blair) - starts with Meg Ryan losing 200lbs of fugliness suddenly becomes beautiful wealthy vivacious and sexy, much to the son's embarrassment, is just tooo much. When a suspected wanted international art thief (Banderas) falls for her and the son is on the case the so-called fun begins. But it just ain't fun. At all. What ensues is a comedy of errors and misunderstandings that is just plain toe-curling embarrassing.<br /><br />This is one of the weakest comedies it has ever been my immense discomfort to see - nothing shines - and the target audience is what? Women in their 40s? - I suggest anyone would be just plain insulted by the lack of anything construing the most basic brain food here - there ain't one smart line or original scene - it truly is neither comedy or romance.<br /><br />The only positive is that this is totally harmless and won't offend,but it won't entertain either, it really is lobotomy food...<br /><br />This is seriously one of the turkeys of the year and deserves to not only go straight to DVD but straight into the DVD bin...<br /><br />Does no-one's careers (Especially Hanks) any favours ... avoid like the plague...especially if you're fans of any of the actors...this will be, I guarantee, one they want to forget in a hurry.
