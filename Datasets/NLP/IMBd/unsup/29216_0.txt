I really enjoyed this movie. Most Hollywood dance movies are very poorly done, simply because they rarely cast anyone with the requisite training to make the dancing sequences enjoyable, believable, or even worth watching. Ballet is not something you can pick up in 6 months of intense training. Prior to watching the movie, I looked up the lead actress, and was delighted to find she actually has had classic dance training. That became very clear, watching her dance. The movie does have a few nice plot twists, as far as the relationships of the key characters. I also enjoyed the portrayal of Julliard.<br /><br />Excellent movie, if you enjoy dance, and, have danced, or been involved with the world of ballet, or modern dance.
