Five friends (Susan (Ashley Jones), David (Charlie O'Connel), Samantha (the horrible Jennifer Lyons), Erik (Brian Kirkwood) and Joe (Rashaan Nall)) are invited to go to a rave party in a distant location. In the party, Erik starts dealing drugs and David fights with a local, and the group is invited to leave immediately the place. In the way back home, in a lack of attention of David while driving, he hits Fawn (Elena Lyons) on the road. He stops the car and they rescue the girl. Fawn is hurt and tells them that she was escaping from some fanatics for Satan, who wanted to sacrifice her. While going to the hospital, a large van chases their car and throws it out of the road, in a field. The maniacs capture Joe, but the rest of the group escapes. In the morning, they successfully reach a small town, meet the local minister Seth (Patrick Bergin) and the sheriff (Tim Thomerson) and report what happened along the night. Many absurd surprises happen with them in the town. This film is a dreadful teen movie, having a screenplay full of flaws and ridiculous dialogs. The ham `actress' Jennifer Lyons has a terrible tone of voice, her character is ridiculous and her lines are unbelievable. Some parts of the story are reasonable, but in a certain point of the plot, it becomes so unreasonable that even a fan like me of horror movie gets completely disappointed. Things happen without explanation or further consequence. My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): `Sombras do Mal' (`Shadows of Evil')
