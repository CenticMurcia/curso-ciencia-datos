I thought this movie was really good especially considering that there were only about 4 main characters in the entire movie. I really wanted to see this movie because of Bug Hall. Who by the way was totally HOT in this movie. I think he's a really good actor and is totally underrated. The guy who played Eddie did a pretty good job too. In all this movie could have been better, as most movies could, but it's not a bad way to spend 2 hours. Very entertaining.
