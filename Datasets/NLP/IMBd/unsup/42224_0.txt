Vicente Blasco Ibanez's novel "Sangre y arena", first filmed as a silent with Rudolph Valentino in 1922, gets the most prestigious treatment 20th Century-Fox could deliver, complete with Spanish music adornments, gorgeous color photography, and some outdoor locations which could certainly pass for Spain. Young boy growing up without a father dreams of becoming a matador, sneaks out at night to practice in a neighboring bullring; there he meets his future wife (the good girl), whom he throws over post-success for a fickle aristocrat (the bad girl). It's all fairly predictable, with a lackluster, by-the-numbers build-up to the inevitable conclusion. In a lazy case like this, certainly the costumes and local color should suffice--but with such an inert storyline, attention is more focused upon the performances given by Tyrone Power, Linda Darnell, and Rita Hayworth, which are uneven at best. Supporting cast (including the interesting Laird Cregar, playing a sort of bullfighter's critic full of hot air and flattery) is overtly-colorful and animated (particularly during the fight sequences), making Power's protagonist seem even more one-dimensional. *1/2 from ****
