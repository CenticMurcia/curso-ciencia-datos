Yes, it's a real Alan Smithee film, and it's pretty obvious why Stuart Rosenberg did not want to be associated with this dud. Basically an opportunity for pure hearted Young White Americans to pound the bejesus out of filthy Brown Skinned Drug Dealers, this Reaganesque paean to Manifest Destiny is boring and offensive. Avoid at all costs, unless you're a member of Aryan Nation.
