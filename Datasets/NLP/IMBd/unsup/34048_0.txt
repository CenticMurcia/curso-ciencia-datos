TOO MARVELOUS FOR WORDS is the one reason for seeing this very mediocre WB musical. The song is sung many times during the course of the film and used for a somewhat silly finale, where Ruby Keeler and Lee Dixon dance on typewriter keys (a really tacky set). It was obviously a swan song (she'd only make three more musicals in the later thirties) for her career and a typical "B" picture of the period. The plot dealing with mistaken identities and misunderstandings is simplistic and rather dumb. There are three songs (in addition to the classic TOO MARVELOUS FOR WORDS, there's HANDY WITH YOUR FEET and JUST A QUIET EVENING)but only the one is worth mentioning. It inexplicably was Oscar nominated for Choreography (decidedly undeserved) but did not receive a Best Song nomination.<br /><br />Ross Alexander (the lead) appeared in 18 films for Warners but did not click with the public. This would be his last - he took his life the year of its release.<br /><br />Lee Dixon (a gawky, untalented amateur and rather obnoxious) appeared in only eight films and had his sole hit in creating the role of Will Parker in the original Broadway cast of R&H's OKLAHOMA! - a part he played as long as the show ran and toured. He was to die an alcoholic bemoaning the loss of the one part he seemed right for.<br /><br />Louise Fazenda is rather a hoot as Keeler's mentor, Jane Wyman has a bit as a snappy secretary, and Lorenz Hart's brother, Teddy, has a bit as a stage manager. Wini Shaw made 19 films, this was to be her second to last.<br /><br />The film is totally forgettable, both as a film and as a musical, but there are enough "bits" of fun in the above observations of performer personalities to pass the time.
