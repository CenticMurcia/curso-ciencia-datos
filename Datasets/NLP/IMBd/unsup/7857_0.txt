I was really looking forward to see this film, The Haunted Mansion was my favourite Disney-attraction, when I visited Eurodisney a few years ago. But the result is disappointing, especially if you compare it to another movie based on a Disney-attraction (of course I speak of "The Pirates of the Caribbean").<br /><br />The story is uninspired and full of inconsistencies, it´s almost unbearable to watch. The story is just a spin off of Dracula, where the vampire confuses a woman with a lost love. Exactly the same story is here, only that a ghost, his name is Master Gracey, thinks to have found his lover in the wife of an estate agent. To allure her to the mansion, Gracey alleges to sell the house and he wants her to do this for him. But instead of coming alone, she shows up with her husband (Eddie Murphy) and her children. So while he tries to seduce her, his butler (Terence Stamp) is concerned to get rid off the rest of the family. Of course Eddie Murphy will rescue his wife and Master Gracey will be reunited with his love and the bad butler will be punished (although nobody really knows why and by whom).<br /><br />Eddie Murphy is a gifted actor and if he has the chance to show his talent, he can be very funny and moving. Sadly he normally chooses very bad scripts, this is no exception. He grimaces and pours out one-liners all the time, who are supposed to be funny, but are not. It´s just very annoying.<br /><br />Terence Stamp, who gave such great performances in the past, tries to make the best of his character, but due to the weak script he fails completely. I can only pity him.
