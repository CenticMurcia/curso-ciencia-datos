Unintentionally hilarious trash. Dyan Cannon's opening line,"God I feel horny!", Rachel Roberts confessing to a lesbian affair,"It was a hot night and I had a thin blouse and no bra" Gene Hackman's reaction, Cara Williams drunken appearance at the club,"The truth is we're all tramps", Janice Rule's outfit, Lori's funeral, Rule writhing on the floor in drug induced lust,etc... all create hilarity in a seriously intended soaper:replete with subplots and a hospital setting. Some of the dialogue is priceless. All of this is interpolated by prolonged, graphic scenes of surgery. It's "Desperate Housewives" with gore. An interesting and diverse cast adds to the fun, and for intended comic relief, there's Christina Holland(from TV's "The Courtship of Eddie's Father")as a student studying sex, and tape recording her sessions. Dyan Cannon is in good form in her regrettably brief role. And was the song "Costume Ball", sung by Cass Elliot, written specifically for this film? Check this one out, and laugh and scratch your head at the same time. DVD PLEASE!
