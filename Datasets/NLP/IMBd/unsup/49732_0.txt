A troma movie usually promises gross gags, nasty jokes, and toilet humor throughout but this one only came through on the last one. Obviously the producers of this garbage had nothing to work with.<br /><br />No money. <br /><br />Cheap equipment.<br /><br />A total of three locations.<br /><br />No nudity.<br /><br />And no talent whatsoever.<br /><br />Bad acting and bad zombie makeup killed any chances the crew of this movie had of taking a not-so-bad idea and turning it into something entertaining. <br /><br />It wasn't a total failure tho. Compared to the other movie on the disc, this one looks Oscar worthy. If I HAD to pick something about this movie that made it worthwhile I would have to say that the story had potential to be good. <br /><br />Mafia hit men fighting the undead is an original idea, but the director who also starred spent too much time trying to make hisself look cool, but that is hard to do when you can't act. Terrible horrible excuse for a movie. Shame on you Troma for putting this piece of $#!* out on an unsuspecting public.
