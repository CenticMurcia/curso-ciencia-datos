i bought this expecting a modestly done BR clone. what i received was a parody that basically ignored its source material about 15 minutes into the film. the points i alloted it go toward a kind of amusing introduction (the entire forrest gump analogy and whatnot) and a few scenes with interesting CGI backgrounds. here is what kills the film: the characters becoming annoying very quickly, a character is killed off almost immediately (without the viewer even getting to see!), and unlike BR - the bad guys have a legion of soldiers that attack the contestants. so basically, aside from maybe two or so instances, there is no contestant versus contestant bloodshed. if i rented this from a store, i wouldn't have been as disappointed with the results. unfortunately, i paid $13 for the DVD off ebay and was only able to recoup about $4 selling it to a video store. unless you have a pocket full of money that has no other potential purpose, and you're absolutely obsessed with anything REMOTELY related to Battle Royale...i recommend you avoid.
