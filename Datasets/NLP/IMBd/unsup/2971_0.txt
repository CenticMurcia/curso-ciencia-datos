This cooking show is outstanding for a variety of reasons.<br /><br />First and foremost, is Ina Garten. She has such a relaxed speaking voice that you can't not help but feel relaxed. Her entire demeanor is one of a relaxed, good friend. You get the feeling that you're a long time friend of hers & you're simply sitting on a stool in her kitchen & she's talking with you as she prepares her meal.<br /><br />Her recipes of course are always tantalizing and I always get hungry watching her show.<br /><br />Her East Hampton home is classy & elegant without being pretentious.<br /><br />And it's great that she doesn't focus solely on the food but brings in the other elements to fine dining: that being table set-ups, location and of course people! It's fun to see the different locales on her show; whether it's her own back yard, or the beach or a friend's home.<br /><br />Ina Garten is a class act in this world of crass, kitchy-ness!
