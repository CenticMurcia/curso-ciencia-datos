The Off Season...sounds like what the director was thinking before he started this production because this is not something I would want on my professional resume. In two words...it sucked. It had its comedic moments, Who says Poo-Poo these days? and a drunk guy who seemed to flip some lady a bird for the better part of 10 minutes. Was there nothing else to pitch to the production company? Oh wait the production company probably gave them a budget smaller than the amount I got for milk money in grade school. I can't believe this movie lasted close to two hours since I personally didn't believe there was 32 seconds of useful material in this horrid farce of a movie. I just threw up a little in my mouth. Nope here comes the rest of it I gotta go.
