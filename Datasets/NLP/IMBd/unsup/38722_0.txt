This movie was released in 1968. By then, NASA had concrete plans on how they would put a man on the moon and bring them back safely to Earth. The screenplay of this movie completely ignored known facts at that time.<br /><br />1. Instead of using the Apollo space capsule to send the three men to the moon, the movie used a Gemini capsule. 2. The Gemini capsule was actually designed to carry 2 men. However, in this movie, only used one astronaut. I guess to save money, the director decided to only use 1 actor to sit in this Gemini capsule to go to the moon. 3. The Soviets beat the Americans to the moon; however, see how the first Soviet is found dead. Did he know he was going to die which is why he opened his visor to quicken the outcome?<br /><br />Two real great actors were used in this movie, James Caan and Robert Duval. However these two actors were so young during the filming of this movie they were actually unrecognizable. But, this would not explain why only 1 astronaut was used to go. These 2 actors were so new to Hollywood that they could not possibly command a high salary. <br /><br />I could write more but you probably will never see this movie.<br /><br />Chow...
