I channel-flicked onto Forgotten Silver just as it started at about 11:00 one weeknight a long time ago. Although totally exhausted from a day at the salt mines, I still couldn't turn off the TV. The story was compelling and convincing with enough irrelevant detail to give it the ring of truth. I was fascinated as fact after fact fell into place with the unmistakable rightness of truth.<br /><br />It was only the next day, after bemusedly watching a workmate fold over laughing when I related the latest proof that a kiwi had beaten the Wright brothers to it and demanding explanation, that I discovered the whole thing was a complete fabrication. One of the few times since leaving kindergarten I have been completely taken for a ride and the only time I remember enjoying the trip.<br /><br />If you appreciate a prank on the grand scale then you have to see Forgotten Silver or, better yet, see it with an unsuspecting friend.<br /><br />
