I first saw this movie after renting it years ago. I think that it must have been the long version that I saw. - I HATED it! HATED!!! It was like I had a violent reaction to the whole movie. I told people for years how bad of a movie it was. - My chief complaint at the time (& still) is the Mr. Sophistication character. All of the strip club footage is very bad & painful to watch.<br /><br />However, I currently have the short version, which I really like. It is a quiet & interesting movie, although it doesn't spend as much time investigating its characters as other Cassavetes movies. - It certainly isn't the first Cassavetes movie that someone should see, but it is worth watching every once in awhile.
