I first this film on video in my young teenage years. The main reason I remember this film to this very day, even though I have not seen it since today, is that I fell totally in love with Sophie Ward. It was something about her beauty and innocence which I never forgot. I just bought the movie recently and saw it again. The film is classic 80's Spielberg. Even though he did not direct it, the film has his signature all over it. I loved the way London was portrayed, as a gothic and beautiful winter setting. The plot was a bit contrived, with the identity of the evil cult leader becoming increasingly obvious at mid-film. It was heartbreaking to see Elizabeth die, and it would have been a better film if there was more of a focus on her character. Nevertheless, this is a film best seen when you're young. A fairly good film, and something worth keeping as a token of your teenage golden years.
