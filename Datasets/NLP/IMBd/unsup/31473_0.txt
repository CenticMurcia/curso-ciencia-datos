Jodhaa Akbar is a spectacular Indian epic drenched in colors and music.. The legendary Moghul emperor may not have been anything like Hrithik Roshan, but Hrithik is every inch a royal prince, all 6 feet of him. Both he and Ms. Rai look beautiful and do their best with the minimal script. Lovers of historical romance and adventure films should be pleased...if they don't expect accurate history any more than would be present in a King Arthur or Robin Hood tale. Besides the two stunning leads, the film offers the most glorious vision of a bygone era seen on the screen in quite a while. The action, war and dueling scenes are just as outstanding as the static opulent court and palace scenes. The film is visually rich, beautifully photographed and choreographed. Lavish sets and costumes equal and compliment the beauty of the players.
