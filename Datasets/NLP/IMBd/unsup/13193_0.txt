My wife loves horses, so it was inevitable this movie would eventually come home with her from the rental place. She insisted I watch it, and I am glad she did. The story is simple and predictable, but still fun and very entertaining. Kurt Russell does a great job of making horse trainer and father Ben Crane real and believable, and Dakota Fanning is incredible. The kid must have been born in a theater. Add Elizabeth Shue as the mom, Kris Kristofferson as the grand-dad, and David Morse as the bad guy and you have a pretty impressive cast for a family oriented film. If I have a grand-daughter some day, I will get this DVD and watch it again with her.
