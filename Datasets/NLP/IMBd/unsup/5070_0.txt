This was my first Almodovar movie and I was impressed. Not only was the story satisfying- lots of twists and turns, the actor who played Victor was both sexy and vulnerable. The sub-plots of adultery and jealousy work well with the main plot of a man pursuing an impossible love. I liked the frantic pace of the first scene, the humor of his birth and the justice of the ending. Everyone in this ensemble adds something- from the troubled partner to the lovestarved wife. The only drawback is the video version destroys the beauty of the passionate love scene-- see it on big screen if you can.
