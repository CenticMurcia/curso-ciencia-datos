As part of the Dracula series of recent, I think this is a most worthy enter to the series so far. It started with (for those who don't know):<br /><br />Dracula 2000. Dracula 2: Ascension. Dracula 3: Legacy.<br /><br />I don't find either part of the series to be average or even dire. Each has their own good points I suppose but none more so than the sequels that the 2000 movie was responsible for. In fact the only disappointment to the series is that Midnight Syndicate didn't do the score for any of them. These are the guys I would get to do the score of every vampire movie made, now and in the future. As their orchestrated Gothic horror music is quite simply second to none. They are "The Grand Dukes Of Hell" for horror music.<br /><br />The music in this installment of the series was pretty good it suited the atmosphere well, almost as much as Midnight Syndicate would have done.<br /><br />The whole feel to the movie was that of a good one, I mean it makes me feel (at times) like I am watching the Subspecies movies. Which reminds me, the first vampire woman you see in the movie. She was in Subspecies: The Awakening, and also the spin off movie of the Subspecies series "Vampire Journals". Those movies and also this one make you feel like you are stuck in a time warp of sorts, due to them being filmed in Romania. Which to me is the best place to film a vampire movie because of the whole vibe that place gives off. It is all modern and yet it still feels like a 19th/20th century run country (in parts of it anyway).<br /><br />The castle used in this movie was the exact same one used in all of the Subspecies vampire movies. It is used in a lot of other vampire movies too and as far as I know it is used in the up and coming Bloodrayne movie too. Here's hoping it will be even remotely decent (I have my doubts due to who is making it, but I give every movie a chance at least once anyway).<br /><br />Jason London is my favourite character in parts 2 and 3 of this series. Jason Scott Lee did an excellent job as well, Kudos to both actors in their performances. The woman Jason London was looking for in his cross country journey during this movie, and who was a part of the second movie "Elizabeth Blaine" played by actress Diane Neal. I think she is really stunning especially in the red dress we see her in, near the end of the movie. She could bite me anytime when she was in vampire form or not lol.<br /><br />The story for this movie was good, but it wasn't the best of stories I have to admit, but I was more than pleased with the movie as a whole. It kept it's pace I didn't find any moment a dull moment during the whole charade, so no complaints there. I would give the storyline an 8 out of 10.<br /><br />I for one would like to see more movies like this one. I Love the whole vampire apocalypse or even the whole zombie apocalypse thing to be my favourite kind of storyline. This movie wasn't exactly like that, but it wasn't too far from it either.<br /><br />When watching the movie I got the feeling that during the trip across Romania, it was only Jason London and Jason Scott Lee and not so many other humans left, to do battle with "The Dark Ones" like they were the only ones in a ghost town called Romania. It was as if they (the creatures of the night) were multiplying and at an accelerating rate as well all across the country of Romania and no one could stop them.<br /><br />I think this movie keeps the standard of the others in the series, script is OK, excellent atmosphere, gore is pretty good too.<br /><br />Rating for Jason London - 9/10. Rating for Jason Scott Lee - 8.5/10. Rating for Diane Neal - 9.5/10. Rating for the movie as a whole (excellent atmosphere included of course) - 9/10.<br /><br />Well done!.<br /><br />I recommend this to those who liked the two Dracula movies before it. I don't think it will win over any new fans, as the storyline needs to be followed from the first part to truly understand everything that is happening.<br /><br />A good all round vampire movie, well done to those who made it.<br /><br />Well done indeed!.
