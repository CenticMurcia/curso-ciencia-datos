Perhaps in the 70's this movie had some appeal, but I cannot think of any good reason anyone would want to watch it now. With thousands of other rentals available this should be your last choice. I wish I could get the two hours I spent watching this movie back. If you have any respect for quality films, please take my advice and pass this one up.
