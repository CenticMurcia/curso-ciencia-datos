On the whole, this was a pretty good, pretty fun movie. It definitely made me laugh out loud a bunch of times, and I thought the comedy was great. The horror was not really terribly scarey, more funny, which I kind of thought was the point, although I guess some people on this board disagreed. Although I really liked the comedy, there were some scenes that seemed out of place; everything with nicole eggert was just odd and that scene in the ambulance was kind of over the top. Some of the acting was really great. For example, Corey Sevier. And the girl who played Alex was amazing. Some of the acting left a lot to be desired though. Like the girl who played the goth sorority chick, she was just a horrible actress who made me cringe. But you know, it was a movie not made for a lot of money and I think on the whole it did a great job. If you have the chance, you should check it out.
