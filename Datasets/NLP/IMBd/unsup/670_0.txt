The story of Romasanta is interesting because it is based on true historical events. The movie interpretion however doesn't quite capture the excitement of the Wolfman killings.<br /><br />Pacing of the story is poorly synchronized: everything happens way too slow in the first half of the movie. And suddenly all the way from the capture of Romasanta the pace quickens considerably and the movie is over before my curiosity on the Romasanta character is completely satisfied: Who was he? Why did he do these things? This movie doesn't answer or even ask these questions well enough. Quite contrary, just when I became intrigued by Romasanta, he is swept away and the movie ends. To be truthful, I think in the end it gives quite a neutral and rather dull view on Manuel Romasanta. But on defensive side I must say that the cinematography, settings and props look all wonderful.<br /><br />Short summary: Romasanta is magnificently set movie with pure Gothic feeling, but it unfortunately lacks somewhat in the script and pacing. You can watch it once or twice without any serious pain, but the lost possibilities do bother me. If I weren't so curious about the real Romasanta, this movie might have seen even worse in my eyes. This could have been truly great historical werewolf/horror movie. Now it manages to be only barely average.<br /><br />I'm a little bit disappointed in the results considering the raw potential of the plot. Oh well, nice try.
