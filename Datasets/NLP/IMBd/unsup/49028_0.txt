The film is more "wink-wink, nudge-nudge, instead of just plain funny. While it does have it's moments such as several points of "the misbehavers" including the end shot and the suddeness that ends "the man from Hollywood". But the rest seems to fall rather flat with poor production and muddled continuity. (a couple of the four "acts" play out at the same time and while at first glance seeing both sides of a phone call in different segments seems novel, you realize that the timing would not allow Ted the bellhop to be in two places at the same time.) Even the opening of Tarantino's Logo with Tim Roth's "Mr. Orange" unzipping to become "Ted the Bellboy" is funnier than most of the intended jokes. There are a lot of surprise cameos here, but that doesn't make the final product much better than an interesting diversion. Purely for fans of Tarantino and his gang.
