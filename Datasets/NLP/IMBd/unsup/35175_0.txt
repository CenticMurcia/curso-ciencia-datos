I wasn't sure what to expect when I went to see this film. I liked the graphic novel and was interested to see what kind of film would result from it.<br /><br />Considering that the script for this movie was already written in comic book form by Alan Moore all those years ago I would have expected the Wachowski's to retain a lot of his work in their script as the story contains some very well-written parts. However, even parts of Alan Moore's original plot have been poorly re-written by the Wachowskis; for which there seems to be no good reason. The Wachowski's writing is very, very poor in place of it. I cite V's first speech as a striking example.<br /><br />Secondly, Natalie Portman's poor accent skills. I read in an interview that she spent a month with a dialogue coach in order to get it right. Who've it was, she should be asking for her money back. Eventually, after swinging through Australian and South African she manages to settle into an impersonation of Keira Knightly. It really grated on my nerves.<br /><br />I would say that this is one film to avoid if possible, unless you want to spend next bonfire night burning effigies of the Wachowski brothers.
