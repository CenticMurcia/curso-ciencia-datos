This movie is not only a waste money, it took away 60 minutes of what I could have used as extra sleep. I was at my girl's house and popped this in at 10 p.m., knowing that I had work the next day, I waited for the movie to pick up, while trying to hold myself from busting up from the ridiculous acting, poor script, and CGI that was probably generated by the Director's 6th grader son, hoping that in the next few minutes the movie would offer something interesting. But after seeing the Ahmad guy tell his boss that he's finish doing deeds for him and then minutes later he tries to save his life, I just couldn't sit there anymore, I turned the damn thing off before my exhaustion drive me to aggravation and might just break the damn DVD which I didn't want to end up paying for. Avoid this movie at all cost, if you ever did something for 84 minutes that you wished you'll never do again, you should consider that instead of watching this garbage.
