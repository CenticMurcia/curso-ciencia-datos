I hate scary movies, because they Never scary just blood and guts and are easy to guess the ending. BUT this one was unpredictable! The actors were believable and the graphics were good! I even jumped a time or two!I think Gabrielle is to thin in Burn notice which makes her character unbelievable- like she could actually kick in a door with thoughs sticks for legs but she is not so skinny in this movie and helps her character seem real! She is a better actor than I realized because she fits the part she plays in the marsh. And I totally did'nt guess the ending which I usually do within the first few minutes of other scary movies. I will watch this movie again!
