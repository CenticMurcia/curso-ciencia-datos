What starts as an action packed cut-throat jamboree overflowing with absolutely incredible atmosphere quickly becomes a stagy film with too much talking. It's not without it's humorous jabs at both the upper and lower class and although it's rather over the top, Charles Laughton's performance is almost enough to carry the film alone. There are some surprisingly dark moments (both in light and tone) particularly the opening scene and the nighttime exterior shots are simply magical. Strangely lacking in some of the more distinctive camera techniques one would expect from Hitchcock, Jamaica Inn overall is still an enjoyable watch Â– just slow.
