It looks like they took Die Hard and moved it to an ex-soviet republic. It must have taken the writers a day to watch Die HArd and copy down the storyline and then another day to take the transpose the storyline and set it in another country.<br /><br />Instead of fake terrorists robbing the safe, you have a fake coup to rob the treasury; one of the co-workers selling out Bonnie Bedelia here you have an embassy employee making the same deal. etc. Even the hero appearing in an undershirt at the end.<br /><br />The stereotyping of the characters - the taxi driver who had cousins who could do anything was horrible, the villain you could tell by his goatee and the Soviet politician who drinks too much - is worthy of a movie from the cold war era.
