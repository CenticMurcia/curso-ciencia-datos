Cameron, Lucy, Drew: watch this movie over and over again and you'll realize how cool it's and w hat you should've done in Charlie's Angels. Shu Qi,Karen Mok and Vicky Zhao Wei are simply superb. Their acting is refined, the kicks, the punches and the gunshots are choreographed as if they were a ballet. The theme of the dead sister's original undoubtedly, though I'd rather have let Shu live and kick butt (wow those beautiful, deadly legs! :))The elevator scene's spectacular though I think it's quite hard to kick butt like that in such a narrow space. But, after all it's a movie. Another interesting thing about this movie's the lack of strength of their male opponents. But I don't want to add much more; I'd spoil the whole thing for all those of you who haven't seen this movie yet . Sexuality's mild, but these three girls are hotter than Demi, Lucy and Cameron put together(sorry, Drew, you're too ugly) Anyway rent this movie, you'll never regret doing so
