When I first watched Pollio's first feature film, HOW IT ALL WENT DOWN, I was blown away with the story, the style and the execution. I had no idea that the same guy that delivered hardcore grit with his first film would go completely the other way with a glossy and witty SHUT UP AND SHOOT.?? I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and thought it was well done. The ending through me for a big surprise and was not expecting that at all. Joe Cortese does a great job as Spencer Spector and the supporting cast was great. Pollio just skates by as Sonny Westwood and although his character has some fun moments in the film with his singing dancing, Pollio's real acting chops show in his first movie, HOW IT ALL WENT DOWN. Here it just looks like he filled that role himself to save the money he'd have to give another actor as Im sure Pollio had a lot at stake in this movie being the Producer with limited funds too. Overall, fun film and I'd recommend it, but my preference in this guy's movie making style is for sure HOW IT ALL WENT DOWN.
