I live in Bangkok and had an extremely difficult time tracking down this film. Our internet connections are not as forgiving as those in the states to permit large downloads. I ended up ordering it from Amazon.com When it arrived I put it in the DVD player. I expected to hate it, although I needed to see it. I admit that I partake in the night scene from time to time and have gotten to know bargirls for what they are, usually nice girls who like to party. Now the majority is not represented in this film, but they are well represented by the misleading nature of the subject. Contrary to a previous review, a bargirl will do most anything for money. If you don't believe me just do a google search for 'nude Thai bargirl' , I think the modesty is a farce. The girls who truly protect their identity last a season or two in the bars, not the 7 years the subject has been there. While the facts in the narration gets a bit preachy, I found myself falling for the girl in the film. By the end I felt what I believe I was supposed to feel. I can see other people disliking the presentation. I can see people not liking the narration. I can't see anyone not liking the main subject Pla. I think this has been said. I wrote an earlier review for "The Good Woman of Bangkok" and I found Bangkok Girl far less contrived and more up to date. Is it better? In my opinion yes, but you should make up your own mind. It might also be that I have heard stories about Dennis O'Rourke (good woman director) and how he is a bit of a prick. I've asked around about this filmmaker and will have to report back about his authenticity. So far he has made a stealthy exit from the country. No slug trail to follow. This film is definitely not for 'one of the boys' prowling the bars. I find they do not take kindly to strangers trying to meddle with their good time. In closing, its a pretty neat film that won't change the world.
