I think this is a very entertaining show. My wife kids and I look forward to watching it every week. The effects are well made and fancy enough for TV. I'm glad you don't need to be an aerospace engineer or some geek to understand this sci-fi show. The customs are great and the girls are beautiful. It's refreshing to see a woman (Baylin) being a real hero over and over. She is also a great sidekick for flash.<br /><br />The simplicity yet cool storyline of the show is one of its greatest assets. As a former Aerospace Engineering student I am happy to know that this is a show I can share with my non scientist family and we can all enjoy. It's also innocent enough to not be traumatic in children's minds. I could not watch Battlestar Galactica with my 11 and 12 year old children.
