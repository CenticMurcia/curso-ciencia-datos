Due to boredom one night and the encouragement of having watched a string of quite interesting though often unusual Korean films i found myself a fan of Korean entertainment. <br /><br />Until i came across this, Lets start with the plot Basically you have a perhaps bright college student with a potential future, a "Bad boy" in all sense of the word...literally, and a brothel. The young girl unfortunately for her steals some money from a man (Which turns out to be a setup by the main character" and is forced to pay it off, Not by getting a loan from the bank, family, friends like a normal woman, but by prostitution.<br /><br />Hence beginning a "tale of life at the brothel". Basically, the skeleton of the film from here on end is this, She gets raped, over and over, and over, tries to escape the brothel, The "Main Character" catches her, brings her back to the brothel so she can get raped some more by random horny guys, while he watches from the other side of a glass, Why? heres the twist - He's in love with her, and telling her simply wouldn't have done.<br /><br />As the film literally drags on, with the constant pounding of the girls miseries it gets to the point where when he gets into a fight, or gets stabbed, which as it turns out he does, you smile and think to yourself "Finally it ends! he got what he deserved in the end, Go Karma", sadly yet humorously He stands up, and shrugs it off, literally just walking away with no medical assistance what so ever.<br /><br />He's fairytale reality does not end there, he somehow as a crown to all he's crimes, and violent nature ends up getting the girl whose life he inherently destroys throughout the length of the movie to reprocate he's love, and so concluding this "Reality of how life in the directors underworld is like" they walk of into the sunset.<br /><br />From this fiasco of an imitation of life in an "Underworld society" we learn that If you want a woman to love you, fellows flowers and candy simply won't do.<br /><br />I had to watch Daisy, to get the bad taste of this film out of my mind. It's sad to see a film like this get rated higher than a 3.1, for the only truth; If the Male leads character depicted in the movie was in fact was brought before the public in a real life scenario, we'd gather our pitch forks, and throw him to the jury yelling the sweet sounds of life imprisonment. Yet he's portrayed behind the lens of a camera and suddenly,...He's simply misunderstood.
