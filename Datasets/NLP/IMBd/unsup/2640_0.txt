It's hard not to develop an appreciation and affection for meerkats after watching this show. Every episode is either watching a new drama unfold or one that continues to unfold in the never dull life of a mob of meerkats known as the "Whiskers" family. It's easy to get engrossed in the comings and goings, challenges, and drama in the meerkat family. Pluses include getting acquainted with other wildlife in the Kalahari Desert through the Whiskers family, whether it's their encounters with plovers, hunts for scorpions, or on the lookout for dangerous neighbors and predators. Also, the amazing close-ups both above and below ground, beautiful cinematography of the Kalahari landscape, and astute narration is a big thumbs up.
