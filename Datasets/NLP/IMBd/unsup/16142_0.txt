I've noticed from some of the reviews here and from remarks made by a number of my friends who have seen this movie that far too many people seem to be judging this movie as a children's film. Strange as it may seem this film isn't a kids film, nor is it a documentary, it's not a sickly-sweet boy loves dog movie either, this has got to be one of the most scathing satires ever made. The film lumps together elements borrowed from "Lassie", "Rin Tin Tin", "The littlest Hobo", "Skippy the bush kangaroo" and many more and then gleefully turns them all on their head in a brilliant parody. Unfortunately too many people see only a kids film and judge it on that basis when in reality it is a movie aimed at adults poking fun at the films those self same adults enjoyed as children. My only criticism is that the movie seems to have missed its intended target. Either the director and screen writers misjudged their audience or the audience are misjudging the film. What a pity as this movie is a pure gem.
