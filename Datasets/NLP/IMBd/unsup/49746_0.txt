There simply are no spoilers in this "movie". Although the picture and sound is good for being produced for a B-horror film, the rest of it is poor acting and scenes you've seen in at least 50 movies before. To make things even worse, someone had the idea that Swedish kids speaking English was a great idea, probably so the movie would have a chance of getting shown in other countries!<br /><br />Here's the plot: A crazy lady has a son together with her own son(!) which is then being kept in a hole in the woods. Of course, this monster of a son escapes, and of course there's teenagers in the woods (sounds familiar?). You don't need a diploma to figure out that Bunny-man (that's what he's called in the end credits) will go Jason on the teenagers, but i guess that's what horror-flicks like this should be all about. The problem is that not once do you get scared, not a single scene looks real, and all acting is terrible. In the end, all you do is sit there and get angry at yourself for watching this, maybe, just maybe, you'll have a laugh at the poor acting, or the strange unreal scenes (There's one car scene that made me laugh like crazy, cause it's so unbelievably unrealistic)<br /><br />Watch it, don't watch it, that's up to you, i'd rather rent any part of the Friday the 13th-flicks and watch it again. I'm stealing my last comment from Comic book guy in the Simpsons: Worst movie EVER!
