At the very least, someone should have said, fix the script, "it's not funny." Give up some money to fix it. Everyone looks bad, including the Asians. That's why Asians should continue to play villains 'til somebody gets in there who knows what to do. <br /><br />Maggie Q is cute from every angle. Be mindful of a limit. She can cross over and she needs to do it now before she gets stereotyped. On screen, she reads with a brain but if she doesn't show it soon ...<br /><br />Christopher Walken as always is a professional and saves what little there is. Likable Aisha Tyler is a talent and she's smart, but she needs to take more control. The nice surprise is that Jason Scott Lee can be funny. The German character gave it a good shot.<br /><br />What's George Lopez doing in there? His character works on his TV show, not here. Did the director say, just be George Lopez? The director deserves this criticism because Lopez' character has so much screen time. <br /><br />This is a director who doesn't protect his people or himself. Sad.
