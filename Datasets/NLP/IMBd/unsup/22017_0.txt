I had been waiting for a good long time to see this movie and finally got the chance at the July screening in LA. The biggest compliment that I can think to give is that the movie captivated me from the first frame through the last and that it delivered exactly what I had hoped it would (with a few surprises along the way).<br /><br />The cast was fantastic, bringing the witty and touching words of the script to life in a fun, beautiful setting. Though I had seen bits and pieces about the film through blogs and pictures, seeing it all play out in a theater was fantastic.<br /><br />There is so much more I could say, but I have refrained from even telling my friends the details because this is a movie best watched unspoiled for the first time. I can only hope that it will get picked up for distribution and that I will be able to see it on the big screen again as well as on DVD.
