I like the way Absa,the author and director of the movie,used to tell the story. Simple, nonprofessional actors/actress, and low-cost(I believe) are this movie's characteristic. It is describing a "world" in a boy's eyes and his life in a sea-shore village, Popenguine, Senegal. In fact, in this small ordinary village, there is a "world" alive! The author use his direct simple way to display a situation that different cultures are interweaving and interacting each other in the tiny place.<br /><br />As well as all good movies, it gives its audience a room to think. When the young generation grow up with the western culture, what will happen to their own culture? extinguish or survive, or still alive in the "corner" where have been forgotten by the rest of the world. Because of the "room" for imagination, different person will have different opinion from his/her different position of view. Like an ancient Chinese saying: "the benevolent see benevolence and the wise see wisdom", I think Absa love to see the different cultures in Senegal can get along with each other harmoniously.
