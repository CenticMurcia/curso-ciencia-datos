I've watched this show on several occasions to attempt to give it a chance, but each time, the episode has been based on repeatedly recycled material, but they add a little romance and some teen angst to give it a little flavour.<br /><br />It seems that once a week, the town is nearly destroyed. The simpleton, Jack Carter, is the one who manages to put it together because everyone else, despite their brilliance, is seemingly unable to solve problems outside their field of science, except a couple of the science characters who happen to be experts in everything and are able to spoon-feed the audience some tech-babble and advance the plot.<br /><br />The show epitomizes cheap Canadian TV. It's a US production, to be sure, but filmed here and it involves cheap props, cheap special effects, and cheap writing.<br /><br />It's only given such praise, in my opinion, is because it's one of the few science fiction shows on TV at the moment. The appropriate quote would be that in the kingdom of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.
