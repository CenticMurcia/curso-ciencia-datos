Psychological thriller .. well the thrills are a bit artificial and unrelated to the story but there's a bit of suspension still.<br /><br />Large parts of the movie happen in the main characters mind. The ending is crucial to the integrity of the story. Until you get there you're feeling a bit like "whats the point of this flick?".<br /><br />I personally thought it was a bit too dragging and slow to rank anywhere higher than 7/10, but a decent psycho-drama still.<br /><br />Makes you think a bit to understand what its about. Look at the vote statistics, very young people vote low for some weird reason :-)<br /><br />Gave avg 5 pts for the implementation, but the ending raises it to 7. Of course the fact that you find your self wondering whats going on during the film also is very positive.
