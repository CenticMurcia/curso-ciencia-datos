This film is far more ambitious in its scope than it is successful in delivering its message. Despite the illustrious cast, there was nothing remotely spiritual in either the characters or the performances, save perhaps Forest Whittaker's scene of repentance in church towards the end, which nevertheless left much unresolved and was ultimately unconvincing. I think this is therefore inadvertently more a demonstration of the inability of the contemporary film industry to discuss spirituality, than it is about Jesus, the Apostles or Mary Magdalene. Juliette Binoche was feeble in her portrayal of Mary Magdalene, delivering a confused, slightly hysterical and nondescript portrait of a woman who is otherwise known to be both an extraordinary person and supposedly the film's central concern. The character played by Matthew Modine was the most convincing, in his cynical, hypocritical and totally materialistic egotism - and I think this fact alone says something about the 'spirit' which guides the whole movie. But even this admittedly interesting character was left sketchy and undeveloped.<br /><br />Discerning viewers should be warned: not only is the film an attempt to justify heresies the church has known and rejected for valid reasons since the dawn of Christianity (as well as some new-fangled ones), but it fails even in its heretical intent - the whole film is a series of loose threads leading nowhere. It leaves one with a vague feeling of religious unease and a sense of the demonic gnawing monotonously away at Christian tradition; yet another rusty nail in the resurrected Body of Christ. I should mention that I'm not against free speech or even the misrepresentation of religious truth, here ably conveyed in their fictional 'interviews' by the purveyors of error themselves, Jean Yves Leloup and Elaine Pagels, would-be academics prostituting their respective disciplines for the broader public; but if you are going to make a movie with a heretical or blasphemous message, at least make it good artistically. In all, a waste of 2.5 hours.
