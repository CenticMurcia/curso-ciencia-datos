***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** This Court TV original movie does a commendable job of pointing out the injustices often caused by mandatory minimum sentencing laws. Mercedes Ruehl is excellent as Susan Walker, a single mother who is sentenced to 20 years in federal prison simply because her live-in boyfriend and his cronies were peddling marijuana on a large scale.<br /><br />Walker refused to plea bargain since she considered herself to be innocent and devoid of inside information. Unfortunately, all of the other defendants in the case (they KNEW they were guilty) accepted a plea bargain, pointing their fingers at Walker as a co-conspirator to shorten their own sentences. As a result Walker, who was guilty of nothing but trusting the wrong guy, received the longest sentence of all.<br /><br />Overall, the film is quite compelling for a made-for-cable flick. Ruehl rules her character throughout.<br /><br />
