In my opinion, one of the best movies of the last 20 years. Very well-made, entertaining, & educational as well. A must for anyone who enjoys a good, intelligent movie, whether you have an interest in space, politics, modern history, or whatever!! I have seen it several times (I teach American History & show in class every year), and am always entertained, never bored. I give it a 10!
