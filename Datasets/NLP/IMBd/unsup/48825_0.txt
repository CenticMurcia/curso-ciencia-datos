A pseudo-documentary that features such appalling acting that it ends up less convincing than Soviet propaganda of the 1950's.<br /><br />A nice try, but even the early interviews with the supposed witnesses and the law enforcement officers are just too relaxed to be realistic. Anyone who's watched real documentaries about murders will spot it soon enough.
