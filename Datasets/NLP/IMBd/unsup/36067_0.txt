I am heartened to see that, for a change, most others agree with me on the dopiness of this flick. Therefore I shall simply add that this has nothing to do with Yellowstone National Park. The "filmmakers" knew nothing about it but that Old Faithful is there and knew nothing about national parks but that rangers wear uniforms. I watched this to see how goofily unrealistic the geysers and hotsprings would look. Surprise, there aren't any, besides a spout of water in the background (Old Faithful) and a love scene in a hot-tub (the hidden hotspring). Disney couldn't even be bothered to make some plastic scenery! Yes, along with each other Hollywood film, they simply set everything in the studio's grassy fields with California's generic mountains in the background. The park's geology and animal-life are joyfully manipulated by the HEROES as the SOLUTIONS to the villain's evil actions. To the filmmakers, the only difference between commercial tourist attractions and national parks is that national park employees wear ranger uniforms. And these are the same people getting worked up over global warming? For sure. But any film with A J Langer is worth at least 3 stars.
