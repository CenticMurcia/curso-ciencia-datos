This movie was one of the funniest films in the first three years of the century. Adam Sandler and Jack Nicholson were excellent in this film! I can't believe that so many people criticized this film. I got this on DVD with low expectations. This movie exceeded my expectations. The basic plot line is about a timid businessman who has to undergo anger management because he got "mad" on a plane. A scene that surprised me was when Derek Jeter and Roger Clemens play a very small part at Yankee Stadium. I was surprised because I was not expecting these two players to appear in the film. The chemistry between Sandler and Nicholson was great. The storyline was believable and the script worked. I also like the music played in this film. Fans of Sandler will be laughing at this film like they never had before. I give this movie a 9/10.
