When one thinks about Northern European cinema you think about frozen landscapes, desert towns, drama, Bergman, Liv Ullman, Von trier... You wouldn't relate Sweden or Denmark to the crazy comedy, but that's what you're gonna find in "Kopps": a small town and four cops whose jobs are at risk (no crime = no need of cops). Now, what are they gonna do? Can you figure it out? Well, if you can't just give "Kopps" a chance.<br /><br />OK, it's not one of the best movies ever, but it's much more funny than most of nowadays Hollywood comedies. It's full of hilarious situations and crazy characters (the police dog is a Chihuahua!!).<br /><br />*My rate: 7/10
