What can say this German Count about this film?... what can a German aristocrat say who deeply loves ( besides his fat German heiresses ) the silent cinema? What then can be said about a film that is well known for being the first talkie (well that's not technically true, it's more a synchronized film) in film history?<br /><br />As you can understand, mein liebers, it's very hard, very troublesome, very sad, very much, indeed, to talk about this talkie film. German words fail this Count (that's a perfect excuse for a silent film fan) when we think about what "The Jazz Singer" meant to film history.<br /><br />The film is a typical 20's melodrama with a son of a Jewish cantor who wants to be a Jazz singer. Ah, and that's a problem, indeed!!... the youngsters always defying traditions, having no respect for the elders they begin wanting to be modern singers and finally want to make talkies!!!<br /><br />"The Jazz singer" was the talk of the town, it's true.<br /><br />Thanks to the adventures of Jakie Rabinowitz and some bizarre songs, henceforth the cinema wasn't the same. The public preferred simple talkie stories and forgot the poetry, the visual beauty, the sceneries, the slapstick, the German Expressionism, the frenchified films, the avant-garde movements, the Pola Negri whip, the Brooks hairdo, Metropolis, the Garbo face, the sunrise of two humans, etc. The magnificent film narrative of the silent films that at that time was especially brilliant was at the beginning of the end of a beautiful dreama splendorous, unique era of the film history.<br /><br />And now, if you'll allow me, I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count has talked himself out with his respect for the films of the silent era
