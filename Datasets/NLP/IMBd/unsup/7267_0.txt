This is one of two movies I have ever seen that should be under the category of "So Bad It Is Good." People say "Plan 9 From Outer Space" is one, but I don't. You can only watch Plan 9 once or twice then you realize it just sucks.<br /><br />This movie, and I speak of the English Dubbed version, was so amazingly bad that it was GREAT. And I mean GREAT.<br /><br />I have NEVER laughed so hard in my life. This is the greatest comedy ever, of all time ever.<br /><br />The other movie you should try and find is Litzsomania. While it doesn't have the high re-watch value this movie does, it is amazing.<br /><br />Movies like Meet the Feebles and anything by John Waters strive for what this masterpiece gets to.<br /><br />CHECK IT OUT! 9/10
