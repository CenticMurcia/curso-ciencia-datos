Once I had read the Tom Clancy's novel RAINBOW SIX, I always looked for this rare video-game title in all software shops arond my town. When it finally arrived as a pay-less version, it has been TANGO DOWN!I read, somewhere, that must be also a motion picture in production, based upon the Clancy's Novel. The plot is quite simple: this is an action videogame just like DOOM, but is a bit different. RAINBOW is an international SWAT team, composed by the brightest counter-terrorism agents from all-over the world to fight terrorism wherever on the planet. It all starts with a hostage situation at the British embassy in London, where RAINBOW team is called to intervene... and then, various missions, most of them based on the original novel's situations, and a secret, deadly plot comes out from behind this sudden terrorism wave. The way to play is here: you choose the weapons, the equipments and the men, you can made a plan, and you got to accomplish mission, such as defuse bombs, rescue and escort hostages... you CAN KILL TERRORISTS, OF COURSE, BUT THEY ALSO CAN KILL YOU, OR YOUR TEAM MEMBERS, OR THE HOSTAGES, so you must TOOK CARE... when the character that you're using dies, you get the control of another team member since they're all gone (you loose) or the mission is accomplished (you win), but you also loose if hostages are killed, or the bomb explodes, it depends from the mission. THIS IS THE FATHER OF ALL TACTICAL GAMES. Two Thumbs Up!
