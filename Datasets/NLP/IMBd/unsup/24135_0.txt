Could have been made by Kubrick, and if it had been, everyone would be saying what an insightful view of humanity it is.<br /><br />Like so many of Kubrick's films, Candy shows how no matter WHAT high-sounding excuses men give for their actions, they are really just animals seeking power, status, and mainly, sex. As someone else here said, Candy shows how men are devious and conniving creatures who will try every dirty trick in the book to get into the pants of an attractive young girl.<br /><br />I only wish I could know what Kubrick thought of this film. I bet he liked it. I know I did.
