I loved HSM 1 and i was really excited when i found out there was going to be a hsm 2. With all of excitement gone to waste this movie sucked! What did i do to deserve this?! The plot is pointless and the songs that were written. I mean come on, who wants to know about sharpay, (ashley tisdale) being fabulous. That song was i waste and so was almost every other song. The only song i seemed to enjoy was you are the music in me. The singing is OK. But the acting i really hate. The only reason why i really watched this was to see Zac Efron. Without him........you don't even want to know. There are way better movies on Disney. At least hsm was actually worth watching. I could watch it again. However hsm 2 i wouldn't want to sing again unless someone held a gun at me forcing me to see it. Little kids might enjoy it but i hated it. It's no wonder why it only got like a 5.9/10. If you really want to see a good movie don't catch your breath on this. Movies at the theaters are way better than Disney channel original movies. But if i had to pick some of the best movies on Disney they would be: Twitches life size parent trap Those are the only OK movies on Disney. Anyway, take this comment from somebody who cares about what you watch and don't watch. DON'T WACTH THIS MOVIE! My overall rating is 1/10
