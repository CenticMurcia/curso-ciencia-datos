I'm a huge, make that HUGE fan of the TV show, so I had always wanted to see the movie that started it all. What a let-down. It's as if Joss Whedon was using the movie as a practice session. The dialogue was mediocre at best, effects were non-existent, and the characters weren't developed at all. Not to mention it was anti-climatic. I realize it was low-budget, but man, it was low. I'm actually surprised that they decided to even give it a second chance as a TV show. It's not like any character from the TV show was in the movie, except for Buffy, of course.<br /><br />Joss Whedon certainly got it all right with the TV show (if it weren't for the title, so outdated now), but I'd keep happy thoughts about the TV show, and skip the movie altogether.
