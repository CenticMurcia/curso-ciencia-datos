This is as butchered as Shakespeare can get, if you for a moment forget about a insulting Romeo and Juliet with Leo Di Caprio and Claire Danes, or pitiful Titus with Anthony Hopkins. Movie, not just that it's very boring and pointless, but it's decapitation of Shakespeare's working. It's offensive to take his original setting of old Denmark, and put it into America.<br /><br />Movie is not worth watching and is a big mistake.
