This is an enjoyable movie as long as you aren't expecting much. It's got it's moments, some you'll laugh at, and some you'll shake your head at. But all in all not a bad way to spend your time on a lazy afternoon. And the director should thank Jack Elam, without him this movie would have lost over half of it's laughs.
