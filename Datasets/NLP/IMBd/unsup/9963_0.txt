Hal Holbrook is excellent. Martin Sheen is excellent. The story line is very touching. Hal Holbrook's son does not know his father is gay when he first comes for his annual summer visit. His live in lover, Martin Sheen, moves out during the visit and moves in with his very liberal minded sister and brother-in-law. One of the most memorable exchanges for me, takes place between Martin Sheen and his sister when she tells him how much she understands his lifestyle. His response is unexpected but very right on! The son learns accidently about his father and runs away but befriends a cablecar operator who helps him sort things out. Hope Lange is the perfect ex-wife. Great movie. I wish ABC would re-release it!
