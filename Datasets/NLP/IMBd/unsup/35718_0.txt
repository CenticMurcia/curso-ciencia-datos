Wow this was one terrible sequel. I don't even know where to start on how bad this movie was. It was just so low budget and so dang boring. Somehow Pluto (Michael Berryman) is still alive after the first movie. How I have no idea. Then there's one other cannibal The Reaper. His name sounds cool right? Too bad the character is so terrible it's not even funny. This entire movie is mostly flash backs from the first movie. Even the Dog has a flash back! This movie is pretty disappointing and really poorly made too. I don't know what Wes Craven was thinking when he made this one. Please avoid this movie at all cost; it's not worth your time. If you want to see a good Hills Have Eyes movie. Go see Hills Have Eyes (2006) (1977) The Hills Have Eyes II (2007) those movies are much better! I give The Hills Have Eyes Part 2 a 2/10
