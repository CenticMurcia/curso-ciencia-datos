This movie is one of the better comedies I have seen over the last few years. The comedy duo of Wilder and Pryor are one of the best we have seen in movies. They have such great comic chemistry. This is the best prison comedy ever in my opinion if that is saying much. I highly recommend renting this movie or at least catching it on the tube.
