It was better then Starship Troopers 2. But the only thing that would have been worse would be a 90 minute film of someone taking a crap. The main problem with this film is it actually tries to be faithful to the first one and that's not good. The first Starship Troopers was made by Paul Verhoveven, a guy not as clever or smart as he thinks he is. It was clear that Verhoveven despised the book which the film was based which showed military service as a positive thing. The film he made was a deliberate spit in the face to the book, turning the concept of courage and service into being a duped fascist puppet. This sequel tries to do the same. It attempts to satire war and the role of religion during war. However the films level of satire are as complex and subtle as someone dropping their pants and mooning you. One of its selling points was the return of Casper Van Diem, the star of the first movie. This a bait and switch move. Van Diem shows up for the first few minutes and is seen for two minutes in the middle and then 5 minutes at the end. Really he looks like he's just waiting to get his money and leave. Most of the film involves new characters stomping through a desert on a remote planet which goes on far too long. The first movie at least knew to throw us a battle scene every 10 minutes to keep us from losing interest. This one not having anywhere near the budget of the first can't and we're stuck with people trying to act with a poor script. I will give the film points on not being completely predictable. I was sure the admiral played by Amanda Donohue was being set up to be the main villain of the piece. Turns out she isn't and her twisted logic makes sense considering the situation. Other then that the film is an attempt to be a sequel to an overrated first film done by people with even less talent and money.
