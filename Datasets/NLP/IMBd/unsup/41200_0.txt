I hated this awful movie! I had such high hopes because I had read about it for many months and I was so glad to walk into the video store and finally see it on display. Though the acting was good, (then again, how could you go wrong with that cast) the story absolutely sucked. Those women were not at all representative of the many women in the world who would love a good man. Each woman who had or whom had access to a good man used him and left him for some man with money. I am shocked that this type of negative woman bashing film even made it to the video store. A man who hates women and who has been hurt and used by some skanky chick must have written this film as payback. I say to the good women out there avoid this evil film and definitely don't watch it with your man---you'll only regret it later.
