The music, the colourful settings and the skills of the dancers make this film a must for everyone that loves to see a drama of love and betrayal - and Antonio Gades who plays Carmelo is the God of Flamenco Dancing in this film.<br /><br />When I first saw the film on a visit to Madrid 1986 it blew my mind completely and after 20 years I'm still in love with this wonderful film. The trilogy by Carlos Saura which consists of Bodas de Sangre, Carmen and El Amor Brujo get 10/10 from me but this film was the first I saw and that's why it's special. If you enjoy Flamenco, Spanish and Latin Culture and fiery ladies and gents - don't miss this trilogy.
