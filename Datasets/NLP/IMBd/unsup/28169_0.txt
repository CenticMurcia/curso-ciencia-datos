The movie version of "South Park" had me --- and this is not exaggeration -- laughing so hard I was falling out of my chair. I was laughing so hard it *hurt*.<br /><br />A) For using satire to make valid points about censorship and individual responsibility, this is the best movie I've ever seen.<br /><br />B) It's the best movie musical made since MGM left the mass-production business. The multi-national production number of "'Kyle's Mom is a Stupid Bitch' in D Minor" is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />C) It's a fabulous, fearless boot to the butt of Political Correctness.<br /><br />Roger Ebert wrote that he felt very guilty about laughing, not knowing if it all "had a point." He apparently was buying popcorn when Kyle flat out stated the point of the movie: that parents need to quit blaming "bad influences" and start *being parents* by talking to their kids.<br /><br />The gags are non-stop, the songs are terrific and there is an unbelievably touching moment involving Kenny near the end. Ignore the current lameness of the TV show; this is a five-star movie (even on a four-star system).
