This is a truly amazing animated film from Canada. The entire short is done in black and white and unless you know more about the process, you might not realize how long and difficult it was to bring this film to life. Instead of hand-drawn or computer-generated animation, the film maker used thousands and thousands of tiny pins and put them on screens. Then, by manipulating the height of them, it makes the appearance of a giant picture when they are all seen together. All this is set to lovely music and the scenes continually change--morphing from one scene into another rather seamlessly. It's amazing to think about the time it took and the film truly is a work of art--and would probably be at home in a modern art museum. The only reason I didn't rate this amazing film higher is that after a while it all becomes a tad tedious, as this is NOT a film with a lot of commercial appeal.<br /><br />FYI--This style film was not created by the makers of LE PAYSAGISTE. In fact, UNE NUIT SUR LE MONT CHAUVE is done by the same process and predates this film by 43 years. See them both if you have a chance. Also, I recently saw NIGHTANGEL (also by Drouin) and it is even better than this film--an amazing work of art from start to finish.
