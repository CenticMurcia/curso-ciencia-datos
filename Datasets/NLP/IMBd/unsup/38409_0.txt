I like a lot of movies so when I started to watch this I figured it couldn't be worse then something like Crossroads. It came close. I've never been so bored and uninterested in a movie EVER. Nothing about this movie made me care about it or the people in it. The plot was hard to follow, and when I did figure out what was going on I didn't feel any better. In fact, I felt worse because I had just wasted nearly two hours of my life. The only consolation prize I have is that this movie is so unmemorable I will probably forget it by next week. I can live with that. Avoid this movie, unless you're an insomniac desperate for sleep.
