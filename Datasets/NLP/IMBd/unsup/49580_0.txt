Bad Acting. Bad Writing. Bad Directing. This film was so bad even the popcorn sucked! The only thing believable about the story was that a guy with the acting abilities of the star, Jimeoin, couldn't even get work as an Extra. Seems a little too real to me. By the way, Jimeoin played his part really well- that part being a bloke that can't act for shite. The pace of the film was similar to the 19 hour Holocoaust documentary, Shoah, just not as funny. They're four credited writers on this film- which means somehow that they're four people on this planet who actually wanted to take credit for this insult to celluloid.. I suppose there will be new agents and managers for all involved here. I kind of get the idea that perhaps the whole film was just some tax scheme for some crafty investors who needed to take a loss- kind of like "Springtime for Hitler" in "The Producers". Things certainly don't look promising for Australian Cinema.
