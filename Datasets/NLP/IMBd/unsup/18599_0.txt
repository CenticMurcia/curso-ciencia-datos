Genre: Animated short, duck, pig, slapstick, based on Robin Hood.<br /><br />Main characters: Daffy Duck (acting as Robin Hood) and Porky Pig (acting as Friar Tuck).<br /><br />Actors: Mel Blanc (Daffy Duck and Porky Pig).<br /><br />What happens: Starring Daffy Duck as Robin Hood, he meets the hysterical Porky Pig as Friar Tuck. Friar Tuck is looking for Robin Hood, but he refuses to believe that it IS Robin HoodÂ…<br /><br />My thoughts: This is a very slapsticky Daffy Duck short (and as you may know I am not awfully fond of slapstick) however I like it quite a lot! I like how even though it has SO much slapstick, there is always a teeny bit of wit to top it off! I also love how they sometimes speak in old fashioned English like "I am whom thoust seekest. I am Robin Hood" and stuff like that. I also like the background animation, well-drawn wonky forests and paths. I also like the song at the very beginning. <br /><br />Recommended to: Daffy Duck fans and admirers (like me) and people who like slapstick and wit in a cartoon! Enjoy! :-)
