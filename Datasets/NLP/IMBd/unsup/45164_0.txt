I seen most other reviews are of a positive nature to this. While i liked the series, sniper 1 was great and two was pretty good, sniper 3 was a disgrace to the series. I realize i am a bit "old school" in that despite my realization that it is Extremely POPULAR and loved by 99.9% of movie viewers, i detest, abhor, hate, and despise movies without any definitive ending. I realize for whatever reason movie viewers love movies that create 10,001 questions and 0 answers. Movies that give you a great plot, great scenes, well written, and then just end leaving it all open to interpretation, while it is loved by the masses i hate it. Had this movie gone another 5 minutes, it could have explained everything, and i would have liked the movie. However appealing to popular demand, not to have an ending, they decided just to end at any random point. great job!!!!!!!!!!!!!
