It's a situation comedy reminiscent of Charley's Aunt and equally as funny. In both scripts a man impersonates a woman in order to reach a satisfactory conclusion to an important event. The results are side-splitting. Nathan Lane has the plum part as the flamboyant petulant drag queen (Albert) while Robin Williams as his partner Armand manages to maintain some credulity in otherwise outrageous and complicated situations. The story bounces along at a nice speed. but tends to sag when Armand meets his ex-wife in her office and they do a little song and dance routine. I didn't see much point in that. Of course the story climaxes in the dinner party scene when the two families come together in the apartment above the Birdcage Night Club. Ostensibly all erotic statues, paintings. carvings and other paraphernalia have been removed prior to dinner to create the right impression, but somehow or other the porcelain soup bowls decorated with men in erotic poses seem to have been overlooked and the patterns are quickly covered over in a frantic serving of chowder. The scene in which everybody joins in singing "I could have danced all night" is a high spot and their friend who acts as the butler for the night has a lovely comedy role as he stumbles about because he is not used to wearing shoes. Earlier in the film Armand tries to teach Albert how to sit, walk and act like a man. It's an hilarious situation....an impossibility for Albert who is so steeped in his effeminate mannerisms. All in all an enjoyable presentation, but I have the feeling the original French version which I saw many years ago had more excitement in it and the farcical situations much more humorous.
