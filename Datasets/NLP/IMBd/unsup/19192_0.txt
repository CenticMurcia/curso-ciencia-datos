Sprightly, only slightly less appealing sequel to Fairbank's first outing as Zorro. Here as Zorro's son, we also get some neat whiptricks and the sight of 2 Fairbanks (as Zorro and his son) in addition to the usual acrobatic stunts. The plot concerns Don Q being sent to the "old country" to study. He ends up framed for a crime by the corrupt officials of the Queen (who are made jealous when Don Q saves their commander from a bull with his whip, impressing the Queen with his courage). Zorro must come over to help him prove his innocence and defeat his enemies in battle.<br /><br />
