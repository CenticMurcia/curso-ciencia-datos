This is definitely the greatest science  fiction surprise of 2008 , little advertised, having been made on less than a modest budget, but still having all that a good movie of this genre requires , namely : visuals ( Fantasy II ) ,acting ( J. Caviezel in the leading role , perhaps the most underrated actor in H-Wood today ! ), and , believe it or not , a story that IS quite original : a space craft crashes on Earth ,and only one survives , well, two , but the other thing is nonhuman , very nasty and rather horrifying- H.R.Giger would be proud - and , yes , has a huge appetite for humans, but even that is brilliantly explained , as the human race in its quest for resources obliterates anything that lives on any planet,and not asking any questions , but simply sending the fleets of colonizers after the campaign 's been done ! All well and peachy unless you find yourself somewhere in the Scandinavia in the 10th century without any fleshy super zap guns or any other useful electronic device that would give you an edge!Briefly , a hodge-podge of classic movies from The Dark Star, Alien series you simply can˙t beat that  to Predator , combined with none other than the literary classic Beowulf , and it takes quiet a lot to do that ! H.McCain is a first time director to be watched closely!
