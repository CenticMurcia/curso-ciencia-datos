Well, here we go with yet another John Lithgow loser. Man, did this guy make a lot of terrible films and was unlikeable himself in almost every role, or what? In this film he's at profane screaming best! No wonder he did so much better on network television where he could be restrained. (Don't be fooled by the "TV" label on this; it's cable TV and this film is rated "R.")<br /><br />A good screen partner for him was Rosanna Arquette, who usually treated the male audiences to good glimpses of her ample breasts. She went topless here for at least five minutes. Meanwhile, the lead actor was neither Lithgow or Arquette. It was Kevin Anderson, a young actor who likes to play low-life roles. Maybe he's related to Lithgow. <br /><br />Wow, does this movie have "class" written all over it or what?!<br /><br />If you picked this up at the video store, you not only got "The Wrong Man," but you got the wrong movie. Go back and get the one with the same title, but starring Henry Fonda.
