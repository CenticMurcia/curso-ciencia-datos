Olivier Gruner doesn't disappoint too much. He's shown better moves elsewhere, and no one expects great acting from him, but he still delivers an adequate performance. The real problem is with the one-dimensional performance of Eric Roberts. I wonder how many hours he was even on the set! It is disappointing to see a performer in a movie taking it even less seriously than do the viewers. Perhaps I am giving him too much credit: Maybe he is really a C-Movie denizen of this appallingly low quality. Randy Travis comes reasonably close to making his poorly written character believable, but the movie wouldn't have been particularly different without him (and his accent isn't exactly typical for Colorado sheriffs, either).<br /><br />It's just disappointing when the worst performance in an unambitious action movie comes from a supposedly competent big name, and the best from a martial artist for whom English is a second (or third, for all I know) language.
