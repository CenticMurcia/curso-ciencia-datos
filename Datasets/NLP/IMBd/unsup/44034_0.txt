First off, I have to admit that the story to Beware: Children at Play isn't bad. I mean, some of the plot points are unique, and it's at least nice not to see the same assembly-line horror plot that you'd see in a bigger-budget movie. Yet, the low-budget ultimately ruins the movie. Sure, you'd expect the acting to not be up to par, but in this movie, the thespian work is really bad. It's on the level of skin flicks. Also, the special effects, for the most part, are even worse than what you'd find in a B-movie. It's more like what you'd expect from a recent film-school graduate. As other people have mentioned, the movie does have many boring points. The ending, while nice, isn't good enough to warrant a recommendation on my part. So, I can't say that I'll ask people to see this flick.
