Made in 1992, this was typical of its era. In other words, big hair, fake breasts, funky wardrobe, feint plot, and really awful cheesy acting. Don't be fooled by the cover, there are no women in cat-suits in this movie. In fact, most of the women are not even very attractive. I'm not even quite sure what this movie was about. Some gang of women (and one man) are cats, and are waiting for the resurrection of a supreme cat. It's hard to follow the plot, because there really isn't one. There's basically just a bunch of sex non-stop throughout the whole movie, including a scene where the only really attractive girl in the movie dances while a bunch of men form a circle around her and masturbate (I think they call this a "circle jerk"), but anyway, it's really dumb. One of the guys during the circle jerk scene has a voice like Macho Man Randy Savage, I noticed it when he kept saying "oooooh yeah!", sounded like Randy Savage. HAHA.<br /><br />There are much better pornographic theme movies than this one. The classic era of porn came to an end sometime in the late 80s, and everything after was just crap. The acting is too dramatic. They can't even have sex without over-acting. There's some clich√©s in this, there's always at least one person who likes to make weird facial expressions during sex. I do not recommend this movie.
