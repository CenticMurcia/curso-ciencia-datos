The only thing I knew about this movie was that it was produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, which is more than an enough reason to rent it. The director was Tony Scott, the director of "Enemy of Nation" which entertained and "Spy Game" which totally bored me. But this movie is like nothing else. Because; 1) The subject is very original, no you can't guess what it's about by looking at the name. Don't worry it's not some freaky Shyamalan type of movie. I have watched quite a lot movies and can easily say this was a first. Oh of course there WILL be many people who will rise up saying "this can't happen in real life". Yeah, and Godzilla can't happen either, so were you there to criticize that too? It's not a matter of "can it happen" or not, it's a matter of "does it make sense", and hell yes it does! It's so hard not to give spoilers, so all I can say is, just hold on for half an hour, and everything will start making sense.<br /><br />2) Unlike many other high budget action movies, this movie IS exciting. Don't wanna give spoilers, but when you grab what the movie is about, you will realize it doesn't necessarily have a happy ending, and that's what keeps you on the edge all the time.<br /><br />3) Needless to say, the producer is Jerry Bruckheimer so everything's gonna be BIG and EXPENSIVE, cars and ships and buildings blowing up in an eye feast.<br /><br />So as a conclusion, I can say Mr. Bruckheimer is getting even better by adding excitement to his high budget movies.
