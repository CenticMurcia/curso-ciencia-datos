This movie is definitely NOT the Cinderella so many of us grew up with...it's a continuation. It adds more to the story to keep the interest of the newer generations and is a good lesson of how sometimes things can be taken away without a moments notice, and you have to work to get them back. This story builds Cinderella into a determined young woman instead of a poor house maid and gives Anastasia a chance to do what is right. Cinderella III also gives the character of the Prince a chance to develop (even though they still don't give him a name!) All in all, Cinderella III is full of good morals, great new songs, a few subtle jokes for the parents, and of course, a famous Disney Happily Ever After ending.
