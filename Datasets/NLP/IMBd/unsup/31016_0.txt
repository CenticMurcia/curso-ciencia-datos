Awful awful awful, the reason i saw this movie was: I was surfing through channels on TV and i stopped when i saw Eddie griffin on the bus and i thought, hmm he made another movie. Silly me, so i decided to watch the movie and let me tell you that my wife ad i hated " Date Movie " Straight Scary Movie copy cats but worst. I do not recommend this movie to anyone, well maybe to my enemies lol.<br /><br />Then only part that was kind of good was the part with the blond chick, she's hot ad i mean hot, but the movie is not based on her so tuff luck. One last note, the director of this movie should be shot. j/k<br /><br />Now lets hope that the next scary movie is not a piece of crap like this one.
