Sorry Serdar Akar but you are no Kubrick, Spielberg, Aronofsky, Joel OR Ethan Coen, Oliver Stone, or any other of the thousand more talented Jewish directors.This is a B movie. The cinematography is stale, the acting is weak, and the action scenes are sleepers by Hollywood standards. Why go through the trouble of getting a couple of American actors to star in a Turkish movie, if you going to get Busey and Zane? Akar, you are adding to the B movie stereotype of countries like Turkery by nabbing B movie American stars. Just when I think Hollywood is utterly stupid, I see a movie like this and realize how good we have it in America. I am hoping for Turkeys sake they have better movies. This was their highest costing movie of all time, so maybe it is their equivalent to America's Waterworld.
