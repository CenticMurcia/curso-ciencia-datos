I think the story was pretty awful and rather scary then funny... Chad Donella on the other hand does a great job. But the funniest person in the entire movie was Steve Monroe as Holden the guy with all the sexual problems. If it wasn't for these two guys i would have rated this film 2/10 instead of 4/10...
