A mix of modern-day Charles Dickens classic A Christmas CAROL along with man-whoring, GHOSTS OF GIRLFRIENDS PAST is a no-brainer with a pretty powerful cast that really does nothing with a script that rehashes this very old theme: regret and redemption.<br /><br />The cast drew me in to see this (that and the fact that I was stuck on a flight with nothing else to do but watch an inflight film!) Matthew McConaughey (TROPIC THUNDER) is the lead as Connor Mead, a guy who's sexual exploits might make a Congressman blush. He's never married but always had a childhood crush on Jenny Perotti (Jennifer Garner, JUNO). The two never got together because of Connor's youthful shyness and Jenny's need to fit in. But now that Connor is returning home for his brother's wedding, things are getting a bit weird. Connor begins seeing his late, great Uncle Wayne (Michael Douglas, KING OF California) in strange visions. His deceased Uncle tells him, in true Dickensonian fashion, that he'll be greeted by three ghosts this night. And they're going to show him the error of his relationship-phobic ways.<br /><br />If you've read or watched any of the Christmas Carol renditions, you'll know exactly how this turns out. Like I said, no-brainer.<br /><br />The sad thing about this film is that they try to make it light and fun, but fail miserably in almost all its attempts (some of you may be familiar with the falling wedding cake scene that has been used as a trailer ...and even that isn't really funny). The only thing that was consistently humorous was the bride, Emma Stone, as a neurotic who tries to keep herself together amidst the chaos of her wedding.<br /><br />This one's a definite pass, even for those wishing to pass a bit of wasted time.
