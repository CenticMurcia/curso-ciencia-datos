I liked this movie. OK, so the low budget was apparent and the acting was not great at times, but the story kept me gripped throughout and some scenes really freaked me out, particularly at the beginning of the movie. Sure, its not the scariest movie I've ever seen, but few films freak me out these days and so this movie gets a thumbs up from me.<br /><br />You can really tell that everyone seemed to have a good time making the movie as well as I certainly detected a few tongue-in-cheek moments throughout.<br /><br />Also, bonus points for having a webcam girl as a heroine - woohoo!
