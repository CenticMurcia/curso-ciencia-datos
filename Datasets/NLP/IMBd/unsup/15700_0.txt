After reading the novel, I am usually disappointed by the screenplay, but not in this case.<br /><br />The story is preserved and is magical in this film. Romola Garai is brilliant as the young Cassandra, but all of the characters are strongly played.<br /><br />The soundtrack is fitting, and the settings work well. The characters traits develop smoothly and interact believably. This, to me is proof that with a great storyteller/writer, cast and director, time and care; something true to itself can be produced.<br /><br />I just wish there were more films made to this standard.
