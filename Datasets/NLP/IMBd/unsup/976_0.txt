i think this film was confusing and had a bad plot.Shannen did OK in this but not as well as she normally does.i found it hard to follow the whole story and found it quite boring and didn't enjoy it till bout half way but i didn't enjoy it much i would say not the best of films i have watched with her in :l what was the point of this story and what was the plot<br /><br />I've seen Shannen in better in other films i was very disappointed when i finished watching this cause it wasn't what i expected i would I've this film a bad review of 3 out of 10 Shannen is still the best actress in the world and she can act whoever put that comment that she cant she just isn't good in that 1
