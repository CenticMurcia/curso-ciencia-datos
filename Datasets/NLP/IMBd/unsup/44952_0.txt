I curse the day that IMDb didn't put an option to be able to vote 0 for a film. Even 1 is far too much of an accolade for this steaming pile of horse manure The film is just plain terrible its like they took gross out clich√©d clips of jokes from other films and ran them one after another on here. The acting is terrible and the gratuitous shots of dumb bimbos got tedious and repetitive.<br /><br />Don't watch this, even if your into all the topless or bikini clad girls. The films is just plain pathetic.<br /><br />This film has a laughable plot, has no comedy, and bad acting, in fact its a travesty it was ever made. I though I would never say this, but I'd rather watch a Uwe Boll movies instead of this.
