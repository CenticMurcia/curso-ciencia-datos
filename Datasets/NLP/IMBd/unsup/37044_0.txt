I saw this movie and was impressed first only for one reason .The new concept of short term memory loss .But then later when I saw the original one Memento I was totally awestruck by how beautifully the screenplay was done ,you in fact live with the character ,which you can never feel for once in Ghajini .Well thats not the only flaw the whole brilliance and intelligence of Mememto is diminished in Ghajini . Its ultimately turns out to be a love story like the million others . Yes it has this concept of short term memory loss .But instead of developing on that , the story is killed half the way . Well I was impressed with Ghajini only because I was happy that directors have started thinking about new concepts ,but I was wrong .This one too turned out to be a copy ,nothing original .
