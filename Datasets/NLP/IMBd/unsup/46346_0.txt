LISA, LISA (aka AXE) is one of the 74 entries on the notorious video nasties list compiled in the UK by the DPP (now CPS) back in the 1980s.<br /><br />Whilst it is evidently one of the weaker entries on the list, it is definitely not the worst. It fares better than THE GHASTLY ONES and the absolutely dire THE WEREWOLF AND THE YETI.<br /><br />The plot follows that of a typical exploitation movie from the 1970s period. Three gangsters break into a guy's apartment, murder him and his lover and then seek refuge at a farmhouse inhabited by a strange girl who hardly speaks. I'm sure you can work out the rest.<br /><br />The exceptionally short running time is perhaps the strongest point of this movie. In addition, a few good scenes stand out from an atmospheric point-of-view or an unintentional comical point-of-view.<br /><br />The producers of the movie were clearly inspired by Wes Craven's exploitation classic, THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT. LISA, LISA is however, a much tamer movie as many who wrote on this comments page have already stated. The title, AXE, used as an alternative to the official LISA, LISA title is somewhat misleading. I won't give away spoilers as to why but you'll find out if you see the movie.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is quite bad but definitely not as bad as that exhibited in the movies of gore legend Herschell Gordon Lewis. A murder scene early in the movie was so badly acted and directed that I struggled not to laugh. Sadly the movie did not contain much else to provoke such laughter in the same manner as the HG Lewis movies, which were entertaining due to high levels of unintentional humour.<br /><br />On the subject of HG Lewis, viewers of this movie will see the inspiration taken from him with regard to gore. Sadly the gore-hounds will be disappointed with the results.<br /><br />The movie is shot on the usual grainy film stock seemingly reserved for its type. However, it lacks the documentary style that was used so perfectly in THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE and THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT.<br /><br />Whilst the movie has potential to be very creepy or exploitative, such potential is wasted by a combination of poor direction and a very flat acting performance from the lead actress, Leslie Lee. Much of the movie between the good scenes is very dull and can be something of an endurance exercise for less patient viewers.<br /><br />The lack of explanation of motives or reasoning of any kind may have worked excellently in THE Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE due to the testament of the movie's strength to horrify and shock, but simply does not work at all in LISA, LISA.<br /><br />Overall, this movie proved a disappointment. Exploitation fans will be disappointed by the tameness of the movie, whilst fans of the "so-bad-it's-good" movies will find few laughs or much else to entertain themselves with by seeing it. The movie adds nothing to either genre.<br /><br />I recommend this movie only to "completists" of video nasties or exploitation movies. Gorehounds should stick to HG Lewis movies. Exploitation fans should stick to THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT and I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE. Fans of the "so-bad-it's-good" movies would do better to see TROLL 2 again. And everyone else should stick to the well-established horror classics.
