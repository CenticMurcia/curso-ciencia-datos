Burt Lancaster is always great, but this is one of my favourites. Lancaster as Valdez can best be described as Jesus with a rifle. He kills the bandits only because they continue to refuse his small request for an Indian woman who has lost her husband (I think he is killed by the bandits).<br /><br />Great, spiritually moving, film.
