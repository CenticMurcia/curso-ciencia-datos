The majority of "10"'s this film recieved makes me now believe that every person that contributed to its making went online to vote. Or maybe whoever the producer is just registered 38 seperate times. Either way, there's no way anyone who's actually watched this film could feel it deserved such merit.<br /><br />I thought it might be a thought provoking comedy. Instead it was just a group of people whining around a table for what felt like two hours (i'm sure it's shorter, but God, it didn't feel like it). It might be helpful if there was even one character that I could care about. But no. I can be around people like this for free anytime i want, considering i live in this town. And I think that's the main problem.<br /><br />I'm sure the producer and the director and the writer all find themself very very interesting and fascinating and yada yada yada. And if they're the regular Hollywood type, they A) Assume you will too, and B) are almost always mistaken. I'm sure they thought everyone would love a movie about people like them. But if you prefer your films to be entertaining, thought provoking, humorous (not pretentious), well-written, and well made, then let Melvin go to dinner by himself, and rent a decent flick instead!<br /><br />
