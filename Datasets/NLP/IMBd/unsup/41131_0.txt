I remember thinking Spongebob was the most stupid thing in the world when it first came out, but after my friend convinced me to watch one episode I found out that it actually was a decent show. It was cute and original. The episodes were witty and funny, having jokes that people of all ages found funny while still keeping it innocent and clean. My entire family loved the show. Each episode was fresh and new, while still keeping it's old charm; but after a certain point things turned for the worse. The episodes got shorter and used the same ideas over and over again. It soon became less silly and more stupid. The animation is more spastic, the voices have lost all of their luster and are now shrill and annoying, and all of the characters have lost their personalities that we once loved. Spongebob has lost all of it's value and all of it's charm. They should have stopped making new episodes a long time ago to preserve it's greatness, but it is too late now. Oh how much I miss you Spongbob... (And all other good kid's shows)
