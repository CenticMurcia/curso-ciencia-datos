This movie was really quite good, at least it was until the last act. The set up was great. The acting in the first 2/3 of this movie. The set was great, the story was pretty good and the big reveal at the end is a great concept if nothing else, and as a big fan of John Cusack I had high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately that was only true for the first bit of this movie. I don't give spoilers in my reviews, but I must say 2 things. One, the big reveal that starts off the third act is a really good concept. Had it been done differently, I probably would have loved it, but really, it ruined the movie. Secondly, the reveal of the killer was again a great idea, but incredibly poorly executed. All potential, zero execution seven out of ten
