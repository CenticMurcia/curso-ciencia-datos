This film is about a little town in USA. Three stories are connected to each other, they take place in the 50s, 70s and 90s. The last part is most boring. I liked the middle one best, itÂ´s about a teenager boy who learn to know that he is homosexual. And his french theacher is that too.<br /><br />Common Ground stands up pretty well, it is an okay film. Actors like Eric Stoltz, Jason Priestley and, of course, Jonathan Taylor Thomas is good in it. JTT can not only act in comedies, he can also do more dramatic parts. And he really shines in CC.
