What an absolute piece of crap!!I wonder how they came up with this.OK,lets get some mediocre has-been(at that time)TV actors,combine that with some young unknowns(with potential),hire a really lousy special-effects team.Now,what are we missing,anything?How about maybe a script.It doesn't even have to believable,just anything on paper will do.This is more than likely how the meeting went.Because the script was horrible,just horrible.Ed Wood wrote better dialogue.King Kong could have written better dialogue.It seems that someone placed a cat on a keyboard,let it jump around for an hour or so, and kept everything that looked like a word.As if that were the only thing that was wrong with this "entertainment" debacle.Then there was the effects (if that's what you can call it).The melting effect really....well it just sucked.The scene with Shattner's father melting was awful.The guy melts completely,without any sign of skeleton.(if you wat to see a much better melting scene go to the ene of "Raider of the Lost Ark", that's melting).Then they made it much worse at the ending scene.They just kept on showing us scene after scene of all of the bad guys melting.On and on,and on ad infinitum.Two minutes or so would have been plenty.Oh yeah, and only the bad guys were melting.<br /><br />What can I say about the acting?Shattner is all you need to hear.The Emperor of over-acting.The absolute king of ham.No one can "chew the scenery" like Shattner.Joe Estevez,on his best day only wishes he could be like Shattner.He(Shattner) wrings the melodrama out of his every single moment on this film.Borgnine tries to keep up with him but fails miserably,as does Skerritt,et al.<br /><br />How would I grade this movie?As a horror film,it fails completely.It never provided me with one scene of anything resembling horror,or fright.If it had been a satire, I might have given it a 3,but if it is satirical,then it is only accidentally so.As a comedy,it would get a 2,but I think the things I found funniest,were things the film maker wanted me to take seriously.So I have to stick with a one,but only because there isn't a lower number to give it.rp
