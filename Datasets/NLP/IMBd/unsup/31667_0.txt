The best movie of Czech genius Jiri Menzel (after the Oscar-winning 'Ostre sledovan√© vlaky' of course). Too bad that Bohumil Hrabal, the writer of Menzel's best movies is practically unknown for the "Western" audience, they apparently ignore these gems from behind the former "iron curtain". Menzel is one of those great Czech New Wave directors (along Milos Forman, who managed to get into the spotlight by moving to the USA) who established this very special Czech style of movie-making: sensitive while humorous, joyful while tragic, with very intimate and thought-provoking stories. I just love the style of Menzel who can put this unreal, incredibly funny character of uncle Pepin to the screen so well that it actually works better than in the novels of Hrabal. Don't miss it.
