Kingpin is a great mini series. Most parts are very intense and it's full of family love. The only bad part is that there seems to be two different story going on at the same time. There doesn't seem to be any connection between the two (I miss the first episode, so I don't know if they have mentioned the connection, but from the 2nd episode to the 6th, there is nothing mentioning the connection between the 2 "story")
