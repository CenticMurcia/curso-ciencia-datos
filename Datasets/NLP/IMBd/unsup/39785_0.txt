What we have here is two ill-defined, unlikeable characters being bounced around for no justifiable reason. The pacing and cinematography are annoying. It all has that been-there-seen-that feel about it. The narrative keeps changing POV for no good reason. And the sex is stone cold. <br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I am not a trasher of independent French films. I do not _require_ to be entertained a la Star Wars. To be fair, the overall mood and feeling (Paris as the humid, drizzly, polluted wintery-cold nightmare) is well captured. You can smell the stale-cigarette-soaked hotel room. <br /><br />Compared to other "random coupling" movies (The Lover, Last Tango in Paris, La Desenchantee), this is limp "caca de chien".
