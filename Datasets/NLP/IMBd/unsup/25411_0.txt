Communion is a wonderful film, and one of the scariest movies ever made. In order for some people to cover up their fears, they want to mock this movie, the idea of aliens, and anyone who claims to have had contact with them. Whitley Strieber brings this up in his book, so it doesn't surprise me that some people smirk at this film. <br /><br />The fact that Christopher Walken is in this movie only increases these immature people's drive to turn every role Walken does as a comedy. I feel bad for Walken. Too many people don't take him seriously anymore. He's one of the greatest actors in the world, yet a lot of fans want to turn every one of his performances as a joke, and make fun of him and/or just not take his work seriously.<br /><br />Then they wanna point out the "lack of the special effects. Now I personally thought the special effects were great, but compared to a modern day movie on HDTV/blu-ray, of course it's not going to be the same. It was the 80's. You people who are spoiled by CGI need to understand that. It's also worth mentoining that the 80's was also an era where movie makers didn't go and remake everything like so many people are doing today. and there are more to movies then special effects, like good acting, and a great story, and Communion has that, but some people's immature ways of thinking blinds them to that.<br /><br />People fear what they don't understand, and that fear soon grows to hate, and some people express their hate differently. Some people just wanna smirk, and make bad jokes, and mock what they fear.<br /><br />Aliens are the most realistic "monsters" in the horror world, and everyone knows that. Any one of us could be a victim to alien abduction. That is where the discomfort of it all comes in, and for anyone to think we humans are the only living creatures in this giant universe is just plan egotistic.<br /><br />I have seen a lot of movies in my life. Way too many in fact, but out of the hundred's and hundred's of films I've seen, I must say that Communion is truly the scariest motion picture that my eyes have watched. It scared me as a child, it scared me as a teenager and it scares me as man. I have never seen a movie that makes me feel more uneasy.<br /><br />I first remember when I was a little kid being in Mann's video store in Bridge City, Texas and seeing the VHS cover of Communion and seeing the alien face really scared me.<br /><br />Communion is the only horror film to ever make me revert back to being a child. I tried to watch it when I was 24, and as I was watching a very scary scene, my body began to experience the "fight or flight" system. My feet felt weird, my heart was pumping, I got goosebumps and I was sweating. No movie has EVER made me experience that and I don't think any other movie ever will. Even watching it during the day time, it scared me just as much. It scared me so much that I actually almost screamed in one part but gasped instead, and twice I had to turn it off and stop watching it because it scared me that much. <br /><br />The reason why it scares me is because since early childhood I've suspected that I may be a victim to alien abduction. I know that sounds crazy and it's most likely not true (at least I have to tell myself it's not in order to sleep at night) but there's always going to be a part of me that will always be scared of aliens.<br /><br />Communion is the only movie that takes me right into the film. I watch so many different scenes in this movie and I think...."I've been there." I know what it's like to wake up late at night and wonder if I'm alone in my room. I decided not to even finish it back then because it's way too intense.<br /><br />Perhaps one day I'll watch the movie again. I'm right in the middle of reading the book now for the first time, and it's pretty scary too.<br /><br />If you have a fear of aliens like I do and you have never seen Communion but thought about watching it....I highly recommend you avoid it. It WILL scare you.
