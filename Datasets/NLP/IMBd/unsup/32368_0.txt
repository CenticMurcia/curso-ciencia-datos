Now, don't get the wrong idea. I am a wrestling fan. However, this is a movie review. I review a movie on how I think of this. I'll tell you why The Marine is not worth seeing.<br /><br />First off, the movie has a weak plot. Not exactly original. Kidnapped wife, not the best. We got a few talented people here. Kelly Carlson and Robert Patrick. However they are supports. Okay, can they save this? No. <br /><br />I have to say without any anti-Cena and all honesty that John Cena is one of the worst actors I have ever seen. He is more wooden than a log cabin. His tough guy facials are hilarious. How did he get this role? And how is it that an experienced actor Robert Patrick have to play second fiddle? To Cena no less? Ouch. Cena's acting made the Marine hard to watch.<br /><br />Also, When a movie sucks, the only resort to try and win over people is to....yep, explosions. Forget the plot, forget the story, forget the bad acting, as long as we have explosions, the movie is saved! Right? Right???? <br /><br />The Last Word: Utter garbage. How Cena nabbed the starring role here is going to be one of the biggest mysteries of the world. His acting is awful. The movie's script is lame, too many explosions, and did I mention Cena? I hate to say this, but Cena, don't quit your day job. Acting isn't your style.
