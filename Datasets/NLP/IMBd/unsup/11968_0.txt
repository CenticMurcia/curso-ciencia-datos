I gave this movie a "10" because I just thoroughly enjoyed this movie! I won't go into details about the story because there are plenty of other comments that do that. What I will say is that even though I read a couple of good reviews about this movie, I wasn't prepared for what a wonderful experience sitting through this movie would give me. While the plot was fairly simple and it was definitely an action film, there were just so many things that surprised me throughout the movie. There were times in the film where I had to applaud - it was such a "feel good" movie and I left the theater with the same HUGE smile on my face that was on my face for about 90% of the movie.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this film yet, don't read anything else about it - just GO so you can experience it for yourself without anybody's opinions coloring your judgment. GO and see this film. It's pure entertainment.
