Yor, hunter from the future is filled with bad acting, bad scripts and horrible screenplay. why do I give it such a great vote? because it's so damn funny. This movie had me wiping tears away in laughter. Reb Brown has a unique way of looking stupid in almost every scene of this film. His goofy smile is enough to just crack me up in a minute. The music to this movie is spectacular.<br /><br />I give it 3 thumbs up! A must see...
