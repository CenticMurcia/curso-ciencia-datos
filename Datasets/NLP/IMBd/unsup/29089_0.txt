I know after a night of going out on the town drinking, drugging and dancing there is nothing I enjoy more than kicking back and playing some Ouija with friends! My first complaint right off the bat is the group were apparently at a rave and didn't seem the least bit high or drunk. It's called acting people! It's not their fault completely. The writing is terrible. There is no way this could have looked good on paper. The story is dumb. It actually gets more and more convoluted as the film wears on until it comes to its utterly ridiculous ending. It is jammed packed full of every teen slasher horror clich√© you can possibly imagine. The intense build up, that turns out to be a friend, cat etc. The going into dark deserted areas when something is chasing you (in this case a freaking demon!). A cartoon-ish old man with an ominous warning. In addition to this, all the kills are off screen and the gore is slim. If you are going to make a film that revolves around a demon it is best if you have a budget to work with. If your budget is tight, make it all about the demon. At least if your film sucks than if nothing else you have a cool demon. Critics like myself would say "Hey that film really sucked, but that demon was super cool". This film is a dogs breakfast. What a mess!
