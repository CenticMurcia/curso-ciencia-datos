Awesome booberama classic from RKO's master breast man, Howard Hughes, this 3D (cup?) extravaganza is a must see for anyone keen for desert showgirl antics and scantily clad harem chases....every stripper and burlesque queen in the greater LA area must have got a gig on this notorious Technicolor romp. In 3D it would have knocked BOTH your eyes out (to paraphrase THE FRENCH LINE's Jane Russell promo). Famous for it's censorship wrangles and delayed release, SON OF SINBAD is like a kids film made for dirty old men..in fact that is exactly what it is......Vincent Price plays the whole thing like he is really Eve Arden.<br /><br />The corridor of boobs in the last reel must have been a 3D wet dream. Poor old RKO was reduced to being a craftsmanship studio making (now funny) trash by this stage and barely made any films in this period that have lasted because of quality.<br /><br />Probably only SLIGHTLY SCARLET is their best film of this time; this is at the other end of the scale ....or maybe the gusset of the assembly line.
