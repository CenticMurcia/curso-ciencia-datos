Don't waste your time with this movie. Heather Graham's performance as a singer/songwriter turned heroin addict is awful. For most of the movie, I couldn't tell whether she was still an addict or not, which I'd attribute to Heather's terrible acting and possibly some poor editing. The storyline is non-linear, which when done properly can be really interesting, but when done poorly (as in this movie) is very confusing and distracting. Jeremy Sisto was fantastic, but unfortunately didn't make up for all of the film's flaws. It's hard to say more without giving away any spoilers, but take it from a fan of drug movies, don't waste your time. An hour and a half of my life that I will never get back...
