I taped this masterpiece from the TV about 3 to 4 years ago and I have probably seen it maybe 15 to 20 times. Each time I see it, more and deeper messages come to me about the real message that this movie portrays.<br /><br />This film is now 75 years old and I say one thing, it gives the movies of today one good run for their money. <br /><br />Look at the special effects that could and were done with less than maybe a quarter of the equipment that we have today.<br /><br />I even like this version of the Thief of Bagdad more than the 1940 version!!! It is that exciting!!!<br /><br />
