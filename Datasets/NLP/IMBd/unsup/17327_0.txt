Don't watch the movie if you're looking for anything different from the first re-make of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the one made in 2003. The plot was almost the exact same thing as the first movie. You have 2 males and 2 females. The guys are supposedly on their way to fight for their country in the Vietnam war, 1970's. On their way to some city (on an empty road), they meet a biker gang. One of the chicks from the biker gangs chases their jeep which hits a cow. Their jeep flips over, and the deranged sheriff from the Hewitt family shows up and makes all their lives a living hell. Seem familiar? Same plot writer? I think so. The rest of the movie is no different. You have a deranged mad man chasing down a traumatized girl and her friends all around the Hewitt property. Nothing special, nothing new.<br /><br />The script isn't exactly brilliant either. It seemed at times when I was watching this movie that all the characters could say was "PLEASE", "NO!!!!", "HELP ME!!!", "OH MY GOD!", "SHUT UP!". Due to this, The characters don't develop throughout the story, so you're wondering why things go the way they do in the movie. The actors were good, but the things they had to say absolutely killed this movie. No point in making a movie that was already re-made. <br /><br />If you're looking for a new, actually decent horror movie, don't rent this, and especially if you've watched the Texas Chainsaw Massacre made in 2003. It's like watching the same thing over. Not only that, you can predict what's going to happen at the end before you even hit the 30-minute mark. If you need something to kill 90 minutes of your time, but wonder what better movies you could've spent your money on, rent this.
