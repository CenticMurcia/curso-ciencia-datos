The couple Spader-Sarandon works well. Max (James Spader) is a 27 yrs old yuppie Jewish. He has recently lost his wife. He will get trapped by the mature but really attractive Nora (Susan Sarandon), who is not so sophisticated and educated than his family and friends, but she can conquer him with her rebel spirit, and wild nature. Nora shows to Max a new way to live the life based on her She has not an academic or professional background so impressive, but she has experience and intelligence. She resists everything except lies and hipocrisy. She show her pride, when Max try to give her a vacuum cleaner like a gift. The erotic scenes are a valuable part of the film. Nora will have difficulties with the friends of Max. The talks in the bathroom are very descriptive about how is she feeling that. Some political issues are pointed during the Thanksgiving party. Nora cannot control herself and standing up gives a speech in defence of the working class in front of that rich and powerful jewish family. The worst scene is almost at the end of the film, in a friend's house, when Max discovers the same model of vacuum cleaner without dust inside. (it's a bit pathetic) In fact it is a recommended film, specially for Sarandon fans (like me).
