I was looking forward to watching this movie as the trailers looked good. It is directed by David Dhawan, who has given us a couple of entertaining movies in the past. Shaadi No. 1 has an incredibly large cast of actors and looked like a Hit. A lousy script about 3 guys who want to commit suicide because there not happy with married life (how realistic and funny). They suddenly make a deal with a man to fall in love with his spoilt daughters and dump them. After many appalling flirting techniques, they manage to romance these childish girls. Suddenaly, a stranger comes and tells them he knows about their affairs, and he will tell their wives. It then follows into cheap comedy, that doesn't make you laugh a single bit. Sanjay Dutt is the stranger, why did a Great actor like him make this pathetic movie. Fardeen Khan has given us some good films, but he seems to be making worser movie over and over again. Sharman Joshi was funny in style and maybe the least annoying character in the movie. Zayed Khan gives us another Flop movie, remember (Main Hoon Na = Anybody that makes a Shahrukh Khan film have a big advantage). Esha Deol and Soha Ali Khan give dreadful performances in annoying roles. Ayesha Takia looks sexy as ever and is incredibly cute with the sweetest smile, but her looks couldn't save the film. Riya Sen is another sex bomb, that couldn't save the film. Introducing singer Sophie in a unimpressive role. Finally Aarti Chabria who looks pretty but her acting once again was poor. I would of given this a 0/10, but because of the girls a 2/10. Out of all the girls, i would love to have a three some with Riya Sen and Aarti Chabria. Their is a song in this film Zara zara where Ayesha Takia shows her melon curves, wow i would love to suck them melons.
