I really liked this movie. I think it pulled off everything I needed. I found it pretty funny, though some might think otherwise. I think that if you have the extra time, and see it playing, give it a look. You might enjoy it. Personally, the wizard was the best part of the movie for me, and he kept me laughing. The names of the people were a great rip on the movie "The Lord of the Rings", which made it so much more funny for me.<br /><br />The movie holds a lot of fun if you give it a chance. I know I did and it was worth it. I don't know if you should buy it at first sight, but I do suggest you rent it, or watch it next time it comes on TV. Well, I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. :P
