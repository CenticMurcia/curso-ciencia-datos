Fearless Young Boxer, aka Method Man, aka The Avenging Boxer I enjoyed this film more than the other reviewers. Peter Chang (Chen) is an underrated actor whose acrobatic ability matches Yuen Biao in many ways. The fight scenes are well done, showing off Casanova's amazing kicks and the final fight scene in the warehouse is surely one of the best ever filmed (a worthy rival to OUATC I). The plot is simplistic : Shao Lung (Peter Chen) joins an acrobat troupe to improve his kung fu skills in order to take on the merciless killer, Wu Pa Feng (Casanova), who took his father's life in a duel over a badge bestowing leadership on a criminal group, and I agree the humour is crudely done but just watch these guys in action.
