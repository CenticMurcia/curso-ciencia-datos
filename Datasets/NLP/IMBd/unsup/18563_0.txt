Silent Hill 3 remains the coolest Silent Hill game yet, Silent Hill 4 remaining the stupidist. Silent Hill 3 is so scary. The atmosphere it dark, the only light is your flashlight, and something is waiting around every turn and corner. This is definitely not the game you want to be playing alone at home with the lights off. Way to scary for that, but so fun that you can't resist playing it over and over and over. I will admit when I first bought it, I was too scared to play it, so I got my friend over and watched him play it. And I skipped through some speed runs on Youtube. Great... Now the graphics of this game can't be described in just one word. Brilliant. Top-notch. Outstanding. Breathe taking. Each room, each character is so amazingly designed, you feel as though you are watching a movie with real actors. The monsters, although not as scary as the ones in the first two (some are just hilarious), are designed bautifully. The riddles are tough, but not impossible so you don't break your controller in anger. Some things I did not like are: The way Heather runs, the voicing, those little dogs. That's it. If you're prepared to be scared, get this game.
