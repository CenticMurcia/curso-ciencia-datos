Poorly acted, lamely scripted, unnecessarily violent, and pretentious far beyond the typical indie films, "Frogs and Snakes" was one of the worst films of 1998. While a bad film may be enjoyable on some level for its cheesiness or other lame aspect, this film's self-importance and supposedly "deep" dialogue makes you want to gag. Nothing redeemable.
