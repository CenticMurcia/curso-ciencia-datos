I saw The Mole People when it first came out. I was just a tyke and I loved 'scary' movies. (Still do. Problem is, movies aren't scary any more.) MP haunted me as a kid and I have always loved those rare times when it was shown on late-night TV. It is very camp but it is still one of my favorites. Now I rather enjoy finding all the scientific and historical inaccuracies in those old movies about giant insects, shrews the size of dogs, and an underground civilization that lives on mushrooms and speaks English. THE BIGGEST ERROR in MP is the statement by Hugh Beaumont that Noah's flood is a proved historical fact. Of course, all the evidence proves exactly the opposite.
