There are many awful movies which have been produced by or for the Sci-Fi Channel. The Sci-Fi Channel seems to have focused on trying to hit new lows in every new production. This Centipede movie is a top contender as one of the worst Sci-Fi Channel movies ever made. The cast is horrid. The acting is non-existent. The lighting is terrible. Apparently they were so concerned that the Centipede should not be seen that they have nearly every action scene in total darkness. They could have just filmed a wall in the dark and dubbed the voices to pretend that action was going on. Did I mention the gore? There is none. Since all the action takes place in the dark, nothing is ever seen.<br /><br />On the few occasions that the Centipede is seen, it looks like one of those Chinese Dragons from a Chinatown New Year's Festival Parade. It was either made out of vinyl canvas or rice-paper. This production was so low budget that they apparently could not afford a rubber monster. Having seen the Ed Wood movie (with Johhny Depp) a couple of nights earlier, I was mildly surprised to see that the rubber Octopus that Ed Wood used was more realistic than the vinyl Centipede that was used in this movie. If only Ed Wood were alive today, the Sci-Fi Channel would have given him lots of work as a screenwriter, producer, and director.<br /><br />Not to spoil the ending (if that were possible), but how many times can you blow up and burn a vinyl Centipede before it dies? And how many times can various actors be standing next to an exploding mortar shell, dynamite, and hand-grenades and just get tossed about thirty feet and then walk away without a scratch?
