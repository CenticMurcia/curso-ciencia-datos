This does for the German occupation of France what "Life Is Beautiful" did for that of Italy. It's a wonderfully warm and even humourous story set against the horror of the holocaust. The characters are well drawn and the camera sees the German occupation through decidedly French eyes. No propaganda. No punches pulled. No attempt to deny that many French collaborated with the Nazis. And no false heroics. M. Batignole is a timid hero indeed but a genuine hero nonetheless. A refreshing new perspective on the war years with much to praise and nothing to criticise.<br /><br />
