Well what can i say, i sat down in the cinema not knowing what to expect i'd never heard of the movie and had been convinced by a friend to watch it. as the movie started a terrible boredom set in, the script was unappealing, the camera work at times appalling, and the acting that of some 60's b-movie. now i've got to admit i saw lionsgate and thought oh thats the b-movie company, and i was surprised that they had made a non-horror movie for the cinema. but i gave them the benefit of the doubt. There was one moment throughout the whole movie when it evoked some emotion other then boredom and disgust, and that was when Lexi put her had through the back door and dropped the phone and contaminated ash in the house, i felt anger that she would do that to her husband who she supposedly loved (allthough i got no sense of any connection between her and her husband) i feel bad for the actors it was not there fault they got the parts, in fact i admire that they made the appalling script come to life, its not there fault it was badly written. but they need work, the characters were flat and 1 dimensional, i felt myself wanting to leave the cinema in disgust and demand my money back, but i felt myself thinking they could have an amazing ending and that would make up for hours of painful viewing, but i was wrong. the ending was woefully inadequate. the idea behind the movie was great, but it was pulled off in a amateur way. i've seen Â£100 budget movies that were better then this. if it had not been for the big screen i might have been able to cut it some slack but alas they even chose the format of release wrong. all in all i would recommend that no one watch this unless you are bored out of your mind and have too much money and not enough sense.
