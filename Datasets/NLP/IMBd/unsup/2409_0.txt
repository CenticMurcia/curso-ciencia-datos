If you watch this movie be sure you are able to mute the sound. Not only that Mos Def only talks about opening up a bakery and baking cakes for children's' birthdays he does not even stop talking about it throughout the whole film. If I was Bruce Willis in this movie I would have shut him myself just to make him quiet. Apart from that the film contains lots of illogical behaviour from different characters. To sum up one can say that the flick was good in the first twenty minutes. Then Mos Def begins to fall on ones nerves what makes the the film worse and with the beginning of the bus kidnapping it loses any existence authorization. I wasn't as angry after watching a film as I was after watching '16 Blocks' for a long long time.
