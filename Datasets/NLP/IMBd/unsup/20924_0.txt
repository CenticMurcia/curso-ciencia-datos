I can't believe I have to give a 10 to this movie. Okay, so the plot isn't that amazing. A bit weird, but not amazing. The acting performances aren't anything special, either. But so WHAT? This movie is supposed to be a whacky comedy, and that it is. Folks say Jim Carrey can't act, and he can only do weird faces and maneuvers. Again: so what? All a crazy comedy needs to be considered terrific is that it is FUNNY, right? I laughed just about through the whole movie. It is true, that a movie like this does not give too good a picture of Mr.Carrey's acting ability, but this sure shows that he's an exceptional comedian. This is the type of movie that you either like or hate, it makes you laugh or cry. Some people can't understand this kind of humor but I sure can.
