This movie desperately wants to be a cult flick: it tries to be unpredictable, strange, and unique. It isn't. It's predictable, uncreative, and annoying.<br /><br />An object flies near a small town in classic ripped off 50s style. We meet our array of Old Man, Good/Bad Cop, Good Kid Hero/Vaccous Girlfirend, and worst of all, ODIOUS Comic Relief. It all sucks to high heaven, and you're bored before the Klowns show up.<br /><br />I have read many reviews calling the Klowns Scary. They're not. They're Skary. They never say anything, and have no personality. Maybe if the clown's had some kind of personality, this would have been good, but it's really dull.<br /><br />After we get the model of a Klown skene established (Klown will show up, do something kind of clowny, and then kill someone) we get that repeated over and over again. Ouch.<br /><br />This movie, despite what you might hear, was not made for nothing. 2 million dollars is not nothing. That's more than twenty ATTACK OF THE KILLER TOMATOES. Think what you will of that movie, but you have to admit it's way more original than this eighties crap.
