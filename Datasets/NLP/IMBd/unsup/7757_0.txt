I have been quite interested in seeing this zombie flick from the first time that I had heard it was being made. The wait was finally over and I got the chance to check this film out. All the waiting that I did was well worth it.<br /><br />Dead Life has quickly become one of my favorite zombie films and there are plenty of them out there. I was very impressed with the acting. Michael Hanton and Jayson Garity are terrific in this film and I hope to see a lot more of their work in the future. I think what impressed me the most was the special effects. I have seen a lot of low budget films lately, but some of them failed with the gory special effects, but Dead Life is different. When the zombies start feeding, the gruesome bloodshed begins, in a big way.<br /><br />William Schotten did such an amazing job with writing and directing this film and I am really looking forward to seeing his new projects.<br /><br />All in all, Dead Life is a fun zombie epic of a film with a cool plot, really good acting, lots of zombie mayhem and some kick ass music (metal all the way). Check this one out as soon as possible.
