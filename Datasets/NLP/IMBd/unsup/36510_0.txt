I bought this movie uncut because I love gory movies. Everyone had hyped this movie so much and talked about how gory it was. The only death scenes I saw were a few long, drawn out gut-munching scenes, very repetitive and boring. I can only watch a few zombie hands reaching into a cadaver and pulling out pig intestines and fake blood so many times before it gets really old. Not to mention the few other scenes where people died were equally mundane. A woman gets her face pulled through some jagged glass in a scene that pathetically attempts to re-create the eye-piercing scene from Fulci's Zombie. Someone gets decapitated and...aw who cares. Even the guy who has the first confrontation with the zombies looks like he is maybe going to have something cool happen, the zombie has his hands wrapped around the guy's face, does he crush his head, gouge his eyes, try to eat his brain? No! He lets him go! What the he!!? The plot was terrible, the gore was redundant and the special effects were sub-par. How dare anyone try to compare this with the other Italian zombie films at the time.
