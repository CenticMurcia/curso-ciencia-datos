A little while into the movie we find out that the wife has been having an affair for four years, along with a few short string of guys.<br /><br />Why the husband stayed, the only reason maybe until the children got older and to keep the family together doesn't seem enough in this movie. It seems a miserable household to be in, and while it doesn't mention if he was having an affair, it seems very plausible this must have occurred.<br /><br />The youngest child, while not uncommon, swears far too much even in front of his parents who don't do much to stop him. In fact they both swear at their parents which, again quite commnon, still doesn't help keep a family together.<br /><br />Watch it to see how this movie shows how the children cope, find out who to blame, and bear through a tough time in their young lives that is happening more and more often. Set in the 1980s not much has changed in parents splitting up, except that it happens more often.
