This is the third time i have seen this film, and i absolutely adore it :). It's so fresh, sexy and real. I would just crawl into the cinema seat, with my love and simply enjoy it. :) The photo session of the film is the one of the best, okay, they don't use such a camera and scenes to produce such shots there and then, but i don't care, it mixes great i think. The fact that both Josh and Cynthia is so usual gives the film an authentic look. :) Great sex scenes and the usual differences between man and woman on display. :)
