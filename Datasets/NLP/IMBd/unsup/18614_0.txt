I have seen many movies last year and this is the one that is close to my heart. I found the characters to be realistic. This is not a Hollywood high octane movie, rather a wonderful story composed of characters you can relate. In addition to a poignant a well-written script, the scenery is simply beautiful and breath-taking. The actors are magnificent and you immediately get drawn to the story. Each chapter of the Carati family is interesting, without being overwhelming. The pace of the movie allows the viewer to take in every aspect of what each and everyone of them is going through. Personally, I find this to be a must-see movie. It is refreshing to see an Italian movie that is not centered around the mob. The only drawback is that certain scenes were predictable. Aside from that, it is a genuine portrait of human life that can appeal to non-Italians, such as me.
