BwaaaaaaaahhhhhhahahahahahahahaAHHHHHHHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! <br /><br />I think that about sums it up. What a trite, pedestrian, ludicrous POS. Might be inspiring for upcoming make-up effects artists, because it's the one thing this stupid movie manages to get right.<br /><br />Starring your high-school drama teacher as Angela, a demon gently blossoming into middle age.<br /><br />Featuring stupid characters, including: a perpetually annoyed priest who doesn't allow anyone to complete a sentence while speaking to him; a dry-boxed old penguin who morphs from cheerless octogenarian virgin to yardstick-wielding commando an hour in; mean girls who are also dumb sluts; mullets; tawdry demonology; bad boys time-warped in from the '80s; and a thoroughly despicable wuss-boy hero.<br /><br />At least Morbid Angel is on the soundtrack, although their music rocks far too hard for this movie.<br /><br />Watch it for a good laugh.
