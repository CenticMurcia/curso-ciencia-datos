To create a truly awful movie, it is essential to start with an absolutely dreadful script. By that measure, "The Clones" deserves a Nobel Prize. Other reviewers have cited some fine examples of utterly embarrassing lines, but my own personal favorite from this movie comes after an attempt is made on the hero's life, and he flees to the home of The Wise Professor to explain his plight. The Professor looks gravely at him and, in a moment worthy of Yogi Berra, says, "So...you say someone is trying to kill you? Hmm...this could be serious!" Possibly a good party movie, but definitely should not be seen while fully sober.
