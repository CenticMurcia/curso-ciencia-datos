Based on R1 DVD 109 mins - Renegade Version<br /><br />Ten thousand imdb voters cannot be wrong, well I should have heeded my own advice.<br /><br />Basically it's rubbish, badly edited, poorly constructed rubbish. Scenes are out of sequence, the Alps are in the middle of Nevada, no ones ever heard of a weather balloon - I could go on but I'd prefer to forget everything I know about this movie as quickly as possible.<br /><br />3/10 - it could have been worse but not by much.
