The cover made it look like The Devils Rejects, the opening credits (images and choice of songs) made it look like The Hills Have Eyes, yet this movie wasn't like either. It wasn't even scary, the first hour and a half was just a waste, then they tried to pile all of the "Scary stuff" into the last 5 minutes. I had never heard of any of the actors or actresses before, and sometimes thats not a bad thing, but usually (and it was the case here) it means you're in for a low-budget film that really won't be that great. The whole movie pretty much left you wondering why you rented it in the first place. Definitely not worth the 4 bucks at blockbuster. If you want a scary movie, don't rent this one.
