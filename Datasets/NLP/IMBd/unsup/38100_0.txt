Poor Dereck was jacked in the dick so many times I really felt his pain. Over all this movie was terrible like my mom's sexual meatloaf; which has been known to cause excessive diarrhea, some might even say explosive. I remember one scene where a door was broken down, mind you this was their last defense, and the response was "Dereck why did you break down the door?" In a very feminine voice. Also Dereck once had all of his ass-holiness absolved by the good preacher Dave who makes a rousing plea to God at the end. There was also a lot of needless tit sightings in this movie. There were these 8 hicks standing around a naked zombie in some sorta circle jerk. Oh yea and the concept of an unbreakable barricade is a few boxes tied together. Why are we researching Hydrogen power when there are ideas like this? All in all this movie makes me regret being born.
