I saw this when I was 15, in the theater... I think we paid for something else and then snuck into this theatre. There were 5 people in the theatre and 3 left half way through.....Do you get what I'm saying. It was the first time I ever saw a fully naked women, I was male and 15.....and it was still only marganially entertaining. <br /><br />Some of the songs were good... This is a product of the 70s when movies like this and Fairy Tales, Flesh Gorden and such were taking almost adult movies(no plot lots of skin) to the mainstream theaters.<br /><br />While I am a major movie freak, I am not much on musicals, so if you like musicals and skin......Maybe.<br /><br />4/10
