Alright well i've been a big "b" horror movie buff for practically all my life and this movie was really bad. BUT I love the music!!!! Its totally up to date with any metal music out there now if not better. If they did decide to put out a soundtrack they would make back all their money they lost making this film. Also that house they filmed it in, i've seen it before and it was my dream house, but now i'd be too scared to step into it so i guess the movie was somewhat effective. Anyways, the music is awesome and its a crime against humanity not to of made a soundtrack. I'm gonna buy the stupid film on DVD just because I heard there was a music video on it. Damn, they got me.
