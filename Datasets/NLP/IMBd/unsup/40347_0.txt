I´ve been a fan of the movies of Brian Yuzna for a long time. Although he won´t be remembered as the greatest directors of all time, his movies have been funny, bloody and imaginative entertainment. But what he did with his new movie "Faust" is beyond words. The acting is painfully terrible, the score destroys every atmosphere, the settings are cheap and the special effects are absolutely cheesy. But, hey, it could´ve been a nice popcorn-movie nonetheless, if "Faust" wasn´t so completely in bad taste and if it had a story. There are moments which remind me of the worst in pornography: There is a disgusting torture-scene which is supposed to be sexy and nearly every boring, stupid and unmotivated scene ends with sex or some uncreative killings. This movie was directed only for money and you see it in every second of it: Throw in some gore, some metal music and some sex and those stupid horror-fans will like it. But it simply doesn´t work, it just makes you want to throw up. "Faust" is the debut of Yuzna´s new production company - He couldn´t have a worse start than this one. Avoid at all cost!!!
