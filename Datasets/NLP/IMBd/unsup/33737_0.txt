I was forced to go see this movie with a bunch of ten year old, and even they found this boring and pointless as I did.<br /><br />Themes were tossed around uselessly in this movie, yet I was not completely bored, the only thing keeping me awake being my icee and the scenes where something would catch on fire.<br /><br />Of course, I failed to understand what significance the dog had in the movie, and to understand the relationships that were going on either.<br /><br />If you are looking for a great family film, or even a movie with a point, don't look here, don't even think about going to this. It was pretty much the worst movie I have seen this year, especially at the theatre.
