Who doesn't love Bob Newheart? I've been a religious follower of all of his television series since I was a young man. Bob is one of those people who's always welcome in our living rooms. I've never thought of him as an actor and that's simply because an actor would never have the skill to appear as natural as he does. Whenever I've watched any of the series he's starred in, I feel like I'm in the room listening to a conversation that's meant only for me and the other actors in the scene. He's so ordinary and likable that he's welcomed without hesitation into the fabric of the typical American family. Isn't it wonderful that this seemingly ordinary man has been able to entertain us for so many years without ever resorting to stories involving violence, murder, foul language and corruption. He's always provided us with entertainment that we can invite our parents or children, or even the parish priest, to watch. He's getting a little long in the tooth now, but I still chuckle whenever I see him on his occasional visits to one of the late night T.V. shows. He's a true entertainer and we're not likely see the likes of him again. He's one of those rare entertainers who has had only one wife, one family, and one philosophy of what represents quality entertainment. God Bless him.
