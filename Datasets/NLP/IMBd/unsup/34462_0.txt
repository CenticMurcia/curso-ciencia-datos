Many critics thought the film "200 Cigarettes" would be the "American Graffiti" of the 90's. Maybe these critics were smoking some cigarettes with some weed-induced nutrients because this film was all wrong. It is about a bunch of young people in the 80's and their adventures throughout a New Year's Eve. By one-quarter into the film, you probably had 200 reasons not to continue watching "200 Cigarettes." The screenplay was definitely up in smoke. And to waste the talents of talented actors- Christina Ricci, Paul Rudd, Ben Affleck, and Courtney Love was like a throwing away a good stogie to smoke. "200 cigarettes" is definitely a film for the no looking section. ** Needs Improvement
