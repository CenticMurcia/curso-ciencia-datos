Nothing about this movie is exciting or clear; not the scenes, the characters, the plot line even. There is no characterization, no buy in to the folks who are a part of the "lost world". I can enjoy most any movie but this was difficult to even look at for the duration. Even for fans of b-grade fantasies or science fiction this movie does not provide entertainment. It was difficult to understand who the characters were or what was transpiring. The acting was flat or actually nonexistent as really 'acting' per se was absent. Additionally the special effects were cheesy and limited to say the least, reminding me of 1950's Japanese horror flicks.
