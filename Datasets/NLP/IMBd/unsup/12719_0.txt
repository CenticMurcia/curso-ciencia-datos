So here goes: <br /><br />Salma is one of my favorite actresses, she has great talent, while Russell Crowe is my least favorite actor next to Tom Cruise. I decided to watch the movie in spite of Crowe. I saw him on James Limpton and he was such a pompous ass, totally in love with himself. I've never understood why he's considered a great actor. He has, though, been in some good movies.<br /><br />What I did like about this movie (besides watching Salma) was the style and editing. I liked the way the director filmed the sex, the arguments, the trashing of the apartments and the black and white thing. <br /><br />Perhaps I would have enjoyed this movie if it hadn't reminded me of a couple of stupid relationships I had a million years ago.<br /><br />But the characters in this movie should just stick to having great sex and quit wasting time trying to communicate with each other in any other manner.<br /><br />They annoyed me so much I wanted to smack 'em! <br /><br />I am sorry I wasted my time watching this movie and I advise you not to waste yours.
