how to lose a guy is an original story, which is well-acted, very smart and very very funny. i found myself laughing out loud many many times. I think its one of the best romantic comedies of all time. I would encourage buying the movie: great for parties or anytime you want to good laugh. I quite enjoyed this movie actually. I didn't intend to see it but i'm not sorry i did. I like romantic comedies but the past couple of years they've been pretty disappointing & plain stupid + i'm not big on Matthew McConaughey. The main reason why i liked the movie is definitely Kate Hudson! She's so adorable & hilariously funny in the movie. Definitely the star. Matthew did a good job i guess, but i still don't particularly like him a lot. The story is original, the jokes are really funny & there's real chemistry between the main characters! Unfortunately it's just a chick-flick that will be forgotten pretty soon. But at least it's a romantic comedy with a real heart!<br /><br />Entertainment Score: 9.9/10<br /><br />Overall: 9.85/10
