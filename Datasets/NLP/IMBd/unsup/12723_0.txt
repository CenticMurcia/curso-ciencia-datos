... Was my initial reaction but BREAKING UP is a bit of a turkey . To all intents and purposes this is an inferior WHEN HARRY MET SALLY for a younger generation . It`s episodic and never feels convincing , but the worst criticism I have is that the two stars never shine on screen . Maybe if Crowe`s character beat up a few people while all Salma`s scenes revolved lying on top of that body builder in the gym it would have been more watchable ?
