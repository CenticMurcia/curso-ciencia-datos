This movie has three things seriously wrong with it.<br /><br />1. The dialog is juvenile, evidently intended for kids in the 12 to 16 age group. It seems like every sentence included at least 3 curse words. Apparently the writers were handicapped when it came to vocabulary.<br /><br />2. The movie does not make use of Jack Nicholson's talents. He is upstaged throughout the movie by inferior actors.<br /><br />3. The movie has a very poor ending. Most of the characters get shot within the last few minutes, and then the screen says "The End." Nothing was decided.
