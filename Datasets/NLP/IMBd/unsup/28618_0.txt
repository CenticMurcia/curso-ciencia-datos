...than the ID card, at least in this time and place. Milan's ownership of one and Kenan's lack thereof fuel the plot to have Kenan disguise himself as a woman so he won't have to 'show his credentials' and get himself summarily shot.<br /><br />The combination of 10% cinema and historical genocide makes for a tense and edgy ride, especially when the new 'couple' is welcomed home and a wedding is performed. Not much affection is seen between the characters as everyone is on a war-footing, with an all-pervasive fear coloring everyone's actions. The love triangle that later develops does not end well, as so few do. The lives of the characters does not improve, nor do we expect it to based on the sad and tragic history of the heirs to Yugoslavia's breakup.<br /><br />Perhaps my favorite moment is when Milan's father Ljubo states that they just should get rid of the Serbs. And the Croats. And the Bosnians. So then "decent people could enjoy this beautiful country".<br /><br />A pretty good watch and a great statement on peoples' rights, regardless of gender, orientation, or ethnicity.
