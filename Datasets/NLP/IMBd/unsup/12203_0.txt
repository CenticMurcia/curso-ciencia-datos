I can truly say this is one of the greatest movies i have seen in a long time. It made me laugh and cry numerous times. Im not the usual crying type, but this movie really moved me. I recommend it to everyone! This is truly a must see movie for the whole family to enjoy or for a romantic time with your spouse.
