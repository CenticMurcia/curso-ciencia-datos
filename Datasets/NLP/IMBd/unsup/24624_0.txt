This "telefilm" starring Jeff Goldblum is simply amazing. The acting (even among the supporting cast) is top-notch, and the realism of the battlefield and of the characters make "War Stories" even more impressive. At a uncertain time such as we're living in now, it's refreshing to see a program take a chance and make us think about journalistic integrity, what are government is doing, and whether or not they're right in doing what they do.<br /><br />However, to give NBC the credit I think is misleading. It's easy to see that this "telefilm" was meant as a pilot. "War Stories" was originally intended to be a series, but NBC chickened out when they thought it was "too risky" to make a program about real life issues and make the audience think for more than 2 seconds. However, the pilot was already made, so "might as well" just air it.<br /><br />Coulda been a good show. Shoulda been a good show. Woulda been a good show...
