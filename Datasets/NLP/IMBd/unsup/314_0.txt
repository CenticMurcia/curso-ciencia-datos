Contemporary releases in sci-fi/horror genre prove that rich Hollywood filmmakers are running out of ideas. This film is really an excellent example of how you can do a great job with almost no money.<br /><br />The greatest thing in Screamers is that there is a message in it. It's just a way the real art should be - it should make people think, dream, use their imagination and not only consume the finished and totally digested pieces of information. And I think not many expensive Hollywood productions (especially sci-fi) are successful in this regard.<br /><br />So, for instance, the idea that someone who looks human, can be a rusted dead machine inside and you can never say who's who judging from their appearance. Or the forsaken soldiers who sacrifice their lives in a pointless war, which was forgotten by the governments who started it. Blood is cheaper than raw materials - this is also reflecting the main principles of our life today.<br /><br />In my opinion you mustn't have one million explosions or world-famous stars in a movie to make it good. It's just a good story, an appropriate atmosphere and some really well done acting to make it good. And in my opinion Screamers has all these elements.
