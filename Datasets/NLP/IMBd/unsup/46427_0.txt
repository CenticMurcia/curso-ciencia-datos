I was not barely able to sit and watch this version.I tried to find something good till the end of the film and I didn't get it,but something upset.The production should be better than of what I had seen.Liz Taylor was a special cast but the weak script and production pulled everything down.Watch the original has been enough! The episodes were good stories.Some of them couldn't be forgotten with tears in my eyes during watching a friendship between Fred and Barney,,,,Great!!!
