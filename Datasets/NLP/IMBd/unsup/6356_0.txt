I bought "Dracula Vs. Frankenstein" on DVD under the Troma digitally remastered release of some of Al Adamson's "classics" (such as "Satan's Sadists" and "The Blood of Ghastly Horror"). I'm somewhat of a fan of B-quality horror pictures if -- and only if -- they are entertaining (like Ed Wood's work). This one is pretty entertaining... but makes up for itself in way of how astonishingly brain-numbing the storyline is (or lack thereof). Inept? Yes. Continuity gaps galore? Yep. Uneven and absurd? Oh, yeah! I haven't seen the movie in a couple of years, so I can't do too good of a job explaining the storyline... then again, even if I saw it ten seconds ago, I don't think I could explain it. If you're thinking this movie is a battle of two great Universal Studio monsters, well... you're wrong. Dracula looks EXACTLY like Screech off of Saved by the Bell and Frankenstein looks like a hybrid mixture of a Cabbage Patch Doll and an actual farm cabbage.<br /><br />The epic battle of monsters isn't until the end of the film, which wasn't even worth the long, long wait. Simply put, the battle goes as follows: Dracula and Frankenstein are in the woods. Dracula easily pulls off Frankenstein's arms as if they were bolted on with Legos. Then, if memory serves me right, Dracula pulls off Frankenstein's head just as easily. Dracula realizes the sun is about to rise and he makes a fruity run to his castle... but before he can even make it to the door, he's fried by daylight right on his welcome mat! So, basically, the ending is a cinematic train wreck.<br /><br />The movie is amazingly uneven and often feels like a different sci-fi or horror movie every 10 minutes. The first 7/8 of the movie really isn't about anything other than a couple of people running away from Dracula and his magical death lighting bolt ring which lights people on fire... And there's some sort of weird-science thing at a Coney Island haunted house ride that involves a midget getting killed by an ax, some strange scientist and a couple naked women.<br /><br />I dunno... I don't get it.<br /><br />Funny movie, but I don't think anyone will really like it unless they're a fan of schlock.<br /><br />3/10
