This was a clever piece of writing and was full of imagination (something I always like.) Billie Piper and David Tennant did another fantastic way of making everything so believable and real. The thing I liked most about this episode was the way they finished it. Usually the only way to stop a monster is by shooting it, or finding a code that'll make them have their emotions back, where as this one was just taking away the nightmare with a song.<br /><br />This episode also proved what a strong character Rose really is, and how far she has come from being just an ordinary young girl to being the doctor's side kick.<br /><br />That's all I am gonna say on this, but I just want to ask, has anyone else noticed that the inside of the tardis looks a bit like the outside of a dalek?.....
