I am very interested in the history of the Native American Indian and I found this DVD to be a profound and moving record. The acting was superb throughout but especially by Eddie Spears, August Schellenberg and an actor I particularly admire Michael Greyeyes. The accompanying music was fantastic. I found the Directors comments about each scene fascinating, especially the information regarding Edward Curtis the well known photographer. I am a photographer myself and could relate to the methods used in the film to create a sepia effect and short depth of field. I know I will Play this film over and over again and each time will find something new.
