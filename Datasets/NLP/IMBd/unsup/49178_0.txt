They say that horror film series like these tend to deteriorate after the first film, and this is exactly what Scream does. After the magnificent opener, the above average sequel, we now have a lame third flick. I have many problems with this film.***SPOILERS AHEAD***<br /><br />*Randy is supposed to be dead. But they can't help sneaking him in anyway, on a prerecorded tape to explain "the rules".<br /><br />*While these rules are clearly spelled out- its the last movie,so anything can happen, and anyone can die, the movie proceeds to ignore them completely. I was waiting to see which of the main characters would die. But none of them did. Also, the killer is supposed to be almost superhuman because its the last film. But I seem to remember it being harder to kill the guys in Scream 1 than this guy.<br /><br />*The killer himself, is a minor character until the end, when he is revealed. You shouldn't have to think twice, and say "Who?" when the killer is revealed. (I thought they would have learned their lesson from Scream 2 about this one.)<br /><br />It's all to samey for my liking, although I did like the bit at the end, which pushed postmodernism to new extremes......I wonder if they'll get divorced too.
