Having been a fan of all things ridiculous from a very young age, I couldn't believe my eyes when one evening a friend and I sat down to watch some trashy horror rubbish and what greeted us was this. 'Nude For Satan', the title sounded good, and from the opening where we witness a car crash nearby a mysterious, remote castle we were captivated!<br /><br />From there on Luigi Batzella draws us into his fantastical, horrifying, bizarre world where things are not as they seem. The setting is gorgeous, with our protagonists (Dr. William Benson and a young lady, Susan) wandering the strange grounds, but something is not quite right, as the characters meet up again they seem to no longer know each other. From here on they are thrust into a twisted reality of dopplegangers, giant spiders, nudity and Evil!<br /><br />This is a film that will change your perspective on the medium forever, alter your perception of filmic conventions and one which will stick with you for many years to come! A truly essential surrealist picture!<br /><br />Open your mind to 'Nude for Satan'!<br /><br />7/10
