This movie offers nothing new. Technically, it is well made, but the plot seems contrived and the tension wears out as you see the two sides continuously escalating for no real reason - predictably, the protagonist discovers the simple truth and is repeatedly frustrated in his attempts to communicate it. This blocking is obviously just a plot device to heighten tension and anxiety in the audience. But it just becomes tedious.<br /><br />If you'd like to watch a movie with the underlying threat of a nuclear Armageddon, perhaps you should try "The Hunt for Red October".<br /><br />Rating 3/10 (Just for the effects and the attempts at acting)
