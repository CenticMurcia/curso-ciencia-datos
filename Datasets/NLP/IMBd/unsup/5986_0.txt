I watched this film many times as a kid in the late 1970's on late night TV. Robert Quarry co-produced this venture after the unexpected and phenomenal success of the two "Count Yorga" features, but it did not hold up to expectation at the box-office. I highly recommend watching this period piece, if you can find it. It is extremely hard to find anywhere.
