I'm not one who goes in much for direct-to-cable to direct-to-video flicks, because there's usually a significant reason why it wasn't released in theaters--and usually a very good one. But I saw the previews for this movie and they sold a previewed copy of it for 5 bucks, so I decided to take a try at it. Even for 5 bucks, I got gypped...heavily.<br /><br />Emilio Estevez is a fairly good actor, and he's good at what he does, as long as the script is right. He seems to be extremely bored in every scene of this movie. And I like Steven Weber. He's a talented comic actor, I thought he was terrific in Sour Grapes. I even liked him on Wings, he has a great, unique way of delivering comic dialogue. He was totally wasted in this role.<br /><br />The whole film has this dark, unpleasant aura which makes it impossible to enjoy. It all centers around drug use and prostitution and things like that. It's like if Taxi Driver tried to be a comedy. This movie does try, but very little, in very cheap doses. I mean, there's an erotic dance scene between Leah Lail and her hooker partner, and even that was boring. That's how dull the atmosphere of this whole movie is.
