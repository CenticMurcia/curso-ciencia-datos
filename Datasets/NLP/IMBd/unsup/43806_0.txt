An absolute waste of time. This kind of movie reminds me of the late 70's early 80's American movies. A lot of violence some cool stunts and lots of stuff blowing up. The main thing is that they forgot about passable dialog (Some loss in translation too I imagine) it is just plain embarrassing. I imagine in about 20 some years or so their films will actually have a decent story w/the cool fight sequences. But until then the Weinstein brothers will continue to bring these pretty stupid films to other Audiences other than just the Thai nation. I am probably being harsh, but just like all kinds of white rappers showed up after Eminem took the world by storm, so has some other wannabes trying to become the next Tony Jaa, (even though his success here in the states has at the very least been limited) Granted this kid did O.K. but I doubt anything will translate to money in the future. I imagine if I was 12 and had never done martial arts myself, I would think this was just the best. But just as I thought "Karate Kid" was amazing when I was a kid (I laugh at the lameness of the fight sequences now) I imagine most adults will laugh at just about everything in this film. Oh if you do decide to jump into these murky movie waters, whatever you do, either mute the English dubbing (it's some of the worst I have ever heard, especially in this day and age)or listen to the Thai track and read the subtitles. Yes the dubbing is that bad, and the generic Rock music is torture too.
