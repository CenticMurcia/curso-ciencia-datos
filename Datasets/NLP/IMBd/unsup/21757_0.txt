Well, maybe it wasn't actually long as it seemed. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen.<br /><br />In reading some of the high reviews of this movie, perhaps those people are intellectuals or movie critics looking for something other than what I would look for.<br /><br />I'm just an average Joe, watching a movie to be entertained - not particularly looking for the higher message. This movie totally missed the mark for me. I didn't understand what the point was, and cannot fathom how others rated this highly.<br /><br />Although I have noticed that it seems that almost every movie on IMDb has a rating in the 7s... It makes no sense to me that a movie this dumb would get such a high rating.....<br /><br />Anyway, I don't recommend this movie.
