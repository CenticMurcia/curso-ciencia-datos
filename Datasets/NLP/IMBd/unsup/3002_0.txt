The humor is great in it. Bill Murray's character was hilarious, one of his best I believe, he's a self-centered wretched old man. Owen Wilson did a great job in this film as well, his character's sensitive, and thoughtful personality is very heartwarming. The relationship between Owen Wilson and Bill Murray is great. Their "chemistry" throughout the movie is what gets the most laughs, along with Willem Dafoe's character that is also very comical. I didn't like Cate Blanchett in this movie very much, i'm not sure why. Funny animation throughout the movie. This is my favorite Wes Anderson movie, the humor is great, and the casting was as well. No one could have played Steve better than Bill Murray, same with Willem Dafoe and Owen Wilson.
