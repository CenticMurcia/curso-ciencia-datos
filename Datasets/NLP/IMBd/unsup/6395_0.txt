Oh my. I watched the film about a fortnight after I read the book. Amazing? Oh I was amazed indeed. Other than some nice photography shots, the film lack intensely. I place the book on my top 5 without a doubt. The film however...I'm not one to compare a book to it's film because they are two different mediums and are not meant for comparison, however for any of you who desire to see this film I suggest you step back with your hands out and get the book instead. Enough satisfaction will be found there. Horrible cinematography, BAD ACTING...holy crap! Alex is the sociopath with no emotion...NOT EVERYONE ELSE. And excessive nudity. I have no problem with nudity, if it is done tastefully and necessarily. This film did none of the above. Loved the eye lashes though ;)
