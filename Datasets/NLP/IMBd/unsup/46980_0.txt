as aposed to what many people think this is not the sequel to Ninja Scroll. even though the characters names are the same they look nothing alike, it isn't the same person.<br /><br />to the review. I hated this movie. I had to struggle to get through it. for one thing, this kinda stuff really happened. stuff as in the Christians being killed by the Japanese. they took a real historical event and made it into a very fictitious thing. plus it just was a bad movie. it was pointless gore and poinless nudity.<br /><br />1/10
