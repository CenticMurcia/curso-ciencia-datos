Yes I love The Wedding Singer. In fact it ranks among my favorite movies ever. I love this not so much for the story line, although Sandler and Barrymore are adorable together in this but rather the hysterical return to life in the 80's. Since I am a child of the 80's(and retain many a fond memory of that time period) every time I watch this movie it brings me back. This movie is best watched among a group of your closest 80's friends. It is a comedy classic and my only beef with it is it makes me miss the 80's so much! <br /><br />Basically, I love this movie! Nothing more nothing less. Wedding Singer is among my top 20 favorite movies ever-one of the best comedies and GREAT music as well! The best of the eighties music(and I do count "you spin me round" as one of them!) This movie pays tribute to a great time period and retains a place in my heart as both sweet/sentimental and roll on the floor funny. Watch it if you haven't, you will be hysterical. Oh man do I miss the 80's!!!!
