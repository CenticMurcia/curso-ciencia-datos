This movie expresses in a very special and interesting way what a passionate love can achieve. The strength of a men who stick to his ideal regardless to the fact that it may cost him life. The conviction of a woman who strongly believe in redemption. The corrupted side of politics which exists since it was born. All this is mixed in a tale that, despite of its slow pace, makes you want remain in your chair desiring for a happy final that you know has no place in the story. The widow of Saint-Pierre can be regarded as one of the best French movies of all times. Excellent photography. Beautiful colors. Reasonable plot. Do not miss it 8 out 10.
