When I first heard about this movie, I thought that the plot sounded humorous, a war with canada could be pretty interesting. But instead, I saw ugly stereotypes of americans, (isn't moore american?) viciously insulting portrayals of our military (rip torn in the idiotic role of a warhawk general)and bland, predictable humor. I was shocked at how americans were shown as gun toting, moronic, bloodthirsty simpletons, who like to pick fights with people. I also could not believe the manner in which the military was made fun of. I think that Moore should remember that if it weren't for the brave men & women that serve our country, his freedom to abuse the first amendment would not be so free. Maybe I am overreacting, but I found this movie insulting and degrading, and made me lose all respect for michael moore
