What a terrible film, i think Jackie Chan's sons career has ended before it even began. He's just retarded in comparison to his father, uglier, has no style, has no ability, is more sickening rather than cute... Storyline was awful. The twins although looking good, just don't make up for the poor movie, unfunny comedy scenes, strange characters for the given actors. I dunno whether the storyline was supposed to be funny or serious in that fact that the evil queen was turning men to women... a wasted all start cast in a flop of a movie. Worth watching just to see how bad it is. The movie looked fun to make, but it sure was no fun to watch.
