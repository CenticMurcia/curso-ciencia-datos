Like Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho," "Pulp Fiction" is a great film. This movie is to Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs what "Slumber Party Massacre 2" is to Psycho. It is a sad attempt to remake the whole "cool and tough criminals kill bad guys in a really cool and tough fashion while saying cool and tough one-liners" genre. Unfortunately, it lacks all originality and the script is far from clever. Every character is one-dimensional; the so-called organized criminals are just a bunch of morons who get slaughtered in their hundreds by two meat packers from Southie. Meanwhile, entire scenes are lifted from Pulp Fiction: the cat accidentally being killed (paralleling Marvin's unfortunate fate in Pulp Fiction), the bible quotes before executions, and the constant oh-so-cleverly random conversations that don't come close to stuff Tarantino probably wrote in Grade school. By the way, the acting sucks. Finally, the message that it's good for vigilantes to kill the brainless ethnic stereotypes that pass for mafiosi in this movie (as well as random guys at a strip club; I guess they're criminal scum as well) whenever they feel like it will appeal to armchair suburbanites scared of those big city lowlifes whom they've heard about on the news--it will seem ludicrous to anyone else. Skip this and throw on "Air Bud 2: Golden Receiver"... or practically anything else you can think of.
