I have never been a fan of Scream, but I'm going to give credit to it for being a semi-original idea in it's time. Now over ten years later, Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon does the exact same thing that Scream did and everyone thinks it's oh-so-original because it copies the same formula. That's about the equivalent of saying: "If you were nonconforming too, you'd be just like me." The premise of interviewing a slasher villain is nothing different from Man Bites Dog, then the movie just uses the exact same jokes and plot points as Scream. EXACT. This has to be in one of the top 250 unoriginal movies of all time because there is not a single thing that Scott Glosserman thought of himself.<br /><br />If unoriginality is the first major flaw of Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon, the second major flaw is just as annoying. The predictability. About 15 minutes in I already figured out the remainder of the plot, including what some people will loosely call the plot twist in the middle. It's just paradoxical that while this movie tried to make clich√©s laughable, it falls into every one of them at least once without noticing. Now that is something to laugh at, not the lame jokes.<br /><br />The acting is iffy. Leslie himself, as some have mentioned, it a total pansy and doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as the villains he compares himself to. Some of his jokes are smile-worthy, but that doesn't take the edge off the utterly boring moments where the camera sits and stares at a wall with nothing happening. Or the boring conversation scenes.<br /><br />Another thing that really bothered me was the lack of any gore whatsoever. Every scene when something even mildly violent happens, the camera is looking at the floor or the wall or someone's face. I've seen countless PG-13 movies with more blood. This is supposed to be a parody of the slasher genre, yet it shows no slashing. Am I really the only one who has a problem with that? <br /><br />Overall, Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon added nothing new or original to the better parodies out there. It can't stand on it's own two feet, so to speak, and it has the entertainment value and thrill of watching a dead tree rot. What a sad waste of movie rights.<br /><br />1/10
