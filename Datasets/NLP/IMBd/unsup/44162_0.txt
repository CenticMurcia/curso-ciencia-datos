Simply put, there are only two reasons why I got to see this to the end. One, it's one of those flicks where they purposely don't show the creature until the very end (we're talking, 20 minutes left in the movie). And two, Cerina Vincent has great legs. Other than that, this is a REALLY weird movie. It's very disarticulated, there are scenes that just seem completely random -- Cerina having flashbacks about the car accident in which she killed her friend Jules, the Native American professor dude who seems to know everything about the creature, the scenes with Cerina's boy-toy who tries to take her mind off Jules (and who promptly gets decapitated by the creature about halfway through the movie). The movie moves very slowly, which made my mind wander (did I mention Cerina Vincent has great legs?) And the monster looks like the younger sister of the monster from "Jeepers Creepers." "It Waits" is not a horrible movie, but don't expect to be scared out of your wits, or glued to your TV. Only Cerina brings this movie up to a 4.
