The Master of Suspense proves himself to be a pretty good craftsman of comedy in this entertaining yarn about the trouble caused by a corpse in a small New England community. There are terrific performances from Forsythe as an eccentric artist, Gwenn and Natwick as a couple of old-timers who strike up a romance on account of the corpse, and, in her film debut, MacLaine as the wife of the corpse. And Jerry Mathers as the Beaver-like son of MacLaine. Initially, as the characters are introduced, the comedy seems to be forced but it soon gets on a roll and offers plenty of laughs. The country setting is beautifully photographed and Herrmann, in his first collaboration with Hitchcock, provides a nice score.
