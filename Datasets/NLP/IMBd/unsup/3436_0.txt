Nice love comedy which examines love commitment and betrayal problems.Good performances by lead actors and a good showcase here for Avital.Nothing spectacular but delivers it's genre promises.The film could have used better screenplay, directing,cinematography,script and editing.Most Schwimmer fans will be satisfied.......
