At least Sir Alfred Hitchcock knew early on that comedies weren't his forte, and that thrillers and mysteries were where his strengths had lied. This film was completely unfunny, and I don't think it's just 50's sensibilities not working in the 21st century. I enjoy many of Hitchcock's films, and Vertigo is probably in my All-Time Top 20. But this is probably the worst Hitchcock movie I've ever seen. John Forsythe was so bad and unfunny that he was actually annoying and irritating. The only positives I can say about this film is that it had beautiful Vermont scenery, and it was fun to see Shirley McLaine in her first movie, as well as Jerry Mathers before he made it big on "Leave it to Beaver"!
