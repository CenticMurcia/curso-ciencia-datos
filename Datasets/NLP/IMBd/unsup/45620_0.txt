All the beautiful cinematography in the world could not save this movie. It wanted desperately to be a legitimate spy thriller, however the best "enemy" it could muster was to fight against a bank. Alright, so in reality banks do fund wars, but instead of teasing out who was behind everything and letting us and the character work out what they're up to, less than half an hour in, Calivini explains absolutely everything we need to know. WHAT? This is not how thrillers work at all. I was not thrilled or on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />The acting was at best average. There was no character development at all. This is probably the scriptwriter's fault rather than the actors, though, as the the pace of the plot really didn't allow for the characterisations to be expanded upon. The unnecessary traveling around was nice to look at, but at the detriment of having a well structured plot. How convenient the assassin just happens to fly to New York. How convenient that Umberto Calivari will see you right away and explain everything you need to investigate. The plot was full of these kind of things which other thrillers force the characters to use their ingenuity to uncover. These characters just got handed information on a silver platter and pulled out their passport.<br /><br />The worst aspect of the movie was the fact we had an Interpol agent and an Assistant District Attorney from Manhattan as our heroes. WHYYYYYY. They have absolutely no authority, jurisdiction or resources to be gallivanting around Europe. The part where Naomi Watt's character is all "Fuck protocol" was hilarious because that's what they'd been doing the entire movie. I think the scriptwriters were trying to be creative by not merely having an MI6 and a CIA agent working together, but what they decide fell so horribly flat. Their justification for Naomi Watt's character being there was so horrible tenuous, it reflected the lack of development and depth of the entire movie. <br /><br />Poor effort.
