Yea sorry folks, but this movie did absolutely nothing for me. A friend of mine told me it wasn't half bad and I expected a good story and figured these actors would not have taken the role if it were bad. I was wrong on all accounts because the story left a lot to be desired, I mean If I had cared about the characters a bit more perhaps I would've like it.<br /><br />Paltrow plays this girl who has taken care of her father for the last few years. Her father (played by Hopkins) was a one time mathematical genius who went crazy. Taking care of her father has made her give up on a lot of her dreams including dropping out of college and she becomes a bit of a headcase herself. One of her father's admirers (Gyllenhaal) wants to go through his memoirs and writing in hopes of finding some sort of amazing proof. <br /><br />Going through his work he finds himself getting closer to the truth and closer to proof that the craziness his teacher had was heretic and that insanity and genius are separated by a very fine line.<br /><br />This movie was a nice change of pace from everything being spoon-fed to us in the theaters these days. I watched it and didn't hate it, but it was rather boring and even for a drama it still was a major let down. I cannot recommend it to anyone, the actors were great and that's about the nicest thing I can say about it, but these actors should've picked better roles and spared us all the load of crap that this movie is.
