The movie was entertaining but there is one scene staged at a reception where a group of girls are playing in the background. I found the music haunting and couldn't get it out of my head for days.<br /><br />I checked IMDb and found others had asked the same question but found no replies. So for those still searching, here is the answer.<br /><br />The group is a string quartet called "BOND" consisting of four girls who are real hot, both in looks and talent. They're based in England. Their most recent CD is called "Explosion" and contains the track called "Victory" which is what BOND was playing in the reception scene of the movie. "Explosion" is a dual CD/DVD containing 12 music tracks and 3 videos of the girls so you can get a look at them performing.<br /><br />I've since bought their DVD of "BOND Live in Concert at the Royal Albert Hall" and it is fantastic. To see their website, do a search on "BONDMUSIC".<br /><br />The movie's reception scene doesn't do BOND justice. They're a whole lot better than the brief appearance given them.
