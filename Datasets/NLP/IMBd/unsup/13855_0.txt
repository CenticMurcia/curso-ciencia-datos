This musical from 1959 is a lot of fun. The music is particularly good and the dancing is first-class. Younger people, however, may not enjoy the movie, as it is not at all politically correct and reflects a time, the 1950s, that many of us who lived through it recall with great fondness. I'd give it seven stars out of ten.
