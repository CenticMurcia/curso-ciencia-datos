Little Witches is about a group of mermaids who go on a perilous journey in search of The Dork of Moby. A legendary whale bone that is said to have magical powers which gives any nautical creature the ability to breath on land while it's in their possession. Early their adventure, the girls encounter a great white shark named, Steven Spielberg. Steven Spielberg seems to be a docile creature who is charitable enough to act as their guardian during the trek, but as the members of the squadron of mermaids begin to disappear one by one, they realize Steven Spielberg has ulterior motives after they spot a mermaid scale stuck between two of Steven Spielberg's teeth. So they are forced to make an escape from the blood thirsty predator with a taste for mer-people with the help of a sea turtle named Cloud Strife, an octopus named Simon Belmont, a jumbo shrimp named Shinobi, and a manatee named Rosie O'Donnell, who they met while taking part amateur night of an oceanic strip club called Flippers, in the Arctic regions in order to earn some extra clams for their journey. All & All, I can say without a doubt that this film was better than Citizen Kane, The Godfather II, & Pulp Fiction combined. The Oscar winning performance given by Mimi Rose put Vivien Leigh, Meryl Steep, & Hillary Duff to shame. So if you love heartfelt stories that doesn't have nudity, cursing, pagan rituals, or fat chicks, that the whole family can sit down and watch while you visit your Alzheimer's stricken grandmother in the spare no expense, rest home of luxury you put her in... then this is the film for you. Pope Judas Nixon over & out!
