C'mon, this film is ridiculous. Lots of full frontal nudity but very light on the plot. I guess they hope you don't notice that the actors can't act (lots of long pause, think bad porn), that the plot is non-existent and the ending doesn't make sense. Cazzo Productions is the producer of hard core gay porn for All Worlds Video in the U.S. They've been making porn for so long that the idea of a straight boy in prison falling head over heels in love with the first guy he meets makes sense. And the language thing (jumping from English to German and back in the same conversation) shows very bad direction and made things even less believable. Skip this film. Rent regular gay porn where you know you get bad acting but real sex. Catch up on your reading or sleeping. Watch Oz. But whatever you do, don't watch this piece of trash.
