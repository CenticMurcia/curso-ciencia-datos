"Spy hard" moves in the well-known "Nielsen-comedy-style"(if such thing exists).It is a parody of well known movies.And some of them are good.So far,so good.However such a movie must have something more than this:the parody-scenes should be connected some way to each other or else the movie is nothing but a collage of scenes.And "Spy Hard" belongs in this category.<br /><br />Rating: 2 / 10.
