Any time I get a couple hours, I pull out the now well worn videotape and enjoy myself. God I am so glad that a DVD is now available. Anyway I wanted to comment on the idea that Tideman/Owens CAUSED the event. I saw a couple references to additional information in the book form, but as for the movie what I got was not that Tideman/Owens CAUSED the event but rather that once the chain of events was initiated he was obligated to made sure that Laskey got on the ship at exactly the right time. (" Our departure was delayed two days at the request of your mysterious Mr. Tideman.") See where I'm going with this? We don't know if we're seeing the first incident, the second, or the hundredth. Once it started it must occur as before. In order for the events to unfold correctly (from Tidemans viewpoint) he must delay the ship or (speculating now)the ship would go back to December 4th 1941, they would miss the rondeview with the survivors of Sen. Chapman's yacht, and he would miss meeting Miss Scott. If they left later, then the attack force would have reached Pearl Harbor in time and messed up history. Meting Laural would certainly be motivation in itself, cuz Kate Ross was still a doll at the time of the movies' production. Sorry if this has been discussed before, I did look.
