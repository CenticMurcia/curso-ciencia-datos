While I love the Star Wars universe, as well as independent film, but even understanding that this was clearly a labour of love created by fans, that doesn't exempt it from criticism. And good lord is there a lot to criticize.<br /><br />Acting. I can honestly say I've seen high-school productions with better skilled actors/actresses than what I was subjected to in this short. I won't make some retarded comment about the actors' physical appearances or aesthetic visual qualities, as honestly that sort of idiocy is completely irrelevant (not to mention infantile). What I will comment on is the fact that there really was no acting in this short, merely people reading lines without even an amateur understanding of the craft itself. I could barely manage to sit through the entire thing without having to fight the urge to turn it off every 5 minutes.<br /><br />Writing. While the plot itself was passable, the dialogue is "Lucas-esque" in it's quality level. Don't misunderstand though, that's not a compliment. Combined with the acting skills of the cast, the result is nothing short of a train wreck and could quite readily be used as a case study in how not to make a film.<br /><br />The one redeeming factor is in the visual effects area (specifically in the realm of CGI). It's quite good considering the quality level of everything else in this short. It's certainly not professional level, but could easily be used as a showcase for portfolio material (especially in the rigging and motion criteria).<br /><br />Overall, I have to give the people involved in this short a hearty pat on the back for effort, especially when you consider the amount of time and effort that they obviously put forth to make something of this nature (something not many can lay claim to). At the same time, time and effort do not equate to quality nor praise when the result is what looks more like a garage play put on by children in capes (with impressive CG).<br /><br />Sadly, this short is only marginally worse than episodes 1-3.<br /><br />FB
