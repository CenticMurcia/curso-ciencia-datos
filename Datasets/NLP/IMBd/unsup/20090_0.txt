First off this movie was not quite as awful as some are saying. For a movie in general it is 2 stars, but for horror cheese (a guilty pleasure of mine) it is more like 4 stars. It had the potential to be more, but was not. Okay now let the ripping and spoiling begin! This film has big problems with continuity and creature effects (two big no no's in monster/horror cheese films). An electrical short that happens during flight does not explain creature transformation. I love the fact that Jennifer Hill's character is running around the entire time in very thin material and no one gives her a jacket. Hill is attractive, but personally I thought Noelle Reno was much more attractive and she gives a darn good performance that stands out in this film, showing that she has that rare blend of good looks and talent. Hill, Harmon Walsh and most of cast deliver decent performances. But, the creature's look and acting were horrible and unneeded. This would have been a better movie if creature killing people was the hot chick she started out to be and not the short circuited, latex, mystic wanna be, walking red eyes commercial she turned into. The avalanche sfx are solid given budget. However the solid acting, lighting, and fine exterior sfx could not make up for bad creature make up and acting, bad acting by scientist, the bad ending (he's dead), and the major continuity flaws. All in all it's a moderately enjoyable horror slice of cheese - you could do much worse and you can do a Whole Lot Better!
