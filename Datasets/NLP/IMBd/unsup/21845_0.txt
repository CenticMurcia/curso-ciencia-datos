This film is a great final chapter to the Dracula 2000 series. Jason Scott Lee is as good as ever as Uffizi, Jason London is cool as hell as Luke, Rutger Hauer proves that Buffy The Vampire Slayer was not his best and is great as Dracula (although I still would have loved to see Gerard Butler return from Dracula 2000). Diane Neal is sexy as hell as Elizabeth, but one wishes she was more willing to do nudity for the final orgy. Alexandra Westcourt was very good as Julie and has a super chemistry with Jason Scott Lee that makes him more human. Patrick Lussier's direction was as great as ever, I'd love to see his take on The Crow mythology :) The additional characters were also great in this film, the two vampires during the opening and the two procurers in particular were awesomely performed! All in all, it is a perfect ending to the series with lots of action, nudity, and gore to please many :)
