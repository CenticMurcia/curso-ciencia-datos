This film is silly, okay, but it's also extremely funny and entertaining! If you liked the various 'Airplane' and 'Naked Gun' spoof, this movie's for you, even if it comes from Germany! So the seven dwarfs are not small, they're grown up men who escaped from women and civilization, and hid in the woods. Everything's fine, until Snow White arrives there, escaping from a nasty queen (Nina Hagen!) that wants to get rid of her. It does not hurt that Snow White is quite a lovely good looking brunette, just about to turn 18... again, if you ever happen to get hold of this film, watch it and you won't be disappointed, it's a good one hour and a half of fun. I have no idea if it will be dubbed or subtitled around the world, but its humor is definitely universal, so don't be scared by its country of origin, Germany! You'll get 95% of the jokes anyway, and who cares if you miss one or two, when you're already rolling on the floor with laughter?
