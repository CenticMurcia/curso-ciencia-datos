This movie is totally awesome,when i saw this movie first time back in 1995, i thought it was great funny and somewhat strange. I now own the movie on Paramount DVD and it is still awesome not that it should be in the top 200 but a maximum of 7.1. This movie rules and it is along with Wayne's World and Wayne's World 2, the most awesome movies from Paramount of the 1990's.<br /><br />
