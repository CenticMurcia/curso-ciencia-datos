After the excellent "Excalibur" this was a big step down for director Boorman. This could have been an intelligent and moving film about a man who finds his missing son after 10 years adopted by a native tribe in the amazon. But the stuff about the tribe being mystical and in touch with nature is layed on a little too thick. This "noble savage" cliche just substitutes one stereotype for another. And the climactic scene in the brothel was ill-concieved, not to mention the silly Deus Ex Machina ending involving the dam, making the Rain ending in "Dune" seem plausible by comparison. It seems tacked on and lessens the ecological message Boorman was driving home.
