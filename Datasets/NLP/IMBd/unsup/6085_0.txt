BLOOD CREEK (aka TOWN CREEK) is pretty much a mess of a movie - in more ways than expected. But at least this very minor effort by Joel Schumacher continues his tradition of introducing fine lads to the screen in hopes of launching a career (Colin Farrell in TIGERLAND is a typical example). The story/screenplay by David Kajganich tries very hard to be substantial (Viking runes were left in about eight farms and the Nazi's preoccupation with the occult made them spend years tacking them down - the runes being a means toward immortality if you drink the right blood yada yada yada...), but in the end this is just another of the genre as SAW 1 - 6(?), Seven, Silence of the Lambs, Halloween 1 - 5, etc. If lots of blood and crazy behavior on a farm in dark territory inhabited by ageless creatures under the spell of a crazy guy is what rocks your boat, then welcome aboard. <br /><br />The redeeming factor in the movie is the presence of Henry Cavill (of the Tudor series fame and fine actor waiting to be used in some choice roles) and Dominic Purcell. As brothers bent on vengeance they make the most of this plot, giving it as much dignity as could be expected. They deserve better material as they are both fine actors and personalities. So Joel Schumacher can't really be run out of town for this movie - he at least gave the two primary actors the chance for screen time. Only or those who love gore. <br /><br />Grady Harp
