Absolutely nothing says, "I'm your BEST friend.", like sleeping with said friend's estranged husband.<br /><br />It's a scary feeling knowing that this movie is being beamed out via satellite and other civilizations may honestly think that we're the imbeciles that most Lifetime movies portray us to be. I have to go, my best friend's husband is here to pick me up for our romantic weekend in Bali.
