As a fan of Lovecraft I'm always on the look for film adaptations. And now I've seen The Shunned House. And yes, it is a horror movie, horror as in horrible. It's a low (or no) budget, Italian straight to video, with awful actors desperately trying to speak English. It's really boring, utterly confusing, it has little or nothing to do with Lovercraft's work, the music is terrible and to my personal belief Howard is turning over is his grave. Oh yes, you get some cheap gore, but that doesn't make a movie, does it. The thing doesn't even qualify for a B-movie. If you want some good Lovecraft stuff, stick to the classics. The wonderfully dark humored Re-animator, or From Beyond, and more recently Dagon. Just leave Shunned House, its a complete waste of time and money.
