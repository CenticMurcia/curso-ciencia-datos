This was a great mainstream movie with a pop artist in the starring role that had substance. Diana Ross became Billie Holiday. I felt like this is Billie Holiday and this is what she sounds like. I even like some of Diana's versions of some Billie Holiday classics better than the originals. OK, I did have some problems with the script(the script). However, it didn't really take away from the overall movie. A must see. Diana and Billie Dee Williams looked great on screen together. This is probably my favorite African American on screen couple of all time. I thought the movie had a great mix of dramatic scenes mixed with musical numbers and a little comedy (Richard Pryor) to evenly pace this film. Lady Sings the Blues addresses racism without dwelling on the issue or making it bigger than the movie. The movie should also be commended for making Diana Ross equally bad and beautiful within the same movie. She looked and sounded great. Billie Dee Williams and Richard Pryor also gave strong performances. I LOVED Richard Pryor as Piano Man. Great Movie!
