I loved this film! It is very funny especially the scene in the greenhouse. The film has fantastic visuals. The images and scenes from this film have influence so many modern films of today, such as the indoor rollerskating scene. My favorite scenes are the drugged up nymphet delinquent girls and Mastroianni sliding down a huge slide as his sexual history flashes before his eyes. The scene of the drugged girls reminds me of the glitzy 80s music video or a scene from an Argento horror film. Many believe that this film reflects women in a negative light, but I don't think it shows women in all their glory. Mastroianni is perfect in this role and quite beautiful to look at. I highly recommend it!
