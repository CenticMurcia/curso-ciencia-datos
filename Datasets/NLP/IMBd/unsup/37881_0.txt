I thought I had written a review of this travesty of a movie.<br /><br />There was absolutely nothing worthwhile in it . I agree with the last reviewer its too much nose candy.<br /><br />They use a hand held camera to the extreme, I have seen better hand held camera work on "youtube."<br /><br />The acting is second rate by a well known cast.<br /><br />I will not insult them by naming them, same for the director & writer.<br /><br />This was filmed on the beautiful Cayman Islands,It should have been done on the Santa Monica beach, that is how much it looked like the Caymans.<br /><br />Rating * (out of 4) 25 points (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10)
