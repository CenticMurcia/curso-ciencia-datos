I'm not saying this is the best suspense movie I've ever seen, but I was surprised by how well put together this movie was. I've heard so many bad reviews on this movie, I was expecting it to be horrible. I understand why Georgia Rule was said to be bad, because it really was...but this movie was really good! The way they made the color blue a huge statement throughout the whole movie was brilliant. I love movies that you don't get until the very end, and this movie provided that. Lindsey is a very talented actress and plays her roles very well. This movie is actually one of her best. I'm not a big fan of the teenage Herbie and Drama Queen, etc. This role was a good next step in my opinion. I think everyone should go out and see this movie. It was really good. <br /><br />HERE COME THE SPOILERS...<br /><br />1. I can just see Dakota explaining to her new found sister that she slept with her boyfriend, in her room, with her parents in the house.<br /><br />2. Why the hell was the piano teacher the murderer? Was he mad because she had a talent and was throwing it away? That's the only reason I can come up with. Who cares really, the movie made me forget about the killer. I was focused on how it all happened in the first place and the girls.<br /><br />3. Lindsey Lohan playing a stripper? Not a shocker. Lindsey Lohan playing twin sisters that found each other by fate again? I did not see that one coming.
