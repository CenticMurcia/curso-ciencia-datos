I remember staying up late a a year or two ago and aimlessly flipping through the channels on TV. Suddenly I saw a rather shabby looking movie that seemed to be science fiction related, so I stopped and watched. I was amazed at the movie I saw, the original Lathe of Heaven. It did look a bit dated but the story was so good and the ideas so interesting that I forgave it and really loved it. I even had an idea that someone should remake of the film to make it look beautiful and keep the complex story and ideas. When I heard of a remake being made for TV I was excited on what a new version could acomplish. So when I sat down to watch this movie last night I was extremely dissapointed. Yes the movie has modern production values but still it doesn't seem to look very good and could have been directed alot better. Imagine getting a major film director like David Fincher to direct this movie, it would have been beautiful. But even if it would have looked good the story was total wash out. They seemed to make it into a love story and disregard many of the other ideas the original<br /><br />movie tackled. The love story falls completely flat when you put Lukas Haas and Lisa Bonet together, I would agree with others that they have zero chemistry and I found myself gagging when they kissed. She seemed too old for him and although she was good at her part when not romantic with Haas another actress may have been more appropriate. I think now I am resigned to having the original movie remain intact as the true Lathe of Heaven and no one should have tried to remake it, even if their intentions were good. I could only say they should have casted better and used the original movies script instead of trying to make their own vision of the story. Please do not only watch this version and not the original, this is not<br /><br />representative.
