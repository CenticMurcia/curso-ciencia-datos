Final Fantasy VIII, is, as the name suggests, eighth in the phenomenal Final Fantasy series. I won't say it's the best. It's impossible to point to one of these games and say, "THIS is the best one." There's something for everyone in all of them, and someone who adores one may hate another, easily.<br /><br />I will, however, say without shame that this is my favorite Final Fantasy.<br /><br />It's a hit-and-miss game. Either you'll love every aspect of it, or hate every aspect of it. That said, I'll take as objective an approach to this game as I possibly can. So, to the actual review.<br /><br />GRAPHICS: Looking back, with games such as Devil May Cry, Castlevania: Lament of Innocence, and Final Fantasy X to compare it to, VIII's graphics seem a little... square. Literally. But the cutscenes are still absolutely gorgeous, and for the time, this was top-of-the-line. And even looking back, the worlds are still beautiful and the creatures you fight are still realistic-looking (well, as realistic as a giant plant with great big tentacles can be). The somewhat dated graphics of the actual gameplay don't really detract from the rest of the story, though, so I'll still give them a 9/10.<br /><br />GAMEPLAY: Hard to get into, even for players who know the other Final Fantasies. I hate to admit it, but even if you mastered everything about the Materia system of VII, you might still get a headache learning the Junction system. But the rest of the gameplay is easy to understand, and once you get the hang of the Junction system, the game quickly becomes as easy or difficult as you wish. This game is unique in that your characters stats are whatever you want them to be - You set the right magic to the right stat, and make it happen. Or, if you want a challenge, go without. It makes for great fun. The biggest flaw I have with the game is that it's long. It's 4 discs long, and to play the game out fully can take upwards of 60 hours. Not for the faint of heart. But still, 8/10.<br /><br />STORYLINE: This should be a novel. And a movie. One of the most complex plot lines in this series, intriguing and fascinating to no end. You start off as Squall, a young man training to become part of an elite mercenary force, SeeD. From a mission to help a small resistance faction overthrow the government to skipping through time to fight a powerful sorceress, you watch Squall's character open up to his friends, and become a great leader. Absolutely stunning. 10/10.<br /><br />CHARACTERS: The problem I found with VII is that the characters weren't entirely realistic. Not so with VIII. Final Fantasy VIII's characters feel so human, as though you could walk into a bookstore and run into Quistis, or get served at a caf√© by Zell. They're people you'd know, and over the course of the game, you come to understand them, the little nuances of their characters, the things that make them real. The characterization was flawless, which was good considering the plot is so character-driven. 10/10.<br /><br />OVERALL: Enjoyable, with a strong plot line, incredible characters, and good graphics. Certainly worth checking out. Like I said, though, not everyone is going to like it. The game focuses very strongly on Squall's character, and the love story is a major part of the plot. If you enjoy a good Adventure/Romance, then this is clearly for you. If not, rent it or borrow it and see if you like it. All you'll lose will be a space on your memory card and the hours you would have spent re-playing Symphony of the Night for the twelfth time. It's a great game, and well worth playing. 9/10.
