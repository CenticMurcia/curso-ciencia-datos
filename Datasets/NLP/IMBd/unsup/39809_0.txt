where ever I go, I get a movie pass at the local video store and just start renting countless videos. Dude wheres the party was one of those movies that was released with no advertising and even the rental i got a hold of had no box, just a DVD with the name of the movie and I don't even think it had a photo or anything it was just a white label with the name. so I watched it, and it focuses on the FOB.. F.O.B Fresh off the boat aspect of the Indian crew.. basically you have a bunch of Indians who are totally assimilated into American culture like our hero Kal Penn (no accent) and they basically have a tight party (according to them I suppose) but the FOB's show up and they don't want to let them crash the party. and some girl gets mad at Kal for being insensitive and so he has to make it right. I was a little surprised that Kal's character didn't notice right away that the fobs were trying to get in on the action but he seems really out of it until the girl gets mad. Its a bit lame, most people can pick up on a group of people looking for action. <br /><br />I'm sure there is more to the movie than that but it boiled down to this. if you're going to have a huge party for your Indian friends, you better make sure that you give individual invitations out because that kind of event will be crashed every time by FOBS. Personally I don't have a problem with FOBS of any type, they're more fun than some of these dead beat Americans I know, and if they're crashing a raging party they're probably open minded at the very least. Let em in FOOL, they're here to party! LONG LIVE HAROLD & KUMAR! DJ LIQUIDSMOKE
