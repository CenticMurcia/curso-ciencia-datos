What do you get when you have a movie that isn't funny enough to be called a comedy, and too boring to be called an action movie? The answer of course, is `Cats and Dogs' the movie. For a film with a very humorous premise; and a trailer promising plenty of action; the film was curiously lacking in both. I kept waiting for something funny to happen! But aside from a few bones that producers threw our way the audience is kept waiting in vain.<br /><br />Watching `Cats and Dogs' was an excruciating process for me. I can't stress enough how utterly pedestrian and tired this script is. In fact, I can only assume it was later used to line a box of kitty litter. Unless this is the first movie you've ever seen -- you'd find more entertainment value chewing an old dog bone than you would from watching this coughed up furball they laughingly call a comedy. 2 STARS OUT OF 5.
