The first comment is just one opinion. Now I'm giving you another. Miramax didn't buy the rights to the movie series for nothing! Jopog manura 1 & 2 were excellent! I was very disappointed to find out that Eun-Kyung Shin was no longer in the lead role. To put Qi Shu as the lead "Americanized" the film. Qi Shu was good in "So Close" but in this role where she's filling the shoes of a very strong actress. She just doesn't cut it. In my opinion, she's not that great. When you have a winning formula why change it? The movie execs should have done everything they could to keep Eun-Kyung Shin in this movie. Sissors and all! If you can, pick up Jopog manura 1 and 2 to enjoy yourself!
