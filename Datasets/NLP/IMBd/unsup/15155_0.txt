This... This was, just as I had suspected, very awful. I was forced to watch it in Maths a few weeks ago for some reason, and I found it practically awful. The jokes were lame and used over and over again, and the opening titles were lacking in imagination, and (this is the worst bit) I expect no film buff is a kangaroo lover. I mean, they do make some quite good animal films sometimes, even if your not an animal lover. "Beethoven" wasn't too bad at all, really. But this movie... oh, I like to smash the television to avoid watching it every time I see it playing. Seriously, my mates who watched it with me in Maths actually LAUGHED for some reason. How could they? Those sort of comic disaster jokes are used well too many times, like in "Bean: The Ultimate Disaster Movie" and I'm getting sick of seeing it on screen.
