The director of SWIMFAN tries his hand at a psychological thriller with HIDE AND SEEK, about a woman's suicide and the devastating impact it has on her husband and young daughter. The husband (DeNiro) spirits away his kid (Fanning) from Manhattan to upstate New York to try and salvage her. Things do not go well. People and pets start dieing or disappearing, and Fanning seems to have developed an invisible playmate named Charley. The plot is hokey and had been done a hundred times before, but the film is kept from self-destructing by the star power on display here. It is not a cast one normally associates with such B-level fare. A virtually unrecognizable Amy Irving, sporting a head of blonde curls, is DeNiro's distraught wife. The always-lovely Famke Janssen is the kid's shrink. And the fetching Elizabeth Schue plays DeNiro's new love interest. DeNiro is slumming, of course, but if his character had been played by virtually anyone else -- think adequate leading men like Dennis Quaid or Kurt Russell -- you'd have no movie at all. At all. On the DVD, you have a choice of five endings.
