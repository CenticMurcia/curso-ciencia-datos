Sharon Stone stars as Hush, a sleazy and irresponsible woman who has two children and lives in a small apartment. She is also in debt with a low-rate loan shark and, as a result, she is constantly being threatened by them. However, she eventually meets Joe (Billy Connolly), a man whose wife has just left him and also has found out that he has a brain tumor. They both fall in love while he helps her deal with her problems.<br /><br />With such a story, one would think that this movie would add up to something good. However, the reality is that 'Beautiful Joe' is a film that does not work on any level. It starts out as a drama that puts an emphasis on a rather unconvincing love story between Joe and Hush. It then shifts to comedy (rather lame comedy that is) during the middle of the film. By the end, the film once again shifts back to drama. With such a lack of direction in a poor script and terrible acting (especially from Stone, whose career is definitely in freefall), 'Beautiful Joe' is anything but beautiful. (1/10)
