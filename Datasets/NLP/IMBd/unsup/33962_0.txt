I think it's sad that a previously entertaining show like South Park (yes, I did like the show) has to resort to wasting two episodes having the characters engage in a battle claiming that another cartoon show isn't funny. All they did was give a one hour long commercial for Family Guy. Are they jealous that Family Guy has such a huge following? Beyond that, South Park has really taken a downhill turn since pretty much the end of season 5. Since then it's been sadly one good episode every two seasons. There was one good episode in season 8 (AWESOM-O) and the World of Warcraft episode in season 10 was hands down one of the funniest things I've ever seen. The only problem is that they rely too much on "pushing the buttons" of everyone that they can't be funny without resorting to racism, sexism, or vulgarity. A shame. They claim that Family Guy is nothing but interchangeable jokes. This is true, and guess what? It works! Family Guy is the far superior show to South Park today.
