Oh, my God. Where do I even begin with this horrid little kids film? The implausible situations? The horrendous dialogue and acting? (Except for Don Cheadle - by the way, what the hell are you doing in this movie?) The ridiculous and over familiar plot and storyline? The God-awful, overwhelming musical score? Hmm...you pick, and we'll start there.<br /><br />Two kids find an abandoned hotel and use it to house a bunch of stray dogs. That's pretty much it. They could've been innovative and original with this idea, but instead, like always, they screwed it over in favor of recycling ideas.<br /><br />The one thing that bothered me the most is the music. The music can either make or brake a film. And, sometimes, with less there is more (No Country for Old Men) and with more (Hotel for Dogs) it becomes tiresome and incredibly annoying. That and it wasn't very enjoyable to listen to.<br /><br />I can't say too much else because I don't want to bore you with complaints, but that's all I can really say about this atrocity of a film. I actually feel sorry for all of those involved with this shite.
