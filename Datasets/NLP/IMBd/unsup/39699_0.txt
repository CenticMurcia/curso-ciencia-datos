Although this film wasn't historically accurate as it seemed, I have to admit there was an honest attempt to making it historically correct. For a Walt Disney movie, there were some aspects to the film that tried to let the audience know that there was at least some truth to Squanto's story. However, I really think that this film would have been a lot better off if they made it in documentary fashion rather than making as a children's film. I really don't think children themselves care too much about Squanto and what he meant to the Pawtuxet people. If a child wants to see a Walt Disney movie, I think they would be more interested in watching Peter Pan, or Winnie the Pooh or Cinderella, etc, NOT a story about an actual Native person who lived a proud legacy for his people.<br /><br />But ............. anyways......... that's why I gave this film a 4 out of 10.
