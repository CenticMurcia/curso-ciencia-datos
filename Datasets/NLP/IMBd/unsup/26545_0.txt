I remember watching this movie at school not too long ago in film history and immediately fell in love with it. Not only did Douglas Fairbanks star in this film, he also produced it.<br /><br />***A FEW SPOILERS AHEAD***<br /><br />The Raoul Walsh film is based on a tale from the Arabian Nights. A noble, nice-looking (sorry, I had to add that in), young thief named Ahmed who sneaks into the palace (with the help of a magic rope) and tries to steal, but changes his ways when he falls for the Caliph's daughter. After hearing that the Caliph is searching for a husband for his daughter, the thief disguises himself as Prince Achmed. He fulfills the prophecy of the princess by being the first to touch the rose of the tree. Later, he expresses his honesty to the princess about him not being a prince, but a thief. His true identity is revealed when one of the Mongol slaves he "ran into" tells the Mongol prince who he [the thief] really is. Then, the Mongol prince ends up telling the Caliph and the thief is stripped, whipped, and thrown out of the palace.<br /><br />Now the princess must wed one of the suitors that were left. But suggests that whoever brings back the rarest treasure after seven moons, she will marry. Before the thief goes out on the quest, the princess gives him her ring. Ahmed goes through several obstacles such as the Valley of Fire, the Valley of the Monsters, the Cavern of the Enchanted Trees, the Old Man of the Midnight Sea, the Abode of the Winged Horse in which no one has been able to survive.<br /><br />The special effects are outstanding for a 1920s film! The tinted scenes of the thief's quest sets you off in a mood and gives you a feeling for that particular scene. Despite the age of the film, it's worth watching!
