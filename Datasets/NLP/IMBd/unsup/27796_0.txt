Three criminals buy a luggage store next to a bank so they can tunnel their way to riches, but the luggage business takes off. It takes a while to hit its stride, but it is an enjoyable comedy. The only problem is that it has a tendency to sink to the level of The Three Stooges, with Robinson playing the Moe role. Crawford is amusing as a lovable lug, and Brophy fits in well as the third member of this motley crew. It is not clear if Wyman is Robinson's girlfriend or his "stepdaughter," as he puts it. Anyway, it is Carson and Wyman who provide the romantic subplot. Gleason is hilarious in a bit role as a nosy soda jerk.
