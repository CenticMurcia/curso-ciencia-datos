It's an excelllent comedy! Benoit Poelvoorde is totally amazing, the script is intelligent, smart and funny. Julie Depardieu is beautiful and a good actress and Jean-Paul Rouve from the Robin des Bois is excellent as Michel Polnareff! If you like Claude Francois this film is made for you!<br /><br />Well done.
