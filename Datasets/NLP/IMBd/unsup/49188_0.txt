Jerk off waiters, waitresses, and other restaurant staff spew sophomoric humor for people who've never seen foul-mouthed comedies (or get off on them). The running joke, herein, is something called "The Penis Game" - you trick co-workers into looking at your exposed genitals. Then, if they look at your worm, you shout "fag!" and playfully kick their ass. Note, the "Unrated and Raw" DVD shows squat.<br /><br />Stuff like spitting on food is about what you'd expect. The caricatures will be recognizable to anyone who has worked in a "Shenaniganz". The philosopher-dishwasher (Chi McBride as "Bishop") and tightly-wound waitress (Alanna Ubach as "Naomi") are made to order. Justin Long (as Dean) does all right with the best-written role. But, this type of comedy can hardly ever keep it up. And, it doesn't.<br /><br />** Waiting... (5/12/05) Rob McKittrick ~ Ryan Reynolds, Anna Faris, Justin Long, Rob Benedict
