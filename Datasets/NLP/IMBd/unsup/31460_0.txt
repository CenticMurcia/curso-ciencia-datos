I just checked, and there are some clips available on youtube. This show and others like it, used to scare the bajeezabells out of my brother and me. Of course we couldn't wait for the next terrifying episodes. Does anyone remember the Outer Limits Episode w/ the radio station and the alien that comes to Earth on the radio waves? I am trying to reference it, but don't remember the name. I was really young when The Jar was on TV, so I don't specifically remember all that much about it, other than it appeared to be very murky and curious. I wish I could get a copy of this on DVD or somewhere, any ideas? Twilite Zone, Outer Limits, even if there is some place on line available to watch the whole thing. Thanks
