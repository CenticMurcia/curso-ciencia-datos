In the last few years there has been a huge surge in documentaries being released for the cinema. Films like "The Yes Men", "Bowling For Columbine", "Super Size Me" have all come out to an ever more hungry audience.<br /><br />Selling Queer is part of this trend and not the best the bunch. I did enjoy this film more then I enjoyed the unrelated precursor, "When Boys Fly", but neither of these films really got me going.<br /><br />Technically I'd consider the film on par with any other shoot from the hip documentary, so I have no real complaints in that department, but where I take issue is with the handling of the subject matter. I wanted to see more of evil people doing evil things. I didn't get that. I wanted to see all the terrible conspiracies at work on how big business is taking advantage of the little guy, but it didn't give that to me.<br /><br />In a way I broke my cardinal rule of making up my mind over a trailer. I've learned not to get sucked in to the marketing of a picture, but I let my guard down. For that I can't fault the film or the director. As a matter of taste I thought the director did a smashing job with a project like this. I think gay pride is kind of obsolete in this day and age and he managed to make a movie that was at least somewhat interesting. I'd like to see what he does on his next film.<br /><br />As I said before, it's kind of forced like When Boys Fly, but without the heavy-handedness. This film let's you make up your own mind about it without apologizing for that. Unlike colombine and some others who spoon feed you one sided muck. But as a stand-alone piece it could have been better. Kudos to the director for keeping me from walking out, but I've yet to see anyone tackle a subject matter like this and blow me away.
