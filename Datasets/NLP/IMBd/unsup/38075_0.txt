Pretty bad. It starts off in 1969 where a girl (Mary) is accidentally murdered and the killer hides the body and she's never found. It cuts to 30+ years later and high schooler Samantha Owens (Kate Mara) somehow raises the ghost of Mary who starts to take revenge on the children of the jerks who accidentally caused the murder. Why she never goes after the actual killer is never explained. Sam realizes something is wrong and she and her brother (Robert Vito) try to figure out who killed Mary and where the body is. It's also laughably obvious who the killer is.<br /><br />Stupid, boring "horror" film. The script is old, the dialogue is jaw-droppingly stupid and the acting is mostly pretty bad. Only Mara and Brandon Sacks (Steve) show any talent. There are a few nice gory deaths to break the boredom and (surprisingly) there's no nudity. The closest we get is seeing Sacks in the shower (waist up) and wearing some very brief shorts in the tanning salon. One woman DOES take her top off but her back is to the camera. So--no real nudity, only a few gruesome deaths, a predictable script and bad acting. Makes the first two look like unsung masterpieces by comparison. You can skip this one.
