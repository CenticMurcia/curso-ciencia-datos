What can I say to this movie that is already been said? "Malibu's Most Wanted" is a very funny movie that stars Jamie Kennedy ("Jamie Kennedy Experiment"), Taye Diggs ("Brown Sugar") and Anthony Anderson ("Barber Shop"). It mostly involves "Brad Gluckman" played by Mr. Kennedy and what it is like to "be yourself".<br /><br />I have never laugh so hard with so many funny scenes in this movie. The writers of Fax Bahr and Adam Small besides doing this movie and Jamie Kennedy's show, have also done "Mad TV", a comedy show. These writers are very very good.<br /><br />This movie will do very good in the box office and depending on the box office receipts could be a possible sequel.<br /><br />The Dark Gengar rates this movie from a single Gengar to ten gengars: Nine Gengars. The soundtrack is good. Aloha everyone and enjoy the movies.
