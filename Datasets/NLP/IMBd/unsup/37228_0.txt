I must admit, whoever advertised this movie is a genius. I would have NEVER seen this movie if i knew it was about a crocodile. I thought it was going to be a decent movie about a serial killer, who is a person. That would have been interesting. It not only was completely boring, but the plot completely sucked. I was so mad when i realized the killer was not going to be a human, and also that the advertisements fooled my friends and i (probably as planned). The only good part about this movie was the jokes it provided my friends and I. But, i can admit that the fake-me-out Steve Erwin was funny, and so were some other lines in the movie. I cannot believe i waste money on seeing this movie.
