I didn't see part 1 or part 2 of this film but after catching part 3 just 15 minutes away from the beginning, I was hooked. I have to say that this part looked like a made for telly movie but it was nevertheless very engaging.<br /><br />The plot deals with a college girl struggling to come to terms with her brother's death as well as her father's growing distance towards her. When she is unable to solve neither conundrum, she decides to take on "The Skulls" a society at her school (also one that her brother had been trying to get in to) and challenge their prejudices. The dean of the school hear's her plight and taps her as a front-runner to become the first female member of the 250 year old fraternity whose membership doesn't end at graduation. Slowly but surely, she begins to discover that all is not as it seems.
