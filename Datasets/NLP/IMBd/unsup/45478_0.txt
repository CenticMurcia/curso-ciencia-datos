Watch this one just to see a bizarre collection of the deluded, the braindead, and the plain old put-ons. The 2 most noticeable of all the weirdos in this documentary were the muscle bound she-man {Bev Francis, I think}, and unbelievably phony Rachel McLish. Miss Francis, who at least saw the competition for what it was, was a ghastly example of what a distorted mind coupled with dangerous steroids can become. As freaky as this woman was I must say that Miss McLish topped her for an outright eccentric, perhaps grotesque, mindset. I heard nothing, I insist...nothing, come out of this woman's mouth that was even remotely real. This has to be the most devious, deceitful person I've seen anywhere. I wonder if her whole life isn't one big hallucination. I have seldom seen a group of people more to be pitied than I did in this expose of womens' bodybuilding. Not a well done film, but worth seeing how odd we humans can act when our minds take us down the wrong path. Strange.
