I sat down in front of my TV and turned to HBO and "The Man" happened to be starting at that moment. I needed two hours to pass, so I watched it.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised. The idea to put Eugene Levy and Sam Jackson in a movie together was a clever one. They bounce off each other perfectly. The jokes in the movie range from farting humor to Eugene Levy explaining that the human bite is very painful (which I found funny). I found the film to be above average funny.<br /><br />The film's humor and suspense are abundant enough to keep you watching the whole 83 minutes. It is definitely a great movie to watch just to burn time.<br /><br />7/10.
