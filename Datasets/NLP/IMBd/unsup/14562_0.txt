Some people won't get this film. Their loss. Lelouch is a master of his art. He plays with narrative and plot, introducing characters seemingly at random, yet he's always in full control, and the fun is in finding out just that. The performances are uniformly even - perhaps Beatrice Dalle is a standout. Photography is gorgeous, and as you would expect from the director who made "A Man and a Woman", the music is luscious. The opening time lapse scene in Paris is worth the price alone. Lelouch is accused of recycling a limited repertoire of technique. Well, bring it on, I say. I watch this film at least twice a year. An unsung masterpiece. *** Late breaking news - May 2005. A DVD version with English subtitles has been released in Canada as part of a box set of six Lelouch films. A search will find it... Finally, the 16:9 version!
