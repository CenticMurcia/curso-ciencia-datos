CUTTING CLASS is one of those teen flicks co-mingling some stupid humor with murder. Taking place in a high school with the typical cast of characters, focusing on three...cheerleader chick Paula(Jill Schoelen), basketball star and self-proclaimed stud Dwight(Brad Pitt)and an obligatory crazy guy Brian(Donovan Leitch). Crazy in this case meaning messed up enough to take a turn in a mental hospital...sent there by Paula's dad(Martin Mull), the district attorney. Right after Brian is released, the D.A. happens to be shot by an arrow while on a hunting trip. There is a premise of boy thinking he has girl wrapped around his finger, while another boy decides he deserves the girl in question. The high school becomes the breeding grounds for strange murders; duh...who could the main suspect be? Playwrite Steve Slavkin will not be confused with John Hughes. This film marches to the beat of several tunes from Wall of Voodoo. The cast also includes: Brenda James, Eric Boles, Dirk Blocker. Nancy Fish and Roddy McDowell.
