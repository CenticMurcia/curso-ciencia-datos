Lets get real, people, there is no good reason for a filmmaker to force some kind of point on someone. Do you watch films to get lectured for 2 hours, or because you enjoy films? When you look at a bed of roses, do you try to figure out what they mean? No, you enjoy them for what they are. Why should it be any different for any other visual or aural experience? If you want a lecture, go watch an episode of 7th Heaven.<br /><br />With that said, "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is a film without much of a point, and rightfully so. It is shocking not because of graphic violence, but because how the violence is handled - we are left unaware of the full extent of the murders, forcing us to use that wonderful thing called imagination. These days many films have forgotten that lost art of giving the audience the credit it deserves by allowing the viewer to imagine what may or may not be. As Fritz Lang once said "It is best not to show acts of violence on screen because the viewers will imagine the worst". "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" had an interesting approach to this method: the violence was implied, sometimes vaguely shown, and its after-affect celebrated in its full and splendid glory. The result is an unfinished painting, yet enough evidence is provided so that anyone with some imaginative sense can paint in the missing parts. Of course, it's an unfortunate fact that not all of us are blessed with this gift of imagination, and those poor individuals are unlikely to appreciate what they see here. So, if you like horror and gore, but lack imagination, please feel free to check out those lame Scream movies, or the 945867987 episodes of Friday The 13th, or EvilDead. But if you're able to use your brain, then you should be able to recognize "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" for the important work of art that it really is.<br /><br />Highly recommended jolly-good family fun for all!!
