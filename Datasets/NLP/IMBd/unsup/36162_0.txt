The Great American Snuff Film, such an awesome title and cover and heck the movie even to have some real footage of people the guy actually killed so it must be real, Right? F!$%&* NO! This movie is utter garbage, trash, crap, you name it any horrible label and you'd have described The Great American Snuff Film. To me this is the worst attempt at making a snuff film, to tame in terms of violence/gore (almost none), very poor film making and just an atrocious movie all together. Avoid this movie at all costs! Just stick with Snuff, Cannibal Holocaust, or the Guinea Pig movie's, those are more of a snuff film than this will ever be! <br /><br />Movie Rating 0-5, Gore 0-10 <br /><br />The Great American Snuff Film ** (2)
