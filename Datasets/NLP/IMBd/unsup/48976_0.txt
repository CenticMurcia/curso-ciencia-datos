I rarely hate films; in fact the only other film I have been genuinely annoyed at having subjected myself to watching was date movie. Personally I find it hard to distinguish between the two as to which is worse. this is just so terrible. the acting is awful, the script is unfunny and, putting it bluntly, crap, the humour is that of a 9 year old, the plot line is rubbish and the whole movie is such an utterly pitiful attempt at a comedy. IT IS A WASTE OF TIME TO EVEN BOTHER WATCHING THIS. FOR YOUR OWN SAKE, DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT IT!!!!!<br /><br />Here are the facts how I see them:<br /><br />1. I watch a lot of films<br /><br />2. I am very tolerant of films and rarely dislike them<br /><br />3. I passionately, from the depths of my heart, hate this movie.<br /><br />4. However pointless, I hate the producers and writers of this film for making such a Appalling movie, and even more for subjecting it to the public.<br /><br />I will repeat again, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!
