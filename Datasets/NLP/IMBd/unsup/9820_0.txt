I was at first intrigued by this documentary. Then I researched the subject, from both pro- and anti-conspiracy sites. I found out that this "documentary" is a manipulative lie.<br /><br />The "documentary" is only a compilation of old government plans and reports (taken out of historical and logically context), a bunch of witness-accounts taken out of context, a lot of half-truths, a lot of quotes taken out of context, a lot of "experts"-inteviews (which are mostly experts in fields which has NOTHING to do with explosions, air-planes or buildings), a lot of poorly pictures of questionable origin and a no understanding of science. This, with a X-files-kind-of-soundtrack, tries to manipulate the weak mind, to believe in Dylan Avery's Jason Bermas' political crusade against reason, logic and the established society.<br /><br />One of the lies made in this "documentary" is that you could not make cell-phone-calls from an air-plane in 2001 in cruising-altitude. Because he claims that the people on flight 93, weren't alive at this point, that they had been killed, and that their voices were faked. THAT IS A LIE. I ask a good friend, who travelled a lot back then (Buisness). He confirmed to me that he could and did 2000 speak in his cell-phone on the air-plane - he called his wife, who was giving birth. You could speak in air-planes back then, the problem was that the calls was cut-off, when the plane went away from a transmitter on the ground. It has not occurred for the director, Dylan Avery, that signals also can work vertical, not only horizontally. Plus: most of the calls made from flight 93, were made on air-line phones, not cell-phones. Everybody who had just half a brain, could research this for one self. This is just another example of the manipulative lies, which this "documentary" consist of. People: please do your own research, point out all these conspiracy theorists mistakes - most of them don't have an education, and if they do it is never technical. <br /><br />Another lie Dylan Avery says in this "documentary", is that the government used live-voice-morphing-technology to fake the voices of the victims on flight 93. That is simply yet another manipulative lie from Dylan Avery. A voice-morphing-technology does exist, yes, BUT IT IS NOT THAT ADVANCED YET. You cant use it live. It can be used for recorded voices, but not live, as Dylan Avery so arrogantly claims. Plus you have to have many recordings of the original voices, and then calibrate the equipment to do morph voices. <br /><br />So if you think about it, then the government would have to have tail all the passengers of flight 93 for several months before 9/11, if you take Dylan Avery's word. The government would have had to have track all these passengers for months, and they would have had to control the will of all of these passengers, to make them take an air-plane 9/11. Because the government should have a recording of the voice to make a "live"-morph of it, so they must have tailed them for months, because they could not have relied on recording enough of their voice in the airport. <br /><br />And Dylan Avery claims that these supposedly CIA-agents used this voice-morph-technology to call the families of the passengers of flight 93, and then sounded so convincing, talking just like them, using the words they use, accents and favourite-curse-words and all, and then convinced all the families of the passengers of flight 93? <br /><br />If you try to do this yourself, think about how to do it, then you'll see how impossible it is. <br /><br />So if you take Dylan Avery's word, you will see how retarded his theory really is. Either he is incredible dumb or just a liar.<br /><br />Dylan Avery has no idea on how reality works - he lives in a fantasy-world of fairy-dragons and conspiracies. <br /><br />But we should not be so troubled by Dylan. He uses poor sources. Most of the sources are taken from the day of the attack - 9/11/01. Right back when no one knew anything of what was going on. I can remember 9/11 my self; no one in the media knew anything. The journalists had reports that about 20 planes had been captured, then 8 planes. Also we heard from the media that there was 20.000 people in the building at the time of the collapse, or at least it was speculated within the first 24 after 9/11. There was simply mass-confusion. A lot of information came to the air, which did not happen/was not true. And that is what this "documentary" is build around - misinformation and misunderstandings. Most other sources that Dylan Avery use in this "documentary", have been taken from anti-semitic and anti-American sources. Not very reliable. Because these web-sites and other sources has a political agenda to discredit USA, Jews and Israel. They do this with misinformation and exaggerations. <br /><br />The only thing positive I can say about this "documentary" is that it is slightly better than Alex Jones' poor trash of documentaries. <br /><br />If you do want to watch this poorly made "documentary", do yourself a favour: research all "facts" presented in this film, so that you will not be mislead into believing that some evil-force is controlling everything. If you do not hold your head cool during this film, then you will be taken in by the lies of this documentaries. <br /><br />Joseph Goebbels once said: "If you tell a lie, which is sufficiently big and keep repeating it, then people will at believe it is the truth in the end". That can also be said about this "documentary" and most conspiracy theories.
