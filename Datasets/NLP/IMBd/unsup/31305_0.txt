Very cute and very funny film, in French with English subtitles, though I doubt any of the females will be reading them, since the "visuals" in this movie are not to be missed. As he always is, Roy Dupuis is beautiful and charismatic, and Patrick Huard is just hysterical. This movie is just fun to watch on a gloomy day.
