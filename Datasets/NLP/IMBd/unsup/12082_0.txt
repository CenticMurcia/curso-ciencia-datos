I found this movie to be one of the most inspirational that I have seen in a long time. The filming was exceptional. The riding that Viggo Mortensen did was awesome and the horse that was Hidalgo was quite an actor. I was riveted throughout and it should be considered an epic. This movie shows so much about this particular piece of our past and how we started and what happened to the Native American Indians and to the Mustangs. We don't have enough of this kind of movie now. There are children that don't know about these things. There were many messages in this movie that were courageously and sensitively put forth. Viggo Mortensen was perfect in every way as was the horse. I found all of the actors wonderful, the scenery so different from just a western and the horsemanship outstanding. What a movie. I loved it. I will see it again, in the movie theater, and I will buy it when available.
