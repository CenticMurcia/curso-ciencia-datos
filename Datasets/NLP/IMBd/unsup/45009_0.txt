Cool calculus - this was my first feeling when I saw this very disappointing Chinese film. Chen Kaige was years ago a good director, but now he wanted to beat the attractions of Ang Lee's "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and Zhang Yimous "Hero". No chance at all... One of the wonders happens in this picture en-route all five minutes could be need by this complete failed spectacle itself. This noticed seemingly the owner of the US-rights and cut 25 minutes out of this movie. So it takes more speed, but this act of castration makes this poor martial-arts-entertainment not better. Don't waste your time, there is no suspense, no atmosphere, no dramatic and no convincing action at all. I give ** out of ten stars.
