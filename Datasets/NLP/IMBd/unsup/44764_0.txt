Very disappointed with editing,accuracy of technology and continuity of film.Premise was good but somewhere along the line the story turned into a love story and main plot fell apart. It's a shame that the story went away.The acting was fair to poor. Marie Conchita Alonzo as a Massad agent with a Spanish accent is ridiculous.What's with the cutting of fish,meat,conch and coffee making.Have big problems with scientific facts which are inaccurate. When making a scientific movie at least get a consultant who can correct the errors in the script.How did one disc turn into two,was one hidden in the cave and what happened to the existence of God.
