What a bunch of crap...Malcolm McDowell seemingly attempting to recapture some of the facets of his role from A Clockwork Orange and failing miserably, combined with some of the most offensively brutal violence and vulgarity I've seen in a film recently. Don't get me wrong, I'm not asking for Gangster No. 1, the edited version... I was fine with movies like Goodfellas, Clerks (and the rest of the View Askew films), the aforementioned Kubrick classic, and others. But really, was there anything in this movie worth watching? Unlikeable characters, thin plot, and weak attempts at humor drag this dreck to the bottom. The violence seemed like vicious filler, and the profanity seemed like a substitute for intelligent dialogue. I give it 1/2* out of ****. Stay away from this movie...all its attempts at artsiness and likeability are hopeless. Overrated by those who are impressed at its "artistic qualities." Go watch a real film, something by Scorcese, Takeshi, Kurosawa, or Kubrick.
