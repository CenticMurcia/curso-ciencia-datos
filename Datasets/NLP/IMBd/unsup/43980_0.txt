After watching the first fifteen minutes of this "festering bowl of dog snot," I longingly wished that I'd been hit by a truck on the way to the video store. After suffering with fading hope through several excruciating minutes of a movie none of which was even 0.1% as cool as the videocassette box cover art, I watched the last 4/5 on fast forward, and it was *still* the most bash-your-own-head-in-with-a-brick, brain-numbingly, agonizingly *awful* piece of trash I've ever seen. (I make a special exception for Alien3 [WARNING: SPOILERS of series-spoiling elements in Alien3 & 4 FOLLOW], which, though not bad overall, will forever be my choice for worst movie because of the GLARING PLOT HOLE and contrived, character-killing plot devices at the start of the movie that COMPLETELY DISREGARD the plot, characters, and story lines that Cameron et al. developed in Aliens. I mean, really. There's an EGG on the Sulaco? How did *that* get there? The escape pod ... *broke* on landing, killing two of the most important characters? Everybody Dies? Argh!!! *sigh*) (And don't get me started on Alien4 and the whole Ripley-clone-automagically-recovers-the-dead-Ripley's-brain-contents thing. Sheesh.)<br /><br />Anyway, back to ROTOR (but why bother?!): Completely devoid of "acting" - it was more like watching those animatronic dummies on the stage at Chuck E. Cheese writhe and jerk around after they're 1,000 hours overdue for their scheduled maintenance. As for dialog, imagine the same jerkiness translated into speech. Now conceive of a "plot" written by selecting random snippets from twenty seconds of Gumby dialog (a la Monty Python), and you'd still be imagining a less torturous movie than ROTOR. Even the "special" effects (think "special" as in "the short yellow school bus") were worse than the worst special effects on television. Transitions into "robot view" or "design view" or whatever they were trying to do were abrupt, discontinuous, and more amateurish than showing a spaceship waving around on the end of a stick. I'm still trying to figure out how to collect compensation from the production company for the hour of my life they wasted... and concurrently how to involve them in some appropriate form of torture. The existence of ROTOR makes a solid case for adding the "0" rating, and perhaps negative numbers, for movies at imdb.com.<br /><br />But hey, I could be wrong! :-).
