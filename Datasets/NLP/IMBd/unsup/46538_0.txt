This movie is strictly for those people who have not seen the earlier Umraao Jaan. Because they will compare and this one would fail miserably.<br /><br />The script was badly written, the characters looked like they had not done any homework, especially suniel shetty, who seemed to be a character who was just taken in the movie for the sake of it. No attention was paid to the details like Suniel shetty's shoes. Aishwarya just danced well, and managed look well, a very good job done by the make-up artiste.<br /><br />The only actor who performed extremely well, in spite of those over decked up sets was Shabana Azmi. Her's was the only character, which made some sense. As neither did blow-in blow-out nostrils(Ash) nor the last moment entry(suniel) did. Abhishek was good, though his character didn't seem to be well-defined enough. Some of his scenes were longer than they should had been, however, he managed to portray them well.
