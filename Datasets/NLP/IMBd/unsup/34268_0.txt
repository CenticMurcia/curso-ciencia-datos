Nothing special, nothing new, with a suprise ending that you could see coming from the begining(not necessarily the exact ending but you knew there would be a suprise). The whole point of a suprise ending is that you don't expect it. It wasn't suspenseful so count that out. It was obvious through the whole movie that something didn't fit. Maybe that's what they were trying to accomplish: showing us how obvious it should have been but how hard it was for them to realize the truth. It wasn't a bad movie but it certianly wasn't a good movie. It copied Sixth Sense in so many ways but totally failed where Sixth Sense succeeded so dramatically. I just couldn't wait for this movie to be over and I'm shocked at how high the ratings are on IMDB.
