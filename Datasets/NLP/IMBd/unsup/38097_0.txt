First of all, a question to you - have you ever seen any of Yossi Wein movies? If no, then you might end up liking "Merchant of Death". Michael Pare looks tough enough, portraying a likable hero, and Linda Hoffman in my opinion? is very cute looking doctor, who is trying to help Pare with his problems.<br /><br />Now, if you are familiar with Y. Wein's work.... you'll probably be angry as hell, and end up throwing your notebook away or breaking your DVD player in half. Because about 40-45% of this movie is EDITED from 4-5 other Yossi Wein movies. I kid you not. Footage from Cyborg Cop 3 (1996), Cyborg Cop (1993), Project Shadowchaser 4 (1996), Warhead (1996) and Never Day Die (1994) was used for almost ALL action scenes, except for those when we see Pare running / shooting or talking.<br /><br />I don't know whether this was done because of budget constraints, or pure laziness, but i was really upset with this effort. They probably could afford Michael Pare for only 1-2 days, so they shot the needed scenes and added everything else later. Due to bad editing, you can actually see other actors (Frank Zagarino from Shadowchaser 4 footage, B. Genesse in a car chase from Cyborg Cop 3, old warehouse shootout from Cyborg Cop, etc) in the footage used here. So, if you haven't seen any of the movies mentioned here, you will probably like this no-brainer. Otherwise, please avoid it.
