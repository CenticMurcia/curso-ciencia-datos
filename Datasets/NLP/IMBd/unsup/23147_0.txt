I agree that Jan Duggan was superb in this movie. It was actually the scene that made me become a W.C. Fields fan. I would love to have an original copy of the movie. I did record it but quality is bad but not so bad that I cannot see "Cleopatra" sing and dance to "The Sea Shell Song." I think I laugh harder every time and that dress & wig could not have been any better for here character. I would even wake my children up when they were small singing this song. Of course they hated it but now that they have gotten older, they will actually ask me to sing it but I just cannot master it like Jan Duggan. I wonder if she was in anymore of his movies as I have not seen her in anything else but what a lady!
