...but this film sux. Gonzalez Inarritu tries to use a conventional narrative structure that doesn't conform at all to the limitations of short film. Where it should focus on the imagery, it tries to establish dialogue and familiarize the viewer with the characters' history. There's no time for that! Show the BMW and los malos hombres and wrap it up!
