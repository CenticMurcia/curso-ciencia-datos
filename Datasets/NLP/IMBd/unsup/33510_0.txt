(Spoiler) So, the moral of the story is that you transition from being a boy into being a man by moving into your "baby's mamma"s dilapidated apartment and sell stolen clothes on the streets, while probably still cheating on her. Or is it that you become a man by killing another man? Real good role model for young black men. This movie had some good acting and realistic dialogue, but the story line was bad. It's supposed to be a coming of age film, but you start with a loser that lives with his mother, and end with a loser who is mooching off of one of his TWO "baby's mammas". How did that term even become a real way to refer to relationships in black culture? That's a sad statement in and of itself. John Singleton should be using his influence to show stories of men who got OUT of the hood and became contributing members of society. Someone tell John Singleton that selling stolen clothes is not a real job, and killing a man doesn't make you a man. 'Boys in the Hood' was a far better movie!
