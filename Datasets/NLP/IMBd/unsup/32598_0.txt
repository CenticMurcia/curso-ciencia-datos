The lead couple had no chemistry. Uma Thurman is too posh to be in this role. They dealt with this situation in the simplest way, Meryl Streep just tell's Uma Thurman she is Uma's bf's mother. The movie then goes on and on and I don't care anymore, I just want it to be over. There is nothing really unique about this movie. The trailer summarizes the movie well. The breakup is a poor ending, and there's no great conclusion. This was just a temporary relationship, now that it's over, we can move on. We never end up sympathizing for any characters. The premise of the movie was good, how they developed it was awful. Meryl's character was limited by what she could say. This is hardly a comedy.
