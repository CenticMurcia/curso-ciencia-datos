All of Carandiru is in Spanish so if you have the DVD copy you'll need to turn the subtitles on. It doesn't necessarily start very well but gets better into the movie. The slow movement of it gets the better of this film too. Being able to tell the story in good detail.<br /><br />This is about a laid back Spanish prison holding more than 7,000 convicts. During visits to the prison doctor the unique inmates tell their own story of what happened to them. After a series of events after the tales and a pair of wet underpants it shows their version of what happened during one of the deadliest prison riots in history killing 111 prisoners.<br /><br />Its dark, mind boggling and have you wondering the true meaning of it or what happened to these people. If your looking for a prison flick with constant violence between the inmates then don't come to this. Recommended for anyone in need of something intelligent and well told. 7/10
