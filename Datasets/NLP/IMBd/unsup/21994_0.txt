James Grodin's Character of Lenny in "The Heartbreak Kid" is one of the most peculiar characters you'll likely encounter on film. Despicable, outrageous and an audacious liar. He's obnoxious in his determination to get what he thinks he wants and yet somehow comes across as sincere and likable. This whole film is also one of the most peculiar comedies to come along. I found myself alternating between laughs and uncomfortable winces at his utter insensitivity and selfish determination, but it's this dichotomy of emotions that make The Heartbreak Kid the obscure gem that it is. I don't think we can ever be sure if we should like or hate this guy. Two scenes in this movie: "laying his cards on the table" over drinks with Kelly and her parents and the breakup scene in the restaurant with Lila, are a sight to behold. Eddie Albert's, Jeannie Berlin's and Cybill Shepherd's facial expressions are priceless as they listen to Lenny's plans to claim Kelly after remedying his current "complication". The scene in the restaurant as Lenny tries to "drop the bomb" on Lila would be funny if it wasn't so painful to watch. I've never been quite sure about the final scene of this movie: Lenny on the couch, quietly humming to himself, seemingly at a loss as the camera lingers on him for a thoughtful moment, is he already on his way to becoming dissatisfied again now that he has attained his desire or has he finally found some peace after his battle for Kelly? This is an unusual comedy well worth a look. If you can find it.
