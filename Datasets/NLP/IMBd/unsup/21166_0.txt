Any movie with Cary Grant, to me anyway, is wonderful. It is trite to say, but there really is no actor like him today. Geoge Clooney could have been, but to his credit (unfortunately for us Cary-like lovers) he has chosen to accept the challenge of many different roles and sees himself as an actor, not a specific type of person, acting. I like both these men, in any case.<br /><br />Irene Dunne is also fabulous, her timing is the best of anyone this side of Madeline Kahn, but Dunne was more sophisticated and played off Grant beautifully. One cannot imagine Kahn as a Cary Grant leading lady!<br /><br />And Randolph Scott! Wow. Where has he been all my life? Oh yeah, dead. Too bad, he is also perfect for this film. I wouldn't mind seven years on a Pacific Island with someone who can swing from a trapeze like he can.<br /><br />Oh yes, the film...great escapism, but I must say I think both "Nick" and "Ellen" as husband and wife were insensitive clods to Gail Patrick's character, "Bianca." That poor woman would have made some man a good wife, too bad not Nick.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite movies and I heartily recommend it to anyone who wants to see how the other half lived in the 1930s.
