In reading a lot of the other comments (and message board quips) it looks like those people who enjoyed this saw it at a midnight screening. I think there's something to be said about the energy of that. I've had a blast watching a movie that, in the light of day (or on the home screen) is unbearable. I wouldn't call this movie "unbearable" but it sure is filled with missed opportunities. I think, contrary to what one poster says, this movie does take itself too seriously. The whole scenario is absurd, which is fine, but the actors play it "straight" (for lack of a better word) too much, with the exception of the villains and the drag queen (but only when she's in drag). There really is nothing redeeming about any of the B&B residents; they're all bitchy, unfaithful, wimpy--kind of like all relationships at one time or another but all at once. The acting is horrible and it's like the editing department was staffed by the actors--every scene lingers on way too long, letting the viewer watch the actors stare uncomfortably (or cluelessly) at each other (or at nothing)--so they could squeeze out a little bit more screen time. My advice if you must watch this: Be under the influence of something, and make a game out of it. Whenever a character rolls their eyes or calls someone a bitch, have another hit.
