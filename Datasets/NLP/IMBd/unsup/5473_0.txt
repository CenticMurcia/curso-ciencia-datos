I first saw this movie in the classroom during Spanish lessons (in Spain). So this was the first movie in Spanish that I fully understood. I was in my 20's then and it really appealed to me. It's a great trip we make alongside a priest on his way to confront the devil. We get to meet a lot of strange characters and we get to witness some really violent scenes.It's got a good soundtrack (very heavy). It's my guess that if you're into Tarantino/Rodriguez movies, Cheech & Chong stuff and (violent) cartoons that you'll like this one too. I loved seeing it. I went through quite some trouble getting it on DVD. Now I can watch it whenever I want. Thank U very much.
