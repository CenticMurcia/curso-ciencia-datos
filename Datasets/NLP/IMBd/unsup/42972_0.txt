Absolutely miserable film despite the wonderful Bill Holden, Sophia Loren and Trevor Howard starring in it.<br /><br />This picture never takes off. Holden, in the Canadian army, goes over to England to work on a tug only to meet old-time pal Howard. The latter is sharing an apartment with Sophia Loren, who appears to tragically jinx everyone she is involved with.<br /><br />We have some bombings, mass destruction but what is the basic story line here?<br /><br />How fortunate Howard was to be a victim of a blast here. In that way, he could get away from this nonsense.<br /><br />Sir Carol Reed many some many fine pictures during his long, distinguished career including 1968's Oscar winning "Oliver!" This film, "The Key," is a dud in every respect.
