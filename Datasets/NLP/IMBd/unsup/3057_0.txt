This was an excellent movie. I can never forget how I felt when I first saw Tupac as an actor; it completely blew me away. The role he played was definitely convincing, it left me terrified and mesmerized at the same time. I believe this movie was definitely a chilling reality about the ghetto's pride in respect and power. When your living in the ghetto, society automatically paints you out to be a low class individual, but this film brought to life the quest of 4 young men who wanted a name for themselves and did not just want to be another statistic or face in the crowd. Unfortunately the end of their journey left them as another statistic.
