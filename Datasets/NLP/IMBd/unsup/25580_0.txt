pleasantly surprised. Okay, it wasn't the greatest movie. In fact, it was a movie that I "settled on" (after I saw the line for Gladiator). I went in expecting the worst, but the more I expected to cringe, I couldn't help but to chuckle. The only scene I could really complain about was the kidnapping of the dog where it got painful. (That poor dog). You have to admit, it is fun seeing Norm weasel out of tough situations. Danny DeVito is excellent...the master genius of funny. Well, the type of humor might not be for everyone.<br /><br />So, my suggestion is to wait for the video if you are not sure. But try to make it a point to see this movie...on some rainy day when you have nothing better to do.
