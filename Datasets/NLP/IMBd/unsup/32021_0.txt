Reallyreally remarkable.I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since I saw it yesterday. It's a movie based on homosexuality in a very macho environment, and yet, there is nothing expressly queer about Yossi and Jagger's relationship--this is a love story and a human story more than a gay story. The worst part of all is that it's also a true story.
