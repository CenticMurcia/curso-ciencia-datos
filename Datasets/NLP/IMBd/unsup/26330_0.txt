Elvis Presley is a race car driver who likes to spend money on strangers with sob stories - he buys, for example, a station wagon for a family with five little girls, and newlyweds receive a new furniture set from Elvis. Bill Bixby plays Elvis' promiscuous friend and roommate. He needs money to keep the supply of booze and women flowing. Due to poor money management, they get in trouble with tax collector Nancy Sinatra.<br /><br />Mr. Presley is a great singer, especially on "Let Yourself Go"; however, you would not know what a great entertainer he was by viewing this terrible movie. The comedy situations are not funny. Ms. Sinatra looks too under rehearsed in both her scenes and her song. Mr. Bixby seems too manic in this film. The film concludes with a dangerous "Big Race". The only way this film could have been worse would be to have had Elvis take the five little girls in his race car near the end - instead of their father.<br /><br />WARNING: Keep small children and wild animals away from Norman Taurog's "Speedway". <br /><br />** Speedway (1968) Norman Taurog ~ Elvis Presley, Nancy Sinatra, Bill Bixby, Gale Gordon
