Kang-Ho Song is a genius. <br /><br />He reminds me of Buster Keaton. What is amazing is to see the other films he is in. Once you have seen this, make sure you check out YMCA Baseball, and then for something completely different, JSA (Joint Security Area). It is clear that some of the best films lately are being made in Korea, and he seems to be a part of them. His gift for physical comedy is remarkable, and this movie keeps going in directions I did not expect. <br /><br />Anyone who has worked in an office will understand this film. It is not only for WWF fans, in fact I HATE Wrestling...but this is something altogether different.<br /><br />Do yourself a big favor, see Foul King, JSA, and YMCA Baseball, and then lets start the North American Kang-Ho Song fan Club.
