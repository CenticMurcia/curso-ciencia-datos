not great nothing new.<br /><br />ghost looked like a mask for 2 dollars for Halloween.<br /><br />production value is OK compared to the budget...<br /><br />i got bored, and had to fast forward to get to end, which was well untouching.<br /><br />some of the production team members are writing comments of praisal, and giving 10/10 ... we'll those people suck.<br /><br />a a a<br /><br />not the worst... but definitely NOT a good movie. wouldn't miss anything by skipping this one.
