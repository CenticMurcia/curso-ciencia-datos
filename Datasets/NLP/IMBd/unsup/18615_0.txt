By far, the best movie I have seen ever! Epic, original, spell-binding, deep, emotionally-nuanced, artsy, and simply human. The main characters evoke empathy from the very start. I guarantee there will be at least a single character you will be able to deeply relate to. If you are wondering whether to see this movie, don't! Go and see it now, you won't regret it. It is well worth the 6 hours you will spend watching!!!<br /><br />Beautiful footage shot in different parts of Europe superbly compements the time period over which the story takes place (40 years). It's great to see Italian movies finally make a come back in this big way.
