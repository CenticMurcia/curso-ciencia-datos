If you're looking for an Occult Lucifer-rising sort of film, this is a definite must-see. Omen was good for its time, but seems a little dated. This is not a simple re-do though on an old plot. There are interesting connections made between Science and Faith, and the ending was well done if a little predictable.<br /><br />The only negative features were the father's role was a little bit wooden (but acceptable), and explanations were a little underdone for exactly how all the supernatural puzzle pieces fit together.<br /><br />I'd recommend it if you're into movies like The Prophecy (one but not two), the Omen series (I-III), Rosemary's Baby, and other such apocalyptic fiction.
