While this film has aged well, it's not especially well made. It's watchable, maybe even entertaining, but I wouldn't say that it's worthy of the mystique that Hitchcock has aquired. Having also seen Rear Window, I'm wondering if that reputation is deserved at all. This is, however, a decent film, and better than many things being released in the present day.
