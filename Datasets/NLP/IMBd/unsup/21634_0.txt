Spaghetti Westerns are Clint Eastwood to the average dork like me. Apparently they also meant high camp comedy to many in Europe. The DVD information says this movie took more lira in Italy than 'The Good Bad and Ugly'. The comedy spaghetti was family fare apparently. What a flight of whimsical ideas this one turned out to be. The spaghetti western era ended with this one. An idea that had travelled so far that it had finally arrived backwards and inside-out. Very strange.<br /><br />Klaus Kinski gets dubbed out of earshot and Terence Hill has the voice of a girl with the blue-eyed, doe-eyed smile of an angel. No wonder Patrick McGoohan dug deep in his own character-filled pockets for an inspired way to project his cavalry h'Officer. Yes, he came up with the, possibly, historically accurate idea of a Thomas Meagher...."I am an American". He looks dreadfully sun burnt too. Location filming in Monument Valley did his Celtic skin no good at all. This movie can only be viewed as episodic, a series of set-pieces. I am sometimes annoyed by McGoohan's accents as they blur his diction and my enjoyment of his delivery. This time, his accent is SO inspired, SO unpredicted, why, it's Genius !!
