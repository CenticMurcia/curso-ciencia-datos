I must admit, I only turned on this movie because of how hot Jane McGregor and Piper Perabo are, and that's the only reason I watched it all the way through. I thought the entire plot was rather implausible; plausibility isn't a requirement for a movie, but this movie is implausible for no good reason. It has some funny moments, such as Starla's (McGregor) French exam, which got a few chuckles out of me, but a lot of things which I suppose were meant to be funny fell flat.<br /><br />I say it's implausible for no reason, because it wasn't very entertaining. The whole idea of Genevieve (Perabo) taking over Starla's life isn't even one of those ideas that sounds like it could be made interesting, but maybe that's just me. Why an exchange student would come to America from France and even risk a stunt like ruining the life of one of the members of her host family is beyond me, and the movie isn't enjoyable enough to make me forget that. It's predictable, and it's not terribly smart or funny.
