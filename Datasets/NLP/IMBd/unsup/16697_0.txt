I knew this had to be quality when I put in the DVD and the Vestron Video logo popped up? So I guess that means this was made for video, no wonder they went broke and disappeared. What we have here is a series of slasher murders being investigated by a very angry cop, he's been on leave for a while since his daughter got killed and now he's back and he uses lots of 4-letter words and goes right into ballistic without even working up to it, whew! Serious overacting by this guy. Anyway this is a bunch of mundane events all tied together by this killer dressed in black with a black mask, but you see the killer making phone calls and it seems fairly obvious who it is if you're paying any attention at all. I didn't even recognize Kevin Costner in this, and I didn't even realize he was in it until after the fact. Talk about screen presence. At any rate, this is a sleepwalk of a film, nothing much to recommend and you'll do just fine by never seeing it. 3 out of 10.
