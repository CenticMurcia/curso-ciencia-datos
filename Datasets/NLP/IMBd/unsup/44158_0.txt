Is this a horror movie or a soap opera? I don't know. It seems to want to be both, and it fails miserably at both. The movie starts off with some promise. A bunch of college students get killed by a daemon in a cave. But then......so much drama and angst and just bore. Sadly, it could have been good. But the focus was on the lead character being miserable over the accidental death of her best friend, which really had nothing to do with the monster in the woods. There are a few basic horror moments, bodies ripped to pieces and such by the creature. But you don't really care because the movie is so boring and so drawn out, it feels like it takes a hundred years to watch it. It's like the soap opera version of Jeepers Creepers only less interesting, more drawn out. And the ending is horribly unsatisfying. I don't recommend this movie. It's only redeeming quality is the actors were good, but they had such garbage to work with that it just didn't matter in the end. And what a waste of Native American mythology. It's like they only threw it in to get a few more movie goers. That story dies quickly and we never really get into much of it. The movie is a long drawn out waste of time.
