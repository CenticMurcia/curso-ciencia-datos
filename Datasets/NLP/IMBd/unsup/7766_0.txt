This is without a doubt the worst zombie movie i have ever seen! There really isn't anything good to say about it at all.I read some of the comments made by the films makers ETC, claim this was professionally transferred to video BAHHHHHH.No way known this was done on a real Telecine, I'm with the handy cam filming the image projected onto a wall.For gods sake WHY they bothered shooting it on 8mm is beyond me, but they could have at least had it professionally transferred. I have seen enough professionally transfered films, mostly 16mm but some 8, to know this Isn't one, my father was a Telecine operator for 30+ years for a local TV station.
