I Love The Royal Rumble Of 2006. I Loved It So Much Because Royal Rumble Is My Fav Match Ever And Plus Rey Mysterio Won It And Hes One Of My Fav With Jeff Hardy. I Other Matches Were OK. John Cena Match Was Good Because He Won And I Hate Edge!!! And The JBl Match Was Not Good They Did Not Fight At All Of What I Can Remember. And Kurt Angle Match Was Good Because He Won I Hate Matt Henry!! Mickey James Match Was Stupid Because Ashley Lost!!! And That Was It That I Can Remember. And That Is Why I Liked The Royal Rumble Of Year 2006.<br /><br />I Hope In The Next Royal Rumble Rey Mysterio Wins Again Or Jeff Hardy Wins!!!
