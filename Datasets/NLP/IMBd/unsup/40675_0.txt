I LOVE this movie! Sure it's hokey, but watch almost any "B" Sci-Fi from the 60's and 70's! <br /><br />I own both versions, "Teen Alien" and "Varrow Mission".<br /><br />It took me years to track down both version. Ebay is your best bet for trying to find any out of print videos. I'm not a "Fanatic" of this movie, I'm just married to the Varrow Male. <br /><br />My hubby was one of the few guys in the Jordan High School Drama club that was chosen to act in this movie, they weren't even going to pay these kids until one of them found out and left after the filming had already started and they had to refilm all the stuff he had been in.<br /><br />I bought them to show our family, friends and to show our daughter that it's okay to make act weird sometimes!
