i first saw this film in 1989 when i was 8. i enjoyed it immensely and having taped it off TV i would watch it on a regular basis. Now, most things that i liked as a child i can't stand now but i do still like this. i liked it as a child and i still like it now at 25. probably one of the few things that have stood the test of time with me, i usually go off things very quickly. this is quite superior to most of Disney's other films in that it is good for adults as well as children, in fact this was probably the only Disney film i liked as a kid (bedknobs and broomsticks is an exception) i usually preferred Disney's cartoons as opposed to their films i have to give this a 7 out of 10 far better than it's three sequels, although Herbie goes to Monte Carlo is nearly as good
