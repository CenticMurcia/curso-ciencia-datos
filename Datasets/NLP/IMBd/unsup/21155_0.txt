I saw not as many people reacted on this film as on the previous part "legend of the overfiend". That's a shame because when you've seen that part you should see the all the next parts as well to get the big picture. Personally I think this is the best trilogy of the series. It is very dark, and some sick people where behind it regarding to the big machine to evoke the demon God. I liked Myunhi Hausen JR. Although I don't think he's cute like some previous reviewer said :-)<br /><br />Because it's hard to rate only one part of the whole series I just give them all a 9 for originality, story, darkness and drawing style.
