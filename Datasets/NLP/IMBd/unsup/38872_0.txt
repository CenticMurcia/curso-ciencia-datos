OK... I love horror movies and I'm not that picky about what I watch but hey... This movie is just more than I can bear... I've almost never stopped watching a movie but this Redsin Tower is one of the few movies I cannot stand...<br /><br />Let's start with the story... boring, conventional and seen three million times... come on, I don't see what's new here: a boyfriend wants to get revenge on his former girlfriend? a tower full of mysteries and bad things??? it's just the basic story of 99% of the bad horror movies out there.<br /><br />but worse is the film.... the image is so dirty that it looks just like a cheap holiday movie... I enjoyed the Blair Witch Project movie but at least the image was something interesting... here it is just bad and blurry... nothing worth spending money to see...<br /><br />Finally the acting is just awful... at times it just seems the actors are almost looking at the camera when delivering their lines ... I know why the actresses were chosen... mainly because they spend most of the movie talking about sex and walking around naked... frankly here too it's not worth losing your time watching...<br /><br />As for the good critics .... I can only think about one explanation... they were left by the producer, director and lead actor of the movie... else... we didn't see the same horrendous film...
