I was flipping channels one night and "The War Wagon" came on. I saw it when it came out in 1967, but not since. I had forgotten all about it, and was mesmerized by the theme song as the credits rolled. As the wagon thundered across the cowboy landscape, I began to chuckle, then laugh. After it ended, I decided that "The War Wagon" gets my vote as the worst theme song I have ever heard. It's so corny that it's hard to believe it ever got to be used. However, Hollywood westerns are notorious for some of the worst musical scores ever conceived. In fact, if you could remove the music from many westerns the movies would be vastly improved. It's always syrupy strings, Wagnerian hero-brass, and the standard thumping bass drums and trombones playing ominous minor scales whenever an Indian comes on the screen. Add a really dumb theme song like "The War Wagon" and that's how you write a horse opera.
