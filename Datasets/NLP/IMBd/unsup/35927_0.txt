The plot: An internet porn-star and her relationship with the world. Doesn't sound that bad, but unfortunately the film doesn't exactly know what he wants to be. A drama? Hm, why is the lead character smiling all the time then? A comedy? No, therefore it's too dramatic. And yes, James Woods is really placed wrong here. The movie has no really interesting or even surprising turning points, no good acting or thrilling music. There seems to be only one thing, that keeps some folks go for it, and that's the fact that this story contains the words porn-star, which indicates some nudity (which you can actually see, at least in an uncut version).
