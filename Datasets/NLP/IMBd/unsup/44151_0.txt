This movie is BORING. It is slow paced and slow witted. The lead character is throwing a pity party and serves plenty of whine through out the length of the film. The movie does share some beautiful scenery, which is ruined by dumb dialog riddled with clich√©, and a camera that is apparently attached to the back of a turtle, when not in the hands of a rampaging squirrel. The editing looks like the squirrel got a hold of it, too. The DVD doesn't include many features, and the one I miss is subtitles, as the dialog is often hurried or slurred. It had the overall quality of a 70's porn film without the skin and sex, which is even more pathetic that a 70's porn film with the skin and sex. I found myself fast forwarding through parts of it and even then the film was slow. I finally turned the thing off.
