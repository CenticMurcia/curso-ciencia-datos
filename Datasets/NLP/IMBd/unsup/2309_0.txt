There is very little i can say about this film that hasn't been heard before but i will anyway.Errol Flynn was and always will be the greatest swashbuckling adventurer the cinema has ever known. THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD is by far his most fondly remembered role. Nobody was ever better as the dashing rogue swinging from trees,waving his sword or flirting with Maid Marion(the beautiful OLIVIA DE HAVILLAND).But Flynn is not alone.He is joined by what is my opinion the best supporting cast ever assembled in an adventure film. Claude Rains is brilliant and the evil and despicable Prince John.Basil Rathbone(one of the very best screen villains)plays Sir Guy of Gisbourne to the max. Little John is played by the always wonderful Alan Hale(Flynn's on and off screen buddy),Eugene Pallette is a hilarious Friar Tuck and Montagu Love adds to the fun as the corrupt bishop.The film is further enhanced by the early use of three color technicolor and the outstanding music by Erich Wolfgang Korngold.William Keighley and Michael Curtiz both sat on the director's chair for this film and both give their touch to it.The climactic duel between Robin and Sir Guy is by far the most imitated and influential sword fight in cinema history. So for those out there who want to see something worthwhile i recommend THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD,not only for being Flynn's greatest role or being the best of all Robin Hoods but for being one of the greatest adventure films of all time!!!!!!<br /><br />AN EASY 10 OUT OF 10
