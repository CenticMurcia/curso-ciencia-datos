Poor costuming,<br /><br />Bad acting,<br /><br />Some OK sets,<br /><br />and Lame plot.<br /><br />Not representative of the Rennaissance in it's lack of accuracy.<br /><br />The fantasy portion can't even begin to pull you into the story. Bad wig on Gawain. <br /><br />Overall the worst movie I have seen in a very long time.<br /><br />All I can say is Sean Connery must have needed money very badly to act (if you can call it that) in this monstrosity. Don't waste your time!
