the worst "war movie" I have ever seen - the script was corny to say the least and the USA USA chanting made me vomit (maybe Americans love this stuff???) I am glad that I saw this at a friend's house on a 75 cent bootleg DVD bought here in China as it would be shame to have spent $5 to go to see it at the movies!
