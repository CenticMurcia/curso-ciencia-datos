I recommend seeing this film, it's sure to raise many ethical and moral debates. It deals with something not many people are aware of, but should be. And it deals with it in a way that doesn't seem forced or in your face. Any film that inspires communication and conversation is worthy of attention, it's one of the things good movies are supposed to do. And the best part: it's thrilling and exciting while it's doing it! Also, for a small film, it contains great cinematography and very effective special effects. Good performances by the two main leads is an added bonus. I would also recommend seeing it with a group of people, because it's very interesting to gauge everyone's different reaction right after viewing the film, there's sure to be opinions ranging from emphatic agreement to stern disapproval, but that's what's great about it. Be sure to check it out wherever you can.
