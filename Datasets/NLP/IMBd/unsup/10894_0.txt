This show is the funniest thing I have seen in ages and I do not say that lightly (lol). Its got all these crappy low budget sci-fi shows down to a T. I've only seen the first two episodes and I'm already totally obsessed with it, this show is just sheer genius, it's hard to explain why it's so funny but you just have to watch it to understand the brilliance of this show. 10 / 10
