I, like many other people, saw the MST3K version of this. I found it absolutely hilarious. Underneath the extraordinarily hilarious comments, I saw a movie that seemed halfway decent, when compared to such other MST3K victims as Manos: The Hands of Fate. ("Manos" makes this one seem like "Braveheart" in comparison.) Though it had an awful plot, script, setting, etc., it did at least make an effort to be (halfway) serious about showing and developing a few characters, about as much as some of the "Friday the 13th" later sequels made. I don't know if I'd give the standard version this, but I'll go with 3/10.
