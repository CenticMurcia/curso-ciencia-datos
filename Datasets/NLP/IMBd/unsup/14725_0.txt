This is a sweet, well-made, beautifully-photographed film. It has a good plot, a refreshingly modern script, and believable characters. Surprisingly wonderful performances are given by Madhuri (including her terrific dancing), Kunal, Konkona, and Dalai (who plays her savvy young daughter), as well as all the junior and minor players in this film. Akshaye Khanna has a smaller but pivotal role, initially as an antagonist who must be won over by Madhuri's determination to do something meaningful for the village she grew up in. The music and dance numbers are very enjoyable, including the opening scenes with Madhuri teaching modern jazz style dance in a studio in the US. The highlight of the film is a spectacular 'stage play' production number as the culmination of the lead character's (Madhuri's) efforts to save her village from unwanted "progress." I'll watch this memorable movie again several times, I'm sure, and I wouldn't say that for a lot of films, either! This movie is definitely worth seeing, if you love Bollywood like I do!
