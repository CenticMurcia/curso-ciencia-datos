When we saw this epic swashbuckler on it's original release in the late 40s, little did we know that it was to be Errol Flynn's last great adventure/love story. It is still the essence of Flynn's screen personna, and it still brings joy to his fans. The only drawback here: Viveca Linfors is no Olivia deHavilland. Chemistry is sadly missing, but this is nit-picking. It is sumptuous on every level, and when a first-time viewer sees that staircase, a "WOW!" is to be be expected. Robert Douglas seemed to make a career of playing heavies, and in this film, he raises villainy to an art form. It has been a longtime coming, but THE ADVENTURES OF DON JUAN is finally available in DVD's glorious Technicolor reproduction. Let's wallow in it.
