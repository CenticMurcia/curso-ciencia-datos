I saw it last night 4/13/05. I thought this would be the worth movie ever but I think it is extraordinary.This is a must see.It is about two spoiled girls who burn the kitchen and they have to take a summer job at there dad"s dairy factory, while he goes on vacation,but the sisters run into a lot of problems and they need to find the solution together.I liked the story,the acting was great and the best part is that I can watch this over and over again,not like a lot of movies.I also like the way the sisters realize that they need to think about other people not just themselves.so this is my conclusion:see this movie,if you like Disney,vote on it,comment.that is what I think of this outstanding movie
