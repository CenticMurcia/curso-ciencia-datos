This is a story of a friendship between an unlikely pair but kids don't care. One young girl comes from a well-bred upper class family and another girl is a street smart daughter of a New York apt. building super. They learn from one another about a different culture and the dialog is fantastic - extremely believable. I'm sorry the overall rating this movie received was so mediocre. The low scores were obviously given by persons out of touch with real life, especially from the perspective of a young girl.<br /><br />
