"Seems Like Old Times" showcases Neil Simon doing what Neil Simon does best: creating harmless, solid little comedies that don't tax the intellect or give you much to remember, but which are pleasant enough while you're actually watching them.<br /><br />This one re-teams Goldie Hawn and Chevy Chase two years after they had shown how much screen chemistry they had together in "Foul Play." Hawn is the wife of the L.A. district attorney (Charles Grodin), while Chase is the ex-husband who comes tumbling (literally) back into her life when he finds himself in a desperate situation. It all plays out like a screwball comedy or bedroom farce, and most of the jokes hit their mark. The three main stars are helped by a good supporting cast of mostly unknowns.<br /><br />Grade: B+
