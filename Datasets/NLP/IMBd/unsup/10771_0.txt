in this Movie Dana Carvey hides his face behind many disguises.unfortunately someone also hid all the laughs,somewhere no one will likely find them.this is billed as a comedy,which is OK,but it's not funny.it's not even amusing.it is however,stupid in all the bad ways possible there are some talented actors in this movie,but i guess sometimes actors sign without reading the script,(or what passes for one,in this case)Dana Carvey certainly has some comedic talent,but aside from the two "Wayne's World" films,he hasn't has a chance to showcase it.i kinda felt sorry for all involved.it was truly embarrassing and painful to watch.i'd have to give "Master Of Disguise" 2/10
