Released in 1976 during the height of the UFO/ancient astronauts/Bigfoot documentary craze, "Overlords of the UFO" is quite simply one of the worst examples of an already ridiculous subgenre. Depending on what mood you're in, W. Gordon Allen's narration will either make you laugh or put you to sleep--and take it from me, if you're *not* in the mood to laugh, you'd better just skip this mess altogether. Ever see footage of an "invisible flying critter"? No? Well, you will in "Overlords of the UFO"! Did you know that aliens from a distant planet called Ummo visited Europe in the nineteen-sixties? Prepare for a crash course in Ummology! The single funniest moment in this wretched film is when the narrator, serious as a heart attack, reports that the authenticity of a certain series of close-up UFO photographs was confirmed for the makers of "Overlords" by Swiss psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung! Ahem. Other than pointing out the obvious--namely, that Jung died in 1961--I can't even begin to address this absurd claim. The producers had brass balls, I suppose, but that's hardly an admirable quality in this case. Well, there you have it. If you're a glutton for punishment, you might want to take a look at "Chariots of the Gods", "The Force Beyond", and "Mysteries From Beyond Earth". They're almost as bad as "Overlords of the UFO".
