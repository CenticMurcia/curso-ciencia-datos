This is one of first real slasher films, and inspired the many films of the eighties. It is set in a bay, where the precious land is sought by many to be developed. The original and unique thing is there is no single killer, everyone is dispatching each other to gain control of the land. Also a group of young campers arrive, they are soon dispatched as well. The effects are very good for that era, especially the axe in the face scene. The film is shot with good style too by Bava, has his camera follows some diverse angles. You get the impression he made this film with his tongue firmly placed in his cheek. Especially the ending, which kind of fits in with the whole theme of the film, but with a difference. And the music at the end is amusing. An impressive film, that is still effective despite its age.
