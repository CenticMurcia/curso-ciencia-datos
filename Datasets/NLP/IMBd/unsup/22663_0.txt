Yesterday, an thrilling, exiting, sinister science fiction movie fresh out of Korea.<br /><br />I do agree that i`ts kind of hard to keep track with the plot, but once you do get its a genius idea that confronts the ethics concerning cloning and gene manipulation.<br /><br />The action scenes are a mere feast with fast moving handheld camera. It has its slow moments at the end of the movie, but cleverly used to reveal the "truth". <br /><br />Well Recommended! <br /><br />
