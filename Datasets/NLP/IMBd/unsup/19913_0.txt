This episode features huge climactic moments that have threaded not only through this season, but through the entire "Smallville" series.<br /><br />The main story in this episode is the marriage of Lex Luthor and Lana Lang. However, many key moments happen that same day that culminate at the altar. Lex gets threatened by his and Lana's physician, Dr. Langston, to reveal the truth behind Lana's pregnancy. In return, Lex does something that most would regret. Lana has second- make that fourth or fifth- thoughts about marrying Lex, and in a huge revelation is finally convinced to back out before another menacing figure comes into play.<br /><br />This episode was written so interestingly, telling the episode three times through the three main characters- Clark, Lex and Lana's- perspectives, following each person's experiences of the day from their individual point of view. The main question following this episode is: why did the "menacing figure" do what he did to Lana? This scene alone will need to be answered before the season concludes. Tom Welling did not act his part as well as he usually does; he seemed restricted because he had to portray a side of Clark (aka Lana-obsessed) that was the exact same five years earlier. Despite this, the storyline and revelations overcome any very minor discrepancies and sets a full table for the rest of the season.
