A bizarrely satisfying masterpiece of a movie, with some of the best acting ever. The cinematography, the script, and all of the actors were just fantastic, but this movie runs so much deeper than that. It is truly capturing the spirit of the human psyche, and how our minds work. The tale of these two friends who have never met each other is both moving and disturbing, and the filming has so many layers to it. Subsquent viewings of the film only make it better, and it is overall just absolutely heartbreaking. Everything about this movie is just oozing with appeal, from its look to the characters to the performances that make it seem just so realistic. I loved every minute of this non-stop drama masterpiece.
