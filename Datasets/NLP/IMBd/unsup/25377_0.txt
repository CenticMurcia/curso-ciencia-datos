While it may not be as classic as other sci-fi from the 1950's, this fanciful bit of sci-fi schlock does just fine for a nights' viewing.<br /><br />A group of archaeologists find themselves descending deep into the earth where they discover not only a lost civilization of light-sensitive albinos, but the title creatures, used and abused by their human counterparts.<br /><br />John Agar, Hugh Beaumont, Alan Napier, Cynthia Patrick, and Nestor Paiva star, and the performances, like the film itself, are fun. The sets are decent, the pacing pretty efficient, and the music enjoyable. The photography is often dark and moody, adding a fair amount of atmosphere. There are even some nicely tense moments. Sure, it may be a little silly, and one may have to be partial to this kind of film to begin with, but I found it to be very engaging stuff.<br /><br />It begins with a surprisingly lengthy lecture by an apparent scientific expert on the earths' core, which is an interesting way to start. The ending is also not quite what one would expect.<br /><br />All in all, I found this little picture very amusing and very watchable.<br /><br />7/10
