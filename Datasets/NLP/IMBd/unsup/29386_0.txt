First of all, I never really cared for Houston's singing from the beginning of her career. It was too Ethel Merman/Carol Burnett, but at least they were fun. I preferred Dolly Parton's version of 'I will always love you' for its sweetness. It's not the kind of song that needs to be belted out at full volume. Second, I don't think she is all that beautiful either with those lifeless eyes of hers and the bitchiness came way too easy for her.<br /><br />Kevin Costner looks good in clothes (costumes) but has the voice of a 15 year old boy. I've never liked any of his movies or his attempts at acting.<br /><br />Put these 2 together and voil√†, an awful, awful mess. Was the interracial love affair supposed to be daring in the 90s? Did Whitney get threatening letters for her performance in this thing as well as the character she played? Did Kevin go to Supercuts during a power blackout? We want to know.
