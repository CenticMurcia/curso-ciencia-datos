Don't let Hollow Man 2 lure you in if you liked the first. This film was absolutely horrible with its one-dimensional characters, and also its boring storyline. What this film really needed was three things. It needed more gore because Hollow Man 2 was too watered down. It needed another actor to play the villain because, let's face it, Christian Slater is bad at acting. And also needed to at least try to make itself better than the average horror sequel. I mean really, the first film was pretty good because it actually tried and succeeded in being entertaining. Hollow Man 2 doesn't really try to entertain us, it's just another on of those Direct-to-Video-Cash-Ins that will try to make money off the original. So may I ask, "Has the world had enough of these re-hashed, stupidly stupefying horror sequels? Maybe so but guess what, Hollywood just keeps making them. When will they learn?" 0 out of 4.
