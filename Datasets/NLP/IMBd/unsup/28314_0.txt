I rented this movie from the corner variety store, I love anything to do with ghosts so i was happy to rent it. I liked this movie cause i didn't have to wait 1 hr into the movie for things to start happening; the best part was the kitchen scene where she's huddling in the corner on the floor and you see the 'ghost' sitting beside her as the lightning outside illuminates the kitchen in flashes. I also liked the knife scene where she's looking at her camera that she set up in her bedroom to see a startling image. I'm glad I have no closet in my room where the door opens easily, cause if mine did what hers did; i would be freaked out agoraphobic or not, i'd be out the door. This movie will end up on my personal movie shelf if i get the chance to buy it. It's not Amityville; but pretty close! Good job for a low budget flick.. 9/10
