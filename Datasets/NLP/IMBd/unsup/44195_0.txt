It is a lousy remake of what was a superb original film.<br /><br />Certain films have a time and place and this one belongs in a post war grammar/private school and not in a current comprehensive school.<br /><br />The older British grammar schools had good and bad qualities but there was a general aspiration to Greatness. During the 1960s the left wing labour government destroyed anything that was good in British education and replaced it with bland "comprehensiveness". Last year (2004) they apologised and admitted the mistake  a bit late for the unfortunate pupils of the 60s and 70s who were stuck in their dreadful system.<br /><br />The remake is just like the school it is set in, bland and soulless  the ideal training ground for future telephone sanitisers.
