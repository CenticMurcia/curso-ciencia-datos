I was originally going to give this movie a two rating..but for two reasons only I bumped it up to a 4 (which is still bad btw) The two characters that made this movie even remotely watchable were Wes & Big Mac. It is pretty sad when two child supporting actors upstage you and put out a better performance Mr. Lawrence. I think I may have cracked a smile twice in this whole film...and only one genuine laugh...in the ENTIRE comedy film. It was awful. How many movies do we have to watch about children's sports that aren't EXACTLY the same thing as the last? This movie has every clich√©d element you could expect all the way down to the coach trying to get the class nerd to growl and do the mean face. We have SO seen that before! I also cant figure out where they came up with the music for this movie. I was sure I must have accidentally slipped into a time warp. They had hip hop and I guess u could say rock from th 80's and early 90's...what the heck was that about in 2005!?!? I only heard one song that was remotely recent (last year or two) and it was a crappy played out Outkast song. Bravo to the young actors that played Wes and Mac because they made it possible for me to finish this movie without gorging my eyes out. It was also nice to see Megan Mullally as the schools principal but she was totally wasted in this part. They should have given her something more to her story and some more lines because she is one funny woman and I'm sure it would have improved it some. Overall this movie is dreadful so unless your 8 year old forces you to sit through it I suggest you avoid it like the plague.
