wow.. this movie was sooooooo interesting.. zzzzz.. (falls on the floor sleeping) with the well known actors... ehh.. tom hardy who has played a minor role in black hawk down! Michelle Van Der Water who has like played in three movies! ooOOo.. the rest of the cast has either played 1-3 movies.<br /><br />the story was very weak.. yey 8 people running around in a maze who is hunted by a "Minotaur". even i could have written better.. the actors must have been the dumbest ever!! " ooOoo maybe if i scream every time, even if the monster are not after me, someone will rescue me.. opps i drew the monsters attention.. i wonder why.. let me scream a little more, maybe ill scare it away!".. damn jerks..<br /><br />many goofs! omg.. such as (spoiler) when one is trying to climb up from the maze, you can clearly see he is hanging by a large string..<br /><br />everyone is going to disagree that i GAVE IT A two! but all the others only say the same (not kidding) "Surprisingly better than most Sci-Fi originals" something around that.. anyway i only gave this movie a two, because the minotaur wasn't so bad made and it was sooo cute...
