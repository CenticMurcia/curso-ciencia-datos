This is one of the worst supposed 'comedies' that I have ever seen. There is not a single laugh in this movie and it is proof positive that Leslie Nielson cannot make a decent movie unless it has "Airplane!" or "Naked Gun" attached to it (and that's being quite generous to "Naked Gun 331/3") Whoever approved this script should never work again. Just imagine what damage they could do in other areas of the public sector!<br /><br />Seriously, tooth extraction is enjoyable compared to this. Avoid with every fibre of your being.<br /><br />
