this movie looked interesting to me cuz i thought there would be a lot of gore. there wasn't. its about unit 731, who tortured a bunch of chinese people for experiments. its not that cool, the effects aren't that great. it has a cool story, and the plot is kinda nifty, but its slow. could have been a diamond in the ruff if they had made it better.<br /><br />mat "drumladdy" (the hot carls)
