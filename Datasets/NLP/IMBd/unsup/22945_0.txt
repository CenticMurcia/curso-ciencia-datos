There are only two reasons for people to rate this film higher than a five. They are either Bela Lugosi fanatics who are blinded by his star power, or they're pulling your leg.<br /><br />In it's favor, this film has the following curiosities: <br /><br />Bela Lugosi in a rare non-horror leading role. <br /><br />Hattie McDaniel in an early screen appearance (although running around yelling "Lordy, Lordy" doesn't showcase her future greatness very well).<br /><br />A curious 1935 vision of television that doesn't seem to need cameras at the point of origin and can act as a "death ray" carrier wave. I guess that makes this a science fiction story, of sorts. <br /><br />And occasionally interesting story-telling by reshowing the same scene using different vantage points to add information withheld earlier in the film.<br /><br />Working against this film is: <br /><br />The poor print quality (both picture and sound)of existing copies. Insulting racial stereotyping. (As implied above.) <br /><br />Ridiculously inaccurate scientific predictions about television. (As implied above.) <br /><br />Undeveloped characters, giving the audience a "who cares" feeling when someone gets murdered. <br /><br />And a general weakness of the writing, acting, and directing. <br /><br />Being a Lugosi fan myself, it pains me to write negative reviews of some of his films. But the truth is, it pains me to watch some of his performances as well. <br /><br />I'm giving this film three stars, based on the curiosities mentioned above. If I were to rate it any higher, I'd be pulling your leg.
