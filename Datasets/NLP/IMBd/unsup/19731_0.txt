...this "movie" discredits Disney's name by revisiting classic Disney characters into a modern world and a modern computer-graphic. I Disney has decided to ride the wave of computer-graphic based animation. Toy Story (1&2) and Monster&Co were good examples of how to use modern techniques in the context of a good starting idea although I can't help thinking that art of animation the way I knew (and loved) has been certified dead by monstrous photo-realistic productions. But this...I'd say it's almost dis-educative for the young generations. I won't comment the technical side of this poorest production but the result is an awful experience that I could not even bring to an end, watching only the first 20 minutes. More than enough. Walt would have no peace if he knew what they are proposing under his name today...
