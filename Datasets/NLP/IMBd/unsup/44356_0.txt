This programme is absolutely awful. the plot is very boring and they should just abandon making new series. the characters are dull and even though it may be trying to create a retro feeling, it is out dated and no longer pleasant to the tastes of viewers. also considering th ratings of many other soaps/dramas, for example east-enders, coronation street and more recent ones such as torch wood, heartbeat does not really compare. this time slot would be well used for a variety of other programmes, and could give a chance for new directors to test out material. the only positive point i can pull from heartbeat is that it is on a Sunday, at a time where many people are doing other things, so they can be spared the embarrassment of watching this.
