Star Wars Jedi Outcast follows the ex-Jedi Kyle Katarn and the never ending battle between good and evil. I picked up this game a couple of months ago because I had played Dark Forces and Academy. As you can probably expect I had high expectations.<br /><br />In terms of game play it wasn't that bad but some of the characters can get on your nerves. There isn't the freedom as there was in academy as you don't get to choose which force powers you want and don't. In true Star Wars fashion however there are loads of cheats and hints available on the internet. Some missions can be somewhat repetitive at times but you can be sure than many of them will have you tearing at the gums because you can't find your way. The graphics in the game aren't that bad but not as good as some i'm currently playing.
