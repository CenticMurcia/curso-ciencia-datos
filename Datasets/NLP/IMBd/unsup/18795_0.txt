This is the third installment of the Dirty Harry series, all starring the legendary four-times Academy Award-winning actor and director Clint Eastwood. Naturally, it's not as powerful and dramatic as the first of the series, because, once again naturally, sequels are difficult to make. Especially if you want them to live up to their proceeding movies.<br /><br />"The Enforcer", like all five installments of the series, is a great action-crime film with it's own little individual plot and point. It's got plenty of decent action, Eastwood flaring away with his .44 Magnum revolver, punching bleeding holes through his challengers.<br /><br />This movie has also got a pretty dramatic ending.<br /><br />Overall, "The Enforcer" is another classic Clint Eastwood movie and definitely worth checking out and seeing a few times over.
