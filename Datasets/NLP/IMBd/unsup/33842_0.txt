Far North is one of the worst films i have ever seen. A pointless tale that fails to entertain (except for the unintentionally hilarious ending) or inform, it's one saving grace being it only last for 89 minutes.<br /><br />The film plods along for 70 or so minutes without a lot happening, except for a man falling in love with a young girl, and the other, older girl looking slightly annoyed. It is then revealed that the older girl saved the younger girl from some soldiers. However, 70 minutes or so into the film, she feels the need to strangle the girl she saved and cut her face off when she reveals she is leaving with the man. Pretty unconvincing stuff.<br /><br />At the start of the film i thought that possibly this film would have a political theme about mining coal in the Tundra, but not so. No information is given to WHEN this film is set, except for the presence of soldiers, so assumingly during war time.<br /><br />Even the scenery isn't convincing, the boat scenes on the rivers are clearly backdrops.<br /><br />This film will bore you to death for the vast majority of its duration, with an ending that will baffle you and probably make you laugh. Do yourself a favour and give this one a miss.
