"Call Me" is all about Anna (Charbonneau) who is smart enough to be a NYC newspaper columnist but not smart enough to hang up on an obscene phone caller. A lame B-flick which smacks of indieness and amateurish autuersmanship features a mediocre performance by Charbonneau, Strathrain for a heartbeat, Buscemi in a bit part, poor production value, and a hokey script/screenplay. Just more flotsam bobbing on broadcast. (C-)
