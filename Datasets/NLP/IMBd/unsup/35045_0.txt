This is probably THE most pseudo-intellectual show on television, and easily one of the dumbest.<br /><br />People can argue all they want about whether this is a rip-off of Mythbusters, the fact is there's no competition: Mythbusters is the better show hands down. Mythbusters is a lot smarter than this, the hosts are more likable and funny, and it doesn't resort to big-breasted woman and explosions to get viewers.<br /><br />I'm surprised people think this show is intelligent. You can enjoy it all you want, but don't call it intelligent. "Hey, let's see what happens when we use a flame-thrower on a stereo! WOW! It catches on FIRE!" If you want to watch something that requires no thought, there's nothing else on, and you have nothing else to do, then and only then do I suggest that you watch this show. Other than that, don't bother.
