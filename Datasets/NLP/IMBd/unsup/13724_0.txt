In the Company of Men is quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. The characters are sick, hateful and sadistic. Do not be surprised if the writer/director makes the same movie over and over and over again. He has nothing to say except "men are evil."<br /><br />This movie hates men, a particularly strong version of self-hatred. Men are vicious, men are cruel, men are full of hatred, men are animals. Women, on the other hand, are portrayed as virginal, innocent, gentle, gullible, weak, and finally victims.<br /><br />Oh poor little deaf girl! Why not make her a bunny rabbit? Oh, vicious yuppies! Why not make them wolves? Please. This fairy tale is idiotic.<br /><br />The movie is more than just stupid and simplistic, however. It is degrading. You watch this movie and you want to take a shower. You wish you had amnesia. You are angry that you lost your money, your dignity, and 2 hours out of your life watching this unspeakable horror.<br /><br />Do you have a soul? This movie will kill it. Do you have a brain? This movie will numb it. A movie for sadists and masochists. The Graduate is art. Red is art. La Dolce Vita is art. This is a filmmaker dropping a psychological turd on paper and charging you six dollars to see it.
