Hey man , someone decides to throw a party , party now daddy-o. Oh and someone invites an Indian who looks like Peter Sellars , I just dig his Eastern philosophy man . Who else is gonna be there ? Some really square old dudes and some really happening mod kids who are into protest . And wow these kids are really far out man , they even jump into a swimming pool with their clothes on , wow that`s really gear man . And they`ve got an elephant with slogans painted on it , wow I dig that . And mind blowing scene with the pool overflowing with the soap suds . Oh wow man baby<br /><br />But is any of this funny ? No not really . If you remember the sixties you weren`t there . If you laugh out loud at THE PARTY you`re probably watching another movie
