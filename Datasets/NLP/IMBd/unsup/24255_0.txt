I love this movie. It's one of the few romantic comedies that work. Simply because you really want Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore to get together. They have such wonderful chemistry together. Plus the characters they play are so likable. My respect for Adam Sandler stems from this movie. Not very many male comedians can show enough versatility to do a romantic movie. Plus I love 80's music. Highly recommend to all.
