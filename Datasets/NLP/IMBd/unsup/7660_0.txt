Norman Hopper (the great John Saxon) is on a mission to save Prisiners of war while on a tour of duty in Vietnam. He and his men find the POWs, but they seem to have been overwhelmed by cannibalism and one bites Hopper on the arm. This turns out to be a recurring nightmare that Norman has of his time in that war. Later that afternoon he receives a call from an old war buddy who's in a bind. He pays it no mind, until he gets wind that his same friend is going nuts and hold up in a department store, which prompts Hopper to go down there in an attempt to talk him down. Seems they've both been infected with a disease that makes one crave human flesh and is transmitted through biting. Soon Hopper, himself, joins in the havoc been wrecked. This could have been an alright film, but a shoddy script and less than convincing acting (Saxon excluded obviously), brings this one down, the long stretches of boredom don't help either. I think the last line off the film puts it best: "Call the chief and tell him this nightmare is over". Nightmare indeed.
