At last, the right show to revive the Atlantis myth.<br /><br />I'm pretty interested about myths, more exactly the Bermuda triangle and sea monsters, mermaids... Actually, I've never found any interesting movies and/or TV show related to this topics. I'm well served with the Mercy Reef :P <br /><br />It's pretty impressive for a pilot. It makes you get inside the whole story in a brilliant way. Actors are really impressive, they're strongly in their character, performing terrifically.The story on itself is well introduced. The decor is quickly planted, giving you time to concentrate on characters' role.<br /><br />It seems that we're going to witness a kind of modern fairytale, involving an exiled prince from the legendary Atlantis, facing evil of his own people. Unnatural behavior, inhuman powers, morphing, and so on are at the rendezvous, deploying a minimum of creativity and imagination that should keep this show tuned, and satisfy the thirst of modern aquatic stories for more than one.<br /><br />The FX are an undeniable part of the success, as sea creatures should be a big part of the buzz. We've imagine mermaids, but what'll see is more than a fantasy! It'll haunt your dreams ;) <br /><br />This nowadays fairytale has began, beware to drown on it ;)
