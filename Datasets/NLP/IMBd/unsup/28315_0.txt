Having seen pretty much ever horror movie ever made I can safely say I have seen it all. And I can also state quite confidently that the scariest movies were made in the between the 60's and 80's (Exorcist, Amityville Horror, Rosemary''s Baby, Carrie, Psycho, Texas Chainsaw, Evil Dead.... just to name a few), and the crap that came out after that was mostly crap (Friday the 13th, Halloween, Candy Man, The Others, and your average slasher thrill-kill flicks...). Recently, the only good horror movies I've seen were Stigmata, Ju-on, and the Ring. Ghostwatcher reminds me of a low budget film from the 80's called Witchboard. Same type of cinematography, music, acting and style. Witcboard scared me then, and Ghostwatcher scared me now. It's the possession thing. Hard to pull off, but when it's done right it's scary as hell. David Cross, the director, must have seen Witchboard and liked it too. Ghostwatcher made my girlfriend scream out loud and it made me want to shut my eyes a few times too. The LAST thing this movie needs is a big budget, because it's better off the way it is. It is genuinely eerie and believable in a way most other flicks are not. The haunting scenes are blood-curdling and it has some excellent originality which I have not seen used before. Although I would have thought this movie was made in the 80's, that is not a bad thing - because most good movies were, so cudos to Cross for capturing a mood that is so hard to find in modern day horror. And cudos to the nearly yall female cast as well for pulling off horror with a blend of amusement and coolness as well. I loved it. Anyone who puts this movie down obviously has no fear of hauntings, and should stick to the slasher flicks, which don't scare me at all. But if hauntings scare you, then see this movie. And keep the lights down low. Definitely a good ride.
