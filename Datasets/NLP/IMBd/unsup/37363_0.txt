What's Mung you ask yourself, I DON'T KNOW! And I really don't know what this movie was ever made for, boy is it bad. Andre Toulon is abandoned for a new rich owner. Basically the maintenance man on the grounds is dim witted, and a bunch of guys make fun of him, so the puppets kill them all. At one point 2 of the puppets are walking side by side and the camera shows them down to the tops of their shoes, the legs were not moving! That is bad film making! You can almost see the stick connected to the side of their leg that they used to move them forward. BAD, BAD, BAD. Then the rich guy uses the dim wit to build a doll, so he can try to transfer a human soul into a puppet body. The daughter is a bad actress, she doesn't even get naked, which is a standard in bad horror movies. The puppets role is once again down played, so with bad human acting, it kills the movie. BASICALLY IT STINKS START TO FINISH.
