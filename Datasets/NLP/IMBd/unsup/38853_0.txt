The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat succeeds in being offensive, but that's about all it does. Unlike the South Park movie, which came out in 99 and had a lot of comparisons to the Fritz the cat serious, Nine lives is neither smart nor funny. It's disgusting, just like Crumb's comics. Pederasts and serial killers need only apply.
