Ever since Something Awful went from funny but financially unsound to lazy, unfunny, and bloated by the contributions of cliquish forum nerds desperate to join some "elitist" society of half a million other nerds, SA's contributions to mainstream wit have become crippled half-thoughts not worthy of attention.<br /><br />There's a reason there's an inordinate number of 10 votes, the forum goofs from Something Awful coming along and voting it up despite its lack of anything redeeming. The movie is as painfully unfunny and unintelligent as the front page and the forums, with as banal a "wit".<br /><br />Give this one a pass, as it'll just line Richard Kyanka's already fat pockets.
