This is one of those movies that is often passed over by people who would love it if they watched it. Why? The cover art and tag line make this movie appear to be a low budget skin flick - which it is not. This film is touching and beautiful and quirky. The acting by Balk is spot on and her character is very well developed. But what really makes this movie so wonderful is the story line. In the summary of this movie you will hear something like.....Truckstop waitress struggles to raise her two daughters...while this is true, the story is so much more than that. I suggest anyone who loves quirky movies (like Lawndogs or Box Full of Moonlight) watch this one - just ignore the cover art and rent it already!
