Despite what I had heard, this was in no way a sequel to City of God, post viewing I have learned that it is a follow-up to a TV series. Still, this film will be constantly compared to City of God, so let's get that out of the way first. City of God makes City of Men look like a day at the park, at times it is hard to imagine that both stories share a common location. In a world where City of God does not existed City of Men would shine brighter, unfortunately for this film that is not the case, it is a constant reminder of a superior film. Both films do share amazing cinematography, no matter how many times and in how many movies I see shots of Morro da Sinuca, I am always amazed by it's vastness and unique beauty. Also both films acting, if it can be called that, goes beyond acting to a feeling of capturing real life as it happens. City of Men dives deeper into the lives of individual characters, allowing us to see how a generational cycle has created and sustained this type of environment for it's people. I walk away from this film feeling grateful for living where I live and that tomorrow I'll have to chose between Coke or Pepsi not life or death.
