This movie is the best movie that I have ever bought that I did know anything about!!! I only bought it because of Ryan Reynolds, but I must say that I will be recommending it to all of my friends and to everyone here. <br /><br />If you want to laugh and watch a movie that is so completely underrated that I want to complain, then please go, buy a copy, rent one, what ever you have to do to be able to see this hilarious movie. Yes OK the ending is slightly predictable but it doesn't matter.<br /><br />If you try it and it didn't suit you then at least you tried something new.
