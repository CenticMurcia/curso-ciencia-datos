A sloppy, poor STV actioner with an aging Wesley Snipes as a disgraced Special Ops turned armored car robber. He ends up with more than he bargained for after his latest heist, a briefcase containing a $65 million Van Gogh painting that may or may not be real. But it is real enough to its owner, who wants it back at any cost. Filmed in Romania on the cheap with an "international" cast, the film looks good and has a terrific stunt car sequence at the beginning that really needed to be closer to the end, as nothing else that exciting happens anywhere else in the flick. Snipes is the only name actor. Badly edited, with lots of characters we don't really get to know or care for.
