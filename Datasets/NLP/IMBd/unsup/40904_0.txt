During a lecture at a planetarium, a man is murdered. However, despite this occurring in a room full of people, it isn't clear exactly who is responsible.<br /><br />This is a super-low budget film that isn't horrible, but it isn't particularly good either. Much of the fault for it being such a poor film are the result of poor writing (with a WAY over-complicated murder scheme), an annoying and clich√©d character (Lola Lane playing a very stereotypical "pushy female reporter") and an overall lack of energy. In fact, as I watched the film, I kept found myself falling asleep because there wasn't much to interest me and the lack of incidental music made the film seem very static and subdued. As far as I am concerned, that was an hour of my life I wish I could have back! Amateurish but watchable--not exactly a glowing endorsement.
