this is a horrible movie. beside the fact that it's full of racism, antisemitism and sexism it's simply a really bad movie (there are exellent sexist films - by and large all billy wilder movies; there are even very good films full of racism - all these comedies of the 20's, 30's, 40's, 50's with ridiculous dancing blacks or stupid black nannies, etc.). since racism, antisemitism and sexism are stupid by itself, the minimal requirement should be that they were presented in a witty way. but this movie is simply rubbish: poor, senseless plot; flat characters, that is boring stereotypes (sharp contrasts to eizenshtejn's "tipazhi"); pseudo-cool, stupid dialogues. brat-2 is full of whining resentments in view of russia's decline as a superpower. forget it.
