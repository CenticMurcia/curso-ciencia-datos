Farce of The Penguins is one of the worst, most boring, lamest and stupid wastes of money it has ever been my extreme disappointment to have endured. It is so bad that watching it all the way through is in itself a Christ-like endeavor. It is so bad, so mind numbingly boring and dull that I found myself losing large blocks of memory and suffering gaps in time as I drifted in and out of semi consciousness as it dragged by minute after stupor inducing minute. Seconds felt like miniature eternities. Imagine watching Dune the whole way through without the half a dozen interesting bits to keep you partially interested. Now imagine that except at 1/2 speed and Lewis Black making anal sex jokes as the rest of the incredibly banal commentary slows to almost sub atomic speeds. It was similar to experiencing several boring people that you would otherwise never listen to talk during a mostly white screen filled with waddling penguins set on a loop for 2 hours. Kill it with fire. Seriously.
