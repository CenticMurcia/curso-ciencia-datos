Well, this movie may not be just another piece of crap like most of this type are, but I do not see any point to praise about it either. Same old premise -- destructed wasteland, no sign of sane life, deadly cyborgs reigning, some unlucky human beings... it works on a very cheap & boring formula. It reminds me of Van Damme's Cyborg, but somehow I feel this one better. Just because it has a better story. But please do not expect a breathtaking, mind dazzling sci-fi plot. I was just comparing.<br /><br />The leadman, Joe Lara, is lucky that he turned out to be a cyborg in the end. Otherwise he himself should question his acting capability. Nicole Hansen added some human touch in this robot-robot game. At least she is the only human among the lead cast. And I'm still in dark why the director chose an old-man figure as the killing cyborg. 3/10.
