If you like movies with guns and action, more guns and action, this is your movie. Hard Boiled is simply the Best Action movie of all time. Hard Boiled is given the name Most Violent Movie by many critics, when it first released. If you see this movie, you'll know exactly why. John Woo is in my opinion the Best Action Movie director. If you see this movie carefully, he does many Action Scenes in one camera take. One spectacular scene is the ending where the Hospital is hijacked and The Two Heroes are shooting there way out. Its like a computer game, a shoot em up that reminds you of Virtual Cop. The scene shows both actors Shooting a dozen guys each and moving one place to another on the same floor of the hospital. This is a 2 minutes scene that was recorded in one take. This is one example of his great directions. Chow Yun Fat is brilliant as the hard boiled cop. Tony Leung is superb as the undercover cop and Hit man. This is a roller coaster ride of Violence and Entertains to the max.
