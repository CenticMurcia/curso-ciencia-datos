... for the Binfords' dog in this (the only) animated episode of 'Amazing Stories'. Part 1: The children play with the dog, but it's more like torture for him. And he doesn't like the cheap food that Ma Binford gives him. Will he find a way to get out?<br /><br />Part 2: Two burglars rob the Binfords' home, and the dog is not able to stop them. Mr Binford brings him to Miss Lestrange's dog training camp, where he is trained to be more aggressive. But it seems they don't teach him how to tell right from wrong: first he attacks the burglars, but then he also attacks a policeman. He even starts a criminal career with the burglars. Will he get on the right path again or not?<br /><br />(Perhaps there are actually three parts. After part 1, they watch a Christmas home movie; that passage may be a separate part.)<br /><br />I liked the second part better than the first. I think it's funnier. But part 1 is still o.k., and it's much shorter than part 2. I liked the passage after the dog has returned from the training camp best; the way he catches one of the burglars, and his subsequent criminal career. And I liked the animation; it looks really good.<br /><br />All in all, a good episode in my opinion, but I like the episodes better that have more horror, mystery, or sci-fi. (This is almost pure comedy. There are some good jokes, but I think there could have been more.)<br /><br />Footnote: There was a spin-off series that was also called 'Family Dog' (1993), but I haven't seen it, so I don't know if it's good.
