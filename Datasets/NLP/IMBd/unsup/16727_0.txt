For my first comment on IMDb, i'd like to thank and congratulate the webmasters: this is one of my very favorite places on the internet! And also: sorry if my English is not perfect.<br /><br />I'd like to talk a little about futurama seasons 1 and 2: I have recently seen the french version and i can tell you this is an amazing show! All the characters are great, really funny (especially bender! the french voice is really really incredible) and the animation is very good. The stories are cool and original too. The new and futuristic universe created here is very entertaining: i've watched the complete two seasons in less than a week!! yes it's as good as this! I personally prefer futurama than the Simpson. I've met people who don't like it, but i don't understand why... they must be wrong, that's my comment! :) So don't miss seasons 1 & 2!! <br /><br />I must add that i've been really disappointed by seasons 3&4 :(((( it's almost bad! what happened?... is that because i'm bored after all that hours watching the first and the second season? well, i don't think so...
