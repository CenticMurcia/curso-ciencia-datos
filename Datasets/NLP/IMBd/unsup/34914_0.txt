Western miner Tim McCoy (as Slim Braddock) is cheated out of his claim by Karl Hackett (as Williams), but he can't prove anything. So, he becomes "The Phantom" bandit, and robs stages carrying Hackett booty. During a confrontation, Mr. McCoy is wounded; he dies in the care of son Eddie Buzard (as young Tim Braddock). Mr. Buzard quickly grows into McCoy (as old Tim Braddock), which is the main Braddock role. After pretty Joan Woodbury (as Helen Brennan) is introduced, the characters' ages are difficult to discern.<br /><br />McCoy is an odd "Phantom"; he makes no effort to hide his identity, and is plainly visible as "Slim Braddock". He also terrorizes citizens with kindness, and makes minor repairs on the coaches he robs. The most entertaining part of "Bulldog Courage" occurs when Paul Fix (as Bailey) arrives to blow-up a mine; he really uses his "noodle." After Mr. Fix is detained, McCoy does a wild impersonation of "Bailey"; with his obvious ability to memorize dialogue, and capture a character, "Braddock" should have been an actor instead of a minor.
