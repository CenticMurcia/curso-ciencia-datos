I couldn't wait til this movie would finally be released and when I got it for my birthday I couldn't wait to go home and watch it, but after seeing i felt like i wasted my aunt's money. Elaine Hendrix is probably the best actor in this entire movie. She does an awesome job as G2. Caitlyn Wachs does an okay job filling in as the role of Penny. However French Stewart does an awful job as Inspector Gadget. There are parts of the movie that are funny and good. Brain is one of the cutest beagles you will ever see and Inspector Gadget's car is so funny. And the bar scene made me laugh a little. However this isn't the movie I would recommend but what the heck give it a chance, you may like it. All I know is that i didn't.
