I enjoyed Brat 2. It certinly much better than most modern Russian movies. If you grew up in a Russian home, you'll feel immediatly at home with the style and psyche behind the film. I think that if Tarantino was a bit less intelligent and Russian, he would be making movies like this: action, some messages about life and a whole lot of gags that only Russians can understand. This movie was not meant to be artsy, as some Americans may view. It was filmed solely with the Russian-speaking public in mind. No, it's not politicly correct by any means, but that's realistic, and a nice change of pace for this movie goer. I don't really know how ANYONE could say it antisemitic. I'm Jewish and I didn't see anything offending in it. The "Fashist" (Russian phonetic here) was funny, if you ask me. He even seemed almost Jewish.<br /><br />But I can see how some one who does not understand Russian culture very well may misunderstand and be offended by it.<br /><br />Cest la vive.
