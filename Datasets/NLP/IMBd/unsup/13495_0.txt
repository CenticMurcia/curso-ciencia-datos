You can talk about what serbs are and everything, but what people don't understand is that serbians were in almost every single war on the world. WW1 & WW2 Then in 91 with the Croatians and Bosnians. It is true that i am a Serb, but my 2 best friends are Croatian. What the world is telling me (America) is that i want to kill croatians!! But thats not true. There is however people over there. Croatians want to kill serbs, and serbs that want to kill croatians, plus bosnians don't differ. The movie rane, shows how the young generation was growing up when Milosevic was in power. That is what made my country bleed and suffer. Drugs, money,alchocol,weapons communism poisoned my country then milosevic killed it. People have to realise that, how this movie was made...its based on truth. I don't understand, seems as though today everybody hates serbs, but through all this time we are still here...thats why our people have a saying "Samo Sloga Srbina Spasava" which translates - "Only Faith Saves Serbs"
