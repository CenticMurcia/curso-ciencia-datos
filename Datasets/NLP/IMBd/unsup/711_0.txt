Robert De Niro and Billy Crytal star in Analyze this.I loved this film a lot. Robert De Niro and Billy Crytal work so well together. Is that really such a surprise that two great actors would do great in a film? Well, I thought that De Nirop and Pacino would do well in Righteous kill. I never saw that film, but I heard it was crap, which was a bit of surprising news. This film reminds me a bit of the Hugh Grant comedy Mickey Blue eyes, though this film is a bit better, not a bit, but a lot. Not that Mickey Blue eyes was bad, it just wasn't as good as this. To wrap up my review, I will say that this is a great film from Harold Ramis, who is a great director. I don't know how you could get a better mob comedy. Though I loved The Whole nine yards.<br /><br />Analye this:****/****
