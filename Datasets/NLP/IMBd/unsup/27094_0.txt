A good, if not great, cult film starring Peter Weller as the jack-of-all-trades superhero. Great performances by John Lithgow and Jeff Goldblum in supporting roles. Lithgow in particular is good as a scientist driven mad by the eighth dimension. Many quotable lines make this movie a fun one to watch over again. A sequel advertised at the end of the movie evidently never made it into production.
