I took my two kids aged 7 and 10 to see this movie. They seemed to enjoy it, but I found it to be one of the worst movies I have ever had to sit through.<br /><br />The plot seems okay on the surface - A chimp who works as a spy. However it all goes downhill from there. There are many silly twists, characters that just don't fit and situations that are completely unbelievable. The film was obviously made on a tight budget and it shows. Nothing seems even remotely real.<br /><br />The director has made a number of animal movies in the past, specifically the MVP (Most Valuable Primate) and Airbud movies. This is easily his worst yet.<br /><br />Save your money and go see ANY other kids movie.
