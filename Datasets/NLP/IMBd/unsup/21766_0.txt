This title is probably more suited to males that have brothers but definitely is not exclusive to this group.<br /><br />Our main, wealthy brother has had a life changing experience and is now looking to bring his family back together. What's left of his family comprises his two brothers and his mom. He (Owen) will spare no expense or detail to make sure that the end result of this journey will bring his family closer. There are PLENTY of adventures along the way that make this task more daunting than it should have been. By most accounts, these feelings (that the brothers share) could of been aired out during a Thanksgiving dinner but clearly, our group needs more time and energy to be heard. Their adventures make sense and it shows how dis-functional blood relations can be.<br /><br />Great writing, along with a spectacular cast make this character driven masterpiece worth investing time in.<br /><br />Expect some laughs, maybe a tear but also, make the time to follow a great story line. This is not a typical Hollywood format. But then again, that might be why I loved it so much.
