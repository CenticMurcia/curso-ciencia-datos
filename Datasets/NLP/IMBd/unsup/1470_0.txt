I've been a Joan fan for a while now, so when I saw the laser disc for this movie I got it right away. <br /><br />I was definitely not disappointed.<br /><br />This movie has got a great story that could actually happen in real life. <br /><br />Joan gives a great performance as usual, of course Joseph is also perfect as the man she falls in love with at the same time saving her life. <br /><br />A great movie to watch if you like romance and a beautiful setting for a movie Italy.
