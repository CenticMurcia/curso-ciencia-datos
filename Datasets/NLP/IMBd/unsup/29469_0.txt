I loved Kisna and Vivek Oberoi in this role. He plays a young Indian man named Kisna, who falls in love with a young British girl (played by Antonia Bernath) who has loved him since they were toddlers. As they grow into teenagers, her militant father discovers her affections for Kisna and vice versa then chooses to send his darling daughter back to England to live to keep her from Kisna. The story of their love is told in a very James Cameron's Titanic like fashion, as the old lady Catherine (now played by Polly Adams) returns to the land where she was born to retell the story of her lost love Kisna which we see in flashback as she is interviewed by some lucky reporters. Isha Sharvani makes her debut and Kisna India sweetheart who gives her British counterpart a run for her money and then some as she dances her way through this film with vigorous fervor. Caroline Langrishe plays Catherine's mum, and Amrish and Om Puri round out the powerful cast with strong starring roles. Don't miss Sushmita Sen's super sexy Mujra, she plays a courtesan who helps Kisna keep Catherine and her mother on the run from those who want the both of them dead. An evil prince (played by Rajat Kapoor) who wants to marry Catherine is also on their tail in the wake of the British partition of India and Pakistan. Hrishitaa Bhatt also has a brilliant cameo in the film as Kisna's friend's wife.
