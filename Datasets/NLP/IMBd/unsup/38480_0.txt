Saban feeds on the leftovers of another steam-free franchise; the first two movies were no great shakes but they were better than this low-rent DTV mess. Following Raul Julia's death and the departure of the rest of the cast (bar Carl Struycken as Lurch), the series drops into a gaudy mixture of cut-price CGI and unbearable overacting by a miscast bunch headed by Tim Curry and Daryl Hannah. Curry's saved more than one bad movie, but not this time. Joke free and even stingier on the plot front than before, this uses its holiday resort mix-up plot in which the Addams family are accidentally reunited with the unrelated Adams family as a slim excuse for a series of underdeveloped subplots and idiotic slapstick. Something of a travesty, it fires wide in every department.
