When I popped Abel Ferrera's DRILLER KILLER into my DVD player, I was expecting something. What it was that I was expecting was a twisted and sick slasher flick. It had a little bit of that, but not enough to redeem it. It looked as though it was trying to be an art-house movie, only with some B-rate exploitation in the mix.<br /><br />Director Ferrera plays a struggling New York City who lives in a tiny apartment with his girlfriend and her rather annoying best friend. And he's trying to paint a bizarre picture for a snobby art critic. Then a punk band moves next door and plays music at all hours of the night. What does the artist do? He randomly takes a power drill and starting killing homeless people with it.<br /><br />I'm actually rather surprised that DRILLER KILLER made it into the infamous "Video Nasties" list. Really, I'd say less than 25% of this movie is actual exploitation killing, and the scenes aren't even that gory. Most of the movie is just scenes of Ferrera losing his mind. It tries to be an art-house horror film on a low budget, but fails.<br /><br />The horror scenes were the only redeemable things about DRILLER KILLER. But other than that, the film is just not worth it. If you want to see some of Abel Ferrera's other works, check out BAD LIEUTENANT or THE KING OF NEW YORK.
