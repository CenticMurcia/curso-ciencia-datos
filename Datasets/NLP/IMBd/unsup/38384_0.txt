Curse is a standalone movie, which is part of the problem. You got this wacked out scientist who got hold of Toulon's puppets, and who obligingly let him know they're alive and willing to help him. Why they're willing to (initially) kill for him isn't clear.<br /><br />George Peck's off-key performance is another problem: he acts like a thirty-year old in bad aging makeup. Maybe he is 60-70 like he is supposed to be, but he looks and acts really odd. And why does he have a 25 year old daughter?!?<br /><br />There are very few people to like here, which also hurts. The romantic leads are vaguely sympathetic, but the scientist, the obnoxious town sheriff, the local town bully, etc., are all very unlikeable, making them slaughter-fodder.<br /><br />The worst problem though, is the end. The movie just...stops. run credits! Whaaatt? Who knows. Catch the sequel, #7, when it comes out, I guess.<br /><br />The uninteresting human characters mean that the puppets have to hold center stage. They're pretty much relegated to the odd gory slaughter or two, though. Even they seem somewhat confused as to what their motives are here. Jester and Leech Woman are relegated to the background as always, Blaze is missing (despite, as noted, his appearance in the opening credits), and the only new puppet we get is the new TV/Tank puppet, which appears for about 30 seconds at the end of the movie.<br /><br />Definitely the weakest entry in the Puppet Master series. Even at the worse of time, the others in the series have had something to contribute. But Curse... just hangs there with nothing to support it or recommend it.
