When I rented this, I was all ready for a good old-fashioned, old-school hack fest. Alas, I was bitterly disappointed. <br /><br />I obviously didn't rent this movie for good acting or a believable plot. But I do require gore, and if there are going to be lots of hot women, I need a little gratuitous nudity. I got neither! A couple glops of fake blood and two women making out was it.<br /><br />The film tries to overcome all of these dire shortfalls with comedy- sort of a mish-mash of gags and jokes paying homage to the horror genre as a whole. I chuckled a couple times, but they were the kind of chuckles that slip out when you are desperately seeking to be entertained.<br /><br />Don't bother with this one. 2/10
