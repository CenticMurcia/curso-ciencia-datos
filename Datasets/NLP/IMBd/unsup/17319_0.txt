TCM:B is not bad compared to conventional crappy horror. It shows the "beginning" and birth of our favorite horror star Leatherface, and his mad family. (read plot summary for details). So here's the wrap-up: The good: Better gore, better use of the chainsaw by Leatherface, nice cinematography, nice story which underlays the first one.<br /><br />The bad: more or less the same story, nothing original out of the ordinary. Ermey stole most of the madness, with less leatherface on screen The ugly: plot holes/gaps, bad editing, shaky camera at the end Now, the trivia in the IMDb says there were even more gorier scenes that was cut. This was sad. 'cos basically, the golden rule of a sequel to any horror is that it should be scarier/gorier/bloodier than the first one. Though there were some nice gore scenes, it wasn't enough to surpass the first one.<br /><br />Anyways, wait for the unrated DVD if you want to see the gore. Otherwise give it a pass.
