I'm a big fan of horror, and I thought I would hate this film, as most adaptations from games tend to be b*llocks, but I found it very good. The story itself is quite meager, but hey, the Texas Chainsaw Massacre wasn't written by Tolstoj either. Action is good to very good, and tension is well kept throughout the film.<br /><br />I'm not easily impressed by overwrought fighting or action scenes (e.g. The Matrix) but the scene in the hallway with the lasers is great.<br /><br />Being fond of Romero's work, it was fun to see the zombies back in action. Especially the zombie-dogs (mutant, zombie, infected, whatever).<br /><br />Don't expect grand insights, moving scenes on the subject of the human mind, or being moved to tears. This one is a roller-coaster, baby, nothing more, nothing less.<br /><br />Hang on and enjoy the ride.
