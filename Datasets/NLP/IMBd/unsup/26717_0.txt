If you like movies that are difficult to predict. This is one of them. Plus it is the only skiing-re-incarnation movie I know of. The ending does not follow logically, but for me it asks the question: What is next? The performances by the actors were fun. There appeared to be on-set tensions that were inscrutable. I felt the whole production was fresh. There are no doubt many who are used to chewing the chewed as far as film drama goes...perhaps they will find this approach confusing. But how does the truly unexpected enter our lives? Should we always expect to see the unexpected in the same old way. THAT would be truly illogical.
