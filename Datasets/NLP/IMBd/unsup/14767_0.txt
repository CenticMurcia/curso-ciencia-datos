Whatever people say about this or any movie, you are your own best critic. This movie gets better with watching.<br /><br />When I first watched "Milk Money", I initailly squirmed when V and Tom were talking. V is talking about sex, and Tom is talking about math.<br /><br />Another point people might squirm is when a mother thinks Tom and V are brother and sister, and mentions to her children them as a good example. Then Tom kisses V in a way most people think brothers and sisters should not kiss. The kids are grossed.<br /><br />In other areas, it is a very good movie. In a gentle, and comic way, it deals with boys interest in sex and girls. It is done with the right balance. The boys all seem to be normal boys, in spite of the fact that no one has a "normal" family life. Who does.<br /><br />For instance, one of the boys is a neat freak because of his father, who unknown to him, has real issues. Later, he decides to stop washing. It's an overreaction, but there is truth when the father blames (wrongly) Tom for turning his son into a pig. Tom says at the boy is happy. He doesn't say it, but it is implied unlike before.
