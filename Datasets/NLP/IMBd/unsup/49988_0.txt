A group of average American college students head to the Emerald Isle strictly for the 'shrooms. Funny, never saw that in any Ireland brochure, must be a well kept secret, but I guess if it's in a direct-to-video movie it must be true. This is a good looking film, the production value is good considering it's obvious a low budget project. Lots of convincing dirt and grime as most of the action takes place in a damp Irish forest. The atmosphere is effectively ominous. I found some of the scenes, although admittedly supposed to be taking place at night, too dark to really see what's going on, which was frustrating at times. The violence, disappointingly takes place mostly off screen, but you get an adequate look at some damaged body parts and corpses which is nicely done. The lead actress, who reminds me of a certain cast member from Scrubs, seizes, "trips" and hyperventilates her way into our hearts. Generally the acting is mostly just adequate, but I thought she was the best of the lot. I found the ending to be mostly uninspired and unoriginal. Could really see it coming. But, despite all this, hey, I've seen worse. MUCH worse. The director shows definite talent and I will keep an eye peeled for any of his future projects. All and all a 4/10
