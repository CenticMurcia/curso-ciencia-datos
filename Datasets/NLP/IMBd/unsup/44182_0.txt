Yes, the first Iron Eagle movie was predictable, totally 80's and far-fetched...BUT it was entertaining and fun to watch. I guess the producers of this movie figured they could write a movie with airplanes in it, name it Iron Eagle and it would be another sleeper hit. Those idiots could not have been more wrong.<br /><br />I was excited when I heard about this movie and eagerly tuned in to watch when lo and behold you see the hero from the first Iron Eagle, Jason Gedrick, get KILLED in the first 5 minutes! Then you think, well maybe he's still alive, after all, in the first movie you thought Lou Gossett Jr's character was killed and yet he turns up alive and well at the end! Alas, the very next scene after you see Gedrick's plane explode, they cut to a military guy saying "No, the kid's dead and buried..." thus removing all doubt that the entire rest of the picture will be without him. I sat stunned for the next 10 minutes, mouth agape, missing several key plot points while I sat there thinking to myself, "They really killed him? That's it? You mean they really KILLED HIM?!?". Then that's when I started getting upset and hating this movie and everything about it....that clinched it....<br /><br />This movie continues to be the only movie I have ever walked out on...I watched up to the point where his fly buddy that is up there when he gets killed sits down with the Russians to plan the attack to take place later in the film and then I couldn't take it anymore...I never saw what happens next, nor do I ever care to find out.....<br /><br />The reason Gedrick didn't make this movie is because he was busy making the Oscar-winning movie "Rooftops" (note HUGE amount of sarcasm here)at the time it was made. Maybe if Gedrick actually starred in this movie all the way through instead of being deleted from it, it could of had a slight chance of being a halfway decent film.<br /><br />Damn you, stupid producers of this movie, for making such vile filth -- if I could exact an equally torturous punishment upon you it would be having you watch the Spanish language version of "Rooftops" with French subtitles in it's entirety six times back to back without a break.......
