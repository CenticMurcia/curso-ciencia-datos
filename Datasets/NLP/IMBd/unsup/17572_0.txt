I was able to view this film at its American premiere at an historic theatre in Macon, GA. Why Macon, GA? Because the Soong sisters were educated at Wesleyan College, in Macon, GA. I was a student at Wesleyan at the time and was already in awe of the "aura" of the Soong sisters. This film only increased that awe. Being a history major, historical films are often difficult to for me to watch whenever there are any inaccuracies. However, I was completely engrossed with this film from the first beautifully shot scene to the last. The artistic merit of this movie is enough of a reason to watch it. I can't recommend this film to everyone; it is long, about history, & has subtitles (which my husband would argue makes for a horrible film). If you like films which draw you in & leave you wanting more, this is a good addition to your collection.
