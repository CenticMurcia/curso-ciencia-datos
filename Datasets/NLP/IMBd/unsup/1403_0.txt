I've watched it 15 times in a row on an old VHS commercial<br /><br />release that includes The Raven... what a wonderful pair!<br /><br />Some comments seem to find it a plot hole when Lugosi kills a<br /><br />house pet and no one is alarmed -indeed, not something<br /><br />common in the world as we know it. My view is that the Black Cat is Karloff, whom Lugosi goes there to<br /><br />kill slowly... does he not? Also, in a few moments we see that Karloff has the same black cat<br /><br />in hand, very much alive, and he mentions the cat has nine lives. Other words are said about the two men having in effect already<br /><br />died years ago... look beneath the surface of this movie... don't<br /><br />take it literally, and much richness is there... the art deco, Bauhaus<br /><br />architecture... the wondrous infusion of Beethoven's 7th after the<br /><br />2nd appearance of the Black Cat. I could watch this movie a hundred more times and not tire of it.
