Here we have three interesting famous artists of all-time cinema, charming Bette Davis, polite and educated Leslie Howard with his English accent, and a terrible Humphrey Bogart as the villain of the film. Howard was an open poem, while Bette felt in love with him, but Bogart (Duke Mantee) came to continue his devastating activity. The Bogart's movements were somewhat different to his usual ones, and he was as terrible as Cagney in "Public Enemy" or Edward G. Robinson in "Little Caesar". It is my understanding that the film tried to demonstrate that smart sentences may be the best way to face a criminal. Normally those gangsters are unable to understand why their lives are so spoiled or why they behave in that way, so with a bit of smartly said words- and that's what Howard did with Bogart- the criminal may reflect a bit of what he is doing or may become lost in his misdemeanours.
