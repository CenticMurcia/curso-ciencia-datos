This is the type of movie that makes you think.<br /><br />Remember how you felt at the end (last 10 minutes) of the movie 6th Sense? Unearthed is a movie that will have you thinking the same way. Full of twists and turns, this movie gets better each time you see it.<br /><br />Excellent performances by John Bernath (Voss) and Slake Counts (Pinder) make this a great movie for either Horror or Sci-Fi fans. It does not fit neatly into a genre category and as such defies traditional movie plots that seem all too predictable.<br /><br />Well done and well worth the watch. Low budget doesn't have to mean bad movie any more. This is a film you will enjoy seeing more than once. Excellent Cinematography and a driving music score. Blood, guns, fast cars, alien warlords, dark cityscapes and women hanging on hooks.....what more could you ask for.<br /><br />REVIEW BASED ON SCREENER COPY OF UNEARTHED 2005
