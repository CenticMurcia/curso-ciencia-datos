Dracula: DEAD AND LOVING IT (2 outta 5 stars) It gets 2 stars only out of respect for what Mel Brooks had done before. I mean, just look at this film in comparison to "Young Frankenstein" or "Blazing Saddles" or "The Producers" or "Silent Movie"... hell, even "Spaceballs" is a work of genius compared to this! Oh sure, I found a couple of chuckles... but the script, the acting, the direction... its all sub-par. This could have been out by any comedy-movie hack team... its simply not worthy of The Great Mel Brooks! I guess if you are already chuckling at the idea of Leslie Nielsen playing Count Dracula you will probably enjoy this movie... but he can do these kinds of movie is his sleep by now... he doesn't really do anything that he doesn't done better before. Peter MacNicol seems to have the nest scenes... even if he does tend to overdo his role at times... a little less mugging would probably have made his role twice as funny. Other comic talent is pretty much wasted: Harvey Korman, Mark Blankfield and Mel Brooks himself as Van Helsing. (Hey, maybe if he'd played that part in "Van Helsing" instead of Hugh Jackman... now that woulda been something worth checking out!)
