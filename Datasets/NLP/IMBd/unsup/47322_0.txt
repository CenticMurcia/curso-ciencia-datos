I have 3 words for this movie; I-Hate-It. I hate it! I watched this in our school field trip once, and it automatically sucks! This is a piece of crap slapped with a bunch of dead animals and freaks. First of all I want to give a shout-out to the film producer Ralph Singleton and Director Mary Lambert; "Hello?! Have you ever heard of AA-NII-MAAL RIII-GHTSSS???" Oh, I'm sorry... It's just this movie sucks anyway! Thanks a lot Stephen King! I'm gonna kick your @** for this, not really.<br /><br />Sigh... And the story goes, the beginning sucks a lot; who would have thought of putting a real iron fence as a prop! They could have at least used... well... just like this movie, PLASTIC! Then the protagonist shouts "Moooooooommm!" Several times... what a Drama Queen! Yeah it's gay. A little later in the vet, a bunch kitties were sent... blah... blah... blah... then the protagonist's friend came in with a Siberian Husky (Hey, I like that dog!). Then, a few minutes later, the kitties turned into shrapnel, poom! Kitty go bye bye! A few more minutes, the dog was shot dead by that freak police officer. The dog is then buried, a little later, freaky police officer turned into freakier police officer after being bit by a zombie dog... ooh... ah... scary... Not!<br /><br />A few more minutes later... This the worst part I've seen and I want to kill them! Those harmless bunnies are torn apart and turned into dinner, I thought those things hanging in the cage were a bunch of stuffed toys, turns out to be rabbits! W.T.F.?! Gah! Only an d-bag would do that! At the near end the ghost mother shouted "blah... blah... (I forgot) Dead is better! Dead is better! Oh, God!" Oh, shut up b****! At the end the father and his son went off, away from that scumbag town! And the last part, showing the characters faces at the side, yeah... It's a barf bag! What a Cornball!<br /><br />By the way, my fictional nation considers this as the most controversial movie, because it's disrespecting! They shot a dog, which is sacred in the nation, showed some kittens that turned into shrapnel, mutilated a rabbit (so sad! They are a bunch of heartless morons!) and showed a taxidermized Pug (the most respected of all dogs in the nation) with an eye that doesn't fit, now it looked like the eye just popped off! My people are animal lovers! The Animal Liberation Front of Teryl (Teryl is my fictional country, I made it since I was in 4th grade, I'm in 12th grade now!) should have protested against this, and ban this for good!<br /><br />The movie's story is crap, the acting is just cheesy, and the lines are lame! Indeed, I'm an animal lover, mostly dog person! If you're an animal lover like me, destroy the VHS, VCD, or DVD or anything that played this crap, burn it, shred it, just don't bury it in the Pet Sematary in Maine! Okay, that's a little drastic... just curse Mary Lambert instead, it's her fault anyway!<br /><br />Overall I give this a 1 out of 10! That's it, I'm done!
