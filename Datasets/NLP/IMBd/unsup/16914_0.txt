When I first watched this movie, I thought of it as a "remake" of Dial M for Murder. I thought that it was really bad, seeing as how it's a "remake". But, after I thought of it as the same theme with a similar story, I started liking it more. I actually saw this before I saw Dial M for Murder, but although this was a good story I still found the original better. The acting in A Perfect Murder was very good. It was much better than I would have ever expected. This movie can't even be compared to Alfred Hitchcock's 'Dial M for Murder'. It still has a good plot. But, I wouldn't think of it as a "remake" because I was stuck trying to compare the two movies together, and it made this movie look really bad.
