This documentary, nominated for an Academy Award, is a look back in time at the traffic problems in and around Los Angeles circa 1946. Interesting but qute dated, it does show that Los Angeles had problems with traffic flows even 55 years ago. Turner Classic Movies runs this occasionally and invariably runs it in March as part of its "31 Days of Oscar" programming. Worth watching.
