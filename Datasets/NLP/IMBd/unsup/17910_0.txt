I feel that these films are great. Two brothers who make a living as Mafia hit men. I'm English so I don't fully understand the in-fighting between the Russian Mafia that goes on. The violence and shoot-outs are excessive but maybe that is the way it happens over there. The music is especially good even though I can't understand what the words are. Sergei Bodrov (The main character) who plays Danila Bogrov in both films is an excellent actor. It's a regret because there are probably loads of excellent foreign-speaking films out there that people could enjoy but can't be marketed.<br /><br />The problem with both films is the fact that there are elements of racism involved, plus the fact that World War II is often mentioned. I'm not sure, but the War must have affected them so completely that they still go on about so much, especially in Brother 2. A lot of the weapons that these guys use against each other are WWII orientated. Russian mind-set must be different to our own but these two films are must watch.<br /><br />Brother 1 concentrates purely on St. Petersburg, but Brother 2 involves Moscow & Chicago, especially concentrating on the differences between two of the major cities in the World. I don't want to spoil the film for you too much but Danila walks into a Black bar in downtown Chicago. Everyone stops talking & looks at him. Being new to America, he doesn't get that it's wrong. There's humour involved as well as violence.<br /><br />Both films are violent but I guess it's the way the Russian underworld works.
