This is a movie lover's movie. The perfect characters, sensual landscapes, delicious textures, and altogether mysterious plot. Although the riddle is not difficult to solve...in fact you may very quickly...the joy is in the getting there. The story weaves about in time and space, forming a fabric so fine that in the end you have lived a lifetime in the arms of the Red Violin. This is the perfect movie for a rainy autumn Sunday afternoon when everything is quiet but the popping of the fire and the creaking of your favorite easy chair.
