I really like the first Basket Case back in (1982) as it was very Gory also really funny and a lot of Fun<br /><br />And now they are back again and this movie start from by showing what happened at the end of The Basket Case, Soon start from the ending of the first movie<br /><br />The twins are now main headline on the news , Granny Ruth and her Grandaugter are watching the news and know who these two are, as they rush to the hospital, Duane and Belial break out of the hospital after he killed one of the doctors. <br /><br />Then Ruth hide them away from outside world with her family and then they find out that, Beiial is not one of a kinda as there are others like him in her house that she takes care of.<br /><br />Duane now feel like a normal person, wants to be a normal person and wants to leave but he ends up getting seen by the Reporter and now he has to stay has he as put the rest of the Freaks in danger of being found out.<br /><br />This movie not as Great as the cult classic Basket Case (1982). Is still great movie.<br /><br />There are very funny scenes in this movie and gore was good not as gory as the first but then make up effect for the Freaks were GREAT, or outstanding and I really like the way the movie ended as it perfect ending for this movie.<br /><br />I liked this movie as it was really good and the acting was great too I going to give this movie 7/10
