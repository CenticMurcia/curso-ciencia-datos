This was a cute film. By far, the closest to a "film" score soundtrack that I have heard in a television movie. The songs , the score were a perfect blend. Great job and kudos to Eric Allaman.<br /><br />If the film had a fault, it would have been nice to see a film actor in the role played well by Brian A. Green. It would have kicked the film up another notch. A well done job by all. Something nice on the resume.
