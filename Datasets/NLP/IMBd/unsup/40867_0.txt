Yes, I knew it would be stupid. But stupid CAN be funny. I won't go into depth about just how stupid and unfunny it was; i don't want to restate the obvious. The snake is eating its own tail when it comes to these spoofs. However, there are some things I expected to get from this movie other than laughs:<br /><br />1. Impersonations of at least "Saturday Night Live" quality (not that that's asking too much). -Um. No. This movie even made Darrell Hammond look like an amateur (and I think he's a pretty gifted comedian). What the heck was up with 'Samuel L. Jackson'? <br /><br />2. Topicality. The previews showed scenes borrowed from some pretty recent flicks. -Er... Punk'd? Scarface? 'I just saved money on my car insurance'? What, no Tom Cruise jumping on a couch?<br /><br />3. Touchstone cameos by 'real' celebrities, ala Dr. Phil in Scary Movie 4. -Nope. Nada. Zilch. Unless you count Crispin Glover doing a bad Johnny Depp doing a bad Johnny De... wait, see, I told you these spoofs were eating their tails.<br /><br />4. Alright, I'll admit it, I expected LAUGHS. STUPID laughs, but SOMETHING!!!! Where there ANY laughs? -I did chuckle at some of Jayma Mays' (Lucy) reactions. I'd like to see her in another movie. Any other movie. Any OTHER movie.<br /><br />Okay, I've officially wasted enough of my life on this stupid, pointless, sub-Date Movie flick. I resolve never to speak of it again.
