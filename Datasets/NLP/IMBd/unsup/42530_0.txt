One may thing that under the eye of a new Director, the Death Note films may have a fresh new start.<br /><br />Unfortunately no. This one is even longer and even more stupid.<br /><br />Adding violence and poor English is not how to spice things up. Neither is making a stupid plot involving L's CRAZZZYYYY adventure that happens within 21 days.<br /><br />Will someone please adapt this into a TV SERIES.<br /><br />The DN universe cannot be contained to a movies, this is the final nail in the coffin,<br /><br />Pass this one up.
