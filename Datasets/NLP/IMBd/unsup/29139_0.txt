This is one of the worst movies EVER! I can't explain clearly how bad this movie is! I know I said to myself that I would never write a comment on a bad movie, but people should know NOT to see this movie. If it is ever on STARz, or Showtime(which isn't a big surprise why it's on Showtime), trust me. DON'T WATCH IT! Unless you want to see guns going off without discharges flying out, bad acting, stunt doubles of a different color then the main star, or just how cool Gary Daniels is. Uh-hem, sorry I have a cold. Anyway, this movie would be better if there were some type of recoils from the guns. Sorry bad action lovers!(0 out 10 stars)
