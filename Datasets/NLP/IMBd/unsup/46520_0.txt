I traded this DVD for an AOL Free Trial CD and I am better man for it. I would rather down a bottle of Ipecac than watch five minutes of this "movie" again. The whole thing is interviews with out-of-work, coked-out celebrities giving staged interviews about "What if" Pauly Shore was dead. The highlights of the film include the foul mouth stylings of Verne Troyer, bitter about being short and a slightly coherent and heavily drooling Tom Sizemore. If you feel so compelled to buy this movie, I recommend you send me the $6 this costs at Target and I'll be happy come over and put a plastic bag over your head for few minutes... I promise, the effect will be the same.
