This was really a fun movie that had some great car action. The trailer I saw on TV looked pretty good but I didn't have much expectation since it was a cable movie. I ended up pleasantly surprised. The old and new GTOs looked great in the movie and the autoshow scene was pretty cool. I really liked Dennis Hopper's character and really liked the younger talent. The ending was a big surprise! I didn't see that coming. There was a nice development of the characters while still maintaining the action that I was looking for. The creator of the "Fast and the Furious" and "XXX" didn't disappoint for this cable flick. While, it may not have been worthy of the big screen, I would actually watch it again. For a made-for-TV movie, I gave it a 9. I usually won't bare to sit through made-for-TV movie. This one was worth it.
