Unfortunately, I found this movie to be only mildly entertaining. Paul Hogan revises his role in this comedy drama as the Australian crocodile hunter Mick Dundee. His real life wife Linda Kozlowski also joins him taking the role of his girlfriend Sue Charlton. I found the plot line to be weak, although some of the humor was good, particularly the parts dealing with cultural differences. George Hamilton makes a cameo in the movie as does Mike Tyson, both of which are complete surprises. This movie is matinee material at best and only if you have 90 minutes to waste. Younger children should not view this movie as there are some questionable situations.
