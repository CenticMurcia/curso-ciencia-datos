1st watched 1/6/2007 - 3 out of 10(Dir-Alan Metter): Mostly un-funny attempt by Rodney Dangerfield to carry a movie with his bad jokes, bad taste but somewhat charming elderly man trying to do things the way he knows how film. The movie tries to pull off the fact that he has a good heart in the end which pulls the movie up a little bit but not enough for me to recommend it. This is basically the story of a man who's made it in life the hard way without even a high school diploma but decides to follow in his kid's footsteps and tries to attend college himself to help his boy's attitude after he hands divorce papers to his second wife. He starts out doing it the way he knows how -- by buying people and getting others to do the hard work but is caught by the college authorities and has to shape up. Dangerfield & a young Robert Downey Jr. are good for a couple of laughs but that's about it, so it was a nice try but this comic can't carry an entire movie with his schtick, and the basic boy meets girl premises added into the mix for both himself and his son doesn't help the movie much either.
