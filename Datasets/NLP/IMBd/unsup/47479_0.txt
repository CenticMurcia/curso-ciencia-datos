Awful, tedious and utterly ridiculous action flick starring the very beautiful and talented Michelle Yeoh and Ben Chaplin. A script beyond salvation, uninteresting action scenes and terrible CGI make "The Touch" a complete waste with little to offer the spectator. The story makes no sense even though its very obviously inspired (stolen) by other famous movies and uses the same clich√©s all over again. Even the actors seem as bored as the audience. Not even Yeoh can do anything with such poor material. Chaplin is miscast and Richard Roxburgh is just another stupid villain. Why three talented actors such as these accept such a flawed project may only be explained by a hefty paycheck at the end of the day. It truly is a shame. The Touch is unoriginal, bland and even embarrassing. Stay away.
