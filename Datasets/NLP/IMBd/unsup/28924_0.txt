A wonderful movie that shows the saga of heroes that began the construction of the history of western space conquest in parallel with aces that never went to space in despite of their skills, like Chuck Yeager. It also deals with the problem of crew's management and the role of the government in the space exploration. All movie is well done, with brilliant actors (attention on Ed Harris as John Glenn) and a long sleepless story.
