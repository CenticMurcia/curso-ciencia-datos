When I saw the previews (and the reviews on here) I was expecting a funny and warm story about a radio show. I am sure many people would say that's what this film is, and maybe it is. Perhaps you have to be familiar with the actual radio program to fully appreciate this movie. I found it to have a very scattered feeling to it, and my friends agreed. Kevin Kline's character was so cheesily awful and over-played (no fault of Kline's - that's how it was written), and Garrison Keillor lacked likability or charm. Also, the woman in white was just completely unnecessary and made no sense. The only redeeming parts of this film were when Woody Harrelson and John C. Reilly were on stage. Their singing was the best of the whole film; I was really impressed with their harmony. Also, the dirty jokes towards the end cracked us up (especially since it was the only bright spot of actual humor in the whole film). So, if you're an established fan of the radio show, this movie might be something you'll enjoy. If you've never heard the show, maybe not.
