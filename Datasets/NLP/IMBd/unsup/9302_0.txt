I risked this movie after reading comments here and elsewhere. Lets say that though Megalodon has a cool idea (prehistoric shark comes out of a fissure that gets opened up leading to a deeper underwater prehistoric ocean), the movie blows big time. Take the plot, and throw would could have been interesting and suspenseful right into the toilet and replace it with a story that plods along accompanied by actors who come from the "high, I just got into acting and am having fun trying to do this part" school of thought. There are a few interesting characters, and a few people show that they have acting potential, and if you get into the frame of mind where you can deal with all the large amounts of shiny computer game cgi, then there is still the problem that the movie just sucks anyways. It has that awful filmed, ultra low budge cinematography look to it, with lots of things extremely scrunched up real close in the frame (probably to hide the cheap backgrounds, but clearly the cinematography just sucks). The editing is also terrible, with places where you feel like saying yourself "ok, you can cut now, the moment is over, cut already." Do yourself a favor, if your looking for a decent shark movie outside of the jaws series, try Deep Blue Sea, or Red Water. Otherwise, here's to the day when the movie Megalodon becomes extinct.
