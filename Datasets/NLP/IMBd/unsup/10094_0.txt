Next to the original "The Nightstalker" this may well be the best made-for-TV vampire flick there is. A superb cast led to a superior offering. Special effects were correctly kept to a minimum, allowing the story and performances to carry this hidden gem. Jason Miller gave a wonderful, sympathetic performance. I read where his portrayal of the vampire Voytek is Richard Lynch's favorite role, and well it should be - he is marvelous! I only wish that he would have been able to reprise his role in the series that never was.<br /><br />It is a rare film that leaves a favorable impression after 27 years. Rarer still one that was produced for the small screen. Vampire, for me, is such a film. To the Powers That Be: please release this on DVD soon. It is long overdue. A few extras would be nice too.
