For the longest time, this was my least favorite stooge short. The stooges with Joe Besser and an outer-space plot was always a warning sign that you were to be witness to cinematic poop. Though, fishing for something positive to say, I have had the "pleasure" of watching HORSING AROUND, which reaches to an even lower depth than this prize of a stooge short.<br /><br />0.5/10
