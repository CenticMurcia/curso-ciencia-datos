I vacillated in my review between 1 (awful) and 2 (not quite awful, I suppose). This movie has no plot to speak of. Someone compared it to "Hester Street" and "Atlantic City" in the way "it achingly proves the universality of the twin globalization pulls of modernization and immigration over the past three hundred years around the world." The exception is that those two fine movies have plots and characters you care about. That same reviewer said it "is one of the saddest films I've ever seen . ." I agree with that. I was sad, too, that I had to sit through this melancholy non-story filled with vapid characters. Go see this movie if you want a good nap.
