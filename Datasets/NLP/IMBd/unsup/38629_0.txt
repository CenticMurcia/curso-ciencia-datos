Flat horror anthology framed by story of college students being taught "The Psychology of Fear" by creepy professor Edward Derek (Ramy Zada) who invites them to his house one night so they can swap scary stories.<br /><br />Story number one is about husband and wife (Nadine Van Der Velde and Marc McClure) who take the long, scenic route home late at night and when the inevitable car trouble takes place, they venture inside the obligatory Spooky Mansion Where Grisly Murders Happened. Mostly just lame, this story is however not totally without tension and does feature a sadistic final twist.<br /><br />Story number two is about some air headed teenage girls who hope to have a night of fun but end up lost in the "bad" part of town, pursued by a degenerate predator (Luis Contreras) and his three killer dogs. Not scary at all, nor very involving, but it has a literally incendiary finale. Horror buffs may recognize Judie Aronson of "Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter" and Penelope Sudrow of "A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors" in this story. At least Ms. Sudrow doesn't get her head rammed through a TV here.<br /><br />Story number three is the mild best of the bunch, with a message service operator (Marg Helgenberger) being menaced by pathetic yet undeniably dangerous loony (Alan Rosenberg, Helgenberger's real-life husband). The bad guy keeps working his way back to her, leading to a decent final shot. Helgenberger is pretty good in this segment - in fact, she's one of the best things in the whole picture.<br /><br />The framing story wraps up with the arrival of an uninvited guest and this leads to some of the film's more outr√© horror. However, the denouement struck me as dumb and annoying.<br /><br />Probably one of the things that bugged me the most was Jillian McWhirter's underwhelming work as the film's prescient central character.<br /><br />Overall, lightweight and forgettable genre fare. Its stories are not particularly memorable, and it is never at any time even remotely frightening. The writers / producers / directors, Jim and Ken Wheat, couldn't really pull this off.<br /><br />3/10
