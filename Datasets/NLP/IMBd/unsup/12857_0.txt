Jamie Harris (Marguerite Moreau) is a young woman that works giving original names to different products. She has a promiscuous life, with affairs with "Mr. Wrongs", differently of her sister that has a steady relationship with her boyfriend. Jamie misses her mother, who committed suicide when she was a child, and her father blames himself for the death of his wife. When Jamie dates her former professor John (Naveen Andrews), for whom she had a crush, she believes she found her prince charming. Meanwhile she meets Mick (Brian F. O'Byrne), the host of a TV show, and they become friends. When John ends his relationship with Jamie, she decides to begin a celibate for three months, and she becomes closer to Mick. After some wrong decisions, Jamie finally commits with her true love.<br /><br />"Easy" is a delightful and sexy romance, supported by a delicious and wonderful screenplay and great direction and performances, but mostly by this lovely actress Marguerite Moreau. The witty and sensual character of Jamie Harris is credible because of the magnificent performance of the expressive and gorgeous Marguerite Moreau, and I really felt in love for her. The director Jane Weinstock shows a tight and sensitive direction in her first feature, and I expect to see another work of this promising professional. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Easy  Sem Compromisso" ("Easy  Without Commitment")
