i was shocked by the this very very very bad movie, i can't believe fox video was not ashamed to release it. people complain that Christian films like Time Changer have bad acting (which it didn't), but this, this was just bad! a group of second graders could do a better job at acting. not to mention the horrible dialogs, who ever wrote the script should be fired. i was rolling on the floor laughing till my sides hurt because it was that bad. the directors obviously had a very low budget since half the scenes, which were suppose to be all different where all in the same location and they didn't try to hide that. oh, and did i mention how bad the acting was? so, in conclusion, if you want to laugh at hell-y-wood for making cheesy films, this is the one! i promise you your sides will hurt because you'll be laughing soooooo hard!<br /><br />ps. the acting was bad
