When I saw this turkey in 1970, there were no rewind buttons for it was in a theater. So I could not go back and check this. . . But I am sure that in the final seconds, as Grieg is running up the street to his home and Nina, his arms swinging as one's arms do when running, he passes a young girl traveling in the opposite direction - and his hand smacks her rump sending her sprawling off camera . . . I have often wanted to see the end of this film again to see if my memory is correct. Or was it finally edited out? Did anyone else catch this best moment of the film? It rather ruined the 'return to his true love, to make up for all the wrong he'd done her' ending for me.
