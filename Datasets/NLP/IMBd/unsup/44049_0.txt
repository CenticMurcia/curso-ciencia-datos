I have quite eclectic taste in movies and will give any genre a shot but I sure wish I bypassed this one. The story was so dull that I actually envied the main character in the scenes where he is in the dentist's chair because root canal surgery is preferable than viewing this film.<br /><br />There is not a single character in the movie that seems real and its not the fault of the actors they were simply working such a terrible script that there was no hope of rescue.<br /><br />Normally I would write quite an in depth review but this film does not warrant one and the only reason I wrote anything at all was to maybe save 1 or 2 other people enduring the hell on earth I have just endured.<br /><br />Only one mans opinion of course but I am sure others have felt the same hope its of some use to someone.
