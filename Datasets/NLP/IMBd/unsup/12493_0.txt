The only reason I decided to check this movie out is the presence of Maggie Q, in one of her earliest roles. She looks very pretty here and plays two roles (twin sisters), but neither gives her much to do. Unless you are a completist who needs to see EVERY one of her films, this one can be safely skipped. Thank God she did "Naked Weapon" right after this and turned into an international action star. My main problem with "Manhattan Midnight" is that it tries too much (especially with that overbearing music score) to play like some sort of poetic tragedy, when its main character is a smug, unredeemable professional killer who doesn't mind killing innocent people (the "second" Maggie twin being an exception), and whom by the end you'll probably want to see dead as well. And he would be dead, if only the cops and the other killers who are shooting at him, in the increasingly silly action set pieces, were not such completely lousy shots. Perhaps the only people who are praiseworthy in this flick are those of the makeup department - they really did a great job. *1/2 out of 4.
