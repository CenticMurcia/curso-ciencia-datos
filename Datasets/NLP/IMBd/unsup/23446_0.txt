At a time in my life when everything seems to be going wrong, I have caught myself being detached from my children and spending way too much time stressing over life and responsibilities. This was a wonderful reminder to remember what is really important in this life! I have found that going back to the time of imagination and innocents with my little girl has given me some relief from my many stresses. I know they are still there, but I need to take more time outs from them, like I did this weekend, and spend REAL quality time with the most important little people in my whole world! Apparently IMDb did not think that I had said quite enough about how much I loved this movie and loved watching it with my little girl - so I will just reiterate that this was the best Eddie Murphy movie I think I have ever seen!
