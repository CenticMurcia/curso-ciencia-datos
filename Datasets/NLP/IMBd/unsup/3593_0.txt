I have just watched Strip Nude For Your Killer this evening and i found it to be a very good film it features several good looking young women who are working for this model agency who agree to strip for this photographer. But at the same time there is a murder on the loose who is out to kill as many of the models as possible. there are some very gory moments in the film, and it also features a lot of nudity in many sences as the title says. I found the dubbing of the actors not to bad which is good compared to other films i have seen. I think that Andrea Bianchi is a good director from what i have seen in this film. Good Movie!(Recommended).
