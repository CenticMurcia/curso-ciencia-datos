As a longtime fan of Rocket Robin Hood, Spider-Man and Captain Nemo, the references this film makes are hysterical. But where it really shines is in its take on Left vs Right wing ideologies. I see it was made in 2000, but is more relevant now in this post 9-11 world. I think the people who hated the style of animation missed the point; I thought it was traditional cell work until I found out it's all 3-D work made to look bad. THAT is GENIUS! <br /><br />According to the website, it looks like the filmmakers are planning a Christmas episode; I wonder if unchecked consumerism will be skewered as effectively as politics. Incidentally, if you do go to their website Hoverboy-dot-com, you'll find lots of support material. These guys clearly love the types of cartoons they're parodying and you can see it in their brilliant homages.<br /><br />Absolutely loved it!
