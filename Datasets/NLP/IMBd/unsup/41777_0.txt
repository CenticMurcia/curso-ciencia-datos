This movie had so many problems I don't know where to start. The plot relies heavily on coincidences, often preposterous ones; I don't want to spoil any of the plot, but the way two of the characters are thrown together in close quarters is just wholly unbelievable. The obligatory throw-guy-through-pane-of-glass moment looks pretty much obligatory and gratuitous, and the oh-so-significant soundtrack songs are intrusive at best and would've been better suited to an '80s teen romance. The script is poorly written enough to make Irene Bedard, normally a great actress, seem wooden. If you just want a good action movie, there are hundreds of better movies to choose from. And if you're looking for a good movie about Navajo people, try the independent documentary "Return of Navajo Boy" instead.
