This came on after some other movie, on TV and it ran for awhile in the background until I got up to look and see, was it really as bad as it sounded? Answer: worse.<br /><br />The writing is, well, what writing. No actor could make it jump, and Keith did not disappoint in this area. There was no pop, no drama, no NUTTIN' in his voice. I sat through a few mins of it and can only say it is no wonder we are turning into a 3rd class country. We can't write our way out of a paper bag, we do not have actors that can act, preferring to import them from elsewhere, etc etc etc.<br /><br />This flick is as bad as it gets. I shan't even start in on the visual. All involved with this flick ought to be drummed out of the business and never allowed in the industry again. It is as bad as it gets. Worse.
