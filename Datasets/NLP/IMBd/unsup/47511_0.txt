Brooks revisits classic horror territory after Young Frankenstein; this time it´s Dracula who gets the Brooks treatment, but this poor spoof is evidence that lightning doesn´t strike twice. Although the movie is beautifully photographed, looking almost like a vintage Hammer movie, there are barely any laughs. Leslie Nielsen is not quite up to his usual Frank Drebin deadpan comedy routines, and even though Peter MacNicol delivers a note perfect Dwight Frye (Renfield in the 1931 version), as well as good turns from Harvey Korman and Brooks himself, the final result is depressingly unfunny. Hilarious stake-through-the-heart scene, though!
