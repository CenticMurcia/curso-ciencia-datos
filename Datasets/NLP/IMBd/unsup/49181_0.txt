The absolute worst of the trilogy, not even comedy could save it ... Unrealistic, unbelievable, loud sudden sounds the only scary component. Really should have quit after one ... No. two was bad but not in the ball park compared to this disaster. Nev Campbell the only saving grace with the four votes given placed solely on her performance having to work under atrocious conditions.
