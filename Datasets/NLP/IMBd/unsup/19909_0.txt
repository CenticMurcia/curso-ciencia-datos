1939 is considered to be one of the best years for filmmaking in Hollywood, and indeed it is,"Wuthering Heights","Wizard of Oz", "Gone With The Wind","Dark Victory","Ninotchka" just to name a few, all came out in that year. But one film seldomly mentioned along with these is, "You Can't Cheat an Honest Man," a fabulous comedy written by "Charles Bogle" is one W.C. Fields' greatest comedies. This one involves Fields (as Larson E. Whipsnade) as a crooked carnival operator, being constantly pestered by Charlie McCarthy, while trying to stay one step ahead of the sheriff. But it is all just an excuse to show Fields doing some of his best comedy routines. No real coherent plot, it dosen't need one! The barbs passed between McCarthy and Fields has them both in their prime. With Edgar Burgen doing some routines that made him famous. Mortimer Snerd even makes an appearance.And who can forget that ping-pong match! Watch then agree, that this is one of the best comedies of the time and deserving of being placed on the list of classics of 1939. Best Line: "Someone stole the cork from my lunch."
