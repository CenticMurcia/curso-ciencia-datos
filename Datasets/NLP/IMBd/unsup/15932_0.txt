Norma Shearer was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance in this film. A very powerful role, the part was even a greater challenge than THE BARRETTS OF WIMPOLE STREET or ROMEO AND JULIET simply because it really showcased all of her range. From girlish delight, to arch queen and dignified royal, flirting with Tyrone Power and then the deep love she felt for the dauphin. The scene where they take the dauphin away.....and then they come for her son, Shearer goes from sheer disbelief that they could be so inhuman, to fighting them off like a tigress, her hair and arms flying around, before they call in more guards. When she says goodbye to "my baby" saying; "we shall be together soon," knowing that all will perish, is nothing short of one of the most brilliant moments on screen.
