Tom, now a cowboy (or cowcat) on a farm somewhere in Texas is involved in his usual pursuit of Jerry when a gorgeous girl cat arrives. He is immediately smitten and falls in love, hoping to impress her with a tough guy act, and serenading her with a mimed song.<br /><br />Not taking too kindly to being treated as a slave in his love game, Jerry messes up Tom's plans and gets him on the wrong side of the farmyard bull. It's a pretty funny cartoon, especially when Jerry tampers with the speed of the record Tom is miming to, and there's quite a bit of inventive visual humor too. I just wish that Tom would get the girl for once.
