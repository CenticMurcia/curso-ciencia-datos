Humm where do I start.<br /><br />First off, Cayo doesn't offer any interesting visuals. Its a shame since it was filmed mainly on the beautiful island of Culebra (i know its beautiful because I've been there, if you judge it from watching the film..well..its just OK) <br /><br />The photography is just average, no consistent efforts (filters, waiting for the best time of day) to produce nice colors. Basically looks like it was filmed at midday on the harsh tropical sun, with skies blown out, silvery and turbid water, or during not so great weather.(seen on some water shots). <br /><br />Maybe is was a bad film print, can be fixed, but regardless looks like production compromise and or error, not on purpose.<br /><br />Its cool, but nothing new, that they told the story by methodically revealing the scenes of the character's past while they live in their presently tragic situation. Its what keeps one semi interested. But, while the clothes and styling somewhat matches the different times of the actors lives, the movie doesn't use color enough to distinguish them. <br /><br />The editing could be a lot lot better, since the movie doesn't "flow" well most of the time and the music could've used some help.<br /><br />Also, The director tries to blend in some political satire and humor but it isn't effective and its way to literal and silly on the verge of stupid and definitely cheapens the film.<br /><br />There are some decent scenes. The detoxification of the female drug addict (Daris Mejias) is one of them, very powerful and emotional, and the acting of young Ivan(Kamar De Los Reyes) while he is having some problems with his wife in his NYC is Good (along with Roselyn) making for a decent scene.<br /><br />Casting was OK, but OMG, what happened to Roselyn when she got old!!, she didn't age gracefully, looks like she got run over by a truck!! (sorry Idalia Perez!). Even though Idalia can act, its a wrong casting choice IMHO.<br /><br />I know that not many movies are made in PR and that people that have been in the industry a long time are rewarded with parts in one once one its finally made but that fact certainly doesn't help the film. <br /><br />But overall the movie looks like too many people made choices on it and doesn't have a definitive style. Which is a shame since its concept warranted a much much better treatment.<br /><br />Yes this review is a little tough BUT, I'm trying to be objective and not let things pass due to the fact that Puerto Rican cinema is quite lacking in quantity, actually a rare occurrence, and just producing one on film is an achievement, but producing a quality piece is another matter, and Cayo doesn't deliver. I'm not going to write a bogus review just to promote a film (and don't ave any agenda against anyone)<br /><br />So yes, some points for the excellent PR crew (stylists, grips, gaffers etc) for actually producing something on film :) :) , its hard work. Negative points for production compromises and some bad choices.<br /><br />Some advice, don't try to make a complicated or huge movie with little money, doesn't work, shoot on video if you have to, and in a more accessible and hence, more economical, location. Keep it simple :)
