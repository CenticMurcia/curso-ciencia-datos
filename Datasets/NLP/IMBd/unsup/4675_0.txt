This summary contains spoilers.<br /><br />For Revolutionary War buffs (yes the species does exist) the pickings in the film industry are pretty slim, this winter's "The Crossing" and this summer's "The Patriot" notwithstanding. Medieval movies are easy to find, WW II movies are everywhere, and Civil War movies are always an on screen favorite. Yet for some reason, the American Revolution is largely ignored by Hollywood.<br /><br />One of the excellent films in this small genre is April Morning, a Hallmark hall of fame presentation that was aired in 1988. The film focuses on a 15-year-old lad named Adam Cooper who lives in the sleepy little hamlet of Lexington, Massachusetts Bay Colony in April 1775. Life for Adam consists of doing his farm chores, courting his sweetheart Ruth Simmons (Meredith Salenger), daughter of Joseph Simmons (Robert Urich), and desperately trying to win the approval of his gruff, temperamental yet good-hearted father Moses (Tommy Lee Jones - before he was ultra-famous). Other characters include Adam's mother Sarah (Susan Blakely), his Granny (Joan Heney) and local firebrand Solomon Chandler (Rip Torn). Lexington is a quiet town, and would remain so if it didn't have the misfortune of being the halfway point along the main road from Boston to Concord MA, where patriot militia groups have been stockpiling arms and gunpowder. On the night of April 18th 1775, the British launch a secret raid with the goal of surprising Concord and securing the contraband. Col. Francis Smith commands the expedition of 1000+ red coated soldiers. Nothing goes right for the redcoats. The surprise is blown even before the march begins as Paul Revere and his co-riders ride through the countryside and warn every little town, including Lexington.<br /><br />When the morning of April 19th dawns, 70 or so men are drawn up on the green as the British march through the town. Inexplicably, Maj. John Pitcairn, commanding the advance party, picks a fight with the men, even though they do not block his path. He demands their dispersion and the surrender of their weapons. Refused, he forms a line of battle and advances on the minutemen. Someone, somewhere fires a gunshot. To this day his (or, for all we know, her) name is unknown. For dramatic purposes, the movie has Chandler pulling the trigger. Believing themselves under attack, the soldiers charge and shoot down Lexingtonians left and right. 10 are killed and 8 wounded. Moses is one of the fatalities, Adam, Joseph and Solomon running for their lives.<br /><br />The English reform, and continue their already much-delayed march to Concord. Solomon predicts that "It'll be easier for them to go down that road then it will be for them to come back." He's right. The soldiers find almost nothing of value in Concord, the contraband having been recently removed. After skirmishing with more militia there, the British return to Boston via the same route they came. What follows is an English slaughter. The road is practically walled with farmers with guns, whipped up into a bloodthirsty and lethal rage by the carnage at Lexington. The colonists, including Adam, Solomon, and Joseph fire on the redcoats from every tree, rock, fence, and bush. The British take most of the casualties, but not all. By the time the day is out, Solomon is dead, and Adam and Joseph return to Lexington, quite aware that quiet peaceful days are gone forever for Lexington, Massachusetts, and the 13 colonies.<br /><br />To the best of my knowledge this movie stands with Disney's ancient "Johnny Tremain" as the only two films to depict the beginning of the Revolutionary War. True, the body count at Lexington wasn't much, but for starting a war, it was enough.<br /><br />The battle sequences are well set up and photographed, one of the most striking audile effects being the drums of the advancing English force, which we hear through the trees for a full minute and a half before the lobsterbacks come into view. The steady increase of fear in the militia is palpable. So too are all the details of the mighty British host preparing to advance. From the rasp and clank of bayonets being fixed to the shouts of hurrah, every effort was made to make the British army look as scary and mechanical as possible.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones and Chad Lowe both went on to successful careers, and this movie proves that they had their acting chops down long before they were famous (April Morning Pre-dates Life goes on and Under Siege). This movie also serves as notches in the acting guns of Urich and Torn.<br /><br />Meredith Salenger of "The Journey of Natty Gann" and more recently "Lake Placid" is lovely and wholesome as Ruth, and portrays her character with an excellent blend of support, worry, faith, and horror for the two men in her life - her father Joseph and Adam. Ruth is what any man who is forced into a war so desperately wants to come home to. The fact that Ms. Salenger is not as recognizable in the movie world as her costars of this film are is proof to me that there is not enough justice in Hollywood.<br /><br />This movie is a treat for all fans of history, Lowe, and Jones. Contrary to what this database says, it IS available on home video, if you look hard enough. Check out your nearest Blockbuster or Movies Unlimited and find the guy/girl who most looks like he knows what he's doing. They'll probably be able to set you up. It's worth the search.
