To begin, this is a great movie! The plot is well developed: a horribly girl-shy, wanna-be author is writing a book about women, leading to some funny imaginary scenes from his book. He meets a rich woman, Mary, who another sleazy man is dating. The boy and girl go on their way, but end up meeting each other again. However, the boy is too shy to tell her that he loves her. Then Mary is about to be married....leading to an exciting climax. Though there is not as much constant humor in this movie as others, but there are some good points, like the workers at the publishers who are crazy about the boy. The last scene where the boy is racing to the wedding is very nicely shot, considering the time this movie was made. This movie is very enjoyable and fun to watch.
