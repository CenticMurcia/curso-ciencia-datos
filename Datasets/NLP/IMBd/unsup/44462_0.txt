Awful dusters like this are the key reason so many people hate the genre. It's the cheapest pulp imaginable ... manna for the addicted, but utterly unpalatable for the rest of us who expect intelligent story-telling in whatever kind of movie we may choose to watch. In this tiny town -- and really that's being charitable; hamlet is more appropriate -- there are but a handful of inhabitants and only three apparent businesses (saloon, store, and undertaker), no court or jail, no regular transportation services, no communications, no government offices of any kind, no mayor, and no law enforcement, yet a busily occupied lawyer? The citizens - despite possessing a good cache of weapons - come out to the street and stand around helplessly as a drunken psychopath goes on a slow and relaxed killing rampage interspersed with ample rest periods and ample opportunities for him to be ambushed. If you have an IQ in three digits and expect a plausible story, don't waste even a moment of your time on this piece of rubbish.
