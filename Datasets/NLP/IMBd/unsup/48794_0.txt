For a start I'm not interested in adding nothing new in this review."Fear Runs Silent" has a good premise,but this premise is completely wasted.Director Serge Rodnunsky doesn't create almost any atmosphere(apart from the beginning,which is pretty creepy),instead he fills this trash with so many annoying flashbacks.The ending is totally awful:after all these grisly events it all turns into dream!!!Yeah right,what a load of s***!!Three stars:one for a funny performance by Stacy Keach as a biologist,one for beautiful photography,and finally one for the beginning.Avoid this mess like the plague.
