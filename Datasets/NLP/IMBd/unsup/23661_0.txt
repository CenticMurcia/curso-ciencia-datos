The Unknown is a fabulous film; I didn't like the comments on the main page for this film so I thought I'd write some about this film itself, instead of a biography of Lon and Browning. The Unknown is fresh and horrifying almost 80 years later -- the only audiences who'll be thrown will the the ones who have gotten so used to "realistic" cinema that they don't appreciate a story whose very reason for being contains nothing conclusive. This is only a surface melodrama, for, like Lon's other great triumphs in film, this film presents a story in which the pains and tribulations of Lon's character are only too predictable.... broken by moments of complete shock. It is a story of desperation and a man who believes he is righteous in his vengeance. The scene where Lon's eyes well up with tears of joy in anticipation of seeing Joan Crawford's boyfriend torn to pieces is priceless. As usual, Lon appeals to our best sadistic instincts while also eliciting genuine sympathy for his impossible love. This movie is a dark fairy tale that it is impossible to resist unless you have grown too old in heart to appreciate the dark pools that contain true human magic.<br /><br />edited to add spoilers warning
