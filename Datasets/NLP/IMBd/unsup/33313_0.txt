I was lucky enough to witness this amazingly entertaining movie while laying hung over on a couch while vacationing in Mexico. We were about to turn the channel but then the amazing acting and dialog caught our attention. Dean is the most hilarious character I have ever witnessed in a film. His facial expressions are priceless. And Sandy's short cropped hair is so hot! The teacher who goes by the name "Blade" at night is hardcore. That little blade earring he wore makes me want to go out and buy one for myself. I was intrigued though with the "greaser" conversation he had with his little boy. His son had no idea they were half Mexican? hmmm. Ramone was probably the meanest hard ass ever. I had no idea why he hated Blade so badly through out this movie though. Ricochet was the worst fake stutterer in the history of film. Go Galaxy High! My lord I could go on and on, but I'll just end by saying that this movie kept my sides splitting with laughter, and for the rest of my vacation in Mexico "Lambada" was our inspiration!
