When I saw the previews for this program I thought it was going to be stupid. Boy was I wrong.... I like sci-fi, but this was so brilliantly written I think someone who wasn't into sci-fi would've enjoyed it. For as long as the series lasted, it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. The characters were well developed and added substance to the story.The only think I can say negative about this series is that it left a lot of questions unanswered (or maybe I just didn't pay closed enough attention, if someone has the answers to the following questions please send me a text) 1. What happened in the room specifically??? 2. The guy who became the profit and the black lady who was after him... that story line just stopped abruptly 3. Where was the girl???
