It's about a normal sea sponge, Spongebob, earning work at the Krusty Krab, Here are my problems about the show: Spongebob is very annoying, he's always been happy all the time, the humor is flat out weak, Everything about is just stupid.<br /><br />Now the characters on the show are annoying, first there's Spongebob, like I said, its about a normal sea sponge working at the Krusty Krab, Spongebob is twice annoying than Patrick and Squidward, Spongebob is a lousy mouth, gotten himself a lot of trouble in every episode. Patrick however, is a starfish like person that hangs around Spongebob a lot. And Squidward is a grouchy neighbor who doesn't hang out with Spongebob or Patrick.<br /><br />The new episodes are getting really cheesy and lame, It was made in 1999, would be like in the mid 2000's or something. it's just that bad.<br /><br />Right now, I'm in high school, and it still sucks today!!! I gave up watching the show in 2006, I turned it off, got bored of it. I stopped watching the show on Season 3, that's it.<br /><br />They made a movie five years after the show was released. That movie was terrible, I couldn't make it through it either. they both suck.<br /><br />I know a lot of people like the show, thinking it was funny, hilarious, great, but for me, I just didn't care for it at all, I'm really not the biggest fan of Spongebob Squarepants.<br /><br />The only good stuff on Nickelodeon are the game shows, and early nicktoons like Rocko's Modern Life or Doug. I recommend watching game shows more than this. I liked every game show that were Nick when I was little, and I still watch them today. Nothing bad or terrible about it.<br /><br />But this show right here is a piece of crap, I wouldn't recommend it at all. Seriously, this show SUCKS.<br /><br />1/10
