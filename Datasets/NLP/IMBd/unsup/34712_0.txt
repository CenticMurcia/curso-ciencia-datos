Man, I am fed up with the rash of garbage we've been subjected to this year. I knew this movie had the whole Final Destination premise going, but I was hoping for a twist or something. What I got was another director trying to fill in for a bad script with a hot bod. Sorry guys, but that doesn't cut it anymore.<br /><br />Cheesy acting, sound that seemed to be piped to us through a can, and a story so thread-bear that it was difficult to watch even a short part of the film. Don't waste your money, check the reviews and rating before watching this film (there's a reason it went straight-to-video). Oh yeah, most SciFi originals are leagues above this film, so take that as your measurement stick.
