We were delighted to be able to see this at Sundance 2007. Antonio Banderas came to the screening and introduced the film, which was very nice. He was very gracious and we were happy to hear what he had to say about his film. However, the film itself was hard to follow. There were too many characters and it was hard to keep them straight. The main character has a serious illness, which added to the many plot devices. I had a hard time understanding why the title of the film was "Summer Rain" while the Spanish title was "The English Road". I guess maybe they both make sense, but "The English Road" seems to be a little more descriptive.Perhaps it doesn't translate well.This film was just all over the place and a bit too artsy for the "normal" film-goer. I can't see this film attracting a wide audience,sorry to say. The acting was top notch, however! Unfortunately, that wouldn't be enough to recommend this to anyone.
