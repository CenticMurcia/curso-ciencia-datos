VIVA is the first great feature from underground queen of the B's (and Bees if you've seen her work!) Anna Biller. Culminating in four long years of production, VIVA reminds of early studio John Waters efforts filtered through her own Strange Guignol style (wherein lurid set color and mannered acting replaces Grand Guignol's gaudy excess of violence). Many will not "get" the tone and acting styles in this era of Neo-Naturalism, but for those accustomed to having preconceptions gleefully overturned about what is "right and wrong" for a feature film, VIVA is not to be missed. Hightlights for me include: amazing, psychedelia-drenched sets and uber costumes that made me wish the 1970's had ever really achieved such suggested heightened self-awareness; acting done in the "Distanciated" mode advocated by Douglas Sirk but reinterpreted to new depths by Biller; a truly remarkable perf by Bridget Brno as Anna's best friend & living Barbie doll gone Bad Girl (but in a Good Way); and an animated orgasm sequence that is as sublime as it is subliminal. For those who want what is wanting, VIVA is your ticket to ride.
