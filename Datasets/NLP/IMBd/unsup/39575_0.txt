The two aging irresponsible cops with a "twist" are back to mock criminals, pedestrians, each other and their superior officers, but most of all the audience. I mean the lack of story not very well disguised with a comic undertone takes this to undreamed heights of awkwardness. The two "heroes" start by blowing up a building(and making fun about it), and being demoted to street patrol but somehow, thru a loop-hole in the script find themselves chasing an arms-dealer cop. Along the way they are "funny" as always, they make fun of each other and alongside Leo Getz and new addition Lorna generally have lots and lots of fun!! - but keep in mind they are cops, and Riggs especially goes from funny to frenzied car-chaser in a second-and when that happens, his left behind slow apprentice, the ever-retiring side-kick Murtaugh finds himself shouting on top of his lungs "Riggs, Riggs, wait for me" , reminding me of Daniel-San in Karate Kid calling out for his Master Miyagi for the entire duration of the movie, with a not-so-bright look on his face. -Ah, but then the fun begins again, and they forget about their troubles and make fun of Leo Getz again and the saxophone plays again,and the mood is :)...and then Riggs is a "son of a bitch" again, and Murtaugh in insensitive not to take Riggs in account when he decides to retire for yet another time...?!? and the mood is :(<br /><br />Oh, what an emotional-explosive roller coaster...give me a break!
