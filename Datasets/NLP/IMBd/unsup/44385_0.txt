Might be fun to watch as a social experiment, and as stated no one tryes to explain the phenomenon, but they do try to make big things out of nothing. The main thing happening is an intervju with a mr. Stubbs, working at a cable/satellite TV company or something similar that has taken loads of time looking at videos from manned space missions trying to find 'mysterious events'...<br /><br />.. he does find odd events that he himself cannot explain and according to himself had asked numerous scientists about them with various results.<br /><br />*commentary to scenes in the 'documentary'* As Stubbs talk about a meeting he managed to get with some scientists, he explaines that one scientist abruptly left the meeting:<br /><br />"He stormed out of the room" I do not doubt that happened, but the thing going through the head of the scientist is likely "omg, did i take time from my work to listen to this nonsense?"... It is not uncommon for scientists (eg. physics professors) to get letters and visits from non-scientists where they are asked to review works or theories of theirs. 99% (arbitrary huge percentage) of these are for the scientists a vaste of time, flaudulent theories. IF YOU WANT TO GET RECOGNITION FOR YOUR "GROUNDBRAKING" DISCOVERY: first you should do is study, learn maths, physics, or whatever area your discovery covers, preferably a bachelor or masters degree. If you still think your discovery holds after you've gotten a good scientific background knowledge, then you should have also gotten to know some people with whom you can discuss it...
