Remember when Mel Brooks used to be funny? Well, so did I, and unfortunately, this movie is an incredible disappointment. I could say the same for Leslie Neilsen, who used to be in some funny movies, too, but really fell into some bad schtickt.<br /><br />Supposedly a spoof on Francis Ford Coppola's "Bram Stoker's Dracula", it actually has more in common with the original 1931 Dracula with Bela Lugosi.<br /><br />All that said, the jokes fell flat, many of them were done to death. "Give him an enema" was funny the first time, but the fourth or fifth, it just lost its humor value.<br /><br />Did the bar of what's funny just pass Mel up, or did he just stop trying? Young Frankenstein still holds up after 30 years. So does Blazing Saddles.
