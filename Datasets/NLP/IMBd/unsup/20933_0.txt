This is without doubt a one man show. Cast most other actors in the lead role and the movie may well have sunk without trace, but with Carrey as "Ace", you've got the makings of a comedy classic. The humour is definitely not for everybody, and if you express your love for the film I guarantee that some people will think you nuts. Nevertheless, if absurdity's your bag, you will almost certainly enjoy this.<br /><br /> Other actors fade into insignificance when confronted by Carrey's comic genius. The one person who almost manages to keep pace with him is Sean Young, who displays a hitherto untapped flair for comedy in a VERY strange role. Then again, the entire movie can be seen as 'strange'. The football players also do well.<br /><br /> There is little attempt to make the 'plot' at all logical, but that hardly matters when you can't stop laughing. Critical dissection of this film is totally inappropriate; you either love it or hate it. Frankly, I love it. Kudos to Hollywood for putting money into such an odd idea and making the then-unknown Carrey into an international star. This is a gem.<br /><br />BEST LINE: "Be sure that you {get the plumbing checked}. If I'd been drinking out of the toilet, I might've been killed."<br /><br />
