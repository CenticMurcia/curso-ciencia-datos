i felt that this movie really should not of been compared to ET. ET was a excellent movie that you could see over and over. i went to see this on the premise that it was to be an ET alike it was not. i was bored but stayed with the movie hoping it went another way it didn't. i could not understand mimzy and it was kind of to far out there with the rabbit. ET we were able to understand him by himself. it never stop disappointing me. the characters of the mom and dad were really a bad portrayal of parents and disappointing. getting rid of something is not throwing it in the garbage by the house. using an island was really poor as we cant get to the island at nite the ferry does not run. the kids were good i loved emma she was wonderful. i don't really now what else to say but i found the movie one i would of liked if it was more like ET. i can not recommend this movie to other people sorry.
