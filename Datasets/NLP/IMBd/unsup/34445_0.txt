Instead of wasting your money and two hours of your life watching the biggest over-baked John Woo film since...John Woo's last film, Face Off!. Brian DePalma, not anywhere to be found on my favorite director's list, really did a top-notch job with the first movie...if people complained that the first movie was too hard to understand, they will be pleased to know that the second movie throws not only logic out the window, but also any sense of adventure, suspense or fun...it's a big disappointment...i can't think of anything else to say because i am still dumbfounded by how LAME this movie is. I like Tom Cruise, I just don't like John Woo (at least in America). Go rent Mission Impossible, and while your at it, see if you can find Woo's Asian films, like Killer.
