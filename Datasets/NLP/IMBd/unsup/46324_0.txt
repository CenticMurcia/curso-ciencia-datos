(SPOILERS!!)<br /><br />This film is boringggg and baaaddddd.....Bad acting,bad camera,BAD JOKES!!!!!!!!!!!Bad music,bad script,bad everything!!!!! One of the Troma's worst films(not has bad then "Rabbid Grannies"). The dude is a very sheep clone of Bruce Campell, and the blonde chick is look like a street whore... This film is really bad, and the jokes are...well AWFUL!!! The Director should be in prison for life, just for doing such a bad movie... I like Troma films,like "Tromeo and Julliet", "Terror Firmer" and "Toxic Avenger", but "Blonde have more guns" is a terrible stupid comedy with no sense at all....
