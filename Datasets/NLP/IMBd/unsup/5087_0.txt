Phenomenal documentary portraying the turmoil unfolding in Argentina leading up to the 2001 economic crash. The movie begins by showing Argentina in crisis, and then goes back in time to some of the problems that predicated the crisis. The documentary focuses attention on the role of former president Menem, though it definitely does not skip over other important aspects of recent Argentine history. The view given to the audience by the movie accurately reflects the opinions and feelings of many Argentinians. As of Spring 2004 when I was in Buenos Aires and watched the movie in theaters, many older couples were yelling at the political figures speaking in the movie. Often the director places comments from trusted officials that later prove to be complete lies taken in back-sight. Great images can also be seen throughout the movie. Don't miss Menem with a belly dancer and the underlying angst and sarcasm felt by the people of Argentina. I would recommend this movie to people who want to learn more about the mood of the Argentine people. Great movie, though hard to watch.
