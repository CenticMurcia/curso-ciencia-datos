I thought this movie was really interesting. The plot was alright. I usually have no problem watching horror flicks, but for some reason I was really grossed out watching this film! If you like watching people eating each other basically, then you'll have a blast! I think it was the part where the main character fries up some fat he took home from one of his patients. It just made me sick! Just the sound effects had me going!! If you like to gross yourself out, I'd recommend this for you all. The ending also was VERY interesting I thought. I was a bit grossed out when I found out that the main character cut his face off and gave it as a surprise wedding gift at the end. Plus it was weird to see other characters in the movie wanting to eat women meat, like the police guy. WEIRD!
