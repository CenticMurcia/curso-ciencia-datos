Kristy Allen was very good on the show. Paul Michael Robinson who played Haffron Williams didn't appeal to me too well. I think the series would have called "Emmanuelle's Sex Trek". If Haffron Williams is a captain of the ship this person should be young in his mid 20's & is very sexy. Tiendra Demian who played Tasha was very good. With the same Sci-Fi series, she meets with a Spanish guy & makes love with the background of the bull fighting. In this series when Emmanuelle was making love to Haffron, the camera was spinning around & around the bed. Making me feel dizzy. I didn't enjoyed that at all. I hope that there will be more Emmanuelle series in the future with more fantasies to come.
