The main problem with this film is more fundamental. Laura is essentially a very tragic character, not a comical one.<br /><br />The story is a tragedy, but it seems that the director himself has missed that point. Ludomania, which is the film's underlying theme, is not funny, but pathetic and tragic.<br /><br />Instead, the director attempts to dress up the story and present it as a hybrid of a comedy and a "love story" between an alcoholic and a compulsive gambler. It just doesn't work.<br /><br />The ending is also a complete letdown: Laura informs Claus that she has decided to sort out herself and work on her (very serious) problems. She states that their relationship cannot continue.<br /><br />This could have been a decent ending, leaving on a hopeful note, but it is completely ruined during the end credits where a number of idiotic sketches show that Laura and Claus have moved together anyway -- with Laura constantly betting with Claus over ridiculous things.<br /><br />Give it a miss. 2 out of 5 stars (** of *****).
