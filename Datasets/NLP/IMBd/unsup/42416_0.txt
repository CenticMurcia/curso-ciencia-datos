Here's exhibit A in crappy dubbing - these guys ignore all syntax as they lurch around waiting to pounce on the next lip movement. "My name. Is Hal." "I'm so glad. We met." That offers some much-needed levity in this yucky biker-revenge movie where a buncha scumbags rape wifey and shoot up the cute-as-a-button parents of the hero, a total a-hole embodied by Robert O'Neil. His contract gives him at least three softcore romp showcases, and not only is he completely disgusting - he looks like a cross between Willem Dafoe and Potsie - HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO KISS. His mouth's open and he's slobbering all over the face of his unfortunate partners. There's a lot of aimless, onanistic pelvic thrusting. This softens the blow of the atrocities a bit; are we supposed to empathize with HIM? And anyway they're just setup for him meting out some rough justice as you may have predicted. The shock ending is kind of gratifying in a stupid way but it's not worth the pain.
