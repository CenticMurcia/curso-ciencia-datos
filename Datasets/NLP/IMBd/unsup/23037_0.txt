This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. For one thing they drag it out too long it makes the movie boring and there is also no good plot it has been way over dune in the past. What I mean by dragging it out is that they spend too much time one a single part. They also spent way too much time talking. Gary Daniels could have dune better. That is just my thoughts.
