Unfortunately, my video store that I rent at does not have the second Beverly Hills Cop or the third, so when I stopped by Best Buy and saw the sequel for $6.99, I thought it might be worth a buy. After watching this, I was very glad that I bought it. It was great to see our favorite Beverly Hills cop back in action! Eddie Murphy is just so great and hilarious, he can make Charles Manson laugh! <br /><br />Basically, Axel has heard of some horrible crimes going on in Beverly Hills once again, so he comes back to help out the force. With his two favorite cops, Billy and John, only this time, they're a little more gutsy. Now they are after the alphabet crimes, a group of thieves led by the 7 foot tall Bridget Neilson. But it's going to be hard with the chief of Beverly Hills always getting on the trio's butts.<br /><br />I loved Beverly Hills Cop 2, I hope I do find the third one, I know it doesn't have as good of a rating like the first or the second one, but still I love Eddie Murphy. Who could resist that great chuckle of his? Beverly Hills Cop 2 is filled with just as many laughs as the first one and I don't see how anyone could not laugh at least a few times.<br /><br />7/10
