I came here to complain but from the look of it almost everyone hates this show. I watched it and swore I would not again but go outvoted and made to watch it again at my friend's place. They ended up apologizing for making me sit through it again. It is so bad watching untalented "comedians" try to be funny when they so obviously are not. It is hard to say how something so totally empty of any laughs is on the comedy network. I am sick of such bad Canadian shows. I'll just watch the U.S. shows now instead. I love Canada but I can't stand watching any more of these atrocious shows. I wouldn't mind a pretend documentary show if it was real at all but this show is so poorly written and performed that it should never have been put on television. What were they even thinking with this one?
