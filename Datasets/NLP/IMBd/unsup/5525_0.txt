This film went straight to video, here is why:<br /><br />The film has the misfortune of following one of the worst sequels of all time. "The Skulls" is a well known film starring Paul Walker, and "The Skulls 2" was the worst explanatory sequel since "Highlander 2." Everybody thought this movie would disappoint because it's a sequel to a bad sequel.<br /><br />Secondly, "Skulls 3" is a feminist film anachronism. The audience is ready for women in serious roles. "G.I. Jane" was a huge hit. No longer is a film which begs the question 'why can't girls play too?' provocative. The films feminist themes are dated and cliched.<br /><br />Finally, the obvious nature of the script rivals daytime drama. The roommate actually says, "waddaya know? A sorority girl with a brain!" (when describing herself).<br /><br />Do not see this movie.
