The title of the movie is the spoiler. Set in 2008, we witness the assassination of George W. Bush and view the aftermath. With the numerous precedents for killing US leaders, the premise, however shocking, sets up what could be a cornucopia of possibilities. Such imagination is never exercised. The movie is not a commentary on US or world politics but a tired re-telling of the problems with what happens when the justice system investigates with blinkers.<br /><br />The use of CGI techniques is clever. However, if the movie let imagination run wild we would have a memorable commentary rather than a boring CSI botch-up. If you are in the market for a cutting edge political expose, don't bother going to this turkey.
