I first saw Explorers when I was 6, not long after the movie came out and still remains a film that can be watched again.<br /><br />Even though this under rated movie by Joe (Gremlins) Dante is for kids I still love watching it and it fulfills all kids dreams who look up at the stars and wonder what the heck is out there.<br /><br />The only bad comment i have on the film is the 2nd half when they actually encounter the aliens. It gets a bit silly but hay i don't think we complained as kids.<br /><br />Well worth a purchase on DVD when it comes out.
