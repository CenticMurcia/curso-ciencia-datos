This may not be the most polished film ever made nor is it the most exciting but I really liked it. The slow pacing will probably irritate a lot of people but that's where it scores. True it is one big tease from start to finish but I couldn't help watching just to see where it was going to end up and I for one wasn't disappointed. They obviously didn't have much money but they covered it up well and for a cheapie it looks great. It's directed well and the performances are uniformly very good, particularly Tom McCamus. Nice music, good editing all add up to a very moody piece and the film is different, maybe too different for most people because it's tough to get a handle on what it is. I'd give it 10 for effort and 7 for attainment. If you're in the mood for something quiet and disturbing then have a look. If you want a big bang then i'd forget it.
