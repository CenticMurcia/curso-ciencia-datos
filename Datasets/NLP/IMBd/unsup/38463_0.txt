<br /><br />There is nothing really to recommend "Peaches". You could see the ending coming from the beginning (esp. with the preview ads). The audience only laughed on spotted occassions, and often the laughter was patched even then. The male protaganists seemed to be one dimensional mostly with the only character development being based around relationship attitudes.<br /><br />A big problem I felt however was the lack of any real direction in the movie. There was no structure to it and it seemed to drift aimlessly. Sure there's nothing wrong with experimenting with the narrative design but theres no point if it doesn't amount to anything.<br /><br />So what do we end up with? A snapshot of the lives of three guys just leaving college and finding out how to live life properly? You can see it on a variety of tv programs done to a superior degree. Peaches are not the only fruit...thankfully we've more variety.
