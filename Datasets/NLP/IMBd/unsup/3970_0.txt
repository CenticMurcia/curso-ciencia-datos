If you want to get an aesthetic view on modern China, this is an excellent vehicle. Over two hours long, some scenes are poetic and subtle with an Eastern beauty lovely to behold. English sub-titles are well done.<br /><br />A big screen experience of common workers from the countryside and the artistic dance community in the big city of Beijing.<br /><br />There is a lot of smoking... and cell phone use, of course - this is the new China. <br /><br />Some animation sequences provide creative transitions of scenes.<br /><br />Not for the adrenaline junkie addicted to violence.<br /><br />Excellent portrayal of relationships. A true artist behind the camera. The acting is so natural.<br /><br />The backdrop and chapters are structured around the different national landmarks at the World Theme Park in Beijing. <br /><br />( 8/10 )
