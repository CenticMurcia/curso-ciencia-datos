If only low-budget film makers would think before making their movie. A well-shot film, likely on digital, that purported to be in a league with BLADE. It is not. <br /><br />****SPOILER****<br /><br />An AIDS researcher is infected with his own work, becoming a creature of the night. Finding himself hungering for blood, he seeks revenge on a shadowy group that is ultimately responsible. On the way, he has to deal with a powerful vampire and a human mercenary. <br /><br />The action sequences, if that is indeed what they can be called, are plodding, poorly thought out and mostly non-existent. It is a very poor script with terrible dialogue and lamentable acting. While some of the camera work was good, it could not make up for the many other technical short-comings. The one thing it had going for it was that it finally came to an end.
