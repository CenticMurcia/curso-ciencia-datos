My Take: Made-for-TV yawner.<br /><br />I watched 'Killer Bees" when I was on a school camping. We were to choose from two activities, go for the bravery test or watch this movie. Well, I was very tired at that time (it was really late at that time), so I decided to watch the movie instead. What the heck happened, I even got sleepier. "Killer Bees" is boring TV movie fare. No excitement, no suspense even no sense. The story sucks, the effects are fake and...well you get my point.<br /><br />The lead isn't even much of a hero, because of his terrible acting. The bees aren't even scary,for two reasons. One, the effects are fake, I mean really fake. Two, there is no suspense, no theme music to underscore the bees' presence and nothing even scary about them, the bees look just like a couple of floating black dots attacking people. It wasn't only boring, it's also stupid.<br /><br />It bored us, and it doesn't even get a little bit interesting. It's not one of those B-films that are "so bad, it's good". No, this one's "so bad, its awful.".<br /><br />I tell you, if ever you watch this on a camping trip, choose the bravery test or any camp activity over this, no matter how tired you are, to keep your spirit up.<br /><br />TV movie rating: 0 out of 5.
