OK. This movie started out to be okay at first. You got a guy that has been "supposedly" in a coma for the past four years after he killed his fiancé during some weird ritual. He wakes up in a mental hospital with no recollection of what happened let alone where he his or what he did. SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!!!!!! Dr. Ek (very weird guy and mediocre acting skills) explains to him what he did and then sends him to this house called the House of Love. Here he meets all kinds of strange characters. He starts having nightmares after his first night about going into the attic of this place and finding a locked trunk, but someone is inside. He opens it and they pull him in. Well eventually, he finds out that this is really his old house where he and his fiancé used to live before he killed her. He keeps having the nightmares (thus explaining the name of the movie) and one by one his "Friends" at the house get murdered. MORE SPOILERS SPOILERS CONTINUED!!!! It turns out that all his fellow mental patients are really actors just trying to get him to relive or redo his ritual so Dr.EK can get the special book that he used so he can be the all-powerful doctor EK!! END OF SPOILERS!!!!!!!! Basically this film repeats itself throughout the movie and generally ends up being very stupid and confusing. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER!!!!!!! Wanna know the big twist in this one, he was really asleep the whole time!!!!! Not even worth renting.
