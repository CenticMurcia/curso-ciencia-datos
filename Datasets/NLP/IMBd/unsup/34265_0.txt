Okay, first off I noticed this movie is insanely high, it's in the top 250 (I forget where) and I really did not like this movie. The acting was good, the premise was good, but the plot was utterly predictable and the dialogue was just awful. and this whole "secret ending/twist?" I think that anyone who saw the Sixth Sense could see it coming. This movie is overly hyped, and ranked way too high. 3/10
