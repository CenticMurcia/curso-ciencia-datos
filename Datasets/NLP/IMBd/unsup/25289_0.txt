The idea behind this film sounds like the stuff good comedies are made of: two very different people, man and woman are forced to share a hotel room because their flights are cancelled. The first problem with this film is that both people are fairly screwed up and are more annoying than interesting. The film then hovers uncertainly between being a comedy (unfortunately it's not very funny), a drama (not particularly interesting) and typical French pseudo-intellectual film where people sit and talk. And they talk a lot. Some scenes are mildly entertaining but about 30 minutes into the film you begin to wonder why you should bother finishing it since it's just not interesting.
