i have never rated a movie before because i have never been so compelled to rate a movie as i have this one. this is without a doubt the worst movie that i have seen since cabin fever. but what makes it worse than cabin fever is that i rented this movie based on roger ebert's review. i will exercise more caution in the future when it comes to ebert's recommendations. the dialog is poorly written and poorly delivered. the editing is clumsy and chaotic. the music score, horrible! music should compliment the story line rather than overpower it. but then again how do you compliment such a bad story? maybe turning up the music even louder and drowning it out was what was needed to make this movie work. i will keep an eye out for future toback movies-so that i can avoid them!
