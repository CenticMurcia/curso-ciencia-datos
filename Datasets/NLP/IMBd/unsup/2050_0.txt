I have generally found the performances of Lon Chaney Jr. a little wooden(sometimes a lot wooden),with the exception of "The Wolfman" and "Of Mice and Men".This film is no exception in that respect, but it has other redeeming features.The way Katherine Caldwell(Louise Allbritton) makes the state of being undead seem so seductively appealing is a very interesting aspect of this film. Her discussions with Frank Stanley(Robert Paine)on this topic give the film a very interesting otherworldly quality and a somber mood.And there are even some interesting special effects(e.g.,the vampires can turn into a swirling cloud of mist).We're not talking "Citizen Kane" or "Casablanca" here,folks, but if you're merely looking for some nice cinematic entertainment for a rainy evening or a Halloween party, you could do a lot worse than "Son of Dracula".
