Something akin to a soap opera, but with much steamier scenes, Carne Tr√©mula is an entertaining look at love, lust, and revenge. I enjoyed the way Almodovar served the story, one bit at a time, allowing for all the events to culminate in a very satisfying ending. Liberto Rabal gives a fine performance and Javier Bardem (of Jamon, Jamon and Boca a Boca), delivers yet another great acting achievement.<br /><br />I saw this film both in the theater and on video. I found the movie much more effective in the theater. It's a great film to share with a large adult audience.
