Hex is a one of the best programmes, need i say more, loved every minute of it, i just hope they make a third series as bot the first two series are fantastic, no sorry, MAGNIFICENT. It is one those programmes that you start to watch and can not get enough of as i said i hope they make a third series. Looking at this television it can be named in the same league as Buffy the vampire slayer in my opinion. When watching the programme you get a great sense of satisfaction from the storyline as is gets more intense as it goes along. first series gets the viewers to get a feel for the programme and teach important lessons about witchcraft and superstition. this makes the programmes great to watch with the feeling of something is around the corner waiting to come out and make you jump but not like a horror film. If i was to compare this with a film it would be the film from 2006 called 5ive Girls, this is a film based on witchcraft and has the same similarities to Hex.
