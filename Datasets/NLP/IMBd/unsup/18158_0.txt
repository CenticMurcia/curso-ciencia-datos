I just finished watching "The Dunwich Horror" a few minutes ago. It's the second time I've seen it in several years. I very well may be in the minority about this. Maybe not. Anyway, I think this movie stinks. S*cks with a capital S.<br /><br />After reading redrabbitbone's review of this disaster on film I had to chime in my two cents. And as I said, I very well may be the lone person on the island about this. Or maybe one of a few - or a few hundred - but, the bottom line in my opinion: "The Dunwich Horror" is a terrible movie. Absolutely horrible. Definitely not a "horror" or scary flick worthy of being shown on TCM, Halloween or not.<br /><br />. . . sm
