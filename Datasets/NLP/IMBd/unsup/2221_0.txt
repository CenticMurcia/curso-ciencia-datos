Suddenly is one of my all time favourite films, mainly due to Sinatra's excellent performance. Sterling Hayden is as always Sterling Hayden, not much of a surprise there. Sinatra, however, begins the film with the portrayal of a cocksure hit-man who seems to be an ice cold control freak. Throughout the film, a cat and mouse game between Hayden and Sinatra unfolds resulting in Sinatra losing his cool. The cold blooded killer, slowly and bit by bit, turns into a deranged psychopath. This is certainly one of the most impressive performances I have ever seen in my life and shows what a fine actor Sinatra was. All in all, it's a fairly unspectacular B movie with not much of a story that turns into a nail bitingly exciting game of life and death between the two men. A must see.
