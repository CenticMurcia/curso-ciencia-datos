Whilst far from perfect, this is a very good anthology of horror stories.<br /><br />There is very little gore, but the stories build up a good atmosphere, and the acting is always of at least an acceptable level, and in the cases of Robin Bailey,Jean Anderson and Dora Bryan, it is actually quite excellent.<br /><br />In the middle story involving people moving into a house, I actually felt quite creeped out, something that hasn't happened for years to me.<br /><br />I would love to know the story as to how three short English tales ended up juxtaposed with the wrap around story of thieves stealing the tapes from a store, but whatever, it doesn't detract from the stories themselves.<br /><br />The copy I have seen has washed out colours which somehow added to the bleakness, and this is shot on film it would appear, doesn't look cheap and nasty at all.<br /><br />If you are a fan of brit horror, you must see this it's definitely a bit of a lost gem as far as I'm concerned.
