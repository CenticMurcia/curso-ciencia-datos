Some movies are intended to be serious and end up cheesy. Some movies are intended as cheese from the beginning and work out well. Many classic movies (Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, Airplane, The Evil Dead, Rocky Horror Picture Show) fall into this category. The Godson was an obvious attempt at cheese that failed miserably. This movie wasn't cheddar... It wasn't even Velveeta... This movie was oil & water.
