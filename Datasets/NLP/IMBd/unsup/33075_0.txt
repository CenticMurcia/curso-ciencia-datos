Open Water is a lame movie that tries to be Jaws, but it just isn't. It starts off with a happy couple going on vacation to some place(can't remember where). But they go there, and they do some stuff and they get on a boat and go scuba diving. They get really far away from the other people and end up getting lost at sea. You'd think someone would notice that they're gone, but no one does. They stay in the water for a few days, but only a few minutes to us. Then, at the end, the couple dies. That's all this movie is. 79 minutes of bad acting and bad EVERYTHING.<br /><br />It's not scary. I think we all knew this wouldn't be as good as Jaws, the shark classic. But it turns out that this isn't even as good as Jaws 3, which isn't that good. Jaws is better, and scarier. And Jaws was made 30 years ago! Ha! Well, I do not recommend this movie. I give Open Water three thumbs down. Three thumbs down. That's pretty bad isn't it?
