ItÂ´s a comedy. Mess of love, the main excene is when two women are in the ladies room of the opera crying and talking ironically about their affairs and marriage situation and Roberto(John Malkovich) is in the cornice trying to avoid them to discover his promiscuity; ne of the girls open a window and face Roberto there(lol). A brilliant plot, witty.
