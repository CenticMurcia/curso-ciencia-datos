Walking around IMDb and I realized that there're many good movies are being shamefully underrated . To be honest this's one in a few movies that in my view are perfect . Thoughtful story, well direct, genius camera arranging . There're some guys here said it's had a bad ,going-to-nowhere story then they can't get the message , the reason blah blah blah , some others complained about its slowness , then some avuncular naturalist point out that these actors can be compare with a wax statue of Paris Hilton , some "critics" bring King Kong (OMG) and LOTR (WTF) to intimidate this movie , so, kiddos , go home and leave indie spirit alone !
