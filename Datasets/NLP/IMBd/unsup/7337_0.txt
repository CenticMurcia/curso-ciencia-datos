This is a great movie, worthy to compete against American movies from Hollywood. Sergiu Nicolaescu is one the greatest Romanian Director and even actor! Now he is old but he written history with his achievements and he will always be remembered as the first greatest Romanian actor and movie director! The new actors and directors are jokes! He is the only one that remains true! This movie was very touchy and realistic! The story was very good and if you're not Romanian you should search for a subtitle in your language then look at the movie! I rated the movie at maximum because it really worths!<br /><br />P.S. If you're looking for a great Drama, Romance movie, here it is, if you want something else, this is not a good place to look...
