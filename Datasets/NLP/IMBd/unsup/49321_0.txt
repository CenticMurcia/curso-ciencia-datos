I lived in Reno for 18 years and was there when this movie was filmed. I had no idea it was being filmed and believe me Reno is the Biggest Little City in the World, and if a movie is being filmed there it's almost impossible to not know. Yet, I had no idea this was going on. The concept of the story is reasonable, but the concept is all that is delivered. All the fluff story propped up around the concept just is not good. Scott Glen seems to be just about the level of a leering drunk and how Pen "falls" for him is just not apparent. Jennifer Tilly is lovely and carries her part very well, but Scott Glen and Stockard Channing's characters require more script quality before they could be held responsible for the out come. (Bad writing can not be overcome by the best of them.) As I watched I saw them drive from the Hilton to the Airport through downtown and rolled my eyes at the director's ploy to present Reno's bright lights as window dressing. If you don't know Reno, all is OK and the director's trick is well received.
