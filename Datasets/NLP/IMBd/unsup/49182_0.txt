Scream 3 just doesnt have the formula that the last two did,and what I mean by that is Scream 3 isnt scary,the same old thing happens,and worst of all,it isn't entertaining.(SPOILER)Like in this one,you would expect Cindy to die,but she dosent,she just survives again,which isn't fun to see.(ANOTHER SPOILER)I'm sure Wes Craven wanted to make something unpredictable,so he made the outcome of the movie unpredictable,but in a BAD way,because it was Cindy's brother all a long,that just doesnt fit,Its impossible for Cindy not to know that she's had a brother for so long.The only good part about the movie is that...uh...there is no good part about this movie actually.I do have to give credit to the acting,it was pretty good,but that dosent make up for a bad movie.Bad ending,a BIG lack of entertaiment make Scream 3 a terrible horror movie.I give it a 3/10.
