Due to his business taking a nosedive and his debts rising out of control, pretentious Montreal architect Dominique suddenly finds himself in need of a job and is desperate to hide his predicament from his young wife and family - but what do you do if being gay is a requirement when your perfect job comes along?<br /><br />(Slight spoilers follow) <br /><br />This hilarious satire pokes fun at bothstraight and gay attitudes and communities using outrageously funny stereotypes & clichés. The film follows Dominique in his ever more complicated attempts to keep his double life secret from both his family and employers - very very funny, even if you're only following the English subtitles. <br /><br />The delectable Roy Dupuis plays Dominique through his journey of self-discovery, (from shallow to insightful,)with much aplomb. Patrick Huard makes a wonderfully funny & understated performance playing Dominique's long suffering best friend 'Pierre', and Albert Millaire & Normand Lévesque are fun to watch as the squabbling antique-dealer queens.<br /><br />Altogether, a gem of a Frech-Canadian Film. This is pure satire at it's best - and the final message is great - love overcomes all difficulties, no matter who or what you are. As long as you're not narrow-minded or easily offended by the saucy humour, this is not a film to miss!
