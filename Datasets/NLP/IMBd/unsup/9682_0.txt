Well , After i watch this movie i have many things to say about it , 1st of all the drama line is so flat , some of the characters if we remove it from the script they will not affect the drama like Ahmed Rateb , Tamer Abdul Moneam (son of Nour Al Sheriff ), and Yosra (her role is sooo boring), also the homosexuality takes too much from the duration of the film , it's not my business to see the gay sleeping on his face more than one time , they could make his role shorter , and also there's no connection or relations between the people who living in the building , they could even meet each other even one time to believe that they live at the same building , what will happen if Nour Al Sheriff Meet Adel Emam once ? it's not hard , and also why they focused on the sex relationship between the Islamic boy (Mohamed Imam ) and his wife at the training place , we saw them sleeping naked two times , why ?? is it a problem when a man sleeping with his wife ? what did they want to improve ? the main thing that i want to talk about it : this the first Egyptian film that scanned to make the color grading and the visual effects on non linear systems ( like Hollywood movies ) , but we didn't see any color grading or great quality like we imagined ? so why the cost themselves if they want the picture like that ?? i really don't know !! i know that many people will have the negative point of view from mine , and all the people here in Egypt saying : Wow what a great movie , what a huge budget , what a great cast that met for the first time ... but that's not the green card for the success of any film , we all watched a movie called ( Heat ) by Al Pacino & Robert De Niro and both of them are great great actors , but the movie was not as great as their names...anyway that's only my point of view ...thanks
