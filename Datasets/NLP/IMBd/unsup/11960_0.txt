I don't have much to add to what has already been reviewed, except that this movie is "The One" ;-) A heck of a potboiler of a movie, with a touch of class! Sheer entertainment all the way. Truly amazing imagination on the part of the directors. 'Mortal Kombat' meets 'The Good, The Bad, The Ugly', meets 'Pulp Fiction' meets 'Dumb and Dumber' meets '36th Chamber of Shaolin' meets 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' meets .. What a blast! Full marks for originality, full marks for copycat spoofing, full marks for grace, elegance, superb acting, special effects and entertainment value.<br /><br />Oh, and full marks for Kung-fu :-)
