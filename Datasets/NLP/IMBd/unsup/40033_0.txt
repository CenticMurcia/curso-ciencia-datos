With the box office success of this movie, Indian film industry hit a new low. Indian film industry is still trying to come out of the bad drug that it got infected with. Just when there seemed to be some sensible movies started to come up in India, in 1994 this movie got released and brought us back to where we were 10 years back. It inspired a genre of movies which have completely meaningless melodrama, utterly nonsense dance song sequences, brainless stories. I sometimes wonder if Indian movie industry would be better if this movie (along with another crappy movie called Kuch Kuch Hota Hai) had not come. I may be wrong, Indian movies were never worth considering seriously before that also barring a very few exceptions. But this one just took it to a new low.<br /><br />Many people say this movie changed the face of Indian movies, and I absolutely agree with it, not for good but for worse. It has been close to one and a half decade and we are slowly managing coming out of the hangover. Hope Indian audience will be sensible enough not to create another Suraj Bhartyaja or Karan Johar.
