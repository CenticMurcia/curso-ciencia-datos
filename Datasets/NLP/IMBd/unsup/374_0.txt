Title: Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed <br /><br />Director: Brett Sullivan <br /><br />Cast: Emily Perkins, Katherine Isabelle, Tatiana Maslany, Eric Johnson <br /><br />Tagline: It only dies if you do <br /><br />Review: After having enjoyed the first Ginger Snaps immensely I decided to check out the sequel which had the same to actresses who played sisters on the last film. Did it live up to the coolness of the original? Well no, to be honest.<br /><br />The story follows Bridgette who after being bitten by her own sister on the last film is now also suffering the painful and slow process of becoming a werewolf. She uses a drug to help slow down the process, but how long will it last? Not a lot of time passes until she ends up in a rehab center and befriends a bunch of messed up junkie girls. The authorities believe that Bridgette is just a junkie in need of some serious rehabilitation. The girls she meets in the center are similar to the group of screwed up kids seen in Nightmare on Elm Street III: The Dream Warriors.<br /><br />What I liked about the movie was its look. It was well shot and had some stylish camera angles...also some of the characters were very very likable. Like for example the little girl who plays "ghost" she was an interesting character and one of the coolest things about the movie. She quickly befriends Bridgette due to the fact that she doest have many friends. I liked her right of the bat just cause she reads and constantly quotes her horror comics. The character of Ghost is the only thing original that this movie has to offer, aside from her and the sub plot with her grandmother, there's nothing new in Ginger Snaps 2.<br /><br />The problem with the movie is that for the longest time it just draaaags. The whole movie is just about one thing. Teasing you. You keep thinking that eventually your going to see Bridgette transform. Many times through out the film she is found in exactly the same situation...just seconds away from transforming...but then she takes that drug and everything goes back to normal. Its like watching an episode of the Hulk in which Bruce Banner never transforms into the hulking beast. For a long time...nothing really happens. The movie just stretches to the point of boredom. Until the last 15 minutes of course.<br /><br />This is supposed to be a werewolf movie, yet there's hardly any werewolf action. We only get to see one werewolf and hes hidden in shadows and quick cuts. I wished we could have seen more of the creature we came to see. Could it be that the director is afraid of showing his low budget creature? Hmm..at leas the first one showed the werewolf even if it wasn't the best looking one, it was there.<br /><br />Sadly we only get to see katherine Isabelle in a small cameo, she was a huge part in what made the first one so much fun, here shes just a watcher, a character who really does nothing except comment on what she sees and torments Bridgette. The chemistry between the two sisters which was in a large part what made the first one so enjoyable is completely gone! That sucked big time for me.<br /><br />In conclusion this movie had some good characters, a monster that wouldn't show and some nice camera shots. Gone is the chemistry between Bridgette and Ginger and the punch that the first movie had. I don't get whey there's so many positive reviews for this film it was alright, but sadly not as good as the first.<br /><br />Rating: 21/2 out of 5
