This movie leaves us the impression that the actors have been hired to appear at a rich kid's party instead of playing a part in a movie. Barring a great deal of respect for Dennis Hopper, Steven Seagal and the others, this movie looks like "a day at the office appearance" for most of them.<br /><br />Point your finger at the director because he is responsible for this low-level picture.
