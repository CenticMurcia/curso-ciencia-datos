I actually thought this movie would be at least worth watching considering what I've read about it here on IMDb. I couldn't have been more wrong and now I'm 100% sure of that the people giving this piece of garbage high votes are friends and family of the filmmakers.<br /><br />I've seen plenty of bad horror movies but at least they had something appealing in them, they weren't ALL bad, but this movies is. There isn't one single thing about this movie that is good. For starters the script is absolutely terrible and the actors are just as bad if not even worse. The plot is ridiculous just as the special effects (that consist of nothing more than blood splashing on walls etc).<br /><br />Also it's so full of clich√©s; we have the drug dealing goth girl, the black girl (who finishes every sentence with "giiiirl"), we have the sweet all American girl and finally we have the star of the movie who is a troubled about-to-go-crazy girl. I still can't understand why these four totally different girls would go on a road trip together, none the less know each other.<br /><br />Someone here compared this movie to Twin Peaks. Pfffft!! I say. That's friggin blasphemy! Twin Peaks is a true masterpiece, full of disturbing dark secrets and mystery. This movie has absolutely NONE of that. The only mystery is how the hell this movie got released.<br /><br />I suggest you stay as far away from this piece of crap as possible.
