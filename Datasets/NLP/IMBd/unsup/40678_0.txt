When Roland Copping was a child, he rolled the dice with a stipulation that if its his number, his brother would have to ride on a river. If its his brother's, then he'll write it. A roll of the dice later, Copping's brother inadvertently did a header off a water fall and has been in a catatonic state ever since.<br /><br />As for Roland, he becomes a claims investigator and, sure enough, with every roll of the dice, he is a menace to those ranging from his neighbors and passer byes, to the very people he's investigating. And why is this? Simple... his numbers came up.<br /><br />Hitchcock always had a motive for his villains, Stephin King even wrote reasons why his insane creatures and villains did what they did, Roland Copping chooses to be a jerk because... of a roll of the dice. That's it. This somehow is to explain why he keeps harassing the main characters in this movie, despite the fact that he defraud them and disproved their false claim, he STILL went after them. He went as far as to take their BMW just so he could rig up a remote control to it to harm a passer by.<br /><br />Maybe I'm not getting something, and if I'm not somebody explain it to me, but this movie made no sense. I only give it a three because Collins surprised me with his acting chops (Haven't seen Buster yet) and can play a jerk very well. I just wish it made some sense.
