I remember going into a little cinema in Texas to see this film, I wasn't expecting much... What I saw was a dead-on parody of life in the 80's. This is one of the great films of the 80's. There is a great tribute to this film in The Simpsons if you notice Homer always drinks Buzz Cola at the nuclear plant. Surf II has a strange intensity that is lacking in most films of today, too bad its not available on video or DVD. I highly recommend you track this one down, it will be well worth it.
