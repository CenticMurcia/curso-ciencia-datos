This is a very different film from the usual bollywood love and action crap, it might take some influences from the Shawshank Redemption and other American prison films but overall it is a very original and fresh film. Naseeruddin Shah really shines and the ending is good. The film is basically about an amateur filmmaker (Juhi Chawla) that wants to make a documentary about 3 prisoners on death row. They are on death row for murder, accidental or premeditated. As the film progresses you learn more about each of the prisoners and how prison has affected their life. Overall it is a pretty damn enjoyable film, and it has NO SONGS
