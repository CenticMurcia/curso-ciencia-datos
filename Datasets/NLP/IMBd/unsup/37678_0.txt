Even thirty odd years ago when I first saw it. I tried and tried, but 'What's the bleeding time?' wasn't funny to an adolescent in the 60s, and the script hasn't improved with age. I even read the 'Doctor' books to see what it was all about, and they left me cold too. Having said that though, it usually gets a look-see whenever it appears on the box (this afternoon for example), just for the quality of the cast and a look at the fifties; and to remind myself of the crush I had on Muriel Pavlow.<br /><br />It really isn't a relevant film any more, other than as a historical document of Britain as it was and of some of the finest British actors of the period.<br /><br />It will be on TV again in a few months I suspect, and I also expect that I'll catch a few minutes of it then, if I can. 4/10.
