Told in three parts, TAXIDERMIA is about the last three generations of Balatony males, a trio of men each weirder than the next.<br /><br />The film begins with the grandfather, a lonely, sex-starved soldier with cleft lip and a fire fetish. In his spare time, which is rather often, he daydreams and masturbates, visualizing shooting stars into space and using his penis like a blowtorch. Somewhere along the way, he screws his commanding officer's fat wife, gets his head blown off, and bares a son with a tail, which is promptly snipped off. Thus his chapter ends and his sons begins.<br /><br />The father is a competitive eater for Hungaria, a national hero of sorts with a huge belly, a patented vomit technique, and a lovely and equally fat and talented competitive-eating wife. Their love is initially tested, but they eventually fall for each other and have a child.<br /><br />Skeletal and insecure, the last of the Balatony's owns a taxidermy shop and takes care of his now divorced and shut-in father, who has nearly tripled in girth. At his father's request, the son tends to a trio of house cats the father has devised to enlarge in order to reclaim his long lost celebrity...of course, their relationship is very strained, and they have a heated argument. The son leaves, unknowingly leaving the cat's cage door open, and returns to find his father dead and a trail of intestine leading to the growling felines. In an artful turn of events, the son stuffs his deceased father, straps himself into an ingeniously made surgical chair, removes his organs, sews himself up, and kills himself.<br /><br />TAXIDERMIA is extremely well-made; great camera angles, style, acting, music, and effects. It is pretty disturbing however, and it's variety of extreme close-ups include genitalia, self-surgery, barfing, masturbation, and yes, taxidermia.<br /><br />One of the more unique and creative films I've seen in a while. Really good stuff if you like your films stylish and disturbing.
