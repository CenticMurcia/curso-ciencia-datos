That and many other strange lines populate this rather boring film that has all the tension and excitement of paint drying. A rather bland young man turns down a country road and finds witches, killer grandmas, and walnut ranchers. He says "Zah!" to some people in a general store and there's an odd flashback featuring the hillbilly from "The Giant Spider Invasion." Then, the film seems to restart itself as the bland leading man turns down the same road from the beginning. In the end, Satan wins the day and we are left with the feeling that ninety minutes have gone by, and we'll never get them back. Even watching on MST, it's still rough
