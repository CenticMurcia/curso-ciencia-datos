tom lives an unscrupulous life working for the real estate business. He and his colleagues use the nastiest means to oust the occupants. fighting, tearing the room into pieces, putting snake (or rats?) through the door slit - the beginning of the film is full of violent happenings in the dark. There isn't the faintest sign that this electro lover approaching his 30s can be a talented pianist.<br /><br />his life is changed when he meets an old colleague of his mother who reminds him that his mom was a brilliant concert pianist. he is invited for an audition and since then his life is filled with his passionate pursuit of his dream. he has lessons every day with a Chinese pianist miao lin. the Chinese girl can hardly speak any french, nor is she very expressive of her emotions. it is quite intriguing to observe how they interact in the film.<br /><br />the efforts he spends on the preparation has changed him. when he goes back to his real estate job, the beat of his heart "stops" as he comes to see how spiteful a life he has had. it is wise to leave it like this without further description. this makes the ending more enigmatic. two days after watching the film i am still pondering what was meant by the glance at the end, what kind of emotions tom must have & why he does not kill the Russian guy.<br /><br />Romain Duris is a brilliant actor. most scenes were emotionally intense and very well-acted. i am excited to see how he listens to and plays music. not only are the piano pieces pleasing, the techno also thrills (trance is great!). i like it so much the way it portrays the dark side of his life at the beginning. a hard but realistic film which deserves one's mental efforts.
