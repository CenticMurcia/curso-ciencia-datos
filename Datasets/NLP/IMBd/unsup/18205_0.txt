Unearthed was shot on digital video on a modest budget. If it had been filmed on 35mm, you'd be enjoying it in theaters already. It's science-fiction at its modest-budget best, with accomplished actors and great camera work by writer/director Craig Kovach. The locations and sets are first rate and the story is compelling.<br /><br />The Movie revolves around an Indian artifact 'unearthed' during a construction project. Strange characters (some good, some bad), populate nearly every scene as the hunt for the artifact accelerates through the highways and byways of Tampa. Flashbacks to previous lives drive the protagonist forward in search for the truth about the artifact. There are some unique scenes i guarantee will surprise even the most ardent IMDb fans and keep you interested through the final reel.<br /><br />A must-see for any sci-fi or horror junkie.
