You have to see this movie! It has all consistences of a great movie-a good story, things to laugh and things to cry!... But to understand it better, you have to be a parent...I think... Well at least I know, it wouldn't touched me that deeply if I wasn't! Great actor play also-it makes you believe that this is actually happening, and the actors are real Mayas. And if somebody has something to say, about the movie, being too "natural" and too "real", I can tell that the life itself it is, so the movies should be, like this one!...Or else you wan't believe it! It's really great and I have nothing more to say, except: I love Mel Gibson! He really has something to say and got nothing to hide! Exceptional work! I hope I can shake your hand someday!
