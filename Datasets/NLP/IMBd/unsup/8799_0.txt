I just watched a screener of this film after a friend who worked on post-production insisted I watch it. I usually don't care for action films but, I heard this was made on a shoe-string budget so, I'm always interested to see what filmmakers can pull off.<br /><br />I must say, I was pleasantly surprised that there was a story!! A redemption story at that! I was told this was a kung-fu action film but, it seem to be more of a crime/ thriller, with some kung-fu action. Although, it's obviously a low-budget film and has some weak actors, this film holds together and has heart. I actually cared about the main character, and was sad at the end, which is more than I can say for most big-budget action films!! Kudos to Jason Yee, hope he keeps going because he is a star!! Where is he, what's he doing next? Viva, Your Independent Spirit, Jason!! I was looking on IMDb for more info on this film and I was compelled to write this after reading heartless comments left by immature users.
