We've all had problems with our jobs, but how a job can relate to relationship problems is something else. In "Career Opportunities", they develop that to an interesting degree. In this case, janitor Frank Whaley and popular girl Jennifer Connelly accidentally get locked in a department store overnight, and thus have to reassess their lives (especially when some thugs break in).<br /><br />Knowing that John Hughes was involved in this movie, we may expect it to be another "Breakfast Club" or "Home Alone". "Career Opportunities" is far superior to either of those. More than an excuse to look cool or cute, this movie dissects the characters' lives: he's the guy who no one ever thought could make something of himself, she's the pampered teenager primed for a world of excesses. And it's up to them how they deal with this sticky situation.<br /><br />Anyway, this isn't a masterpiece, but I still recommend it. Also starring Dermor Mulroney, and John Candy in a bit part.
