Well, well, well other movie studios can make Disney-esquire films without actually being affiliated with Disney! Such a low state of affairs for a movie studio when they try to 'out-Disney' Disney. And they seem to have beat them, but only in Disney's bad sequels department. Trouble is, this isn't a sequel! The premise is very cheesy: a dog actor thinks gets lost during a stunt and they only find his hairpiece. What??!?! I can't believe that, but it gets worse. The 'troubled' kid only seems to ditch class sometimes.

Bad, evil corporations trying to burn people out of their homes! Not like the real ones, who only buy people out of their homes and claim 'imminent domain'. Well, I guess pyromania is more plausible? Overall, except for the explosion near the end, nothing exciting or interesting happened. "D-"
