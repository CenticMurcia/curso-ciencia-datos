Tut, tut, tut, oh Vinny what rubbish have you got yourself into now?<br /><br />Well first off, I would just like to say that Vinny Jones does not deserve all of the harsh comments directed at this film (well let's face it he's not the sharpest tool in the box is he?), but I definitely think he should have said no to this little stinker. <br /><br />The film started with a couple of ideas that weren't too bad, but ideas can't save a film with no story. Also choosing Vinny Jones to be the lead in you're movie, doesn't exactly spring Multi-million pound film to mind does it?<br /><br />I liked the fact the movie was filmed in the place it was actually supposed to be set in, this is something you don't see enough today (Plus Ireland does have some lovely scenery).<br /><br />The Bogman (if that's the right term) wasn't at all scary, though he might have been a good idea for a kids movie. The actors were surprisingly good (too good for this film anyway), but us as the audience didn't really empathise with the characters they played (probably because most of the characters had the annoying factor, this was probably their intention, but that only works for likable B movies i'm afraid), which is kind of important in a film like this.<br /><br />Using English, American and Irish actors in the film was quite a clever move, they probably thought this would make it more appealable to all audiences and therefore make more money off it. Having the characters come together gradually was also clever, I like it when films do this, because it shows that all the characters had a life before the event, and not just the main character. <br /><br />Although the ending was predictable and just added to the pointlessness of the film, I thought it could have been worse.<br /><br />To summarise, the film was awful and judging by some of the reviews on this site alone, you'd have to go a long way to find someone to disagree with you on that.
