What? If you're expecting a serious comedy, then you will undoubtedly be disappointed.<br /><br />As far as comic-book characterisation and 80's chic go, this film is perfectly tongue-in-cheek.<br /><br />The chemistry between Jay Jay and Chaos is superb... still funny well into the 2000's.<br /><br />In line with a ream of other comedies of its time ("Planes, Trains and Automobiles", "Trading Places" and "Spies Like Us" - all SNL spawned classics) and superior in its way to all clones made since.<br /><br />Que the music - "tan-,tan-,taaaah!!!"
