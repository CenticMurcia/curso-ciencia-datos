First season seemed reasonable. It had some 'unrealistic' edge, but generally it was a reach setting with possibilities. It had consistent developing global plot.<br /><br />Second season introduced big amount of mindless action. Some episodes became of little relevance and/or with multiple silly moments. Commonwealth development became something inessential, some episodes involving Commonwealth activities were a joke. Last episode added substantial chaos to global plot (as it turns out, it was already too late to damage the series).<br /><br />First episodes of third season made no sense at all, like if story was being invented during filming by passing-by random people, having no idea about global and even episode-local plot. I couldn't continue after that.
