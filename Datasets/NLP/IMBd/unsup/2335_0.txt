A story of a groom going through the pre-wedding dilemmas of manhood and loyalties. A uniquely told story by talented director Lee Rogers. The raw style captures the lifestyle and heartbeat of the ozzie beach scene in sydney, or more specifically, Bondi beach. Great performances by all cast members, including singing sensation Kate Ceberano. Very relatable storyline that is heartfelt and honestly told. A bunch of unique characters that are fun and humorous and make for good comic relief. Surfing in the nude is always fun to watch, i don't care who you are. Definitely worth watching for wit and charm that is brought to the table by this troupe of Australian surfers and their friends.
