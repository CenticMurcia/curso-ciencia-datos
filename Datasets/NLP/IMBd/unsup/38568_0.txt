Hollywood today is sort of the democratic party's propaganda machine. While the business world finally realized that serving & pleasing the customer is the idea, the American media still obsesses with messaging us to death, reasoning, where else can we go for visual content?<br /><br />Thus comes this, trying to feature all the right bases. In fact,we're lucky it was made before gays took over; most films now have to have at least one gay scene, no matter how stupid. <br /><br />Anyway, you can feel this trying to be a movie. The sexual excitement as the two psychos (on either side of the cell bars) turn each other on with their intense chitchat and his endeavoring to touch her. And his evil strength, tossing guards everywhere, gives us good menace to fear. <br /><br />Then it fails. Real guards would chain his legs after getting beat up several times. These just keep getting beat. And after the killer shows great mental powers by killing all the men in his path and escaping, he realizes the movie is going to end so he lets the girl shoot him so we don't get the would-be-delicious con-mentally-overpowers-stupid-but-gorgeous-scientist-and screws her as she gasps don't, while stripping.<br /><br />Add in the innocent (of course) executed con. Vicous warden. Crying mom makes a brief appearance. It's kinda fun that these people seemingly wander in and out during the executions, where real ones take all the fun out and restrict 'em to death (so to speak). The movie throws in a few more cardboard cutouts; the gov, his advisers, a judge the evil guy mentally forces to kill himself. All these get a little screen time, then off for the next CC's. The psycho girl finds her aborted baby's grave, I guess. Why? I dunno. Why not? She already somehow is the only one who knows how to build a mind past-and-future memory film making gizmo that nobody except her seems interested in. How would a psycho know how to build one, anyway? Most psychs become one because there's nothing easier in college. Oh well, throw it in. <br /><br />Is it soup yet?
