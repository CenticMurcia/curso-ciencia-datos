After Jason was killed in the last 8 entries, it seems rather stupid to try and explain that this would indeed be the last time, especially since they would go back on their word, also their Final Chapter was hardly the last. However this time the story is a little different as now Jason has been led into an ambush and is blown to pieces, however his evil heart lives on and he possesses various people to kill people who are a threat to his immortality, as a bounty hunter says that only a Voorhies can kill him, this of course leads to his sister, niece and grandniece, they are the only ones who can stop him. Jason Goes To Hell:The Final Friday is titled a little weirdly in that New Line had just bought the franchise and yet they claimed to only make one movie out of it? However the problem here is that the mumbo jumbo explaining Jason's evil isn't very well explained and although it's admirable to offer an explanation, just as many unanswered questions surface. For instance is the character of Duke(Missing In Action 2's Steven Williams) who seems to know about the rituals and such. Where did he find this out? Of course nobody expects logic in a ninth entry in a series but give us something. Also of great disappointment is that Jason is hardly in it, at the beginning and at the very end. However I give them points for trying and although it doesn't emerge as the thriller aimed for, there are some inspired moments of gore. Also the film is watchable through out.<br /><br />* * out of 4-(Fair)
