How could you do a better movie about storytelling than showing how hard it is! Solondz splits the movie in two parts, "Fiction" and "Non-fiction" and shows in both how easily our subjective perception of real life loses its grips in other people's perceptions, situations, expectations... while writing about it. Whoever has ever written something: Don't miss this film!
