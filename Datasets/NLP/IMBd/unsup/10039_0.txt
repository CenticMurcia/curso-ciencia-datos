This was one of my favorite movies the first time I saw it. After seeing 'What Lies Beneath', I would have to say that, as much as I love Back to the Future, I like Zemeckis' darker films best. I absolutely loved Bruce Willis in this movie.<br /><br />Also, the use of film manipulation and special effects is excellent for its' time in this movie, and is still easily appreciated even now. What I love best about Zemeckis, has to be his use of the passing of time in his movies. Huge time lines are crammed into a few chapters! It's amazing. Characters age. It's so great. And, as always, there is just the right amount of imagination in this film. One of his best!
