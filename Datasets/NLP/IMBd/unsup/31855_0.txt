It was only at the beginning of this year, that my parent's came into the living room, saying 'Guess what..? Were going to see The Island!'. I thought that they meant we were going to get onto a plane and just look at a boring island off the coast of Perth. Then, I turned on the Comedy Channel to find The Island was a comedy act with the famous Lano and Woodley. Personally, I love their show.<br /><br />As we watched the show, I couldn't hold on. When I mean hold on, I mean my bladder. I was laughing too much. I loved the part where Frank ask's the neighbour to feed their cat when they were away, only to come back to the neighbour, moment's later, to tell her that they don't have a cat. Then, on the last visit, he ask's her "Can you buy us a cat while we are away and feed that? Okay, thanks!" And the judge! He rocked my socks! I loved the part "I shouldn't be a judge... I should have been a vanquilaqist!" And saying the second part, with his mouth closed.<br /><br />And what about 'Salt' (Da! Da da!). Even that little music number with Frank playing the ukalea or Colin singing the song 'I Love Me!'.<br /><br />Out of all the comedy act's I've seen, this was the one that got my boot knock, and the audience alway's getting a laughter and shock!
