This show was hilarious! I really wish that it would have been given more of a chance. The actors/actresses were perfect in their roles and had real chemistry. I only hope that some time in the future perhaps the cast will be reunited in some new series. If you haven't seen it I recommend downloading the episodes from some peer to peer network, you will love it if you watch more than the first 15 minutes of the first episode. Glenn Howerton, who plays Cory in the show, has a lot of talent and should go far as an actress. And Eddie Shin is just downright hilarious in his role. I hope to see more of him in other sitcoms in the future. But all of the cast made this show one of those "gotta see the next episode" series that should have stayed around for a long time. Too bad, the network didn't know what they had with this one!
