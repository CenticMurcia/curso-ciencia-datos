This movie was previewed before Captain America. I don't think I need to say anymore. They're both as good as each other.<br /><br />And by that I mean they're totally awesome! Never before has the emotion of the Gulf War been captured on film with such accuracy! Rob Lowe is a god of the silver screen! The way he owns the screen, its perfect! This movie challenges conventional war films by being sub-conventional! Standards are reduced to bouts of hilarity! Okay, I'm lying, this movie can't be good.<br /><br />Honestly.<br /><br />It just can't.
