I have been to Sundance, Toronto, Venice, to name a few, and of all the independent films that I have seen (and I have seen lots!) I have yet to see a film with such heart. It's not a new story, but it captures the feeling of a first love in a way that is hard to not be moved. Although not the esoteric film that we usually see in the independent circuit, it is so well done that I looked beyond its minor flaws. Lovely film.
