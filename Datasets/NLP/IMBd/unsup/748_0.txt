For those of you that stole (or borrowed) your parent's National Geographics, for whatever purpose, this is the film for you. You would be hard pressed to find any better looking native girls going around topless and mostly bottomless anywhere( and they actually *hate* wearing western style clothes!-great scene there)<br /><br />This movie is mostly a "Tarzan" adventure about a boy lost in the Amazon(no plug intended) rain forest that was brought up by natives instead of apes. Lots of "nostalgia" about a way of life that has been lost because of ecological destruction caused by man's "progress". Usually such proselytizing would make for a pretty boring movie, but Boorman keeps the action lively with cannibals, naked native women, forced prostitution, gunfights, knifefights, spearfights and the like.<br /><br />National Geographic was never like this!
