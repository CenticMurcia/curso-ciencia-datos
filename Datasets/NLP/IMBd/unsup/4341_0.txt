The original Home Alone is an outstanding classic. Home Alone 2 is good, but not outstanding. It has the same cast members and a similar plot to the original. This time Kevin isn't left at home, he mistakenly ends up in New York, by himself. At the same time, Harry and Marv, the two bumbling burglars from the original, have gotten out of jail and just happen to be in New York. What a bad turn for Kevin.<br /><br />There are a few other sub plots in this that make the movie more fun and interesting as it goes. The only bad thing about this movie is that it follows the sequence of events a little too closely to the original. The settings in this movie are different, so the story takes a new approach in some ways.<br /><br />I think most kids will love the original, but like this at the same time. John Hughes makes his movies in a way so they are directed at an audience that is the same age as the main character. That is the reason his movies appeal to so many people.<br /><br />This is definitely worth watching. It's not as outstanding as the original, but it is head and shoulders above the horrid 3rd and 4th Home Alones. You should give this a try and ignore the IMDb rating of 5.0. I'm sure the whole family will like it.
