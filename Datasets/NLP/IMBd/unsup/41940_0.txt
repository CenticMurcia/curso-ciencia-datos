I probably haven't seen such a bad movie since Kull the Conqueror.<br /><br />This movie is an offense even to the teenage genre, it's about a mind controlling chip that is installed to the small town high school rebel students, turning them into "A" students, football jocks and cheerleaders in a scheme for world domination, so, see it a your own risk.
