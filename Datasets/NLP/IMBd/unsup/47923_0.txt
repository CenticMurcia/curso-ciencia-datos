It seems as though EVERY new Christmas movie that comes out is listed as an "Instant Classic" and this is no different.<br /><br />I think this as a so-so effort with a different approach to the Rudolph story known by all. When presented with the incredible animation process of Polar Express this is, in my opinion, less enjoyable than the Rankin Bass production from 1964. The songs are simple and, even though the Paul and Linda McCartney hit "Wonderful Christmas Time" is listed as one of them, it is only a small snip-it version of perhaps 30 seconds.<br /><br />I prefer the classics that I grew up with like the original Grinch or Rudolph, but my child enjoys the show and, as the saying goes, "To each his own".
