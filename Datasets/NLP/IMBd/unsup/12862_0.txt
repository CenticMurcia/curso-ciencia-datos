Amazingly good, in the mould of a classic western, with Sanjay Dutt, who is maybe one of the best actors period. He is up there with Pacino, Bachchan, Brando, etc. <br /><br />Nandita Das stood out, playing Dutt's wife, in a very powerful performance. <br /><br />I enjoyed the slow build up to the climax of the film; Puri in one of his best "bad guy" roles was also great. <br /><br />.. One warning, I had to buy this DVD three times. Both previous copies by Spark, where defective and would not play past the 70-minute mark.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
