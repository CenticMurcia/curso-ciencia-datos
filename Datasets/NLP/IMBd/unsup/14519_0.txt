I seen this movie as a young teen, and fell in love with the movie and the books. I recently purchased 2 of the 4 books to read and be 15 again and remember all of the emotions you go through as a young girl. I'm 35 yrs old and just found the movie on DVD and had to have it. Michael and Jesse are what ever girl dreams of having with a hot looking older guy!!!! I still do. However, I'm married to a wonderful man. But there is always a place in my heart for my first love Michael Skye (Rex Smith). This movie is a MUST HAVE -- MUST SEE. Anyone with preteen,or teen girls will want to watch this with them. Young love .......... first love. It is a movie that takes you back to your first love. It did for me.
