I don't have much to say here. I just finished watching First Spaceship on Venus from 1960. It's exactly what is says, a movie about the first spaceship on Venus.<br /><br />Words can't really describe how incredibly bad this movie is. Perhaps it is because it is dubbed over from it's original German dialogue, but even without dialogue it is pretty clear what is going on. A team of scientists intercept a message from deep space, fly to the source, discover alien life, learn a lot about the universe and each other along the way. Very basic for a science fiction movie from the 50s and 60s.<br /><br />Still, this is a special one. I don't think I've come across one so poorly put together in just about every possible aspect of production. It's a wonder that the producers didn't have these people arrested for attempting to release this. There are so many things wrong within the first few minutes that you start to tune out what is happening and just start enjoying the garbage being thrown at you.<br /><br />I think I have said too much. I recommend you watch the movie to see how a movie should NEVER be made.
