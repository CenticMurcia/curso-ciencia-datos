**WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD** Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself is postmodern nihilism at its worst. Nothing funny in this film. The characters are grotesque, self-centered, disloyal and dysfunctional. Harbour is the only likeable person; a man who gives selflessly of himself to his suicidal younger brother and everyone else in his life, only to be betrayed and scorned (even by his own parents). No one can give a reason for living to Wilbur because life is just "here" with no ultimate reason or reference to God. Harbour nevertheless tries to help Wilbur best he can. Wilbur procedes to "repay" his brother by having an affair with his wife, who claims to "love" Harbour. The affair continues even after Harbour is diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. When asked what a near death experience was like for Wilbur (white light?)he responds "nothing. Just blackness and silence." Lovely. Harbour, rather than try to go on fighting a almost certain death sentence from cancer, commits suicide in the hopes his brother will honor his promise to look after his wife and stepdaughter, giving Wilbur a reason to live. His grave not even cold yet, Wilbur visits hand in hand with his brother's widow and stepdaughter talking of marriage (we all know how sacred those vows are to them. Why even bother?)The movie ends at a graveyard, replete with bleak scenery that leaves you disturbed, angry for what happened to Harbour, and perhaps even wishing everyone else BUT Harbour had killed themselves. Sartre would have liked this movie, but not even one as twisted as he would dare to have labeled this trash as "comedy."
