This is easily one of the worst films I have ever seen.<br /><br />Walking fraternity-stereotype Jake teams up with timid wing man to score chicks. The wing man turns out to be the heir to the throne of some fictional Mediterranean country and has to get laid before his 21st birthday, or whatever.<br /><br />The plot must not have been much of a concern for the "creative force" behind this game. That is how they label themselves during the end credits.<br /><br />The whole film is basically Jake spewing tired platitudes and inane one liners and come ons.<br /><br />Perhaps this is one for the fraternity boys out there who could not get enough of Stifler from the first three American Pie films. His character was at least somewhat tongue-in cheek, and was balanced out by other, less annoying characters in the cast. There is no such awareness or balance in this "film." To quote Kevin Smith, if you "have an IQ less than your shoe size," or if you are white and regularly use sayings like "fo shizzle" this might be the greatest film of all time, right up there with American Pie: Beta House or Booty Call.
