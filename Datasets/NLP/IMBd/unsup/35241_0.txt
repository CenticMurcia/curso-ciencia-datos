We've just gone through the Bakker family scandal, so hey, why not make a tasteless vulgar comedy out of squeaky clean religion? This is the most lurid use of satire I've ever witnessed out of SALVATION! After 80 sinful minutes, it's time I've gone into the shower and wash away the evil-spirited entertainment stuck in my soul! The movie isn't even worth laughing about, not just in satirizing the Bible, but in bland, senseless, flatulent humor. Rent this one and see what I mean. In the end, nothing can save anybody from surviving this Armageddon of dirty laundry!
