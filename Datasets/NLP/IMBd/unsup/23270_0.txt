This show's format is the reason why I keep watching each season. Imagine travelling around the world and your final target is US$1 million, it's for those who dare to do it.<br /><br />The recently concluded season is one great show. The ultimate winners were whom I wanted to win and it's a great ending to a show that has won the Emmys before.<br /><br />Overall, if you are the one who has always wanted to see how the world really is and interested to see how the various teams outdo each other to the finish line, this show is for you. Also, prepare for culture-shock abound because as they say - 'When in Rome, do as the Romans do'.<br /><br />Phil really does a good job of being the host and it's almost impossible to not linking the guy who hosts The Amazing Race.<br /><br />The show is just...amazing!
