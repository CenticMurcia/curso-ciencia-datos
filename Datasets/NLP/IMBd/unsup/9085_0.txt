I really enjoyed this movie. I always catch funny, interesting or thought provoking films late at night on television and this happens to be one of those. <br /><br />John Turturro (the reason I started watching the film in the first place) plays Benjamin a character facing death attempting to make the best of it. One of the consequences of the illness causing his death is memory loss and memory is a running theme in the movie. Hilarious yet quiet, the film uses old home movie projections on different sources of water to show Benjamin's earlier memories. <br /><br />Giving away some of his possessions, drinking and casual sex run a gamut of things Benjamin attempts after learning he has five weeks to live. His odd behaviour is noted and addressed by his ex-wife and friends, a very good supporting cast. <br /><br />You may think the theme of a man living his life extravagantly with only weeks to live thus showing us how little time we really have is a tired and overplayed one. I thought this at the beginning of the film, but it soon won me over and I recommend it to most anyone (language and some nudity are present). Especially to anyone living in Montreal, as that is where it was filmed. Big city shots are used, which is rare when something is being filmed in Canada. 8/10
