I've got a spoiler for you so if you don't want to look at a spoiler look away right now O.K. here's the spoiler: this movie sucks big time.<br /><br />The utter craptitude of this project is beyond shame. A political Trojan horse of a movie if there ever was one. I should have suspected something when I kept trying to determine whether I had stepped into something on the way home from Blockbuster only to realize that the odour was emanating from my blockbuster bag. Never has an olfactory sensation so shocked my senses. Undeterred I removed it from its Pandora's box and unleashed it upon my DVD player. The movie did give me a million dollar idea however-google could invent a penis pop-up blocker for the DVD player, I know I'd buy one. I've had political agendas crammed in my face before but this is ridiculous (pun intended). If certain people want to push their beliefs that is fine but to do it in an underhanded style such as this is disgusting and abusive. Using shock value as your only means of persuasion is unintelligent and actually childish. What if in Bambi at the end a little kid came up hunting with his dad, cocked a shotgun with one hand and blew Bambi's brains all over the screen Pulp Fiction NC-17 style? Then immediately they cut to an American flag waving and patriotic music playing, and a shot of the kid hugging his proud father with a screen that said The End brought to you by the NRA. That would be the shocking equivalent. Never before has a movie sucked in this way and perhaps...one never will again.
