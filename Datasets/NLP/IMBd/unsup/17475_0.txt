Few know that this film was the studio's biggest "blockbuster" until "Jaws" was released 20 years later. The film does chronicle some of the exploits of Audie Murphy, who having grown up dirt poor in Texas, went on to become the most highly decorated soldier of WWII. The film is somewhat dated and was definitely cleaned up to appeal to a larger audience, but nonetheless, it gives a pretty accurate version of this man's damn near suicidal bravery. Because Murphy was rejected by the Marine Corps, and was a fairly small man in stature, an under current of the underdog story develops as the young Murphy attempts to do just about anything in order to improve himself. This was not Murphy's first film, so perhaps this explains his above average performance and seeming comfort on camera. He is supported by a crew of veteran performers, (Marshall Thompson, Jack Kelly) who do there best to let Murphy be the center of attention. It's a terrific story, enhanced only a little by the fact it's true, and if you're able to imagine a remake of this film, I don't see how it couldn't be successful.
