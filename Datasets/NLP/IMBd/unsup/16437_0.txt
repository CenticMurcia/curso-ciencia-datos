There's only one word that you can describe when talking about Lynda carter and her role in Bobbie Jo and the Outlaw. That word is Fantastic! Lynda Carter stars in this film as Bobbie Jo Baker, Marjoe Gortner plays the role of Lyle Wheeler and Jesse Vint plays the role of Slick Callahan. Bobbie Jo is restless and is tried of the small town life and is looking for bigger things. That's when Lyle Wheeler enters the picture. Lyle is a want to be outlaw who goes from town to town participating in gun fights. Lyle trucks breaks down and he starts looking for other means of transportation. While at a drive in burger place Lyle takes notices of the beautiful Bobbie Jo. When Bobbie Jo walks out on her mom she hooks up with Lyle and there long journey begins. When Bobbie Jo and Lyle run out of money and a place to go they hook up with her sister Pearl and her boy friend Slick Callahan. Now all four of them plus a friend are on the long journey life looking for happiness and instead they get trouble. As for Lynda Carter she was fantastic, gorgeous and if you're a Lynda Carter fan you can't keep your eyes of her. I believe that this movie was the big reason why she landed her role in Wonder Woman in the fall of 1975. I have this movie on DVD and its part of my Lynda Carter collection. Based on Lynda performance alone I give this movie 10 weasel stars.
