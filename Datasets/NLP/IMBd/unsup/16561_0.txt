There are only a handful of movies I have evr walked out on because they were so dull they were unwatchable. Something to talk about is one of them and though not the MOST boring movie I have ever seen it certainly comes close.<br /><br />The movie sounded interesting when it first came out but somehow I missed seeing it when it came out and, years later when it came to television was really looking forward to seeing it. Unfortunetly, the feeling was fleeting...<br /><br />This movie moves at a snail's pace. Nothing ever seems to HAPPEN and the more seconds that tick by the more bored one is watching it. I have seen most of Julia's work and with the possible exception of "Sleeping with the enemy" thought her movies very well made. This is a major exception. I am also a big Kyra Sedgewick fan so I hung in there hoping something(anything) would happen. <br /><br />I think the subject matter was interesting, it's been done many times but that doesn't mean it can't be done again if it's done well. The problem is when a movie's THIS slow going on action it runs the risk of losing it's audience when something DOES happen. That was the case with me and others I know have expressed the same feeling about this movie.<br /><br />
