an absolute dream-like beauty to this film. It possesses the best of say a Wim Wenders masterpiece, coupled with the narrative of a whacked-out indie great. Every moment is fully realized........never forcing the viewer to "feel" anything. heartbreaking and hilarious, with art direction that is a knock-out! The direction and the acting were gorgeous (especially the stunning Katharine Isabelle!). Both the narrative and pictorial silences in this film say so much more than most films do in the entirety. So much is left to the viewers politics and prejudices, it almost feels interactive (granted I grew up during this period, so that probably has a lot to do with it). If you're a child of the 60's / 70's (or a dysfunctional home.......and who isn't.........) this is a must see.
