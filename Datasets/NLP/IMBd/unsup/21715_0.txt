I would certainly recommend this film to anyone and everyone, especially as i've just watched this film and as soon as i'd seen it once, I immediately wanted to start watching it again, it was fantastic. I didn't even realise how much time had past between me starting to watch it and finish watching it. It certainly made me laugh, as well as cry, especially the end after Shane arrives at the Pow-Wow in Alberqueque & sees in the people there, some of the elements of the people in the stories that he was told by his grandfather before he died on the way, then watching him beat the drum to start the storytelling and remembering what he was like at the beginning rebelling against everyone & everything.
