For his first film, M. Night Shyamalan, leaves much to be desired in this film. It's not really a bad film, maybe mediocre at best. Nothing wrong with the story, but the film is very low energy and a bit too sugary for my taste. The acting is weak, the directing is slow paced and not involving and I found myself nodding off occasionally. Maybe I needed a nap but I don't think so. The story involves a child's quest to find God after his beloved grandfather dies. Most of the film takes place in a Catholic Boys Academy and the hijinks that ensue are very corny and cheesy. Rosie O'Donnell and Camryn Manheim were OK as nuns but the young cast were all below par as actors. The good news is that Shyamalan did survive this to direct "Sixth Sense", "Unbreakable" and "Signs".
