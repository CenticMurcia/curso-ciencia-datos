I have been a longtime fan of the controversial TV show South Park, and I went to see the feature-length movie the first night it came out. Well, Trey Parker has done it again - shocked me to the point that my jaw almost hit the floor (and I do NOT shock easily).<br /><br />Even those (myself included) who believe that the show has lost its novelty (the new episodes have kinda sucked lately) - are in for a treat with this one.<br /><br />"South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut" has absolutely NO barriers in its comedy - it pokes fun at gays, straights, blacks, whites, Jews, Christians, the handicapped... you name it. It even pokes a LOT of fun at Canadians (which I am), which makes it a hilarious free-for-all that is NOT for children or the easily offended.<br /><br />Most of the characters are here (except Mr. Hankey - a shame, but I can't really see where Parker could have written him in), and there's a LOT of hilarious musical numbers (including the side-splitting Terrance and Phillip song, "Uncle F--ka"). If you think you can handle it, go see this movie by all means. If you're prudish and easily offended, stay home and rent "The Horse Whisperer".<br /><br />
