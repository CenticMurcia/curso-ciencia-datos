Michael Keaton's performance in Pacific Heights is interesting, but the film practically makes no sense. I didn't care about the characters that Matthew Modine and Melanie Griffith portrayed, and I think the direction was pretty lame. Only worth watching if you would like to see Michael Keaton in a strange role.
