Having lived with only a handful of other tenants in a large building undergoing renovation in New York City (and on the same floor that Stephanie lived on), the subject matter of this film was a little too close to home. We also had ex-cons working in our building, and we had break-ins and crimes committed by maintenance staff, though no rapes or murders.<br /><br />The film had a couple of mildly terrifying moments, but most of it failed to convey a sense of dread, or was original enough in its details (except for the setting, which was terrific) to be considered truly frightening.<br /><br />The crimes committed were a bit too abrupt. As a previous reviewer noted, there was precious little exposition that would have lent a sense of suspense and depth. And with all the good (great) unemployed actors out there, it seems a better cast could have been picked. The film had a kind of amateurish/film-school project aura about it that was at once admirable and disconcerting.<br /><br />***** SPOILER *****<br /><br />Finally, what happened to the door leading to the outside? It seemed to have disappeared! Even if the writer/director had made the choice for Paul to chain lock the exits to the street or something, it would have lent a note of believability to the final scenes. But the victims seemed content to stay inside to play a deadly game of cat and mouse with Paul, and that made it hard for me to suspend my disbelief.<br /><br />***** END SPOILER *****<br /><br />I would like to see this film rewritten, shot with higher production values, and re-released. It has a decent kernel of a plot and a superb setting -- it just needs more vibrant characterizations, some connection to the outside world to keep it from drifting too far into the realm of disbelief, and more skilled actors. Music could have been more prominent and original, too.
