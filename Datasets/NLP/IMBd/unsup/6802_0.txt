Don't go into this movie expecting a modern action adventure film. It's a movie very much of it's time where the bad guys grimaced and the hero's were gentlemen. Hong Kong martial arts movies were and still are made in just a few days and the storyline is rushed through as the emphasis of the movie is the action, and that's not lacking here as Norris stars as the adopted son of a casino owner who is under pressure from the local mafia.<br /><br />It's also one of the few Chuck Norris titles not yet on DVD and I can't understand why! He's on peak fighting form here only a few years after his Karate championship successes.
