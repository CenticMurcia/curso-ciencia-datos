Pretty good Sci-Fi flick. In the vein of "Pitch Black" and the last 2 "Alien" movies. Should've been R rated. That could have given the director/actors more room to really explore the true terror these dragons were inflicting and could've been more graphic/dark. Not enough dragon sequences. Also, would've been much more plausible had it taken place in the 1930's or 1940's. That would help explain how we weren't able to deal the dragons. Also the much overused ending of a small band of humans with almost no weapons left being able to defeat the supreme enemy - in this case the Bull dragon - would work better in 1942 as opposed to 2020. I give it a 7 out of 10. Definitely worth watching.
