Formidable film built on an original scenario, Two men in the city is a load against the death penalty and a dark report on the incapacity of the Republic to grant one second chance to that which made an error. But it is also, quite simply, the tragic history of a man. Four years after their Clan of the siciliens, José Giovanni again joins together the couple, Gabin/Delon in a film . It calls also upon one of known leading man , with dishevelling Michel Bouquet in relentless police , Bernard Giraudeau who plays the son of the teacher Cazeneuve, the presenter Christine Fabréga, his wife, Cecile Vassort ,his daughter.Victor Lanoux , Gerard Depardieu and Gabrille Briand three mafias, One could say, in a certain manner, which we all are of Gino Strabliggi..... that's a simple existence transfers with the drama. What is striking, it is to see the life gradually escaping the character literally from film. A combination of circumstances: a mourning which pushes to start again elsewhere, the chance which puts to you in the presence of harmful characters, voluntarily or involuntarily, the feeling of injustice in justice.<br /><br />The interpretation of Alain Delon one of his best in his career. One will never say enough the importance of the glances in this film. Delon deploys a varied and sensitive "pallet" . Jean Gabin, to his practice, brings a considerable appreciation to the interest of film. Narrator and the pilot main thing of the drama, it systematically replaces the pseudo truths in their true contradiction with the owner of the printing works which employs Gino Strabliggi, humanity in a terribly mechanical and cold landscape.<br /><br />It is necessary to have seen the two almost dumb scenes in which the two actors exchange glances, that of the visiting room and that of the execution. Into the latter, Gino Strabliggi slips to Germain Cazeneuve "- I am afraid" like that of a son to his father.<br /><br />last word ,the original music of Philippe Sarde, perfectly adapted to film; light and sad old story... like the destiny.<br /><br />
