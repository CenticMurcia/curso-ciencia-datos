Hav Plenty is a clever romantic comedy that is appealing because of its unique cast. Seldom do American audiences get the opportunity to view intelligent comedy starring African Americans.<br /><br />Hav Plenty demonstrates that the Black community is not limited.<br /><br />Hav Plenty was a pleasure to watch. I own the DVD... It's a cute and witty film that confirms what I have known all along. Black people are diverse. They have class and sophistication. They are attractive, intelligent and extremely talented.
