This is actually an above average sequel. Yes it's low budget and there are no celberities(except Eddie Albert if he counts) but the film is done tastefully. There are some good scares and it's a good follow up to the original. The original actress who played Remi in the original returns as a teacher who suspects the judus breed has returned. It's not as good as the orginal but it's very decent. Plus the special effects are good, good action, good suprises and it's short which always helps.
