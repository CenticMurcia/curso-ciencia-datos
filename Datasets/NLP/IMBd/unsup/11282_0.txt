Abbas-Mustan after BAAZIGAR came back with SRK in BAAZIGAR which was planned after BAAZIGAR<br /><br />The film is a remake of NICK OF TIME, RUSH HOUR<br /><br />The movie does disappoint you compared to BAAZIGAR and is too cheesy and stupid in parts<br /><br />The all detective agency office changing into a hospital.etc is too stupid The film has some funny moments but things are too lose at start<br /><br />The twist in the tale where the confusion about BAADSHAH occurs it makes you interested The scenes in the plane and then the entire chain of events are well handled The film does have many convenient situations too But they are some funny moments too which make you laugh and also keeps you thrilled at times<br /><br />Climax is too filmy and a complete copy of RUSH HOUR<br /><br />Abbas-Mustan is good, but not at their best Music is good, title song rocks and also Mohabbat ho Gayi<br /><br />Shahrukh Khan fits his role well though he overdoes it many times yet his comedy is well directed here and his pokerfaced comedy suits him most but he does make too childish and clownish expressions which irritate Twinkle Khanna is nothing great Amrish Puri is laughable for wrong reasons mostly especially wen he says OH BACHCHI Rakhee is okay Sachin Khedekar is alright in a small role Johny Lever makes you laugh like in most AM films and he is a laugh riot Deepak Tijori is okay Deepshika is average Sharat Saxena is funny Razzak Khan and Saurabh Shukla overact Prem Chopra is hardly there Neeraj Vohra is good
