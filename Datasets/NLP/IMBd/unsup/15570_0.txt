Without a doubt, there are many moments where The Bernie Mac Show becomes laugh-out-loud. However, for every hilarious scene, there's a mild letdown to ensue.<br /><br />To sum it up easily, The Bernie Mac Show will have a certain peak in the episode that will make the rest of the comedy pale in comparison. The first season is far more immune to this flaw, yet the later ones are the one I'm referring to right now.<br /><br />All in all, this isn't really for kids, though can be entertaining if they know the subject matter. Some of the language and sensual moments can get out of hand, but it's all confined to be appropriately inappropriate. I only recommend this show to his loyal fans and anyone looking for something to watch when nothing else is on.
