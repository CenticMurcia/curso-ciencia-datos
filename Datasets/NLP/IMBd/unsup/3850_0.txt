Under Bob Fosse's direction the cabaret numbers are all exciting. Joel grey as the Master of Ceremonies is outstanding. Liza Minelli as the brassy Sally Boules outshines everyone in her splendid "Come to the Cabaret" presentation.<br /><br />It is amazing how much action can take place on the confines of the tiny cabaret stage and how soon one is completely absorbed in the solo acts. The cabaret audience and its reaction are left out of the picture most of the time, the camera concentrating on the singing and dancing. The choreography and costumes are top class and the acts soon become the most interesting part of the production.<br /><br />Against a background of Nazi propaganda there are the continual rumblings of anti-Jewish sentiments in 1931 Berlin and a nervous anticipation of events likely to follow. But the MC invites his audience to leave all their problems, their worries, their cares outside and enjoy the cabaret where everything, just everything, is "beautiful".<br /><br />Intertwined with the stage presentations at the cabaret are the off-stage relationships between Sally and her lovers. Understandably these scenes do not quite sparkle like the rest of the film. I do however enjoy the scene where Brian Roberts (Michael York) and Sally get a little tipsy, clink glasses and make a toast "Here's to you and the baby".<br /><br />Liza Minelli has beautiful eyes which she uses to great advantage. She can give us a wonderful display of mixed emotions....laughing and crying at the same time with a tear-stained cheek. Great to watch and enjoy.
