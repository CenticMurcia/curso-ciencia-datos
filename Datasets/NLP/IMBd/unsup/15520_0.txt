I'm ashamed I watched it and everyone associated with making it should be ashamed they helped create it. I had hopes that it would be at least entertaining, but it didn't even go that far. I watched all the way through to the end, but it was only because I couldn't look away, like seeing a car wreck on the side of the road. <br /><br />I like Ving Rhames in everything I've ever seen him in, but he was given such awful dialog in this that even he couldn't save it. Aquaman and some other folks were cute & shiny eye candy but that's all -- they came up with wooden acting and eye-rolling delivery. But waaaay beyond anything the actors did or could have done was the horrible screenplay. Plot and dialog were written at about a fourth-grade level. Nothing made much sense. I'm going to see if I can get my money back from iTunes.<br /><br />One day when I'm on my deathbed I'm going to look back and regret that I wasted an hour of my life with this stinker.
