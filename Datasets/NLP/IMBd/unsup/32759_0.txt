This movie should be used as a demonstration to media students as to why you should NOT use the mic built into the camera to record sound. In many scenes you cannot hear the dialog.<br /><br />There is a lengthy outdoor conversation scene where you can hear a near roar of crickets in some shots, and none in others. So the lesson there is to record some "room tone" background sound to use to solve exactly this kind of problem. Of course so much cricket sound was recorded probably because they used the camera mic rather than a boom.<br /><br />So this is an example where a movie is made basically unwatchable because of such poor sound quality.<br /><br />Also, don't use you friends as actors just because they are your friends.
