Aside from Prince of the City, Robert Daley's work has fared poorly in film adaptations. This dreadful, obnoxious Mickey Rourke vehicle throws out 95% of the novel (one of Daley's best) and substitutes a plodding, dull, flat storyline that only occasionally threatens to engage the viewer's interest.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke is as offensive as usual, strutting and preening his way through the film as if he's deliberately trying to be as unlikeable as possible. John Lone does what he can with a poorly written role, but even the one or two good scenes in which appears can't save this train wreck.<br /><br />It's not just that I loved the book and hated to see it trashed like this. I first saw the movie in a theater years before I read the book. After reading the novel I gave the movie another chance and liked it even less.<br /><br />Whether you liked this movie or not, you should at least give the book a chance. Robert Daley's story is so much better than Oliver Stone's version.
