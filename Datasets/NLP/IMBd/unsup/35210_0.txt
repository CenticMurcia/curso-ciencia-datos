Wow, just wow. Does this movie actually exist, or is it part of some awful dream? Sadly or gladly, however you want to look at it, it does. The first 'Troll' is hardly a masterpiece, but unlike this film it was made by a competent director with a cast that actually had training. This "sequel" was directed by Claudio "Drake Floyd" Fragrasso who brought us such classics as 'Zombi 3' and 'Zombie 4: After Death,' and if you've seen either of those movies before seeing this one then maybe you know what to expect. I first saw this film back in the early 90s. The box artwork is really eye-catching isn't it? Even though I was just a dumb kid at the time, I could still tell the difference between a good piece of film-making and and a film so bad it hurts, but what is it about the movie that makes one hurt you ask? It's that it makes you laugh so hard that your chest is about to burst. That is the magic of 'Troll 2' my friends.<br /><br />Pros: This'll be easy right? Ha! Well, the pace moves like lightening. The actors, no matter how over-the-top or shrill, at least seem to be having fun and aren't stiff. There are plenty of unintentionally (Or were they intentionally?) hilarious moments and dialogue. For example, the older sister has a duzy of a line that goes, "If my father discovered you here, he'd cut off your little nuts and eat them. He can't stand you." This is supposed to be a horror movie right? Right, but the music is like a combo of music from some really bad action movies and comedies, which adds to the fun. Plenty of moments that you'll never forget. What else? Um...the special effects are fun...to laugh at! <br /><br />Cons: Everything!!! <br /><br />Final thoughts: This movie very well could be the greatest cult classic of all time. Move over 'Plan 9 From Outer Space' and 'Showgirls,' a new great piece of crap is in town. And now with the cult status, recent screenings, and upcoming documentary, will we be cur...I mean blessed with 'Troll 3?' <br /><br />My rating: 5/5 (So-bad-it's-good rating) 1.5/5 (Serious rating)
