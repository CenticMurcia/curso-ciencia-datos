I finally managed to get through the film with the aid of modern technology i.e. a dvr that plays back at 300x.What I enjoy the most about the database are the comments posted.Some of the writers should be teaching creative English at the university level although I secretly suspect that all the people who aced those courses didn't get jobs at the New York Times or become mainstream film critics and I know that IMDb reviewers have no reason to distort the truth or are getting paid off.Sometimes the only redeeming social aspect of some of these films are the comments made by the Silent Majority (was that Jerry Falwell or Spiro Agnew who coined that term ? or was it niggling naybobs of negativism ?) who have suffered through really awful films and are willing to share their pain with us
