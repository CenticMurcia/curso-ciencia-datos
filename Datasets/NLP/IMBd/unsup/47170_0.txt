Warning : spoilers ahead<br /><br />In 5x2, OZON's daring narrative approach consists of 5 isolated moments of a failed romance, played backward. The structure is largely artificial it seems, leaving too many blanks for viewers to fill in, and I didn't manage to enter the whole story.<br /><br />In addition to experimental choices, I found that Marion and Gilles were, except for a few scenes, uninteresting or even despicable characters (especially Gilles, the unconsiderate, sex-driven husband).<br /><br />On the other hand, OZON's accurate direction, combined with soft lighting and scarcity of sound, create a unique atmosphere, like in his previous movies.
