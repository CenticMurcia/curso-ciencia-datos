This is one of the few films I have EVER seen, I would call TOTAL RUBBISH!<br /><br />It is a shame to see a talent like Nigel Benett, wasted in such trash.<br /><br />It truly has NO redeeming qualities,<br /><br />The screenplay is completely incoherent, to the point one has to only imagine the editor, had some kind of brain aneurysm, whilst working on it.<br /><br />Somewhere after what may, or may not be, the second act, there is a 20 minute motorbike, "chase", that simply serves no purpose, other than to show off some "special effects" and explosions, and even they are so cheap, it is embarrassing to watch.<br /><br />I have no idea, how you even get finance, let alone insurance to make such a film.<br /><br />This film makes Plan9 from Outer Space look like Lord of the Rings! At least Plan9, had ambition, beyond its years, or finance.<br /><br />Life is too short, >AVOID< >AVOID< >AVOID< >AVOID<.
