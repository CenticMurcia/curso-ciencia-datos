This is not a movie it's a photo. It should be framed and hung in a gallery where it belongs. Thanks Sundance for showing your true colors. If this is what passes for a great documentary at Sundance then I hate to tell you but the emperor has no clothes. Pretentious, ponderous, sanctimonious. An art film in the worst sense of the word. It got me in touch with my spiritual side but only to pray for Borat to show up with a couple of hookers. I was so bored I can't believe people on here gave this thing high ratings. Oh, well, it takes all kinds. I'm still not sure what these monks do for their community. It seems to me they do everything for themselves.
