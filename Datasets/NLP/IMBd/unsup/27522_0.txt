I really think this is a great movie. It got a very low rating on IMDB, but I would give it an 11! I think it is way above standard for a 1992 TV movie. Kathy Ireland is great, as well as Joe Lara and June Lockhart. You also get to see a young Nikki Cox (and even at that yound age her acting is GREAT!). The script is really good, and I do not see a problem with the special effects (like some other people have ssaid in there reviews). The plot is simple: People get stranded on an island, and attacked by creatures, but the movie is much more complex. I could never tell what was going to happen next (and that always is a GOOD sign!). The locations chosen for this film are beautiful. I have the dvd (which was re-released in 2001), and I have watched it about 20 times. Thanks for reading my review!
