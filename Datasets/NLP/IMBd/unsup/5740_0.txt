After Sing Baby Sing, this is my favourite outing from the Ritzes. They only get the chance to be sporadically zany, but you see them and wonder why Old Hollywood couldn't find more suitable stuff for them. Theirs was the kind of snappy manic verbal patter that stands up well to repeated viewings, sub-Marx and more limited in range, but very watchable.<br /><br />The kids watching this in the cinema in '39 would have been delightfully scared by the shadowy house, the hokey gorilla, creepy Bela and sinister Lionel, for most nowadays only graphic gore will suffice. The film itself suffers a bit from being adapted from a stage play - I lost count of the times those double-doors were opened or closed - but the production values were generally high enough to carry it through OK. Patsy Kelly grates a little, but she had a few good smart ass one-liners too.<br /><br />All in all, if you like utterly throwaway inconsequential old comedy films for their utterly throwaway inconsequential charm and not for the completion of your University sociological thesis you should like this like me.
