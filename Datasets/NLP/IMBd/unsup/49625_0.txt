This "movie" is just AWFUL! Sequels like this should be forbidden, because such movies are just made, because the original Film was a Blockbuster. I hate movies that destroy the spirit of the first film. Highlander 2 is another good example for that. Bad Animation, ridiculous Actors and Story (Asians in the medieval Europe...). To the middle ages: Where the original did a great job creating an quite authentic atmosphere etc. this thrashy rip-off felt more like an pumped up version of xena or this absolute horrible new adventures of robin hood series which should also be forbidden.
