While I feel the message of this film is laudable, the execution isn't great. It's full of mediocre acting, bad story and character development, bad writing, and is completely predictable. A movie promoting good church values doesn't have to be this bad. Simply said, this movie doesn't offer anything interesting or new. It's the stereotypical story of a young man struggling with the decision of whether to serve a mission or not and offers its audience no surprises or insights we haven't already seen dozens of times in other "feel-good" LDS movies. Like I said, I think the message is important, but the movie comes off as bland and, quite honestly, a bit preachy. I think there are more artistic and compelling ways to tell the same story or deliver the same message.
