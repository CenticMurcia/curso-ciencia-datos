As a big fan of the Street Fighter franchise from it's original conception I had high hopes for this movie. I expected it to provide a cinematic version of what I already knew of the Chun Li persona, and it failed to provide in every way.<br /><br />First off, Kristen Kreuk as Chun Li. What where they thinking! There are hundreds of highly skilled Asian actors that could have been casted in a better fashion. Bison/Balrog (lol confusing) kept reminding me of the Green Mile, the death sentenced good guy with a heart of gold. Now he is some buffed punchbag, mmm. This leads to the horrible, horrible accents that the actors had when they were talking in an Asian language. Seriously, UGH!.<br /><br />The story itself was shallow, bad bad special effects. (Spinning Bird Kick in the club scene, are you serious? 20 years ago they were able to make it look better in a video game. 30 years ago they made it look better in a Kung Fu movie, get real.<br /><br />The story about her revenge on Bison is shallow. She gets her revenge in a way, but it's not satisfying at all.<br /><br />Top it all off with cheesy one-liner upon one-liner, bad acting, bad casting and you got yourself a turdcake that the entire audience has to take a bite off.<br /><br />F--, see me after class.
