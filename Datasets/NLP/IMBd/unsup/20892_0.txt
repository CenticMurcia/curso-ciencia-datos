But with him it's just half-garbage.<br /><br />Really, you have to be very desperate to call this movie a good comedy. Yes, it has funny points, mostly played by Jack Nicholson, but generally it's a failure as a comedy. It's one of the movies, which's trailer consists of all jokes of the movie :-)<br /><br />+ i cannot understand why Sandler is still used as a comedy actor. He's not much of an actor at all, though Punch Drunk Love was good (goes to show what a good director can do). But casting him into comedy is same as calling Britney Spears a serious singer. Already an idea is ludicrous.<br /><br />Rating: 2/10
