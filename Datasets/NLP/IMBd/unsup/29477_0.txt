i understand that movie making is hard work. if the scale is that of kisna, its extra ordinary hard work. i entered the hall with tremendous excitement. somehow i could not like the movie. the protagonist is too uninteresting and pre programmed. but the lead actress is surprise package, she rules. the film started off well, though inspirations are too obvious. the period was meticulously recreated but the movie quickly lost the steam. by the time movie was over, i was totally detached. when i left the hall i gave the maker benefit of the fact that my expectations were too huge. but now sitting alone and thinking back, i see more and more holes. it was a great deal of hard work wasted.
