I am not a particular lover of Adam Sandler, but out of all his movies I would rate 50 First Dates and Happy Gilmore as not only his two shining moments but two of the funniest and enjoyable films I have seen.<br /><br />Sandler plays the title character, a deluded hockey player of limited intelligence and unlimited instability, who due to the repossession of his Grandmothers home, reluctantly takes up pro golf in order that he can win enough money to settle with the IRS and reclaim the house.<br /><br />The only problem with this plan is that his golfing skills are on par with his abilities as a hockey player, which leaves a lot to be desired.<br /><br />The only thing he has going for him is his talent for driving the ball over 400 yards using his hockey slap shot.<br /><br />He turns to one-handed former golf pro Chubbs Peterson played to comic perfection by Carl Weathers, to iron out his short game in order he does not lose his long driving advantage when he reaches the green.<br /><br />He also takes on board the beautiful Virginia Venit the tournament's PR, who helps Happy control his almost psychotic temper and focus more on his game. I don't know about you, but with someone as gorgeous as Julie Bowen next to me, golf would be the very last thing on my mind! She must be one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen in the movies.<br /><br />The film offers run of the mill Zero to Hero schmaltz and from the word 'Go' we are left with no uncertainty of how it will turn out, but his journey to the final championship, is a cleverly written comedy with strong performances from all involved most notably by Christopher McDonald as Gilmore's arrogant and devious opponent Shooter Mcgavin.<br /><br />McGavin will stop at nothing to finally win his much coveted Gold Jacket and his interplay with Gilmore as he tries all sorts of ways to have him removed from the tournament is hilarious, and provides the film with most of the gags.<br /><br />However what I found to be the most gut wrenchingly funniest moment in the picture, was the old man at the ice rink as he solemnly mimes the words to Endless Love. Brilliant.<br /><br />Look out for a wonderful and hilarious scene where Happy has a violent punch up with American game show host Bob Barker and a great cameo from Ben Stiller as the sadistic nursing home orderly.<br /><br />One question though. The midget cowboy on the unicycle in the dream sequences......Whats all that about?
