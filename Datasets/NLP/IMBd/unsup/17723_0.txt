The 'Silly Symphony', The Wise Little Hen feels more like one of those huge, books with thick cardboard pages you read to infants in order to help them learn basic words and morals. It may be notable for the first appearance of Donald Duck (in a supporting role) but the rest of it is mainly annoying.<br /><br />I seriously do not like the Peter Pig character and I do not ever want to see him again. He was fat and rude with a rubbish voice. And the mother hen had this irritating gimmick of clucking out certain words.<br /><br />The story goes that the Hen and her chicks need help planting her corn. Pete and Donald pretend to be ill but once the corn grows (no thanks to them) they feel well enough to eat it. Too bad the hen is only serving them Castor oil.<br /><br />Hope the lesson isn't too subtle.
