OK, I gave this movie a 2/10 instead of a 1, for the slight twist at the end. This movie is horrible, do not rent it. I rented it based on the cover and blurb on the back and thought "Hey this could be good," because I like a lot of straight to video horror. But this movie is not worth any money. I won't really say anything else about it til a few more people post, I don't want to give away all that happens, or as you'll see, all that doesn't. OK so I added the spoiler warning, you only see how 2 people die, the rest you kind of just have to imagine. It's pathetic, the acting is terrible, and the camera work is supposed to add to the suspense, but could leave you nauseated.
