I had the pleasure of viewing this very clever film with my 10 year old daughter. Her opinion: "It was GREAT" (and believe me, she can be quite picky)<br /><br />I was especially humored by the "Russian," a cat in serious need of an attitude adjustment.<br /><br />The special effects were just a tad hoaky, but it suited the spirit of the comedy perfectly.<br /><br />If your children liked "Spy Kids," they will thoroughly enjoy this movie. If you have ever had a pet cat or dog, this film will really tickle you too!
