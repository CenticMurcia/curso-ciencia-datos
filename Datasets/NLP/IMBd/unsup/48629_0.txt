Ok, fair question...well, it has rocketpacks (Ahem, THE ROCKETEER had better special effects?) ok, but...it has some laugh value for how bad it is (Couldn't you just watch Shrunken Heads so you can claim to have seen the worst ever?) Well yeah, I guess you could.<br /><br />Sorry, no reason to see this.
