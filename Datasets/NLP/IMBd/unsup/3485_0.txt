I really liked the idea for this film, of groups of people trying to survive in a dragon scorched world. It was very well executed to take this ludicrous fantasy and apply all the rules of logic etc to it.<br /><br />I also thought that the film looked amazing, particularly the dragons, with the effects only let down by some shoddy looking explosions at times.<br /><br />The only thing that let the film down was the cliched and sometimes pointless dialogue, especially from the Matthew McConaughey character.<br /><br />
