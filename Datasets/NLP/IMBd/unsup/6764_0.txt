When I was younger I used to like elephants, especially in cartoons. This was a very simple cartoon with some short and simple stories involving all the characters, but it was still good. Babar in his childhood had his mother shot by hunters, but he was rescued and looked after by an old woman. As he grows up he learns to dress, walk and talk like a gentleman. Soon many elephants are like this and they build their own place out in the country. Because Babar was the one that started it he was soon to be known to these elephants as the King Babar. Throughout the series Babar helps people with problems and runs his elephants well. It's only the rhinos that aren't too keen on the elephants. It was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Okay!
