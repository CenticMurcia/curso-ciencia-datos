Allow me to ask some rhetorical questions:<br /><br />-Why would ANY airport allow an 11 year-old on a plane WITHOUT CHECKING THEIR TICKET?<br /><br />-Don't you think Megan is a little too smart to get on the wrong plane?<br /><br />-Why would the most PRESTIGIOUS hotel in Los Angeles allow a single 11 year-old to stay in the PRESIDENTIAL SUITE? Without checking her credit card? Do the words FRAUDULENT CHARGES ring a bell?<br /><br />-How was Megan allowed to stay in the hotel's PRESIDENTIAL SUITE, which costs a good $15,000 a night (or more) for over a week? Gee, that's over $100,000, plus ROOM SERVICE. Her mom and dad are going to be ticked...<br /><br />-How did a couple of thugs outwit ARMED GUARDS to get a money printing press? <br /><br />And just to top it all off, it wasn't really a very funny movie...
