I think there are so many reasons why I love this movie. I think the biggest attraction for me, age. It has that kind of after school special meets feature film look to it. Even though it is sooo cheesy and pop culture like, there is something real about it. The acting is soo down the the core real. I something I really miss with todays "teen" films. The way in which Jessie acts is soo the 13 yr old being the 17 yr old.<br /><br />I remember watching this movie when I was 13, and now that I am older, for some reason I just HAD to have this movie on DVD. I am not sure what in gods name made me think I needed to have this movie in my collection, but after watching it again for the 15th million time, I REMEMBER. It is cute and cheesy and has a really good message. I am sure there are guys who can relate but the trilogy of books and the movie just go hand and hand with us girls when we were teens! I just some how got it and understood exactly what Jessie was going through, and I saw it 10 years after it came out! There is no way to really explain this movie, other than, if you can hang with the kind of raw quality and can get passed the 70s look, okay and maybe the music, deep down it is a really great movie to watch on a Sunday afternoon.
