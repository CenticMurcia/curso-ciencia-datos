Please allow me to present to you: dumb and redundant Alien/ The Thing clone number 5.276All the elements that fill you up with irritation and annoyance are cheerfully presented. The scientist of a lab gets bitten by alien tissue and undergoes a transformation. Guess whatsoon he's loose in the facility and on a killing spree. The children of a random, unimportant victim (the night guard) perpetrate the science lab and avenge their father! Oh, how interesting and fascinatingNOT! The cast is filled with lousy amateur-actors and the special effects are atrocious! This film was made in 1993 and the `horrible' creatures featuring here still look like typical 80's cheese. And can you dig the presentation of the makers of this? It's like the 10 millionth rip-off of `The Thing' but monsters seem explode out of chests like they invented it! Because it's so dumb, the film quickly becomes unintentionally funny. You can't hide chuckling when you see another stupid character running straight into the creature's mouth or. simply hearing the entire screenplay, which is as dumb as they come. Example:<br /><br />`We believe this tissue is alien' `Alien? You mean from another planet?' `Yes, doctor'<br /><br /> Oh my God! Is it possible to write a line more stupid like this? The characters are perfect stereotypes and endlessly boring. The typical `fat & fun scientist guy'-type is there (these are usually killed violently) and the cute blond girl turns out to be a Princeton math-queen. Her boyfriend seems to have escaped the of the `Revenge of the Nerds'-cast. The rebellious teenage daughter didn't look too that much like a rebel, neither. Movies like this are a waste of good money (both yours as the producers') and they're destined to go straight to the lowest shelf in unpopular video stores. It is there where idiotic people like me pick it up It could be worse, though. I used to be in contact with someone who regarded this as the `greatest horror movie ever made'Now this kid has got serious issues. Hunt down a copy and burn itjust for the fun of it. <br /><br />
