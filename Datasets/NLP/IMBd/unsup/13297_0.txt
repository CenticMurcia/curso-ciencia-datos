Izo- My Takashi Miike run ends with Izo, the story of one of Japans most legendary and bloody assassins, at the beginning of the film he is crucified and pierced repeatedly with spears, he spends the rest of the film warping through time and space at random, having ethical and metaphysical discussions with and then killing virtually everyone he crosses, including Buddah and mother earth herself as he searches for a reason for his curse, which renders him unkillable and unable to control his location. This is easily the most violent film I've ever seen, not in grisliness, but sheer body count, but around the endless slashing, is a portrait of modern Japan symbolized by the reoccurring Powers-That-Be characters who represent Society/Reality/Order(often shown meeting around a board room table and discussing how to destroy Izo), and the Buddhist Hells which serve to purify souls through pain thereby readying them for reincarnation. Of all the Takashi miike stuff I've seen this is one of best executed, feeling more like a film than an experiment. Not to mention the great songs by Japanese folk singer Kazuki Tomokawa also known as "The Screaming Philosopher", due to his somewhat gruff vocal stylings. These songs may seem strange but they really do help break up the monotony of the endless waves of violence, and oblique dialog, as well as more often then not mirroring and adding emotional depth to the actions of the at turns stoic and demonic Izo(who was based on an actual samurai Lord, who was known for his violence). This is one of my favorite Takashi Miike films, while it might not be for everyone it is a must see for fans of the auteur, and those who think film can be aesthetic object as opposed to just a linear story. It's SlaughterHouse 5 except Billy Pilgrim's out to destroy the world one image at a time.
