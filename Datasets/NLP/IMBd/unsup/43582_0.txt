Its been a while since I saw a movie that infuriated me like this one. I cannot believe I actually paid for this piece of junk. <br /><br />About an hour into the movie l couldn't figure out whether it was a bad comedy or horror movie. And I was also certain that the writers had never seen the original night of the demons. The demons don't crack stupid jokes in the first movie, did the writers think they were being funny or original? It wasn't either of those things. If they wanted to make a comedy or spoof then that's what they should of done, and not ruin what could of potentially been a long running franchise. At this point I would gladly give this movie away.<br /><br />What's harder to believe than how bad this movie was, is the fact that there's a third night of the demons, meaning that this sorry excuse for a movie actually made money.
