I hated this movie, but I dislike a lot of movies that others seem to love--like A Beautiful Mind or the Usual Suspects. So if you loved those shows, read no further. I'm only posting this for the benefit of people with similar tastes, so they can avoid this one. At least A Beautiful Mind and the Usual Suspects had some entertainment value. This show has none. Only weirdness, and in a very annoying way.<br /><br />For me, a film has a duty to the viewer to be fair--to not resort to the cheapness of portraying a dream, delusion, or fantasy as reality. It's fine if the character doesn't know what's going on. It's even fine if the audience doesn't for a while, but I find it incredibly annoying to invest a couple of hours into a story only to find out in the end that it was all just a dream.<br /><br />This movie is very cheap in that way. You might like it if you're fifteen years old, don't care if a story makes any sense, and just like weirdness, but I hated. I sensed early on that this was one of those annoying movies that offered no clarity, so I fast forwarded and watched the ending. Well, the ending made no sense and so at that point I gave up on the show and came to IMDb. After reading the posts here and the tremendous amount of confusion this movie caused, I have no interest in watching it all the way through. This is one movie that should have never been made.
