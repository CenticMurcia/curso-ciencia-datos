After a so-so effort in Magnum Force, Dirty Harry goes comedic. Coupled with some great comic lines and action, this proved to be a turn in the right direction, considering this film showed a different side of Harry which we had not seen yet. While I was disappointed Lalo Schifrin did not conduct this film's score, Tyne Daly brought in a new dynamic which had not been seen in the other films. While this could be considered nothing more than a transitional picture, it did so with some class and dignity.
