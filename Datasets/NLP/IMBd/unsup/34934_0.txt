I wasn't sure what to expect going in to the movie. I had watched a preview for it here on IMDb and thought that it seemed like an interesting story. Boy was I wrong! The acting in this "movie" is some of the worst I've ever witnessed in ANY movie. Another reason I had decided to rent this is because one of the other users here who had posted a review made a comment about how great the acting was. She must've been high, because this was laughable. The two hippy women were probably the worst of the bunch but the loudmouthed punk kid was right up there, too.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this movie to Helen Keller. The story is so lame that it'll have you squirming in your seat. Stuck in traffic because of downed power lines and a man who refuses to move his wrecked car? Okay, here's an idea...TURN YOUR CAR AROUND AND GO BACK THE WAY YOU CAME!!! Jeez. I wanted to scream.<br /><br />Watch this movie you you want but don't expect it to be any more interesting than watching paint dry.
