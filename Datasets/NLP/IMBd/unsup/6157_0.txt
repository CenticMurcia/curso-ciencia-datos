Well-done tale of totally amoral Hollywood producer Jonathan Shields (Kirk Douglas). It's all told in flashback of how he made...and destroyed...three people--actress Georgia Lorrison (Lana Turner), business associate Fred Amiel (Barry Sullivan) and writer James Lee Bartlow (Dick Powell).<br /><br />Purportedly this was an accurate portrayal of what Hollywood was like at the time--I have my doubts. It's well-directed with beautiful black and white cinematography but I don't think this was all factual (however I did get a kick out of the obvious caricature of von Stronheim). Acting varies--Powell is terrible--I realize he didn't have much to work with but he doesn't even try. Sullivan was OK. Turner was just superb--one of her best performances. Douglas is good but lacks the charisma to put the part over. Somehow Gloria Grahame got a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for this--she's barely in it. Also this goes on a bit too long.<br /><br />So it's worth catching but just misses the mark of being a really great film. I give it an 8.
