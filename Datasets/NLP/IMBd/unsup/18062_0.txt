That's right. Every day is a no-brainer for these two clutzesque clowns. Carrey is as funny as ever, this time playing a stupid rather than a sort of psycho wiseguy. His goofy appearance, including the masterpiece chipped tooth is enough of a cue for pants-wetting, floor-stamping laughter. If you can't decide whether or not to watch this film, trust me- just watch the first 30 seconds. You'll be hooked straight away. No probs. Jeff Daniels' performance is also faultless as Carrey's sidekick. The humour is sometimes crude and vulgar, however. There are a couple of token toilet humour scenes which definitely cross the line.<br /><br />The first half of the film is much better than the second, with the scenes in the guys' apartment really hitting the mark.
