The man has created some of the most remarkable American films of all time (obviously). These movies include RAGING BULL, TAXI DRIVER, MEAN STREETS, GOODFELLAS... The list goes on. However, there is so much to cherish about WHO'S THAT KNOCKING AT MY DOOR, and it lingers in the memory long afterward, to such an extent that I wonder if it's my favorite of his work.<br /><br />I realize that it's a rough-edged, ultra low budget movie. That in itself fails to hinder its impact. In fact, the evident workmanship on display serves to heighten its effectiveness, since the visible seams lend a sense of unease and unpredictability that accentuates the central character's uncertainty about his personal values, which is the key subject at hand.<br /><br />Keitel's performance is exceptional. It's his first film, but his emotional range was already astounding. Others have mentioned that his mannerisms and speech patterns are reminiscent of Scorsese's own public image, and I couldn't agree more. It's a very personal movie from a man who, particularly in the early years of his career, openly explored his own morality.<br /><br />Zina Bethune, as The Girl, is a bit stilted at times but still manages to deliver a fine performance. Her role is so well written that it would be almost impossible for her to have failed at creating an interesting character.<br /><br />Scorsese's visual style here is kinetic, experimental and compelling. Much of it owes a great deal to the French New Wave films that were popular throughout the 60s, and it also pays homage to the films of John Cassavetes, SHADOWS in particular. A good deal of the acting appears to be semi-improvised, and it works beautifully.<br /><br />WHO'S THAT KNOCKING AT MY DOOR will prove to be a challenge for a lot of viewers. The narrative structure reminded me a lot of Fellini's I VITELLONI, with a series of character-building vignettes that appear to step away from the central plot (not unlike MEAN STREETS in that regard), and I'm sure that many fans of Scorsese's later work will be annoyed by this. A shame, because it's the type of storytelling that I sorely miss and that has been largely absent in cinema since the early 70s. His use of music here is also very interesting, and the songs he chose - most of it consisting of hits from Scorsese's youth - are inspired, to say the least.<br /><br />If you're a fan of character driven dramas, I highly urge you to see this picture. Also, if you're an aspiring filmmaker, this is an absolute must-see. With any luck, the newly restored DVD (which looks amazing) will inspire some up-and-coming directors to kick their careers off with a similarly personal and interesting feature debut.
