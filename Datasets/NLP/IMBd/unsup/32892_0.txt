I don't understand movies like this, it seems that someone down the line (director, screenwriter) to address very obvious plot holes and inconsistencies.<br /><br />1. In the first scene, the man who gets hit by the train, first off, he was clear of the train, pressed against the wall, but suddenly for no reason he leaps in front of the train at the last minute. Also, if you die of your worst fear, as the female lead later revealed, then getting hit by a subway train was this guy's worst fear??? 2. The German kid; he just seems to have bled to death in the cell. What was his death fear? 3. The ghost girl; she's a hemophiliac. Wouldn't she have bled to death well before 48 hours? 4. If your computer explodes after viewing the site, why didn't the computer expert girl's computer explode? It seemed only left in tact so the male lead could log on to that site.<br /><br />5. At the end, the male lead summons his partner when they have the killer cornered, he says, "I don't have time to call for backup." What? Your cell phone service only allows ONE emergency call? And if so you use it to call your useless-up-to-now partner? Or why wouldn't you tell HIM to call for backup on his way??? 6. The partner manages to get there ahead of time, get killed and get strung up, even before the male and female lead even make it there. All by a guy with a scalpel and surgical dress on.<br /><br />7. If ghost girl was tied down and tortured, how was she able to write a note, stick it in her lipstick case and swallow it without the mad doctor's knowing? Secondly, HE autopsied her and put everything back. Wouldn't he have checked the stomache? That's all. Great concept, poorly executed.
