Okay, I'm going out on a limb here, but the opening scene of the mystifyingly titled SUMMER STORM reminded me of THE MUDGE BOY (and it's short predecessor, FISH BELLY WHITE): An awkward young farm boy bites the head off a chicken. Except here the farm boy is a former porn star now reduced to being a fluffer (if you don't know what that is, put your player on 'pause' now and rent the film THE FLUFFER), the 'chicken' is actually not poultry but the human variety, and the 'head' is...well, I think you get the idea.<br /><br />This film is inexplicably repulsive, with awful videography, unattractive performers speaking stilted and unmotivated dialogue. The plot is surreal and unbelievable. Somehow I thought this was a comedy - but the only thing funny here is just how demented some writer/director/editors can be in the name of independent film making. If this is SUMMER THUNDER, give me a winter blizzard any day.
