I don't think there are enough good things one can say about Eric Byler's film CHARLOTTE SOMETIMES. A contemporary relationship-drama that avoids cliches, that unfolds in a unique environment (which happens to be in the middle of Los Angeles, the most over-used location in the world, but Byler somehow makes it happen - a double coup) and is so f-ing honest in the way it delineates the characters desires and fears that it hurts! I saw this film at the LA FILM FESTIVAL and I was amazed. I don't think people champion films like this because Byler avoids the cheap tricks that plague so many of the films that are coming out of the independent production world. The characters involve us but they aren't always easy to relate to because if we're honest with ourselves we'd find they are uncomfortably a lot like us. Byler is working in Cassavettes territory...
