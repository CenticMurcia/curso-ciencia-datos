While I've read many a comment saying how "boring" this HBO film was, I'm happy to say that I disagree. In this day and age, when communicating to young people just how important voting is, it's important that media like Iron Jawed Angels is made available. For those out there that are either too young to remember or have not had the privilege of learning these stories in history classes, knowing how hard some people fought and how much they struggled to achieve a right that many current citizens take for granted is tantamount. These stories are just as important as any other story in American history that details struggle, suffering, and a fight against obstacles to overcome.<br /><br />Kudos, also, to Hillary Swank and company for all-around superb performances! Most importantly, thanks to those responsible for bringing this film to the public. Thank You!!!
