This is one of the better movies made in Bollywood recently. Everything about the movie is great, especially the acting...however, has anyone noticed that the movie is an obvious copy of Hollywood's Steven Spielberg's "Catch me if you can"? Sure, there are the slight touches to the original, like in here there are two fraudsters instead of one....and also, holding to the Indian tradition of movies they must both be of different sexes and must inevitably fall in love and have a child...not to forget the extremely well choreographed dance sequences in between, which is probably the only thing original in the movie....<br /><br />don't get me wrong, if you consider Bollywood alone, this is one of THE BEST MOVIES...unhappily, i'd already watched the Hollywood version...<br /><br />if i ever watch a bollywood movie that's not a "remix" of a Hollywood one, i'll give it a ten no matter how crap it is.....
