I rented this on video. Spend the first 1/2 of the movie bored to tears and the second 1/2 wanting it to hurry up and end. I didn't care for any of the characters and honestly didn't care who ended out with the money. This movie makes The Money Pit look good. John Travolta, Lisa Kudrow, and Ed O'Neil could not save this money. A great cast but a terrible movie. In rating this from one to ten I give it a low 2.
