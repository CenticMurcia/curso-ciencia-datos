This film is by one of the worst movies I have seen this year. It is so quick to play the slapstick, immature humor that it doesn't allow the humor to really build. It tries to follow in the same breath of the likes of "Office Space" and "Clerks", but it falls well short. I admit, I did chuckle here and there, but overall I was the only person in the theater laughing the least. I cannot recommend this film.<br /><br />I'm sure people who have worked in the restaurant business might be able to relate to this film more, though I have worked in the customer service business before and I know how it is to deal with difficult people. With "Clerks" and "Office Space", I was able to relate to the humor of the workplace because it was clever and smart. "Waiting..." does not take that approach and is one lame gag after the next. The writers of this film should have taken more time to mold the humor in this one.
