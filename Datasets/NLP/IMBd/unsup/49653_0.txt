After seeing how so many critics have raved about this film, and how several put it at the top of their "Best of 2002" lists, I was looking forward to it. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed. The story poses an interesting concept. I won't spoil it, but basically, two men are in love with two women who are in comas. One man is obsessive, the other is "the other man," but does not know this until after she is out cold. They develop a sort of friendship, which is complicated when one of them acts inaproppriately out of his obsession.<br /><br />There are also some creative "surrealist" moments in the film (particularly during the shrinking lover b/w portions), but I found them to be more flashy and "oohh look he's being different" than intelligent and thought provoking. The film also contains an abundant amount of female nudity, which after a while became gratuitous. It's greatest weakness however is a slow plot. It takes nearly half the movie until an interesting plot point hits-- not to mention that the cuts are far too slow. The images might be pretty, but that doesn't make them entertaining.
