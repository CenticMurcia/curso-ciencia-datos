When I was a kid this was just one of greatest show I ever knew. Not exactly a huge story, but a huge star. A postman named Pat who drives a red post van filled with letters and parcels with his cat Jess. Ken Barrie as Narrator and voices was just perfect. Postman Pat was the same makers of Fireman Sam. Pat is a nice friendly postman with many friends in the town of Greendale, the only ones I can actually remember are Mrs Goggins in the Post Office and Ted the mechanic. Pat was a nice guy and black and white Jess was cute. One of my favourite episodes was Pat's birthday, which just showed how much of a difference Pat made to the town of Greendale. Your kids will love it, the Royal Mail probably loves it too! It was number 23 on The 100 Greatest Kids' TV Shows. Very good!
