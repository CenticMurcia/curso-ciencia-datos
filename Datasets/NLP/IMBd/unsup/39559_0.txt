I don't know why they make such a big deal about this film. the sole thing i like about this film was Colors of the Wind. I saw a sneak peek of this film while watching The lion king on video and was excited about an American film, a great break from the recent films where the main settings were in Austrailia, France, Arabia, and Africa. Overall i was unimpressed primarily due to the fact that they try to make it too much of a movie. Later when i learned that this film was predicted to follow Beauty and the Beast's footsteps and Beat lion king, i was increasingly disappointed. There were a few good films during the post lion king years(Hercules, Toy story, Tarzan) but this film started the decline to where Disney animation is today. Could've been better. :[
