One of the worst I've seen... I'm trying to figure out which audience this was made for: a lot of nudity, a dumb story, bad acting, characters you don't care about, bad premise, bad direction, etc. I'm beginning to think they were trying to target people with low IQs, because they basically show you the beginning of the movie all over again at the end, SHOWING you what you didn't figure out... Stay away from it, it's trash.
