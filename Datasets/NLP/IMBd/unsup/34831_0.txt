Of any film I have ever seen this has to have the most problems with appearing boom microphones - they are everywhere. Besides this, Elliot Gould perhaps should have known better, as he is wasted in a feeble, unfunny comedy with little or no plot direction. There is nothing to warrant seeing this film.
