There might be some spoilers herein... so beware.<br /><br />Well, I am watching the end of this movie on DVD. I am thrilled that I did not pay to see this film. The DVD was free, thank God. As I sit here and count the minutes until the end of this wretched film, I had to comment on how disappointing this film was. Indeed, an all-star cast does little to give hope to this less than mediocre story. <br /><br />First of all, I have to say it, I really do not like Dustin Hoffman. I don't know what it is, but I just do not find him entertaining. I just do not enjoy his performance. He seems to lack articulation or something that just flat out turns me off. <br /><br />Anyways, Susan Sarandon is a waste in this film. Normally, I thoroughly enjoy most of her movies, but this is just boring. Her character is too odd and unaffected to draw any sympathy and without that, I could care less about her. <br /><br />Holly Hunter is horribly miscast in this film. The movie is set in the 1970s, right? What decade is she supposed to be in? The hard-ass D.A. portrayal falls flat.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal's character is pathetic. I don't care if they broke it off before the fiancée died, you would be more upset about the senseless murder of your "great friend," as he labeled her. Also, could he not wait a short while before he decided to get together with the strange postal worker girl? He is living with his dead fiancée's parents, sneaking out at night like a teenager. I don't know if the filmmakers tried to portray some kind of struggle in that he found someone he did want to be with, but they failed miserably. The wide-eyed puppy look doesn't come even remotely close to a decent performance. I honestly can say that I found him more interesting in the Day After Tomorrow than in this film. <br /><br />The parents hate each other, joined together only to get through this, even though they fight terribly. There is no cohesion in this film, no purpose. <br /><br />And the scene in the courtroom when he 'confesses' because Diana would want him to be honest. COME ON!!!!!! Worthless. I'm sorry but the whole secret of them breaking it off was not that dramatic, or at least it was not conveyed well enough to make the movie worth watching.<br /><br />The music is better than average, but not enough to save the picture.<br /><br />In short, this was a waste of my time. I am glad that I watched it at 2am on Saturday night while I did other things. It did not command my attention. It did not capture my interest. <br /><br />If you are bored one night, I guess you could leave it on while you do something else. Otherwise, don't waste your time. <br /><br />1 out of 4 stars
