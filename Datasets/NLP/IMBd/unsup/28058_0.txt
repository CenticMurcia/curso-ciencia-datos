James Woods must've been desperate to pay the bills when he accepted the lead role in this seriously flawed suspense/action flick. For a man of such immense talent, this is a total waste.<br /><br />Scripters and director James B. Harris have done their very best to destroy what was probably a good plot, based upon the novel "Blood on the Moon" by James Ellroy, about an obsessive serial killer whose love for a prudish, feminist poet type drives him to commit horrid crimes while an uptight detective hunts him in the name of all the disillusioned young women...................................well, maybe the plot wasn't so good to begin with, but certainly Harris and company have done a great job in smothering what value there may have been. Any remnants of a storyline are washed out as the focus is pure vengeance. But it's a little hard to care about the way the characters feel when you don't care for the characters themselves.<br /><br />Charles Durning, Lesley Ann Warren and Raymond J. Barry also conspire to throw away their collective acting prowess along with Woods. Apart from all the short comings afore mentioned, there really can be nothing else to say about what is a definite failure.<br /><br />Saturday, February 15, 1997 - Video
