Billy Crystal has copied all of the worst features of movies, such as "A League of Their Own," that let sentimentality overwhelm what might have been an interesting story in someone else's hands. The gloppy music, the flashbacks, the cardboard characters all make this movie a waste of two hours and ten minutes. The use of slow motion at the end was painful and those closing notes were trite.<br /><br />Has there ever been a good baseball movie? "A League of Their Own" was entertaining, but sticky sweet. "Bang The Drum Slowly" didn't quite measure up to the book. "Field of Dreams" was manipulative and corny [no pun intended]. And that's not even counting monstrosities like "The Babe Ruth Story" or Ronald Reagan as Grover Cleveland Alexander. I haven't seen the Hank Greenberg documentary, but it appears to me that there simply is not enough in the game to make a decent drama out of. Ken Burns' nine-part documentary proves the point.
