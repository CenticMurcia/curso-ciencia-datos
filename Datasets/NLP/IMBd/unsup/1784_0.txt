Beverly Hills Cop 2 was a smash hit when it was released to theaters in 1987. Many action fans really loved this movie, as well as fans of the first Beverly Hills Cop film.<br /><br />One of the reasons why Beverly Hills Cop 2 is such a great sequel is because of the return of the stars from the first film. Eddie Murphy is back, as well as Judge Reinhold, John Ashton, and Ronny Cox. In addition to them, some new characters are introduced such as Brigitte Nielsen & Jurgen Prochnow as the new villains, and the cute Alice Adair as Ronny Cox's daughter in the film.<br /><br />Another reason why this sequel is good is because of the way the action and comedy scenes are balanced. While not as funny as the first film, Beverly Hills Cop 2 has a nice balanced blend of action and comedy. This means that both action & comedy fans will love this movie.<br /><br />Here is the final reason that this sequel is good: So many great cameos are featured in the film! There are cameos by Paul Reiser (again), Gilbert Gottfried, Chris Rock, Hugh Hefner, Carrie Leigh, and DOZENS of sexy Playboy Playmates! <br /><br />Perhaps the only bad thing about the film is that there were many noticeable mistakes in editing. However, upon watching this movie more than 5 times, I got over the mistakes and managed to look past them. The good things about this movie far outweigh its disadvantages.<br /><br />To sum up, I strongly recommend this film to those who loved the first movie. It is a truly great sequel, one of the greatest movie sequels of all time. It follows very closely to the first film, and has an 80's feel to it just like the first movie. Don't miss those great cameos!
