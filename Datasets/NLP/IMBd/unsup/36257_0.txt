The problem with Laurel and Hardy is that most of their best work is hard to come by at present. Only a handful of their features and shorts have been released on DVD, so something like Babes In Toyland seems good. But that's only if you haven't seen their other work. Babes In Toyland was primitive even for 1934 and even as children's fare. The costumes (especially of the "Boogie Men")are tacky and would barely fool a 4-year old. Stan and Ollie have a few good moments but I would estimate they only add up to about 10 or 15 minutes of screen time. The rest of the movie seems to assume that children are just complete idiots. Again, any child over 4 would be bored out of his skull by this travesty. Even Hal Roach -- in later years and in an honest moment -- admitted this was far from the best work by the comedy team. As one person commented this is like they were trying to imitate a cartoon. That's especially valid when you consider most cartoons from this era also assumed children were idiots and were so cutesy-poo that nowadays they seem not only silly but sickening. This film is am embarrassment to Laurel and Hardy and the truly fine comedies they made both before and after this.
