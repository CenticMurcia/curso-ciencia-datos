Films, so the screen writing gurus tell us, are written from the ending. Writers are on a journey; they know where they are going and then plan how to get there. The destination in this film is two ex-mates turning up coincidentally in a bank at the same time, one with a bunch of flowers, the other with a gun. Each equally implausible, given that they share the same purpose - to win a woman's affection. If you think I am wrong, ask your female friends how much they like it when their ex turns up in the middle of their shift in front of their workmates to try and get back together.<br /><br />I assume this is the ending the writers set out with, and it bodes ill for the British film industry that no one shouted 'contrived!' at any stage. If this was not the ending they started out with, how did the collaboration process end up at this farcical destination??
