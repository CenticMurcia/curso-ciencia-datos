In my 1001 movies you must see before you die book, this documentary was actually recommended. Not to mention that when I saw the movie Monster, that won Charlize Theron her Oscar, I was more interested in learning about Aileen Wuornos, one of the country's first female serial killers. My mom and I have been watching this show called Most Evil or something like that and Aileen gets mentioned quite a bit, she's up there with most male serial killers on how she thought and acted. So I rented this movie curious on her interviews and what she was like before her execution, man, this woman was disturbed, very badly.<br /><br />The only problem I have with this documentary is that it seemed like Nick was a hypocrite saying how everyone was trying to make money off of her, but he did just that by making this documentary. Not to mention that I don't like the fact that he tried to make her sympathetic, I'm sorry, just she did still kill these men. There was only proof that the first killing was a possible self defense, but the rest were just out of blind robbery. I know there are a lot of sick people out there, I don't think she did it for pleasure, but still acting upon what she did was just wrong.<br /><br />Aileen: Life and Death of a Serial Killer is a good documentary, don't get me wrong, this was still incredible and I'm glad that he was able to get these interviews with Aileen. I couldn't believe her last interview, it seemed like she had lost her mind. The only thing that made me feel sorry for her is how long she had to wait for death row, it's like 12 years of torture, but I'm tossed up on the decision of death row. It's a tough subject. But this was a good documentary on her life and what might have led Aileen to act the way she acted. Aileen killed 7 men, lived as a man hating lesbian, a hitch hiking hooker; did society make her this way or did she just not see the light? Well, check out this documentary if you wanna find out for yourself.<br /><br />9/10
