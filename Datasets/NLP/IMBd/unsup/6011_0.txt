First it had to endure having the three stooges in its ranks, and later Abbott and Costello.<br /><br />Be that as it may, this is another of the better stooge shorts complete with Vernon Dent and some very sexy harem girls.<br /><br />The stooges start first as starving artists in Paris, and then Foreign Legion soldiers (with familiar "about face" marching routines), Santa Clauses (There ain't no Santy Claus) and harem girls. They are of course hilarious in each, and then the climax with their encounter with the lion. One of the faster moving episodes and as usual quite worth watching.
