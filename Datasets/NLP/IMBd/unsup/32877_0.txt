At no point during this incoherent rambling, did it ever make sense, everyone who watched this... is now dumber, I award it no points, and may got have mercy on the directors soul... The movie did not make any sense, it wasn't for even a minute scary, it was more of creepy that someone had these images in their mind. The ending was horrid, I drew parallels to "The Ring" from this movie, but The Ring wasn't nearly as bad.. I don't recommend this movie to anyone unless you have seen every other movie in the world.. 1/10
