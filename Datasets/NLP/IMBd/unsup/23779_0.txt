Typical, threadbare backwoods slasher crap, which proves that the well seems all dried up, has a group of young adults being murdered one by one by a lunatic matriarch's incestial offspring mutant twins and her equally nutty sheriff son.<br /><br />Mama Lake(Pat McNeely, under a thick southern accent, all demented smiles) wishes to continue the family line and uses the death of her husband, by a shot gun blast to the head directed by their son Chuck(James C Burns), the sheriff, to lure granddaughters Brielle(Kelsey Crane)and Kelly(Kelsey Wedeen)with the idea of a possible hotel inheritance. Along with her sensitive boyfriend Ben(Jim Devoti), his college chum Bill(Alex Quinn), Bill's gal Amy(Vanessa Viola)and Kelly's pal Tanya(the yummy Malea Richardon, all too willing to shed her shirt), the group head onto the backwoods Lake hotel and estate against the advice of drunken father John Lake's(Dan Woods)advice. Soon, Mama's mutant offspring begin killing the Lake sister's peeps, and find that the plan in place is for them to bare Chuck's seed and keep the family tradition continued.<br /><br />Nothing original here folks, kids running for their lives in the woods as two mutant monsters, straight out of "Hills Have Eyes" or "Wrong Turn", chase them down, mutilating them. Most of the violence is off-screen, and you know who will survive and die. This slasher does nothing to separate itself from the countless number that have came out since the 80's heyday. If anything, "Lake Dead" is far minor to even the tamest entries of the 80's. Stuff like "He Knows Your Alone" or "Graduation Day" are just as hard. I mean you do get Richardson removing her shirt and seducing Bill, before getting a pickax lunged into her skull sticking her to a tree. But, the make-up for the faces of the mutant, silent, skulking killers are cheap and unconvincing, especially when one of them gets bashed in the head with the butt of a shot gun.<br /><br />I gave it a 4 because I felt the camera work was polished enough, and the film moves along well, but if you are looking for slasher fireworks, look elsewhere.
