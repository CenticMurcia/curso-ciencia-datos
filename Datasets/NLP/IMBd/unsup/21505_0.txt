A cocky, jerky, hyper-active/rambunctious test pilot (Quaid) who never outgrew his high school jock phase is miniaturized with the intention of being injected inside a rabbit, but when things go awry due to terrorist interference, he gets injected inside a man instead, specifically a hapless grocery store clerk (Short). With the bad guys hot on their trail and time running out before the pilot suffocates, the clerk must gain the trust and help of the pilot's unhappy girlfriend (Ryan, Quaid's real life ex-wife now). Naturally, over the course of their adventure the male bonding scenario results in the clerk getting in touch with his inner Rambo while the pilot learns that there's more to being a real man than just being overly aggressive and fearless.<br /><br />Silly and absurd it may be, but still an engaging sci-fi comedy adventure. Well performed by the affable Short, the dependable Quaid and Meg Ryan at her cutest. The film's biggest flaw primarily is that it shows Dennis Quaid naked, and no one needs to see Dennis Quaid naked.
