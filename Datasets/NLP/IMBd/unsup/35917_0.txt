I can't believe that the NZ Film Commission puts money into trash like this at the expense of serious film makers, who want to actually make films that NZ film makers an be proud of. The best actor was the sheep dog. Plot was okay, but badly acted, pathetic script writing, and badly directed. Weta of course did their stuff well, but nothing could save this film.<br /><br />I suspect this has been a case of someone, knowing someone else that could pull some strings to allow this to go ahead. And then putting all their mates into the cast and the result speaks for itself.<br /><br />Am I the only one with the guts to say this publicly? This is exactly why I have moved to Australia to continue my film making, where it's taken seriously.
