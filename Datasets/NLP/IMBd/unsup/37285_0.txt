I haven't read the book therefore when I was about to watch this film, I really didn't know what to expect, and quite frankly I found it very boring and quite tedious. The story is centred on a very cringe-worthy young teenager and her love life and I found it quite an uninteresting one. The film, to me, seemed to be a very poor attempt at a 'romantic comedy', where everything for the main character goes horribly wrong, and then a very unrealistic see's all her dreams come true. However, the opinion I have given is one that I would expect from a teenage boy, and I believe that the film would be a one enjoyed by most girls; most of the girls I know have enjoyed it and therefore I would recommend this film to girls, but if it's with a boyfriend, then i'm afraid I feel quite sorry for him.
