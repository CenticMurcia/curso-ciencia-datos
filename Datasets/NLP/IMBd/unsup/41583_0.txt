Well, this wouldn't have been an outstanding movie if this had been one of the last z movies to be released on French screens. It was just before the cinema crisis in 1985-86,a crisis which put an end to all these poor quality products.<br /><br />this film released in France under the title of "Prisoners in the valley of the dinosaurs" is a mixture of adventure (Indiana Jones was quite popular then), erotica and cannibalistic violence. of course, none of these movie genres are successfully adapted. it's just another curiosity for bad movie buffs.<br /><br />
