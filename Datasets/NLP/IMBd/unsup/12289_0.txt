Un credited Jenny Lee-Wright http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0496751/ I think plays a bar maid in the pub.<br /><br />Did Columbo actually plant some evidence?<br /><br />Honor Blackman looked gorgeous in this one. The American actor Richard Basehart did a fairly unconvincing English accent. They both acted the 'overacting' thespian lovely clich√©s quite well. The streets of London looked grey and boring. An American who seems to get up the nose of a British Policeman - why didn't he get arrested? I really didn't know that a white china cup could kill anybody. She must of had a killer throwing arm.<br /><br />But, didn't Columbo plant some evidence though?
