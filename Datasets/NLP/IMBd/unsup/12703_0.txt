One of my all-time favorites. I watched it again a few nights ago. Fairbanks is a marvel. Princess Flavia's dilemma at the end always reminds me a little bit of Elsa Laslo's dilemma in "Casablanca." (Although Madeleine Carroll's acting seems highly stylized today.) The best part of that scene is the scenery--the lighting and the window's arch as it frames the two lovers. It's achingly beautiful. If I had a room like that I would never leave it. But the film as a whole is not a three-hanky affair--it's got swashbuckling, snappy dialog and lots of old movie conventions. (C. Aubrey Smith is an old movie convention in himself.) I definitely keep coming back to it to watch Fairbanks as Rupert of Henzlau.
