I have just seen SAATHIYA, and I never new that I could be so gripped by a Bollywood type movie. I was loving almost every minute.EXCELLENT.I just wish I could find love like that. Gave me a lump in my throat when I thought Suhani was going to die. Rani Mukherjee ( Suhani ) is gorgeous,and boy can she dance.I hope I can get it on DVD. I gave it 9 and not 10 because I did not like the hospital part. When Suhani crosses the road and gets run over by the van I could not believe what I just saw. HOW did they do that. Looks very real. The film is very colourful. The dancing gets you jumping about in your seat. Lovely to watch good looking women dance together.Everybody needs to see this film if only to make us all realise how ugly it is to argue and be grumpy in life.
