Having seen episodes 5 and 6 from my local library (And also some scattered episodes from when I was small), I decided to pick this one up as well, thinking it was the End of Evangelion (It was wrongly labeled by the library, despite how obvious it wasn't from the big words DEATH AND REBIRTH on the cover). What I got, however, was a rushed and complicated mess of scattered scene after scattered scene. Having not seen much of the series, I was left asking myself "What the heck just happened?". I had no idea who most of the characters were and I couldn't pick up even the slightest idea of the plot.<br /><br />And that's just the start. Then, you have 20 minutes of EoE. The first scene is more messed up than a raving maniac and from there follows extreme sadistic violence. Don't be fooled, Australians, by its M-rating (as well as EoE)-it's more explicit than it sounds.<br /><br />To finish, don't watch this unless you've seen all the episodes of Evangelion up to Episode 24. If you don't, you'll be left more confused than I was.
