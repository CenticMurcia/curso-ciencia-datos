Charlie Sykes (Chad Lowe) and his girlfriend Rachel Clark (Kristy Swanson) are traveling to Las Vegas to secretly get married to each other. The decide to follow through a secondary road, and while fueling their car in "Sam's Last Chance" gas station, they are advised by the owner and attendant Sam (Richard Farnsworth) to not sleep after the second tree in the road. They fall asleep in the car, and a policeman arrests Rachel. Charlie returns to the gas station, and Sam tells him that she has been arrested by a Hellcop, and he has to go to hell if he wants to rescue his fianc√©e.<br /><br />"Highway to Hell" is a gem underrated in IMDb. I have seen this cult-movie at least six times, and I really love it. I have an used VHS, and I do not know why this movie has never been released on DVD. The clumsy baby face hero Chad Lowe has a great adventure trying to bring his girlfriend back from Hell. The now famous Ben Stiller, in the beginning of his career, is very hilarious in the role of a cook, and also as Attila the Hun at the table with Hitler and Cleopatra. The special effects and the music score are very good and I really recommend this movie for fans of a trash and funny original adventure. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Estrada Para o Inferno" ("Highway to Hell")
