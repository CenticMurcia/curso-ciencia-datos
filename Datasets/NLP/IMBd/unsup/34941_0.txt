Lewis Teague's sequel to Robert Zemeckis' 1984 smash hit "Romancing the Stone" is a very similar adventure-romance, only it's a lot sillier. Once again we follow novelist 'Joan Wilder' and her lover 'Jack Colton', this time across Egypt as they romance a very different kind of stone. Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner reprise their roles with no great flair, while Danny De Vito (in tow) provides some comic relief.<br /><br />"The Jewel of the Nile" does remain light-hearted which it needs to as it is often a little naive. Overall though the yarn leaves us relatively uninspired and lives up to its predecessor.<br /><br />Thursday, October 29, 1992 - Video
