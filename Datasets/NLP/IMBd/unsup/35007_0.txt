B-Grade Horror at it's Worst.<br /><br />If you really enjoyed Rosemary's Baby, then you might actually watch this entire movie. But it's really quite boring. Once again, it's a cool concept, but the actual movie let's me down.<br /><br />For the purpose of warning you off, I'd better give it a rating of 1 out of 10 (and I think I'm being kind).
