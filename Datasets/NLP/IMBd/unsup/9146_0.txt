This was a well-done Walt Disney animated movie. Although not a huge fan of the movie, I find no fault at all with this film, and it's especially appealing now that it's out on DVD. It looks and sounds super. The colors are bold, bright and just plain gorgeous. The sound separation is excellent. If you have a nice surround system, you'll be pleasantly surprised with this.<br /><br />The story is nothing extraordinary but decent with a lot of subtle humor mixed in with it, mainly with the talking objects in the castle. Little "teacup" is the cutest of the characters.<br /><br />The songs, with the exception of the title tune and a Busby Berkeley-type number, are nothing to write home about.<br /><br />Still, when you look at the whole picture, this is a solid movie and probably one of the Disney's all-time best animated movies.
