I thought this was an excellent movie. I give it 10 out of 10 stars. Everything about it is great, acting, directing, production, script, music and storyline.<br /><br />Spoilers Herein<br /><br />The treatment in some of these women's prisons is unacceptable. They are criminals but they should still be treated humanly. Correcting people is not treating them nasty and doing inhuman things to them like in this movie. These things include rape, abuse, sodomy, the use of torture equipment and special privileges and gifts in exchange for sexual favors. This is extremely wrong. Kudos to the cast, crew and filmmakers. Two Thumbs Way Up!
