Its all about patriotism and what not, just like some movies i watched earlier, Mission Kashmir? Or Dil Se, the movie seemed pretty straight forward and not so much of the Amir "Khann-ish" type. Kajol looked amazingly gorgeous, the sets were amazing, i wouldn't pay for watching it on theaters though! Should have waited for the D-v-d release and rented it! Over all i guess performance wise it seems pretty decent. First half was happening, as soon as a monument blew up, the rest half seemed like a wold goose chase, more like a chicken run! S-t-r-e-a-t-c-h-y...Could have had better twists! A friend of mine actually spoiled the whole fun of the movie after reading out some reviews and using her own deductions. She basically came up with the main plot. The dialog's were pretty "poetic". My other friend on the other came up with dialog's, i guess if they were put together they can come up with a better plot! I seem kind of bitchy..but hey what the hell? Its all cool and yeah hopefully you guys enjoy it better than i did!
