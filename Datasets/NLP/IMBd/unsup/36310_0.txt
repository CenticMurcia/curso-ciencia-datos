Another reason to get SKY is that regular basic cable movie channels air horrible Horror movies like this! Really, there is nothing positive to comment about this crap. I really tried to be objective while watching it, heck, I tried to hard to not change the channel and put on some MTV in the worst case scenario. I truly can't remember why I decided to watch this one; probably because it got regular attention when it first came out. Now I understand that it was popular among some Horror fans because it's indeed a horrible movie.<br /><br />The plot makes absolutely no sense and so does the supposedly villain. What the hell was that rap propaganda and sub-plot? The title makes justice to the horrible visual experience that this movie is...
