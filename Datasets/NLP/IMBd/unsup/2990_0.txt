Fourth Story is a film that bears repeated viewings with ease.<br /><br />The actors are perfectly cast and have an easy chemistry with each other (and not just Mark Harmon and Mimi Rogers - all the actors are perfectly cast from the biggest to the smallest part!) while the script is a model of clarity and fun that most writers would do well to emulate.<br /><br />The music score is a joy and works like gangbusters. <br /><br />It makes you wonder why most directors think of Jazz as a fad when it can be made to work so well in so many settings.<br /><br />Overall it is a very worthy film that I can only hope will have a DVD release very soon.
