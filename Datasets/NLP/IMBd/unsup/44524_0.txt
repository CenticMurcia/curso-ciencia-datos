Ok I am not going to waste alot of time on this as I have already wasted enough on this movie. Someone commented earlier about they would have liked to see a black girl try to be white instead. RIGHT ON! I am SO tired of black people being shown as the oppressed and "cooler" race while whenever white people complain about other races they are viewed as "racists". This double standard alone kills this movie as well as the predictable pathetic plot. The characters are overacted as well as lousy dance routines which add a layer of desperation to this movie. Do yourself a favor and watch Unbreakable instead.<br /><br />1 star out of 10 and I would give 0 if that were possible....
