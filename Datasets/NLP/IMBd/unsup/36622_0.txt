Granted, I saw it on TV, and it was no doubt butchered. (Why language gets recast in TV dubbing is beyond me when sitcoms now include some of the raunchiest allusions imaginable. But, of course, they never get right down into the gutter with George Carlin's "Seven Deadly Words." Heavens, say F***, S*** or C***, and you get bleeped, but describe the activity in puerile detail and we can't get enough. Go figure.)<br /><br />But we would all have been better off if the entire movie were bleeped owing to the ridiculous screenplay this film foists upon us. The scenes were so predictable and the stereotypes so obvious that dialog wasn't necessary. Fill in the blanks. Your choice of words would have been every bit as convincing and emotionally uplifting as the nonsense many other reviewers here seem not only to ignore, but enjoy. A fatal flaw for this film as far as I'm concerned. I like Mary Steenburgen, and Lance Henricksen, and most of the rest of the cast were credible, too, given allowances for the mess they had to work with.<br /><br />As for the child molestation business, and the claims of ripoff -- both irrelevant when this banal, derivative film sinks itself in its own morass of cliches.<br /><br />I was led to expect more. I got much less. Go see any number of other films that do so much a better job of putting the outsider among us to reveal our prejudices and fears and irrational reactions to the unknown. Start with Tarzan, finish with Mighty Joe Young. Most will leave you more satisfied than Powder.
