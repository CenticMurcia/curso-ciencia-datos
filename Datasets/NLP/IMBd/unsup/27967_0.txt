My girlfriend rented this movie because our friends hosted official screenings while we were out of the country, and we were somewhat curious. Basically, it's horrible. Terrible acting, hilariously bad soap opera writing, and nails on the chalkboard pacing are the least of its problems. After wasting a small portion of my precious life watching this, with it's inserted "spiritual" moments bookended by standard Hollywood movie clich√©s, we watched the introduction and closing comments from the trio who created it.<br /><br />They smugly proclaim this movie to be the next "What the Bleep", and tell how all kids should watch this. First of all, it's an insult to characterize this as the next "WTB", this is the most amateur hour, half baked and overcooked drama I've seen in ages. Second, kids don't really need to see more bad cop, angry adults, drug deal gone awry garbage, not even for illustration purposes. "WTB" had none of this stuff - Indigo has precious little to do with our day to day lives as people on our paths of self discovery. We don't need to feed ourselves or our children this negative imagery to contrast something "positive" - that's what Hollywood does day in and day out. <br /><br />Second, the zero humility trio positively drool over "Indigo" children, and the director even infers that his child is an Indigo child, with her wise "Whatever!" comebacks. They don't realize that all they are doing is letting children be themselves, without jamming cultural mores down their throats, and POOF!, you've got an Indigo child. I was a pretty freaky kid myself, I think most of us are, some probably more than others - so what. <br /><br />It's all a big spiritual pat on the back for the "creators" of this moneymaking venture, and watching them stroke their own egos for an introduction, is more fun than sitting through the "film" (it's shot on HD) itself. Their fatuous praise is voluminous enough to make up for the lack of it here on IMDb.<br /><br />BTW, I've been in the film business as a boom operator for 12 years, have seen tons of good and bad acting and writing, and this film takes the cake. I was torn between laughing and screaming at the screen, especially when the creators talked about how wonderful their film is, instead of letting it stand on its own merits, which are all but absent. Their assumption that they could make a POS about spirituality and sell it with a slick underground marketing campaign was correct. Crap isn't just mainstream, it's spiritual too! <br /><br />And Hollywood HAS made interesting spiritual films, like "Contact", "I Heart Huckabees", "Donnie Darko", "The Sixth Sense", "Phenomenon", "Waking Life", and "Powder'. Even the lousy "Revenge of the Sith" has more spiritual common sense than this film.
