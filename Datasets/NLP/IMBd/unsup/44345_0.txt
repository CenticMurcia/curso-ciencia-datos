How does something this bad get made? The plot is simplistic and predictable, the characters one dimensional and clich√©d (single working mum with disabled kid, rich corporate mole who drives like she owns the world). The camera is so jerky it made me sick. This technique has only worked for the Blair Witch, and nothing else.<br /><br />A women's Falling Down, not bloody likely. D-Fens would be rolling over his watery grave.<br /><br />And these positive reviews that have been posted - film crew anyone? The only realistic aspect of this garbage is how women drivers are depicted. Now there's the real drama.
