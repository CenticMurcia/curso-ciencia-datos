This is a small gem, apparently totally forgotten and ignored by the multitudes of clueless movie fans and critics, who are very much focused on showering praise only on crap that they dig out from the past. I was surprised to find myself enjoying an Italian movie. The humour is slightly odd, at times very funny. There are those who consider Steiger not to be at his best here, but I guess for some people only frantic over-acting, complete with manic hand-waving and mugging, counts as good acting. ("Show mee the moneeeyyyy!"). Steiger is subtle yet everything he does that is in any way connected to escaping his dumb captors is hilarious: the way he touches the soldier's rifle, the manner in which he dashes away with the cow bell attached to his neck... Priceless. TGATG is strange little film, almost inventing a new sub-genre: the "war road movie". The trio of main characters move in war-torn territory that comes off almost as another planet, where food is about as scarce as brain-cells are in Sean Penn's bloated head. The struggle for the egg is a good example. The guy playing the Italian soldier isn't that great, but Virna Lisi is quite sexy. The fairly interesting Morricone score helps, too.
