Ok, I was three when the first one came out, so I don't remember seeing it in 1986, but I do remember no. 2 in 1988. I've seen both of them too many times to count. Honestly, I never expected another Crocodile Dundee. I thought they had done all that they could with the idea. But, when I saw this movie, I thought wrong. Although this is not even close to being on my list of fav movies, it was worth the 4 bucks I paid to rent it. It wasn't original, but it was funny and entertaining, and that's what's important. too many people take movies like this and compare them to the movies that win Oscars. Personally, I thought this movie was more enjoyable than "Lord of the Rings," and I'm usually in to those kind of movies. 7 out of 10.
