Russel Crowe and Salma Hayek does a great job in this film playing two difficult roles. It`s not often you see a film with only two people speaking in it. But Crowe and Hayek doesn`t have any problems with this.<br /><br />*spoiler* (maybe)<br /><br /> I think the film was entertaining the whole way. Normally it would become boring in the length with all the switching those two between; at first they are toghether, they brake up, they come back together again, they brake up again... but it isn`t boring at all. The movie keeps you at the screen all the way. <br /><br />*spoiler end*<br /><br /> I just love Russel Crowe after I watched Gladiator. He`s a great actor. I just can`t wait for his movies in the future. Salma Hayek isn`t so bad either... <br /><br />A good an entertaining movie...
