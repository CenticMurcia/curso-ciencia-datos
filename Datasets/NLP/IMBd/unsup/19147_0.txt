Now I remember this show airs on CN on 2001, titled Grim & Evil, one was Grim (Grim Adventures of B&M) and Evil (Evil Con Carne). Now in 03' it was retitled "Grim Adventures of B&M" <br /><br />Grim & B&M- It's about two kids waiting for something unusual to happen, and it did, comes the Grim Reaper. First of all, the character designs, voices and other stuff is downright bad.<br /><br />Characters of the show: Billy- He was a neighborhood boy who doesn't remember anything because he doesn't have a brain, Well, he has a brain right now! He can be smart, intelligent and have personalities to each other.<br /><br />Mandy- Can this creep ruin everyones lives today? We'll find out, Now Mandy is a mean spirited girl has no opportunity to have fun, she wants to be a demon all day. Mandy's Emotions: mean (that's all) no happiness? , no smiling? Why? Anyway, Mandy is so bad, that she torments Billy thinking he is retarded, well he's not! Grim- (No description). The humor is very overrated.<br /><br />I used to watch this show when I was 12, but after a few years, I suddenly gave up on it.<br /><br />Overall: It's not as bad or boring as Spongebob Squarepants (IMO the most overrated show ever made, but it's definitely not as good as Rocko's Modern Life, Ren and Stimpy, Doug or Invader ZIM.<br /><br />B&M: 2.5/10
