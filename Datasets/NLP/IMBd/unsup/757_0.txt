Regarding Mr. Fedor Markovic comment, I would say "what we have forgotten" is that we belong to the Earth, we are just part of it, not the owners. It is as simple as that, and this is a quite old, tribal, basic knowledge that we seem to have forgotten. For what I know, the Gilgamesh poem already dealt with this subject, and it was written quite a few years ago. We are very clever, very civilized, advanced human beings, but maybe we are not improving. Maybe we are not progressing, but we are declining. And we don't remember, we don't know how to use our knowledge. However, I doubt Mr. Markovic can realize. He is very comfortable sitting at his sofa.
