STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />Josh Randell (Norris) is in charge of a security at the casino owned by his adopted Jewish father and his wayward son, collecting small debts and taking care of trouble-makers at the casino. But now he faces a new threat in the shape of Romandy (Peter Cavanaugh) a small time gangster's son who wants to take over the casino. When the family refuse to hand it over, Romady turns nasty and Randell is left to take his adopted sister and his lover on a wild journey across the mean streets of Hong Kong in a desperate struggle to stay one step ahead of danger.<br /><br />In the very early 80s, a little while before Schwarzenegger/Stallone and a good while before Seagal/Van Damme, Chuck Norris enjoyed a period where he was pretty much the number one name in action movies. But they stuck to a pretty repetitive formula and one movie was pretty interchangeable from the other. This would be one such movie, only, as other reviewers have noted, with an even more wooden performance from the lead star. But there's some good kung fu action on display, an appropriately drawn theme tune and a pretty neat revenge theme running through it, so it's one of his better ones. ***
