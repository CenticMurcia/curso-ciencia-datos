Well, I gave this movie 2 out of 10 point, because it really is a crappy one. I liked it anyway. As many other cheap movies it entertains a lot, mostly because of the awfully cast. Okay, the women were good looking and the guy with the makeup seemed to have some talent. But letting the girls play ridiculous pop rock and having 2 ends for it just to reach a 80 Minutes line is a sad result for Mr. Band. "Mr. Mascaro"'s appearance and his explanation why there is a second ending added a little touch of a "Tales from the Crypt" atmosphere, and it helped Blooddolls to gain a few bonus points. Conclusion: Very bad movie, but a lot of fun to watch, but Charles Band did better in the past, I will definitely watch it again when it runs after midnight and there is no alternative.
