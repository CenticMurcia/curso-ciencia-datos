This film is excellent - just as good as Goodbye Lenin. I love the fact that Jule is facing a real dilemma and that Jan shows her a way to release that tension. I love the fact that the chemistry between the actors is good and you can believe that this is something real. I love the fact that Peter and Jan brake into the "rich" people's houses but not to steal just to move their furniture is a great idea. Makes people realize that no matter how much money you have or the hight of security that you may have gotten you can always be brought back to reality by others. I enjoyed this film so much that it made me start to learn German again. This is defiantly a must see film. Great way to show a different way of life compared to "society's" way of life.
