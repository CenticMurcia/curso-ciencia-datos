This movie is terrible - I love it. It is classic "B" movie crap. I collect terrible movies (I currently have about 400 or so) and this is in my top 10. The girl band in the cage is classic and no movie is complete without a midget. I will be dressing as Mr. Mascaro this Halloween. Get this movie, you will not be disappointed. Virgil is truly horrible and I was not surprised to see that he only appeared in one other movie. Thought the movie features dolls, don't expect to see them that much. I guess the budget needed to animate these things just didn't exist. Come to think of it, I doubt there was much of a budget to speak of. I'm pretty sure netflix carries this film and I have seen copies at Blockbuster.
