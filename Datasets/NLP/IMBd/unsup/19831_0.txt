VOYAGE TO THE END OF THE UNIVERSE is one of those rare treats, a mostly routine programmer with enough unconventional elements to hold your interest.<br /><br />The story opens with the ship, having nearly completed its voyage, being threatened for destruction by a demented crewmember. The story then segues into flashback, showing the mission from the beginning up to that time.<br /><br />One unconventional incident during the voyage occurs when the ship encounters a wrecked spaceship, and dispatches a boarding party. The boarding party discovers that the wreck is a space gambling casino, complete with roulette wheels, card tables and humanoid remains. Unfortunately, the casino is also booby-trapped.<br /><br />I would love to see this movie in color. Unfortunately, in perhaps the only instance American International Pictures choose to do so, the film was released in the United States in black and white only (Columbia Pictures used to do this fairly routinely; I've seen at least three Columbia films made in color and released in Black and White).<br /><br />The ending of this film is quite predictable. However, I can certainly think of worse ways to spend 90 minutes.<br /><br />
