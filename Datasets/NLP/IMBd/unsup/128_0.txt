La Femme Nikita is one of the best action/thriller spy movies to come out in the 90's. Luc Besson became a name upon moviegoers lips from that moment.<br /><br />From the films brutal introduction to nerve racking ending, this film is, in my opinion, one of the greatest commercial french films. A great deal of people believe that French films have to be boring or art house. Well this movie has adrenaline but also has a interesting imagery to it. the characters and supporting characters are all stylish with each underlining imagery that go with them.<br /><br />Example. When our heroine goes on her first mission she meets her team. The team is filled with men with earings, dreadlocks and even ganger looks. These agents do not resemble the clean cut, tuxedo wearing James Bond. there is also a mixture of cultures which i find refreshing.<br /><br />Even the action is stylistic. Luc Besson created the camera POV of the bullets trajectory (which was i believe was stolen by Robin Hood : Prince of thieves 1991).<br /><br />La Femme Nikita is much better than its boring American remake POINT OF NO RETURN ( the movie was good enough to be shown in the States without having to be remade).<br /><br />I Recommend this movie to whom ever are in the mood for a good story and a great set of action sequences.
