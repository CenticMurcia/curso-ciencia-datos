A trio of nerdy sorority sisters (Linnea Quigley, Brink Stevens, and Michelle Bauer) are possessed by Succubi while holding a s√©ance with 3 fellow geeky guys. OK, how can you go wrong with no less then 3 Scream Queens in the flick? Funnily enough easily. First of all, the action doesn't even begin to start until about 30 minutes in, that alone wouldn't be cause for alarm, but this is an 80-minute B-movie, so that's more then 1/3rd of the film dedicated to lameness.True the girls remain topless for a good deal of the remaining film, but, aside from a good lengthy bubble bath scene, nothing you can't see in any other of their respective movies. Films that don't almost put you to sleep in the first half hour. Which leaves the acting and humor to keep this flick alive. The acting...well heh, let's move onto the humor. The humor is extremely cornball. Skip this one.<br /><br />My Grade: D<br /><br />DVD Extras: blooper reel; 3 stills galleries (dedicated to each of the 3 scream queens in various states of undress); Director & producer commentary;<br /><br />a second commentary (this time with Brink Stevens, Michelle Bauer, and Richard Gabai)
