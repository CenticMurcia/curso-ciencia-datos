I must say that I love taking kids to see movies but majority of the time, the movies are over-wrought with violence and inappropriate behaviours for anyone under the age of 15! But this, Nanny McPhee, made me think differently. Emma Thompson is a wondrously talented woman and she proved it here again (along with Colin Firth, of course!) as she helped the distinctly intelligent yet naive Brown children turn their behaviours to the good. I saw several older ladies cry and many young children cheer throughout this extremely well done movie. Mary Poppins, watch out! This Nanny has got a few up on you! I implore all who are considering taking their child(ren) to this film to do so! It has many values that are lacking in films today. This movie might even make a child rethink his or her attitude towards their nannies! This is a movie we desperately needed! Good Show, Emma!
