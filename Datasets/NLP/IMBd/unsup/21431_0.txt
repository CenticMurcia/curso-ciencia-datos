Simply put 'Ring 2: Spiral' is not as scary as the first one, but like<br /><br />most classic horror films (except for Aliens, if you consider that to<br /><br />be a horror film), sequels don't have the privilege of fresh shock<br /><br />values of the original movie. Especially if the second movie, as is<br /><br />the case with 'Ring 2', serves the purposes of explaining the<br /><br />background further from the first movie. With knowledge comes<br /><br />power and with this power, the protagonists in the movie and the<br /><br />audience can fight back a portion of their fear. I may also add that<br /><br />this sequel is more schizophrenic in its direction and visualization<br /><br />than the first one. This may have been intended by Nakata as<br /><br />sporadic confusion that disturbs our sub-conscious perspective,<br /><br />but it also prevents the film from being able to move forward to a<br /><br />building climaxes, at least not as powerful and thrilling as in 'Ring'.<br /><br />SPOILERs Nevertheless there were genuine horrific scenes, as scary as in<br /><br />'Ring': the revelation of Shizuko's background, her apparition in the<br /><br />ryokan and the chase within the well with Sadako. It's a pity that the<br /><br />character of Reiko is killed off by a runover accident rather than by<br /><br />the curse itself. <br /><br />But the surprising appearance of Ryuji was a reward and it's<br /><br />simulteneously disturbing to know that his soul is also trapped<br /><br />within the well.<br /><br />Overall 'Ring 2' may lack the suspense and horror of its<br /><br />predecessor but it managed to deliver the same tone of haunting<br /><br />atmosphere and revealed the dark secrets of Sadako. Personally,<br /><br />the professional use of the same cast, crew and director is always<br /><br />a treasure in a series like this. <br /><br />I'd have given this movie 8/10 but Fukada Kyoko (who according to<br /><br />my Japanese friend, is a good actress), had been mis-casted.<br /><br />She has been too well known, outside Japan, as more of a<br /><br />pop-idol or pin-up girl. Hence her characterization of one of the<br /><br />victims is quite unbelievable, not to mention that she became a<br /><br />second 'video ghost' herself.
