STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />Down and out fighter and ex special forces guy Xander Ronson (Dolph Lundgren) is propositioned by eccentric businessman Chambers (William Shriver) to lead a quest for an ancient relic in the hills of China. However, there is some competition in the shape of some Russian mercenaries and something to worry about in the shape of deadly curses that guard the tombs.<br /><br />Dolph takes a break from directorial duties with this one, which is just as well as the poor chap needed one after the varitable trio of The Defender, The Russian Specialist and Missionary Man, although according to the trivia page he took over for most of the time from director Samuel Dolhasca. It sounds like a troubled production, shot officially between China and Canada, and although there are moments of flair, it's usually quite obvious to see. It's mostly pretty dull, with a tasty showdown at the end between Dolph and the utterly cardboard lead villain but little else of any interest. Dolph's rather wooden, and we also have Shriver's annoying voice to contend with. Not quite Dire-mond Dogs but not far off it to be honest. **
