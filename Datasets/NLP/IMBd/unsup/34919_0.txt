Overall, a right load of tosh. The slime creatures look like turds from a toilet cleaner commercial. The soldiers are all wearing crash helmets and there are so many unintentional goofs it's ridiculous. I smiled when a crash helmeted soldier answers the phone. How does he hold the receiver to his head with his Spaceballshelmet on? Badly of course! You can see the look on his face - oh, jeez, I wish I'd rehearsed this bit.<br /><br />But it's not all bad. It fits into the genre of Them, those films where the Chinese tunnel under the earth to defeat America - Battle Beneath The Earth. Richard Jaeckel is always a favourite and good value. The Italian woman leading looks great (like an early Elizabeth Shue) and the funky sixties party when the Slime comes to light is just great. I am sure if I'd seen this at the cinema as a kid, I'd have reckoned this was a classic up there with The Blob and Invasion of the Body Snatchers.
