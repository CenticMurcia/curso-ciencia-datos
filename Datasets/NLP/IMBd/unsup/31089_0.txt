There were some goofs which spoiled the greatest Mini series ever. The most significant was the calculation of age as opposed to time. In 1897, David Eastwick was born, yet in 1902 he was nine years old, five years after being born. Nancy Eastwick was born around that time, yet her fake gravestone read 1906. Josh would have been around ten years older than Eastwick, yet they appeared to be the same age when they got old. Accuracy of age, particularly where children are involved is paramount when making films. Josh's narration states Eastwick was born around 1878, yet it appears his actual age is unknown due to him being raised on the streets.
