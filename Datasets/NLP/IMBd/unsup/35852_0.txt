Many didn't like the original, but I thought it was pretty good. I'm a fan of the game, and was excited when hearing of the movie coming out, and then a sequel, right on! Didn't get a chance to see in the theater - am I ever thankful. It was horrid. Everything was bad, the story problems are probably what bothered me most. Little was accurate to what any MK fan would know. Then there was the fact that most of the characters (excluding main) got all of 5 minutes (if that) of screen time. I am generally pretty open and like movies a lot - especially action - but this just stunk on sooo many levels
