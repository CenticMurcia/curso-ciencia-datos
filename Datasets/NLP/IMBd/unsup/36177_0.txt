OK, I love Shannen and everything. But this show is just so wrong. Some of the victims get so scared that they cry and are traumatized for a long time. Some of them have important psychological problems after the "joke", and you don't have to be a psychiatrist to see that. Non of them are scared voluntarily. I used to like this show cos it's very entertaining, but then I started to feel more and more disturbed and guilty for those poor people, I couldn't watch it anymore. It felt simply WRONG. The jokes are very well done, but some of them are just too much. Don't be fooled. Something entertaining is not always good. And sometimes funny it's not that fun.
