I recently found this movie on DVD and instantly knew it had to be in my collection. Yes, other reviews will tell you all about the 'holes in the plot' or pick apart the making, but for sheer nostalgic value, this is a hit. Admittedly, a lot of my enthusiasm for this movie has to do with the fact that I was thirteen years old in 1986. I have had several talks with friends about the 'cool' movies we remembered growing up, and "The Wraith" always surfaces. Movies like this one are fun to sit back and grin a little bit at how serious they really were when making it, and poke some fun at a young Charlie Sheen and Randy Quaid. It may be slightly on the guy side of the chart, but for anyone that likes a little cheese now and then (especially if you were a young teen in the 80's), check this one out.
