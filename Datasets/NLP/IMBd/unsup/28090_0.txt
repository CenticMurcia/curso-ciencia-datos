Moussa Sene Absa's film portrays life in the town of Poponguine and how colonization has effected the population. Through Absa's film it is hard to decipher exactly whether or not he agrees with the adaptation of the population to the influence of French and America. From what I gather, Absa saw a blatant difference between the elders and the young people in the community. The young men were more willing and interested in wearing European style clothing and listening to American and French pop music. They also spoke fluent French instead of Wolof, unlike the older people in the community. Although it seems a bit disheartening that the young people are drifting from the traditional way of life, I think Absa realizes that the influence isn't going away and must be accepted. It also seems that Absa saw a lot of faults in the white males in the film, but in the end everyone was able to get along together.<br /><br />I found this film to be very entertaining and believable. They actors did a nice job considering most were Poponguine natives who had never acted before. There were minor lapses in scenes that confused me a little and some of the scenes seemed to drag, but I could have felt that way just because I am used to the fast passed American cinema. I think the film successfully showed how much influence the West has had on Senegal and how much of a challenge it is to integrate the traditional culture with the new influences. I recommend this movie to anyone who is curios about current African culture and anyone interested in foreign films.
