'Horrible' is an apt description of this bomb of a movie. (Actually, it's insulting to all other movies, just to call it a "movie"!) I would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this waste of time -- it's nothing but a ridiculous plot, with bad acting and ludicrous scenarios. A driver-less car? Flying off of cliffs, only to return to torment (us the viewers, I presume?). No other cars on the road? ANYWHERE?! A 12-year-old kidnap victim is magically a stunt person with acrobatic skills? PLEASE!!! And in case you're waiting for an explanation of the 'plot' in this drivel, give up. It never happens.<br /><br />If this waste of time shows up on a channel in your area, you'll have the perfect reason for throwing out your television.
