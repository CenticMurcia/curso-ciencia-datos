Taye Diggs makes a second dazzling preformance. He is the real deal. Morris Chestnut enterance was one of the best on screen. Nia Long shows why she has few equals. Terrence Howard gave a stellar preformance as Q. The cast performance was stunning. The only film that I never wanted to be an end to. Hopefully, Malcom Lee will do it again. A must see film in an industry full of lilly white trash.
