Poor film, poor story. Listening to Steve Coogan do an American accent was cringe-worthy. About 1 minute into the film I knew it was going to be a stinker, but I persisted to the end...and was not rewarded for my persistence. The twists were obvious, the humour was poor and very much un-coogan. <br /><br />I agree that most reviews of this film seem to be written to boost its popularity. <br /><br />I picked this film up for Â£2, and it proved you get what you pay for. I'd never heard of it before buying it, and I wish I'd not bothered!<br /><br />If you like Steve Coogan, you'll dislike The Alibi! Don't bother. Pick up some old Alan Partridge instead, much funnier.
