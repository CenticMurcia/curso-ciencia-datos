I am afraid that this is without any shadow of a doubt the very worst film I have ever seen.<br /><br />It really is truly appalling and has no redeeming features whatsoever. I am certainly not averse to watching junk, indeed some films are enjoyable precisely because they are bad. But this was is quite unbelievable.<br /><br />The acting is utterly abysmal - particularly Kelly LeBrock, who is totally talent-free. The storyline stinks to high heaven and is so politically incorrect it would make even the most severe male chauvinist blush. The dialogue is truly ghastly and made me cringe on many occasions. "Time Out" said that it was as though two adolescents had been let loose with a camera.<br /><br />I dare say many will think I am taking it too seriously. Believe me I am not. It is obviously meant to be a joke - it's just that it fails dreadfully and does not seem too aware of the miserably obnoxious underlying message it conveys.
