This ground breaking movie, much like the ground breaking sounds of NIN, '?' has been discussed, praised, shunned, ripped and probably copied since, that you can easily lose sight of the fact that what you have here is a genius-ly original film, and when experienced over and over again, STILL never fails to amuse.<br /><br />This movie is one of the few I would describe as genuinely "unique" and "stellar". I honestly cannot fault many things about it, except a bit too long??? The brilliant dialogue, the fantastic group of actors, who range from everywhere (in age and ethnicity, even to inanimate objects), are all uniformly excellent, and the soundtrack is the coolest of any independent film (which rarely ever have one), I have ever heard. The band Hideous Input is awesome! <br /><br />In short, this is an indie classic, and required viewing for all black comedy buffs, especially demented nuts like myself. '?' is as good as any comedy you care to name, believe it. Not perfect, but 8/10.
