I saw 'See Grace Fly' when it opened in the theaters in Vancouver. I adore this movie. One reason that I like it, is because it takes two controversial themes and sticks them together. Religion and mental illness are portrayed in such a way that I did not feel the urge to yell at the screen. That is very hard to do. I'm not a religious person, and this is one of my favorite movies. The cast does an amazing job. Gina Chiarelli as Grace is phenomenal. Her emotional struggle that progresses through the movie is heart wrenching. Paul McGillion who plays Grace's brother, Dominic, also adds to the power of the movie. He plays the repressed missionary brother who is trying to come to terms with many different aspects of his life...his mother's death, his missing sister, his faith. 'See Grace Fly' is a wonderful movie that I recommend very highly.
