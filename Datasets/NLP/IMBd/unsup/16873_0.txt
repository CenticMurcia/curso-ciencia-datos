Just a few notes on exceptional scenes, what's in them and what's not: 1) the ending, the framed shot that lingers for 50 seconds as Anna advances down the esplanade of the cemetery towards Holly and beyond; 2) the hospital scene: not a single shot of the children, but the tattered teddy bear was enough; 3) the wait for Harry to show in the cafe`: the close-ups of the faces of the military men waiting in ambush were straight out of Leni Riefenstahl's "Triumph of the Will" and with the same dramatic impact; 4) the total absence of sizzling sex scenes, profanity, & gory violence (with one exception, none of the men killed is seen being killed, and in that one case there is no gore, only a quick hitting sadness); 5) and couldn't it have been just possible that Anna was wanted by the Soviets as a war criminal? Here's where Graham Greene's screenplay was strictly Cold War boilerplate: The Russians were necessarily the "bad guys," prepared to harbor a scumbag like Lime and persecute a sensitive soul like "Anna Schmidt" (maybe she'd been the lover of a high-ranking Nazi commander of a death camp and had shared in his sadistic delights). And, finally, the bozos in this column who disliked the music because it had an "Hawaiian sound" must have thought they were listening to Arthur Godfrey on the ukelele rather than Anton Karas' zither. Cold War boilerplate or not: 10 out of 10.
