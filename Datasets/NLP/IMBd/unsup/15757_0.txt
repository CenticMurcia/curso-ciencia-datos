what a hoot!!!very campy, but fun, and the dolls have a personality of their own, that is crazy....<br /><br />a bit over the top, but all in all not a bad b film; of the actors, all seem to be having a good time, with Warren Draper as the wimpy husband stealing every scene he is in until his gruesome death by the hands of the evil dolls....<br /><br />Recently viewed one of Drapers latest films, Tomorrow is Today with Scott Taylor Compton, and he gives a very powerful performance...<br /><br />Blood Dolls is very much worth the rent, and the all girl band is smoking!!!!
