The monotony of the scene got to me, but I think that is because I am a product of my generation. Move, fast fast fast. And THEY thought life was fast in this movie. I was 6 when this movie was made, and I just saw it today. There were periods in the movie where I wanted to cry because the content is SO TRUE. I related to this in a way I never thought I could. I went into this movie having NO IDEA what it was about. I was all sorts of happy when I realized it was based in NYC, although in reality, it wasn't :-( I was wondering what messed up signals I was sending to my child. This movie made me think harder than I have thought in a long time. I pride myself on thinking, seeing what is right in front of one's face, yet not seen. Guess I'm not all that. This truly is a movie that if you are really watching and LISTENING, will change your life.
