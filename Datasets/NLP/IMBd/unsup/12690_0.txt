Major disappointing swashbuckling romantic film with the great Ronald Colman playing 2 parts- a cousin who goes to Zenda to attend his cousin's coronation only to be involved when the monarch is kidnapped.<br /><br />Douglas Fairbanks plays the villain here who hatches the kidnap plot to help the evil half-brother, a sinister Raymond Massey usurp the throne. When Michael (Massey) finds Henzlau (Fairbanks) with his beloved Mary Astor, Masse is stabbed to death by Douglas.<br /><br />There are some good romantic scenes between the "Cousin" and Madeleine Carroll. Aubrey Smith, as a confidant to the king, provides an excellent supporting role.<br /><br />The film itself is quite drab at best. How Astor could truly love the sinister Michael is beyond belief.
