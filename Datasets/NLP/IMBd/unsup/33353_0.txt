What's the fun of watching a cartoon about a boy who gets grounded for every little thing he does? It's basically watching a boy get tortured by a man.<br /><br />The show is lame. The catchphrases are lame. "Radical!" Like I never heard that before. I don't have an interest in surfing, skating, or anything of the sort. This show is just as lame as a show can get. I wonder if they still air it.<br /><br />I do not recommend this show for anyone without an interest in sports. Even if you do have an interest in sports, watching a little boy get grounded every episode is not entertainment.
