This movie rocks. The cast, the soundtrack, the writing, the timing, it has it all. It is not your typical 80's movie, although a lot of movies were (and still are) being made where this one takes place in New York City. The plot is quite simple as Michael Keaton (Billy Blazejowski) and Henry Winkler (Chuck Lumley) work on the night shift at a morgue. Billy is an idea man,(he wants to feed mayonaisse to tuna to simplify the process of having to mix the mayo with the tuna) while Chuck is seems less and less content spending time when he can alone with his neurotic girlfriend. One day as he arrived at his apartment building, Chuck bumps into his neighbor, Shelly Long, after she had been beaten up by her pimp. Chuck later shares her plight with Billy Blaze. Well, it's at that point that Billy suggests that he and Chuck should run an escort service out of the morgue at night as pimps for Chuck's neighbor. The hilarity begins well before that, as there are too many quotes to list. I will say that once they become "LOVEBROKERS", as Billy so entusiastically suggested, their lifestyles change as the main characters' Parsons allow. This is a great movie that I now proudly own. You should too, if you're into first rate comedies about prostitution and pimp daddies. I know I am.
