Michelle Brown (Kimberly Williams-Paisley) has the perfect life - a wonderful job, a wonderful boyfriend, and she just bought the dream house she's been waiting for her entire life. But when she gives away all of her personal information to a depressed drug user in need of money named Connie (Annabella Sciorra), her entire life falls apart. <br /><br />I absolutely loved this TV movie. It's full of suspense and emotional scenes, but more importantly, it's full of truth. Identity theft is the fastest growing crime in the nation - every 6 minutes, someone's identity is stolen. The fact that the movie was based on a true story makes it all the more scary, and you have to be prepared for reality to slap you in the face.<br /><br />It's a big eye-opener. You can also learn a lot from this movie: What to do if it happens to you, etc.<br /><br />"Identity Theft: The Michelle Brown Story" aired last night, but if you missed it and have the opportunity to see it again, I highly recommend that you do.
