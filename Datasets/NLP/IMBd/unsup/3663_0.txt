En la Cama is a film about a guy and a girl who have a one night stand, and end up opening up to each other like they never have to anyone before, and it seems at times that they wished their relationship was more than a one night thing. The concept is good, but the film seems like a bad version of "Before Sun Rise". The conversation the two leads have (while in bed, the whole film happens in a motel room) sounds a bit forced at times, and is quite dull. The sex scenes are done in quite a brutal way, and are longer than necessary and the camera seems to hide, sort of like we are spying on them, and also there are a lot of out of focus shots. I don't get why it was shot that way, it makes us miss any looks of delight they might give each other while playing and being childish, and it makes it hard for the audience to connect, care, and feel what the characters are going through. Is not all bad, it has its moments, but they are wide apart and manage to get cheap laughs. Half the audience feel asleep during the film, and is not that long at all. The acting is alright. Valenzuela gives quite a convincing performance, and does a good gob with the mediocre script, but Lewin falls short, she can't make the words her own. This could have been a good movie, but it seems like it was done in a hurry, missing potentially good moments that may have helped character development and it lacks intense moments, making it a slow, dull film that doesn't give its viewers anything new. The whole idea of the film is that its easier to have true intimacy (meaning a true connection, not sex) with a total stranger, because we never have to face them again. I got the point, but I didn't feel it. And what good is a movie if it doesn't make you feel??? En la Cama is an improvement in Chilean cinema, thanks to its technical details, but still it has a long way to go, it needs to figure out how to truly reach the audience. ( a little trivia: the fire escape in the motel room says SEXIT)
