200 Cigarettes is a bad movie, no doubt. But bad movies can be interesting, sometimes even addicting to watch. For me, and the small group of people who watched it with me a couple of nights ago, it was a struggle to avoid hitting the STOP button halfway through it.<br /><br />This movie was just horrible. The characters were not likable or interesting, all whining and repetitive. The many intertwined stories seem like they came out of some stupid WB show, only to be painfully stitched together at the end to give it all some phony 'full circle' effect. This movie is just fluff, the enemy of substance. There is nothing here hasn't been done before a thousand times - in many better films.<br /><br />I wish I could find one redeemable moment, one glistening quote, one interesting subplot, but there was literally nothing at all. Just an awful movie that wasn't even worth the rental price.<br /><br />
