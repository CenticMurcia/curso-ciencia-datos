AMC has been showing this stinker for the month of March,2001. Ted Healy gets my vote as worst actor ever on screen. He does a second-rate Jolson impersonation- and that may be an insult to second-rate! In the scenes with the Stooges(of the 3 Stooges fame) Shemp comes across as the leader of the three, but Healy tries and fails miserably at doing slapstick comedy better than the Kings of the art form- The Three Stooges. I understand Healy was eventually murdered. Too bad for him, but great for the world of comedy.
