This is not what you would expect when you see the front cover of the DVD. Actually, it's not even close. It's just a "Scream" kind of film where a masked guy chases some frightened teenagers through an isolated mental hospital.<br /><br />From my point of view the first film was way better than this one. The first puts the accent on the horror part, this one emphasizes the bloody, cruel and disgustful part.<br /><br />As for the plot, it's a little bit incoherent because you actually don't know who killed the children's parents in the beginning of the movie.<br /><br />Anyway, "Boogeyman 2" is definitely not a horror fan's movie and I am a little disappointed in it's shallow approach of the Boogeyman subject.
