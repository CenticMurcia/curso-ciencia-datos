Although I've never actually gone to the Woodstock Festival(I'm 22) it seems while watching this documentary you are really there.<br /><br />Michael Wadleigh gives us a great view of the highlights of the Woodstock music festival which was held on the ground of Farmer-hero Max Yasgur(may he rest in peace).The documentary switches from music to great scenes of the festival(as well on the festival ground as in the village and outskirts of the festival).Most of the time the view is split in 2 or 3 segments so you can watch the movie 3 times and actually see 3 different movies.This makes Woodstock an absolute must-have for every music fan.<br /><br />The greatest rock artists like "the Who","Ten Years After","Crosby,Stills,Nash & Young","Jefferson Airplane","Country Joe & the Fish,"Jimi,the Great One,Hendrix" etcetera.Of course,some great artists and groups are missing like "the Doors" and "Pink Floyd".But still,it makes for an unforgettable 3,5 hours(I've got the Directors cut,which is critically acclaimed) of non-stop beautiful music and scenes from the festival visitors.<br /><br />The outstanding songs are now given an extra dimension by the band members who really get it on.Just watch Pete Townshend of the Who playing his guitar on "Summertime Blues",same thing for Alvin Lee of Ten Years After playing the brilliant "I'm Going Home",a rock ode to some legendary Rock 'n Roll songs of the 50's and early 60's. Santana on his big debut using almost every possible instrument on "Soul Sacrifice"(watch the drums-solo!). Richie Havens who had to play overtime because the other artists didn't arrive yet(watch his shirt). Country Joe McDonald,who gets the 400.000 people on their feet during his anti-war classic "I-feel-like-i'm-fixin'-to-die-rag. But of course,the most remembered piece of work during the festival:Jimi Hendrix version of "Star Spangled Banner",the USA national anthem.Although a lot of people already left because his show was postponed till monday,everybody seems to know this "song". There is also an extra movie about the Jimi Hendrix performance which I haven't seen yet,but surely will in the future.<br /><br />Although the music is the best part of the movie,the scenes between the songs and sometimes during the songs(brilliantly done)are also of very high and entertaining quality.The "port-o-san-man" scene is quite hilarious and the "rain" scenes show the interaction between the visitors.Not to mention the shots of the village people,the people who live in the village close to the festival.Some are delighted by the festival and some are really p***ed off,watch the sceneof the old "conservative" man working on his car and the debate between the villagers on whether the festival is good or not good for America,this also shows you the big split of views of the american people in those days which now also reflects on the present debate of a war. Also some legendary quotes came from this festival:"It's a free concert from now on","What we have in mind is breakfast in bed for 400.000" and of course "the Brown Acid warning" which was used as a joke in Wayne's World 2,the parody of the Woodstock Festival.<br /><br />Not every artist or legendary event is shown in this documentary,artists like Joni Mitchell and the Band are not included which I personaly would have enjoyed.And the forgotten "Abbie Hoffman incident" is also not included.I have this incident on CD,the Who box set,but I would have liked it when I had on DVD also.But then,You can't have everything!Also some songs and artists are kind of misplaced.Best example for me is the performance of Sha-Na-Na doing "At the Hop".This Rock 'n Roll song doesn't quite belong on this festival,but still it is a funny sort of intermezzo.<br /><br />The end-titles gave me a pleasant surprise,because the editor and assistant-director of Woodstock is the greatest director in my view: Martin Scorsese.This gives the directory an extra plus if it ever needed any. Woodstock is to me the best music/documentary and maybe even best movie ever made.It not only shows great music of great artists but it also shows a generation of Americans who did not want to go with the flow of the American government,especially in their war in Vietnam.Sadly enough,Woodstock 1969 was also the beginning of the end for the hippy-culture which is also beautifully put on film in the other 1969 classic:"Easy Rider".<br /><br />Still,the memory lives on and will never be forgotten.Especially in these days where a new unjust war led by the American government is approaching.<br /><br />Woodstock will remain the best thing ever that happened in rock music and I will watch it over and over again.<br /><br />R.I.P. it up,tear it up,have a ball. 10/10
