Reminiscent of some of the '30s Bogart/Walsh collaborations, in style if not in pace, "The Enforcer" is a first-rate crime thriller, and even more of an accomplishment when you realize that Bogart is, to be honest, miscast. He's actually not particularly believable as a crusading district attorney out to bring down a ring of contract killers. Bogart's character is presented as more of a dogged, plodding but sharp bureaucrat (when was the last time you saw an "action" hero who wears a bow-tie?) than an intrepid, guns-blazing crimefighter; unfortunately, Bogart's persona is too strong for the former and he is, frankly, too old for the latter, and he seems just a tad lethargic throughout much of the film. That being said, and Bogart being Bogart, this is still a top-notch noir thriller, with some of the best character actors in the business (Ted DeCorsia, Roy Roberts, Jack Lambert, Bob Steele, Zero Mostel) filling out the cast, a dark, oppressive and somewhat claustrophobic tone, and some particularly--considering the time in which it was made--gruesome moments (the scene between sadistic hit-man Bob Steele and gang member Danny Dayton, when it slowly dawns on Dayton that *he* is the intended victim, will make your hair stand on end). Even taking into account Bogart's miscasting, this film is still a nail-biter with a surprising little plot twist near the end. Don't miss it.
