Darkly amusing (dark comedy if you're English) about a dodgy cop using spoof scenes from great and famous movies. Such scenes with the poodle reflects the horse in the godfather and the another scene is the Karaoke Bar and the movie Carrie. This is all set in Swansea about twins and dealing with the death of a family member. Much Love, madness and set in Wales. Wonderful, I watched about 5 times in 7 days. Got funnier and funnier, the script (See Summary) is outstanding. John Noakes and the scene with the Ice Cream van is most amusing and again if you are English the scene in bath where the twins are quizzing each other about football is also exceptional.WATCH WATCH AND WATCH AGAIN.
