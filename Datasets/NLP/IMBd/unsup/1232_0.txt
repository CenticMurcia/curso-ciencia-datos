I like this movie--loved it as a kid, and would beg my mother to watch it with me. I also remember watching it in the hotel lobby when we had to move somewhere when i was nine or ten years old. Gosh, i hope I can find it--do you guys and gals out there get into the mood of watching old movies you haven't seen in a long time? That's me-- i will watch any movie that comes to mind that I loved watching when I was a little kid... I am a big movie collector, but ironically, i don't like watching much TV, weird huh? So now i tried to post this message and i have to go to ten lines thats weird because the last post i did didn't have ten lines and it posted, so i guess here we go with the tenth line here!
