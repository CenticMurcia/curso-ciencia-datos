Set in the distance future and in a place far far away, Screamers is an excellent sci-fi flick about two warring entities whom both have been long since forgotten. For the past 10 years, Sirius 6B has been shaped by the face of nuclear war and now it will be shaped by a another, more smarter, and aggressive entity called a Screamer. A Screamer was a man-made robot (sent to help one side) complete with an advanced A.I. who lurks beneath the ground waiting for its prey. Waiting silently and patiently. But little do both sides know that this man-made robot has got a few tricks up its own sleeve. Screamers is a amazing movie that features lots of suspense, plot turns, and a few good comedy scenes of its own. If you enjoyed Pitch Black or Red Planet, this is a great movie to add to your collection.
