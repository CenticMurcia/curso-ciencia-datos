*Caution potential spoilers and road hazards ahead* ROUTE 666 is actually the kind of lightweight straight-to-video extravaganza that would make a good date flick. Whoever you're with, they'll get bored quickly and want something else to do. The premise had potential, that being federal agents stuck in the middle of nowhere with a prisoner, being pursued by homicidal ghouls. Unfortunately, the execution is as bland and bleak as the desert landscape that surrounds them.<br /><br />Lou Diamond Phillips sleepwalks and occasionally "trips" through the film, and his is the best performance. Steven Williams does add some oomph to the proceedings, too. The rest are wrung from the "hey, memorize the script and recite the lines" academy.<br /><br />Speaking of script, in ROUTE 666, a lot of talk replaces any modicum of action. Well, suspense for that matter, seems to have taken a holiday, also. What's left, is a talky, unexciting, predictable outing that has a couple of good moments. ROUTE 666? Don't go there, girlfriend.<br /><br />Not recommended.
