While this film may seem academically sound and well-researched, it does not once mention what I thought was rather widely regarded as the most practicable alternative to petroleum fuel, the conversion of coal into synthetic fuels using the Fischer-Tropsch process. This process has been around since the 1920s and has been exploited by oil starved nations such as Germany and Japan during the second world war, and by South Africa during Apartheid and after. I understand there are enormous reserves of coal in the United States alone, enough to provide such fuel for the country for at least a century. While more expensive, it cannot currently compete with the use of petroleum, and has therefore not been widely exploited. In this film, however, power from solar, Hydrogen, and wind sources are all dismissed out of hand as impracticable alternatives and cannot, or will not, be developed before we all suddenly starve, freeze, run amok, or whatever they suggest is going to happen in twenty years when oil reserves are suddenly depleted. Yet, there is no mention of a significant technology which is already in place, using a resource in rather great abundance, and whose refinement and improvement is light years from the hopelessness suggested by one of their experts, who likens the challenges we face in surviving the depletion of oil reserves to that of colonizing Pluto in ten years...
