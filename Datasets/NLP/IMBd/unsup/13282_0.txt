To the guy that said bypass this movie, just stop watching kung fu movies all together. I mean you couldn't even get the plot right, no wonder you didn't like it.<br /><br />The real story is that a rebel against the army is on the run, to make a long story short he is protected by the ten well-known fighters whom later becomes considered as the Kwangtung Ten Tigers. But after the head officer of the Ching Army is killed, years later his son and sworn brother plot to kill off the students of the famous Ten Tigers.<br /><br />The martial arts in here are nothing short of excellent as always plus all the Venoms were in this one, all 6 of them. Kuo Chui, Lo Meng, Wei Pai, Lu Feng, Sun Chien, and my favorite of them all Chiang Sheng rest in peace.<br /><br />Ten Tigers is a definite pick up for any one whom likes classic kung fu films, I own a whole lot of them so I know personally, but give this movie a peek, you can't go wrong. On a special note don't listen to these hard to please reviewers waiting on something to hate, they already have dislike on their mind before they even watch the film.........................For Shame.
