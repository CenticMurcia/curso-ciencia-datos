This movie is part of a tired franchise and not the one started by the Wayan brothers. It all started with Airplane nearly thirty years ago and moved into The Naked Gun etc. to Scary Movie 3. The actors and gags slowly churn some from brother to brother with the exception of Leslie Nielsen.<br /><br />It basically spoofs four movies with others thrown in. The three main storyline movies were not very interesting to start and the comedy is not much of an improvement.<br /><br />Tom Cruise is parodied in both The War of the Worlds and his Oprah appearance. This is interlaced with The Grudge, The Village, and the whole thing is bookended with Saw.
