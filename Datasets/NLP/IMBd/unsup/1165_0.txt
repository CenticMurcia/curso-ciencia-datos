I was really impressed by The Book of Caleb - the first low-budget indie for the young director, Matt Manahan. The scale is HUGE - lots of locations, costumes, and characters. And it looked Amazing - how many first features shoot in 35mm these days? I had just gotten together with my friends from high school a few days before watching the film and so the themes hit me and resonated. I have so many old friends who i keep in touch with and miss, yet when we're together it's obvious how different we all are now. One friend said - I feel just like I did when i was 21 and I had to say back - why would you want to do that, you're 32! I think that's something we all go through and continue to. Caleb captured it well. I also loved seeing Bucks County, my home town, on the big screen.<br /><br />For the most part, I thought the balance of humor and pathos worked really well - there was one scene that I thought stuck out but I can't remember what it was...it may have been the transition into the speech in the school yard or when the guy is dancing on the roof.<br /><br />The film struck me as a great mix between a parable and 80's coming of age films. The voice-over sets that tone well, although i did wonder if it could be shorter - i have no idea.
