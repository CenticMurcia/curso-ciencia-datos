Futurama is probably my favourite Western animation, I first watched it because it was "from the creator of The Simpsons" and found myself preferring it. The style of animation is similar to that in The Simpsons although the characters look more human.<br /><br />Set 1000 years in the future Futurama follows the life of Fry, a 20th century pizza delivery boy who got frozen in a cryogenics lab on New Year's Eve 1999. He awakens to find himself in a strange world where he makes friends with Bender, a kleptomaniac robot and Leela, a purple haired cyclops who is the only one of her kind on Earth. The three of them find employment with Fry's great-great-great... etc nephew, the 150 year old Professor Farnsworth. Their work for his delivery firm takes them to a variety of strange worlds although not all of their adventures are on alien planets, some involve the professor's strange inventions and others just involve them living their lives on 31st century Earth. There is also a good collection of secondary characters such as Dr Zoidberg the incompetent company doctor who is a crustacean, Zapp Brannigan, leader of the Democratic Order Of Planet's military leader who is also infatuated with Leela. The show manages to have several guest stars even though it is set centuries in the future by having the technology to keep people's heads preserved in jars, strangely this even works for people who are long dead in the present.<br /><br />Like all series there are a few week episodes but these are far outnumbered by the excellent ones, most episodes will have viewers laughing and one or two might you cry. The voice actors all do a great job as do the animators.
