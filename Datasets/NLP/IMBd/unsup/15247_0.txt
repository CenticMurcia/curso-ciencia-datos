I'm a recent convert to IMDb and have been writing and posting these comments since late November and they've mostly been about films. No television show has really motivated and impressed me enough to compose a love letter in it's honour so far. Until I decided this little (only in ratings) wonder deserved the distinction of becoming the first program I'd praise to the skies.<br /><br />I checked the chronological filter in reverse to find out just who was the very first soul to write here about "Freaks and Geeks". I wanted to give them a tip of the hat by name. And guess what? The comment from 19 July 1999 (love the way those numbers flow together) was listed as "anonymous"! Oh, well. Thanks anyway, whoever you are. <br /><br />I assumed by now there would be over 1000 people on this subject and was shocked there are less than 200 so far! Where are all you "freaks" and "geeks"? Write something and tell the world out there that this show is easily one of the greatest of the medium's history.<br /><br />Paul Feig still is active in comedy and has been overshadowed somewhat unfairly because of the juggernaut that is Judd Apatow's career. Let's not forget Mr. Feig was a huge part of this experience and if he's not involved with some film and/or television, the world is a less friendly place. His pain and refusal to gloss over the real, heartbreaking trials of adolescence are what makes this show have a great big heart that ticks. God bless you, Paul Feig!<br /><br />I'll maintain no matter how good some of Judd Apatow's films are, his best work always has and will be on the box. If you're going to create another show, Judd, please put it somewhere like HBO this time and get some newer faces who grew up with "Freaks".<br /><br />And have Linda Cardellini appear in some role worthy of her talents. Honestly, is there another young, popular actress this well liked? I've never seen a negative mention of her in the tabloids. And I hope it stays that way. Her ability to take almost any kind of material and not just make it work, but thrive is on full display in "Freaks". The role she returned to NBC for, Samantha Taggart on "ER", was only worth watching because she made often silly plots truly believable with her brave and intelligent acting style. <br /><br />There are so many wonderful actors on this roster, I'd like to tell each of them how much this whole 18 episode arc means to me and millions of other young adults. At 36, maybe I'm not a "young adult" in the technical sense, but I have watched an awful lot of television in my life and can say this program is as good as TV has ever been. <br /><br />NBC used to have the best stuff around and now...I don't make a point of setting an hour aside anymore because one thing in the lineup is that worth the time. No more "Homicide", no more "Seinfeld" and no more "Freaks and Geeks". It makes you feel like you are at a wake and remembering how great we once had it.
