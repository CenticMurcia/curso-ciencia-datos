My friends and I were browsing the racks at a local big-name movie rental place, and we came across this film, which promised to be shocking, exciting, and provocative. Being that most of the other titles were tame, we decided to take the risk.<br /><br />I guess we built it up to be more exciting than it really was, because by the packaging, we were practically led to believe that this was going to be an absurd, shocking, and possibly humorous. There was also the added bonus that it appeared to be overtly sexual as well... So we thought, "nothing like some gratuitous nudity to go with this seemingly wild movie!" Personally, I was sadly disappointed, because the movie was more serious than anything, and frankly it really didn't have much that appealed to me. The portrayal of the teenage boy and his struggle was believable, but I'm only 25, so I still remember quite well what it was like to be a teenager. But as far as the struggle itself, I felt like it was really typical, if not beat to death.<br /><br />Plus, I should add that the soundtrack was the crappiest thing I've ever heard, and I felt that it clashed with the movie. It also had the unfortunate effect of ruining any of the impact of the movie, because it was extinguished by the horrible use of music. I would have even rather heard circus music as a soundtrack.<br /><br />I gave it a 4, because the plot seemed to be decently thought out and executed. Maybe my mediocre rating would not have been here, if the film was actually marketed and labeled properly, instead of trying to mislead people into thinking that it's some type of sensational and provocative material! We probably should have just watched Bram Stoker's the Mummy, again. That scene where Richard Karn gets electrocuted is simply the best.
