"Can't Hardly Wait" was a perfect fit for Jennifer Love Hewitt. She doesn't have to act. All she has to do is sit on the sofa, pout and show off her cleavage. To her credit, however, she does this very well.<br /><br />I am seriously beginning to doubt Miss Love's true acting abilities. When is she going to be in a substantial movie with a role that requires her to do some real acting? Perhaps if she ever does have such a role her lack of any real acting talent would be exposed and her star would come crashing down. So it's safer for her to stick with lightweight movies such as "Can't Hardly Wait."<br /><br />I gave CHW three stars: Two for Seth Green, who is pretty funny all the way through, and one star for Melissa Joan Hart in an unbilled appearance. Other than that, you've seen this plot many times before and you've seen these characters many times before.<br /><br />Of course, CHW would have been somewhat redeemed if it had given us a positive message or two. Instead we get more cliches, like getting drunk will change you from Mr. Nerd to Mr. Popularity. Please!<br /><br />"Providence" fans, look closely to see a pre-Providence Robbie Hanson guarding the beer keg. No, on second thought, leave this movie alone and watch a re-run of "Providence" instead. That would be much more entertaining.
