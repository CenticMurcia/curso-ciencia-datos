This leaden effort is about life in the Waspy social circles of N.Y. (I think it was N.Y.; I was too bored to remember). The critics went ape over this dog, but the endless, pointless, droning, fatuous conversations among people we don't give a fig about were to me a kind of torture by dialogue. Maybe that was the point, I dunno, but they should have put a warning label on this one. The movie to me gave a whole new meaning to the word "sleeper".
