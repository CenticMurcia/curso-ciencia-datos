Yeah it was a great movie! lol it was like they read some fan fiction that involved this plot and thought that it would be neat to try going in that direction.<br /><br />An I got to say I didn't expect it to turn out so well from the beginning but now I must say it's because I was being a hard headed Disney purist with the whole thing of No Disney Sequels are Bad! But now I see I was wrong, there's actually some good ones in plot wise and then there's some bad ones you just have to watch them for at least 30 mins to give them a chance but some may require 40 mins the most.<br /><br />Come on people, remember the old saying YOU CAN'T JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER! lol that's why we all need to read the title of a book and then flip it over and read the back of it before buying, or sometimes we open the book and read a page or we just decide to give it a shot and give the first chapter a read then when were done we are hooked or not.<br /><br />So please next time you think NO WAY!, don't be Lazy! and give it a chance and watch the first 30 minutes on Toon Disney or Disney channel like I did and if that's too much at least read a summary for the movie or watch a trailer.<br /><br />In my defense I must say do Both! Because the trailer's sometimes make the movies appear better than they really are example Bridge to Terabithia!
