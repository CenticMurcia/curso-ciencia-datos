Whale of a Tale is basically a story about a kid who visits a marine park and forms an attachment to a killer whale there. Not much else happens. It's very cheap looking and totally inoffensive, even by 1970's standards. It plays like an average episode of The Wonderful World of Walt Disney. In fact the star, Scott Kolden, appeared in many Disney productions, which seems odd as he's an actor of little talent. What really makes the film interesting is the appearance of William Shatner who plays a marine biologist at the park! The clothes he wears is enough to make watching the movie worthwhile. The box says that the film came out in 1976 but judging from the fashions worn by the characters, I'd say it was more like 1972. Oh yes, Shatner also has a totally forced romance with the boy's mom (naturally, Kolden plays a fatherless child) Whale of a Tale is actually pretty funny if you can accept it as tongue in cheek. It may well have inspired Free Willy twenty years later! One wonders how Shatner feels about it.
