This is without a shadow of a doubt the best metal doc. ever to come to our screens. looking back at roots like blues, Rickover vagnars classical influence to the well overlooked blue cheer. to the true beginning black sabbath. showing the ex vs pressy and wife the gore's full front attack on metal and twisted sisters assault back just superb. the doc. stretches as far a gorgoth of Norway discusses Norwegian church burners and the fact that Gene Simmonds painted the phrase OJ. just brilliant.<br /><br />whether you like love or have metal its worth understanding at a greater level the preconceived. watch it love it hate it just rate it. thank you.
