This is a movie that is about being vulgar, hateful, and worthless. It in no way is an inspiration to anyone. There are people out there that live this way, but why promote it as a way of life? There needs to be more family friendly movies instead of this kind of garbage that actually perpetuates damaged families and their lack of importance to each other. Some families are broken as shown in this movie, but unfortunately, those same families will walk away from watching this movie feeling vindicated in living this lifestyle rather than seeing this as an embarrassment to their lifestyle. I have known people like this in my lifetime, and they would completely take this as, "...yep, this is my life and there's nothing wrong with it; they even made a movie about it." I HATED this movie. I want to bring good values to my family and friends. I don't want to validate this stuff. I don't want to ignore it and pretend that it doesn't exist, but it's better to help people who are like this than to make a glorified movie about it.
