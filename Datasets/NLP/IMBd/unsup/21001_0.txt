This was one of the first Disney sequals... It was one that turned out pretty good, but now Disney is going overboard. The Return Of Jafar was basicly the pilot for the TV show and it started it perfectly. Everyone is back, except for Robin Williams because of some disagreement. The story it pretty good and the songs are ok.<br /><br />It's great seeing Aladdin, Genie and the rest in action again, because in my opinion, Aladdin (1993), is one of the best Disney films ever to be released.<br /><br />The only thing I'm mad about is all these other sequals. If Disney is going to make sequals to their films, at least TRY to make them good. The only good Disney sequals I've seen Return Of Jafar, The Lion King 2: Simba's Pride, and Return To Neverland.
