I saw this film only twice on television in the late 1960s, and I have not seen it listed too frequently. The plot is from a Graham Greene short story, and like so many of his works Greene questions what we regard as good and evil in the world.<br /><br />Steiger is a crooked financier on the lam. He boards a train and exchanges identities with another passenger who died on board. He reaches a Latin American country, and crosses the boarder. But the authorities at home are still after him. He did not realize the person whose identity he stole was sought by the U.S. authorities for murder.<br /><br />Steiger has plenty of money in a suitcase, but he soon discovers that the local authorities see him as something to bleed dry. Everyone jacks up prices for his normal living expenses from the police on down. And the money is slowly running out. The only creature who befriends him is a dog. It remains his only real friend in this town of vultures. He consistently refuses to return to the U.S., where police officer Bernard Lee tries to get him to return. But he realizes that they think he is the murderer, not an embezzler, and he can't return. Moreover, he resents the pressures that are being put on the local authorities to push him back. They are using these to squeeze more cash out of him.<br /><br />The character Steiger begins as is a selfish crook, but as the film progresses (as is typical of Greene's work) the defects of those around the anti-hero are such as to make us increasingly sympathetic to that figure. As he is stripped, step - by - step of everything, Steiger gains our reluctant pity, and his relationship with the simple dog makes him ... in the end... tragically heroic.<br /><br />Definitely a wonderful film - hopefully they will show it again soon.
