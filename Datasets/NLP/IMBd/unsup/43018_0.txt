I just got my cable cut out and i had the misfortune of watching this movie. To wash the unholiness and filth off of my eyes, I rinsed them in muriatic acid, that I found laying around. My friend help me write this comment. It is truly the beginning of the end. Disney movies should be banned from the face of the earth. And raven, oh raven, no more raven, i'm better off watching something from ed woods. The storyline and plot are relatively stupid. The acting is worst than The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl. Disney just isn't the same since Disney died of course. Whatever happened to cartoons not associated with Pixar or bad acting like that.
