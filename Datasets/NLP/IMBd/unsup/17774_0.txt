This was a good show in between the "Star Trek" and "Star Wars" years that was supposed to be a reboot for the successful English "UFO" series of The Late '60s / Early '70s. The States got it in syndication about a year post-production and was heavily marketed initially for the 1975-76 season.<br /><br />The show got a lot of stick for its questionable science and uneven writing, but it was a nice break from other action shows masquerading as sci-fi. Remember, it is science FICTION. Unresolved endings and dark story lines were the trademark of the first season while the second series succumbed to safer familiar territory. One can point to the unexplained changes in Season Two as show killers, but I think people who latched on to this simply wanted another "Star Trek" and were disappointed.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed ... I found the stories fresh, realistic, and full of literary references that fleshed out the scripts rather than purloined as borrowed lines uttered by the actors.<br /><br />The main idea built around the premise of the moon forcibly ejected from the earth's orbit was a risky move, and I suppose many viewers thought this too ridiculous, therefore I wonder if an episode, a continuation of the pilot episode, that picks up the events befalling earth below simultaneously was in order. Perhaps that idea was kicked around but rejected because of similarities to Irwin Allen's disaster flicks of the time, budget constraints, the lack of a script, or the fact that the series was about space, not earth. Whatever, I think that would've been the link that might have clinched this series for a longer run.<br /><br />Some of my favorites include "Dragon's Domain", "Force of Life", "Black Sun", "Earthbound", and "Death's Other Dominion". Good drama, good fun.<br /><br />Cheers: Groundbreaking effects, fine acting, some good scripts, serious drama though fun. Stories are thoughtful.<br /><br />Caveats: Year Two. Haven't we seen this sort of thing before? "Science" Fiction. Scripts at times uneven and lacked conclusions.
