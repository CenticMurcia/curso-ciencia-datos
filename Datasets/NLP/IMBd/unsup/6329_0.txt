Explain to me why after this Frank Whaley did not turn into a huge star? This is as good a turn as Matthew Broderick's in Ferris Bueller. Whaley carries this film with a swagger that defies belief. We've all known total BS artists post-high school like this. The opening scene alone is worth the price of admission. Definitely one of John Hughes underrated gems. Add to that the fact this will remind you of how hot Jennifer Connelly used to be before she got all stick figure on us in her adulthood. The violence I think really we could have done without. It seems a crutch many American flicks fall back on. I mean, how many comedies seem to want to put guns in them? Sorry, but how often does the average person actually see a gun pulled in their lifetime? It was really unnecessary to have the whole trapped in the store after hours and then have Connelly and Whaley held hostage.
