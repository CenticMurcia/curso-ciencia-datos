***The comment may contain spoilers*** The idea of adventure in outback and the cast sounds interesting to me. the more time has passed by, the more i felt boring.<br /><br />I have seen it once, and i was not convinced by such weak story, perhaps no plot at all, so i gave it another shot, and this time i'm convinced that i have wasted totally 4 hours with nothing more than a big disappointment.<br /><br />The main flaw of such crappy film is that, Sandy and Hiro should have never met each other this way in the first place!! A rich Japanese so-called businessman, who can afford a classy Leica camera, he just can't afford a team of professional traveling guides to show him around, particularly in outback. Does the Japanese really look that naive? i'm simply not buying this.<br /><br />If the director gives the green light to go this way, fine i just move on to see what chemistry can possible exist between these businessman and geologist. Well, They are stuck in the middle of the desert. It's predictable but hey, what the heck, i might get something interesting between these two people. for the next 20 minutes i just see someone is digging, and a few lines coming from someone's mouth, then followed by goodnight sleep. Sorry I couldn't see any plot here, not to mention there is any chemistry I can smell,,, Someone please tell me what's the deal with the pants in the sex scene. If the director cares the least to explain why, at least someone who gives 10 stars should.<br /><br />Sooner or later I will ask myself, what exactly are these two people, who are willing to put their life in danger again, doing in this no-man's land? If you expect an explanation for this, don't. Because the director was so concentrated to shoot the beautiful landscape in outback. (Perhaps it was meant to be a documentary film, but somewhere along the line it turns out to be a drama/ romantic movies, that might be the missing plot,,,) The death of Hiro is just ridiculous and hardly to believe. From the way Hiro jumps to the water, breaking his arms would be the worst scenario. I thought he was making fun of Sandy by playing dead, but it won't happen because there is no plot remember. And the dragging body, i just admire how great the director is good at killing time, unfortunately my time.<br /><br />I can't imagine how a wife could be soo cool for losing a husband and a father of two children. May be i'm not that sophisticated to understand it. And again I hear the familiar soundtrack. If you are the one who have trouble of sleeping, you shouldn't miss this mind taking scene of airport.<br /><br />If i ever watched it again, I would edit the film with nothing left but the shot of Toni, and call it Sandy story.
