This is my short review of Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle. This movie blows big time! I'm a big fan of the R&B cartoon, but sitting through this live action update was like the most painful torture imaginable. Watching this took away precious time from my life that I'll never regain. The only part I enjoyed was the last minute, where Rocky and Bullwinkle are finally back in their cartoon form. Let's pray they never leave that form again.
