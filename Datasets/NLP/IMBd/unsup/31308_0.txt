Dismissed by some narrow-minded or hyper-sensitive critics as a cliche'-ridden sitcom, full of the usual 90s yuppy stereotypes, J'EN SUIS is really a well-made, funny urban comedy. If the themes stated can be freshly presented and funny, why can't this be a great film? It is. Nobody should be offended. The film in my opinion just wants to make you laugh. It never insults any minority group, and it succeeds exceedingly. Throw in Quebec's best two young actors (Roy Dupuis and Patrick Huard), the sexy French star Arielle Dombasle, and a glossy cinematic vision of Montreal, and J'EN SUIS becomes even more enjoyable. The blend of Canadian and French actors produce a blend of French understandable by all Francophones (unlike many modern films which use variations not understood by those on the other side of the Atlantic), and humor accessible to all, free of regionalisms or cultural slants. Don't miss this beautifully photographed, funny film, now available in video with English subtitles.
