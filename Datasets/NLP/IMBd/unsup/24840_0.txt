This movie is absolutely haunting! I have never forgotten it and am still feeling the slowly growing horror it produced back then when I remember it now. I first saw this film as a little girl.<br /><br />I need to get a copy of this wonderful film for my own. I searched filmographies of Arthur O'Connell to actually get the title for this film. It was spooky and so memorable to me even as a child. I remember the playhouse, I remember the sound of Barbara Stanwyck's voice, especially with key lines. What a film! I remember all the nuances. Add this to your collection as well, it will stay with you for sure. I can't say that many movies have remained with me the way this one did.
