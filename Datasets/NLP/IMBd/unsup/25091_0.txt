I know that the movie isn't "realistic," but it's fiction after all. The concept is unique, and I don't know of any other movie that uses this plot. The whole idea of Indians still living in the U.S. as they did 130 years ago is fascinating. Some of the shots - especially the one where the Indians first "materialize" to Barbara Hershey and Tom Berenger - are really awesome. Also, I love Steve Reevis, so anything he EVER does is a draw to me. Also, I don't care that much that it's not shot where the movie is supposed to take place - they do that all the time now, although I've never been able to figure out why. Was there no place in Montana they could've filmed this? Is it cheaper to film in Canada? Look at the movie "The Edge' - it's supposed to take place in Alaska, but they used Canada also. That's the only thing that irks me, and, I'm sure, other viewers. Why can't we just film movies in the places they are supposed to take place in?
