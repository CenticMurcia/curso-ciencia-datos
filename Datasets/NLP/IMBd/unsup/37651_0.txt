I was telling my friends recently about a movie i saw in '92 or '93 that had Jim Carrey as first bill but he didn't show up until the last five minutes. No one knew what i was talking about and so i came here to find out what it was.<br /><br />High strung is one of the worst comedies and thats why its unknown. it's marketing was poor if it had any and had to milk the success of an actor who was in it for five minutes to get it released. <br /><br />I can describe this movie very easily, nothing happens but you as a viewer will be bitched at for the whole movie about some pathetic persons life. despite the wit to some of the ideas, its absolutely boring. Its been awhile since i saw it but the one repeated thing that comes to mind is the character's inability to accept that no matter how little milk he puts in his cereal there is always some left when he's done eating. It's so stupid even a real person would not bitch about it, in fact they would just drink it or not , Thats a simple solution but to bitch repeatedly about it is dumb.<br /><br />It tries way too hard to be funny. Even Carrey is unfunny in his cameo. This is a movie that should of been shelved and never released.<br /><br />I did see one person liked this movie, maybe that one person is enough to justify its existence, for me its not.<br /><br />A BOMB
