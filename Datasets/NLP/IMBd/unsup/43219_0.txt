******SPOILER/S(I guess)******<br /><br />Actually, I think the, um, band(?) featured in "Pod People" is singing "Hear the engines roll now." Which doesn't make much more sense than what Joel and the 'bots imagine they're singing (their own version is a gas) or excuse the fact that the song just plain sucks. And if the music sucks, it can only be because the, ah, movie(s?) in which it is featured also sucks. As Mad Scientist Dr. Clayton Forrester puts it "it has nothing to do with pods, nothing to do with people and everything to do with hurting." Fortunately, some of the aches and pains may be caused by MST3K-induced laughter.
