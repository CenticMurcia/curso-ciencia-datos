The story is dull and lackluster but the biggest disappointment is in Kim Basinger's performance. She sleepwalks through the part. Her job is to be convincing, instead she seems like she is acting. Vincent Perez fairs better. However, his energy is wasted in his scenes with Basinger. She just seems like she would rather be anywhere than in this movie. Towards the end she does come through a little better but, by then it's too late to save the film.
