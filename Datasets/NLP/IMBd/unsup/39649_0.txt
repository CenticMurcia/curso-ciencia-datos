May or May Not Contain Spoiler.. don't think so though!! <br /><br />I have never posted a comment about any movie here before, but I felt compelled to post about this little flick.<br /><br />With all the hype surrounding this movie, I was expecting a terrifying thriller but instead I was treated to a 4 minute long laser show with brief breaks in the 'action' to feature a poor special FX job on Johnny spinning in his wheelchair, and a frightened small dog.<br /><br />Despite the claims of 'shape shifting mutant', I saw nothing of the sort, other than what looked like a blob of latex with teeth pushed against a photocopier.<br /><br />Worst money I ever spent in my life.
