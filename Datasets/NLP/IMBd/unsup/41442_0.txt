I haven't seen this movie yet, but my husband has. He said it stunk as bad as the previous commenter said.<br /><br />My take on it is, I grew up just a few miles from where the plane landed, just down Highway 100. My dad and my uncle heard about it on their CB radios and went up to see it before the Sheriff ever got there. A short time later, they took the rest of us up the hill to see it. The plane was empty, but it was amazing how small the clearing was in which they landed this plane.<br /><br />Literally, a square landing field was made in the middle of the woods. There were tree stumps and debris and Georgia red mud, it was like a choppy ocean with hard, stationary waves.<br /><br />The plane had clipped pine trees as it came down and there were still pine needles stuck in the prop.<br /><br />I was only about 10 and I'll never forget how surreal it was. Maybe if I ever actually see the flick, I'll come back and tell you how they did.
