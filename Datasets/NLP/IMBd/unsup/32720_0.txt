So it was funny, I guess. The point is that they're all stupid, and we get to kind of have fun letting them be stupid and run around the woods. I get it, I should say... fun! Yeah...<br /><br />I don't know, I think a few things in this were pretty creative, mostly the different type of stuff the killer did and the whole side-story involving the transvestite. I also like the references to Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Deliverance (at this point, can you even have a killer woodsman story without said references?). Also, the whole duct tape thing was a great motif.<br /><br />I actually think the funniest and most interesting part of the movie was the credits, though. Wardrobe provided by Wal-Mart. Yeah, good stuff.<br /><br />--PolarisDiB
