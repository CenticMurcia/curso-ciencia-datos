Sorry, but as an Argentinian woman, I can't stop saying that this movie was so bad for me. Like her other movie "La ci√©naga", Lucrecia Martel continues without saying anything to me clearly, when I was trying to understand this movie, it ended!!! I don't understand anything of it, and I wasn't the only. What happened with Dr.Jano and Helena?? What it is means the two girls in the swimming pool at the end?? Sorry,maybe this kind of movie is for high level mind or something, but I think that I am intelligent, I like European movies a lot, and Argentinian movies are similar to them,but this movie specially sucks! 0/0
