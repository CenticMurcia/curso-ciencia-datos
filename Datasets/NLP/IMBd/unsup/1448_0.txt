Jeremy Pevin and Sherilyn Fenn are a dynamic screen couple, which is apparent from their first scenes. Their understated performances are accompanied by some first rate support from JoBeth Williams and Alex Rocco. In Ms. Williams case, the movies over before you realize it was her; this movie gave me a reason to remember Alex Rocco.<br /><br />Despite the implausibility of the situation these people behave like normal people. If your going to pass yourself off as a screen writer, you might get some books about screen writing. The inability of "power" people in Hollywood to admit they don't know someone whose "in" is believable and a huge asset to the deception.<br /><br />This is the rare Hollywood romance where we actually get a clue as to what attracts these two people to one another. Only once do they resort to the music and photo montage of a date to explain the mutual appeal. The rest of the time the screenwriter lets us hear what's going on with these people.<br /><br />A great movie. I'm going to go watch it again.
