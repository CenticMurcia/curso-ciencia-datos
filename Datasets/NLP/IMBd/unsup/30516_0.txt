In this innovative doozy,you get to control the parties of Shion,a highly ambitious knight;Riza,a young psychic priestess and Surlent,a scholarly wizard.The three must form a party of diffrent warriors of different species (the species of each 4,000) to confront Rudra of the heavens and try to purify the world and it's life.Afterwards,Dune,a legendary plunderer makes his appearance.<br /><br />It's a really cool game.It has everything an RPG fan is asking for,likeable characters,interesting plot twists,wonderful soundtrack and a spell system where it consists of word essences(note:there is mostly Kanji,or chinese styled symbols).Keita Amemiya's designs breathe life into the characters,monsters and mechanisms.If it wern't for him,the game would not be the same.<br /><br />I'm not saying this game is flawless.There are a few flaws.The graphics are very gorgeous,but looks too much like "Final Fantasy VI" or "Romancing Saga 3".And the game can be hard at first for beginners of these type of games.But other than that,the game is beautifully crafted.I wished Square would have just gone ahead and released it,if it weren't for the censors.
