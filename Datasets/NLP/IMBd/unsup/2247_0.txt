This film has fallen into my hands by accident and i am so happy for that as i found it absolutely amazing!!! I loved the twist and the whole story surrounding it!!! I found it totally daring and bold, very smart and the music by the wonderful Alberto Iglesias was just so good. The performances by Paz Vega and Najwa Nimri are just breath taking and Tristan Ulloa so sweet and real. The actors and actresses altogether have managed to make me feel various feelings throughout the movie and i have to admit that i have watched it over 10 times by now!!! THe location of the movie offered great colors and excellent views even though i still don't know where it was filmed!!!<br /><br />Another one time Javier Camera has proved his amazing talent. Julio Medem has made an exceptionally remarkable work. Spanish cinematography is indeed the finest!
