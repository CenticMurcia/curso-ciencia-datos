Anyone who's seen any of these Batman fan-films knows they're dime-a-dozen. Every one of these directors has their own take on the Dark Knight. Everyone's gotta add their own little twist, evidently. That's great, I understand the concept of adding a little to an already well-known franchise to make it your own. This director decided that killing off Batman wasn't flashy enough, so he adds anal rape! Sounds great, huh?<br /><br />Apparently some whiny criminal, who enjoys blaming everyone else in existence for his problems, captures Batman with the ole taser to the peepee trick. I guess years of training couldn't possibly prepare Batman for a slow-moving junkie with a taser. And really, why would Batman even bother to protect himself in that area?! Once chained up, the criminal is kind enough to share his drugs and some man-lovin' with Batman. See that's the part where the crook gives Batman a taste of the hard life that he endured because of Batman. Because we all know that once you go to jail, you are immediately hooked on drugs and have sex with men. And it's always Batman's fault. I guess the director figures anyone who goes through injustice is entitled to act like a raging lunatic.<br /><br />Yada yada yada, a bunch of pointless & poorly delivered speeches happen, the criminal does everyone a favor and blows his brains out, and Batman uncharacteristically kills himself because the director thinks this is a brilliant plot twist. Then you see Batman lying in a coffin in full costume. It's hilarious.<br /><br />In short, the director probably never bothered to research anything about the character. He probably found a second hand Batman suit laying around, and thought he'd show everyone his awful take on Batman. This may sound harsh, but this film is really that bad. Aside from the absurd plot, the acting is embarrassing to watch. Every line, especially from the criminal sounds forced. If you walk away from this crap feeling anything other than disgust, you have issues. No amount of BS film student excuses can save this film. It's just poor taste in every form imaginable.<br /><br />The director's message in this film seems to be: "If your life is difficult, you should blame others and take drugs. It will be justified."
