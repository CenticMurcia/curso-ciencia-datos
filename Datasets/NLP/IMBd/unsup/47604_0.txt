"The Wizard Of Speed And Time" is a low-budget movie loosely based on the trivial adventures of a special effects person (Jitlov) who is making a short movie. I sought out this movie after reading many glowing reviews on IMDb. Despite wanting to like it, I found the hype to be unfounded.<br /><br />Dated music and visuals along with cheesy humor screams out "80's movie". Inexpensive early synthesizers in simplistic arrangements were used for a large part of the music. For visuals, somewhat crude stop-motion photography is the order of the day. Never do you finish a scene without having to digest the awkward and unnatural effects. Even keeping in mind that this is a low budget movie, we never cross over into cherishing the effects for what they are, and instead lose whatever redeeming value they could have otherwise had. <br /><br />As a fan of Airplane!, I enjoy 'low-brow' humor. Unfortunately, "Wizard" is not nearly in the same league. Puns sometimes replaced any real attempt at adding any substantial humor. Scenes showing Jitlov's dealings with various unions (complete with double-talk representatives) left me cold, despite their humorous target. The various flat-lined police scenes (often involving mock-chase scenes) produced groans instead of laughs. In other parts, clever visuals took the place of real humor. Often, a small effect (for instance, glasses that glowed at the right moment) inspired a smile. Unfortunately, cute effects can't bridge over the large gaps in humor this movie has, and "Wizard" never goes beyond a level that only pre-teen audiences can enjoy. <br /><br />"Wizard" contains Jitlov's running commentary on Hollywood unions. Jitlov reduces the movie industry to a two-dimensional caricature of evil and incompetence. In one case, a movie producer ambushes Jitlov's efforts at every turn in order to win a bet. "Wizard" is also laced with running themes about Hollywood union lock-down. For example, studio executives use creative accounting to allow the non-union Jitlov to make his short while remaining out of union sight. "This potentially political statement lacks the bite it needed to come across as anything but fluff. Instead, it becomes lost 'in the mix'.<br /><br />Script limitations left the actors out in the cold. Philip Michael Thomas ("Miami Vice") played a bit-part policeman that had no significant role in the plot other than to chase some conveniently placed bad guys. His character ends up slapped on top of a script held together by loosely-based vignettes. Stephen Stucker (who nearly stole the show in "Airplane!") had even less screen time. His last screen appearance, Stucker's comic talents unfortunately are never allowed to surface. In the end, Jitlov spends too much time in front of the screen with his only 'adequit' acting skills.<br /><br />Some have made much of the movie showing behind-the-scenes glimpses of how special effects are done. Nobody is going to walk away from "Wizard" a special effects expert. While "Wizard" held a few moments of interest (notably, the 'running on the wall' effect), most everything fell into simple 'common sense'. <br /><br />In conclusion, this isn't the 'diamond in the rough' that some have suggested. I wanted to like "Wizard", but the many flaws quickly grew tedious. If you do come across it, take a look. Just don't get your hopes too high.
