No need to waste your time, skip this unhappening letdown of a movie, Claire Denis is capable of so much more, as shown in (at least) Trouble Every Day, that watching this movie made me upset. All haters of French cinema for the "lack of action" should consider using this "movie" as their pick, truly nothing happens. It's all very nice to make human movies, picturing things as we probably retain them in our non-cinematographic heads, but this is ridiculously lacking in the value department. Cannot believe this was based in actual writing. I insist, don't even bother, this was the last movie I watched at the SFIFF'03 and as such it couldn't have been more representative of the general disappointment that I felt.
