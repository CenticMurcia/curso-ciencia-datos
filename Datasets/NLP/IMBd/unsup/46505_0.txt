A few twists and turns keep the viewer's interest in this one, although Van Heflin's whining can turn you off. Robert Taylor plays a convincing tough guy with no compromises, but someone who softens up and does the right thing at the end.<br /><br />Heflin has some interesting lines but, personally, seeing a drunk in major role like this wasn't much fun to watch or hear. He ruined the film for me with his unlikeable annoying character. <br /><br />Meanwhile, once she changed hairstyles, Lana Turner was a lot easier to watch. Fans of her will be disappointed in her screen time and the amount of lines they gave her to speak. It's not much.<br /><br />A slightly-below average film noir/melodrama for its period.
