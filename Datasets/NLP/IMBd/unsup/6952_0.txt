Some of the people who "review" flicks here continually amaze me with their complete lack of film knowledge.<br /><br />When I heard an interview with the always-extraordinary Sean Penn, in which he said he was upset that so few people had seen what he considers to be his best work: this film and the excellent "At Close Range," I knew that I had to catch this.<br /><br />Then, finding that it was based on an unproduced John Cassavetes script, I was all the more eager.<br /><br />That final statement should scare off anyone who expected a happy, romantic Hollywood film, as they clearly haven't seen any of the late writer/director's stark, realistic films. Cassavetes' work relied heavily on tortured, unlikable or unredeemable characters who can act their brains out [quite often portrayed by his wife/widow, Gena Rowlands].<br /><br />We're talking serious fare, folks ~ required viewing such as "Husbands," "Woman Under The Influence," "The Killing of a Chinese Bookie" and "Gloria" [the brilliant Rowlands original, not the adequate Sharon Stone remake].<br /><br />Now comes his former B-movie star & son, Nick, who dusts off papa's script and enlists the type of actors who are eminently qualified to play a group of true undesirables: Sean Penn, Robin Wright Penn, James Gandolfini, Harry Dean Stanton, Debi Mazar and the newly-retalented John Travolta, who appears in the last reel.<br /><br />Even Mom [Rowlands, of course] gets a small but important role.<br /><br />And the adorable Kelsey Mulrooney, playing Penn & Penn's nine-year-old daughter is terrific without stooping to precociousness.<br /><br />Is this a brutally honest film? Yep. Is it vulgar in nearly every way? Of course. Do the leading characters have any chance of redemption, moral or otherwise? Not likely.<br /><br />Do I care?<br /><br />Let's just say that there's more passionate acting in "She's So Lovely" than was evident in nearly every other 1997 film.<br /><br />And that's certainly good enough for me.<br /><br />So there.
