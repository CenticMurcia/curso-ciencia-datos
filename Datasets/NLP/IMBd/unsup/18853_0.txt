You would think by now that those young people would stay the hell off the back roads in Texas. I've traveled them North to South and East to West, and I can assure you that there are things you don't want to see.<br /><br />I don't remember The Devil's Rejects as being as good as this film. Ron Zombie presented a visual and auditory assault on the senses that moved right along and featured an outstanding soundtrack and some of the best special effects I have seen in a horror movie about a family since those rejects in Judge Dredd.<br /><br />Sid Haig was a real hoot as Captain Spaulding. He really added to the movie. Of course, Sheri Moon was fantastic as Baby Firefly.<br /><br />I just can't wait for Halloween.
