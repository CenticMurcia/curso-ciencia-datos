I gave this a rating of 4, and that was being generous.<br /><br />The film starts with a bang. However, it becomes quickly confusing since a man called Frank gets killed towards the beginning of the film, but then either he or some other man named Frank become quite central to the plot, shortly afterwards.<br /><br />Surely they did not have two characters with the same name? I don't know, I never could figure that part out.<br /><br />Anyway, the story, such as it is, revolves around two women. Jayne, who is a "cleaner", who has killed around 20 people or so in her career, and Mom and her teenage son.<br /><br />Mom is a divorcee who apparently gets no child support, and manages her money so poorly she has let her house mortgage build up to over $3,000. She whines about it so much to her sixteen year old son, he feels compelled to do something about the problem.<br /><br />Son is a novice, however, in the criminal world, and ends up losing a big package of cocaine he was delivering.<br /><br />Son's fed up boss comes by that night and shoots out the windows in the house. Mom & son survive by getting down on the floor. This is followed by Mom asking son if he got the license plate number.<br /><br />I would have LOVED to have had the kid reply: "Well, not hardly, Mom, since you had my face pressed to the carpet the entire time."<br /><br />Another cute thing is when they return to the house later in the film, the shot-out windows are completely undamaged! The film has a few of these kinds of little glitches, along with the characters doing things that make you say: Huh? Why would he do that? How would she know that?<br /><br />Eventually Mom, son & Jayne intersect, and are traveling together in a car with hitmen on their trail.<br /><br />I was quite disappointed in the actress playing the hitwoman. She was supposed to be beautiful as well as deadly, but she was very unattractive.<br /><br />It would have been better if the actresses' roles had been reversed as the one playing the Mom was much better looking.<br /><br />
