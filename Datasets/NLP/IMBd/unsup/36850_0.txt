I saw this movie on opening day -- I was convinced by a fellow Science Fiction fanatic to see it. I still believe that it is the worst movie that I have seen (with an actual budget).<br /><br />Every aspect of the movie was bad: the acting, the dialogue, the plot, the pacing, the special effects (don't blame the year...there were plenty of movies that came out in the same year that had decent effects), ...the list goes on. The theater I was in started full, but did not stay that way. I was actually stunned into staying - I couldn't believe it was so bad. When the movie started showing events from another character's point of view, I lost it. I thought, "Not only can you see through the plot, you get to see it twice!" I started laughing uncontrollably, eventually slipping out of my seat onto the floor. I didn't understand how the movie could have gotten any worse, but it had. <br /><br />There are some who would say that you have to go into viewing this movie with an eye for camp. I would agree, except that this movie was marketed as, and had the tone of, a serious Sci-Fi flick. Also, if it wanted to be seen as camp, there should have been something that seemed intentionally humorous or at least intentionally awful (like a good 'B' movie). Barring that, if the movie had been unintentionally funny (like Battlefield Earth), I might have appreciated it a bit. As it was, it was dull, dry and painful to watch. The only entertainment I derived was from thinking about how bad it was.<br /><br />I'm fine with time travel paradoxes, and can even overlook continuity issues; I was not confused at all by the plot. I just believe that this movie was uninspiringly bad.
