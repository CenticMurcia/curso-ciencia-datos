This is a rare film indeed. Not only is it set in Wales but it's also a film born of a passion for the art of film making rather than profit making. The acting was excellent and the black comedy story line was gripping. The dialogue was littered with expletives but I guess that's how they talk out in the Welsh backwaters. The characterisation was inventive, I especially liked the coke dealing bent coppers and the compulsory inclusion of a Welsh quire. I don't remember seeing any sheep though. However it was a big mistake to try and market this film on the back of 'Train spotting' as it could have been marketed more successfully on it's own merits. As a result , most people have had to wait for it's terrestrial UK broadcast to discover this film gem. I'm sure a great deal of interest and debate will now resurrect this film in the rentals and shops. It's also important to note that this is precisely the kind of radical, raw, original, thought provoking material that the American masses are restricted from viewing as they are fed the constant diet of bland, formulated, self-censored, over-glossed, garbage Hollywood usually churns out. I feel their loss.
