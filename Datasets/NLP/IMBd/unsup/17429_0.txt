i watched hundred titles of Asian horror movie. and this is, my best Asian horror movie i've ever see since Noriko's dinner table and a tale of two sisters.<br /><br />this movie totally different than any other Asian horror film, it has no vengeful ghosts lurking around killing people, or haunting people like Shutter or Ju-On.<br /><br />after that, this movie has a deep meaning, philosophical, and totally haunting (yet beautiful). the atmosphere and cinematography were gorgeous and well done.<br /><br />i think this movie was beautiful, haunting, mesmerizing, and i LOVED this movie so much!!!!<br /><br />i don't have any problem with the extremely slow pace of this film. and i've watched this movie more than 35 times (yes, i counted on it). and i still loved it!! overall, i highly recommended this movie, but not for average ghost/slasher horror fans. if you want to see something different, watch this. but if you want anything about vengeful long-haired woman haunting people, you can pick many Thai/Korean/Japan horror flicks (Shutter, Alone, Coming Soon, Ju-On, Chakushin Ari, Arang, Ryeong, etc.)
