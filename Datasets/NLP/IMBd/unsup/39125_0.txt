Several of the previous reviews for this episode remarked, in my opinion, more upon the reviewers love for the series rather then this episode. Well, you won't find a bigger Stargate fan than me, and I absolutely hated this episode. The actors tried to push on through some truly, terrible writing but even SG1 couldn't pull victory from the jaws of this big a loser of a script and concept. To quote Samantha Carter herself, "What's wrong with going out on fishing,". Are you a StarGate fan who hasn't seen this episode yet? Do yourself a favor. Skip it. You'll remember the series more fondly this way. I do look forward to the DVD movies though.
