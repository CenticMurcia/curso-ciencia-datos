wow. I have to say that this movie was the biggest let down in my life. after hearing on websites that this movie was gritty and gory and all this other good stuff, I went to check it out at the rental store. after seeing 2 minutes of this episode I was utterly utterly disappointed and ashamed. the English dub sounds like a cheap 70's porno, the animation looks like a bunch of junior high kids got together some day and drew this crap up, keep in mind that this came out in 93, only 2 years before ghost in the shell. the story , oh my goodness! it makes no sense! from little gray people showing up out of nowhere and with no explanation to what they are, to babies coming out of statues, the only reason I saw the whole thing was hoping that some action scene would save this holy piece of bad anime crap. never ever ever watch urotsukidoji... do yourself a favor and go rent yourself Akira or Mononoke..please
