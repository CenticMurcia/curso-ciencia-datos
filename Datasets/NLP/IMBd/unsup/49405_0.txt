The only place this film can take you is 90 minutes closer to death. A complete waste of TIME. I can't believe anyone gleaned an iota of entertainment value from this boring, dismal, putrid movie. Plodding, plot less, devoid of drama and human interest, there is no excuse to waste the energy even to go to the store and rent it. Avoid at all costs! <br /><br />I didn't care about any of the characters or what happened to them. I found every situation completely implausible--even from a surrealist standpoint. It was maddening to sit through scene after scene of incomprehensible stupidity, waiting for something to happen, only to get to the end and realize NOTHING WAS EVER GOING TO HAPPEN!
