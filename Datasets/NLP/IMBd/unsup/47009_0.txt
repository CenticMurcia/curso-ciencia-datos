Short review on this one. I was very excited by the premise of a film taking a serious look at the 'coined "Big Brother" culture we all live in today, it is a known fact to most people and has become a seemingly accepted part of our lives. Hopefully this film could help me to understand some of the finer or more disturbing facts surrounding this reality.<br /><br />However the films opening scene had me thinking, perhaps I had the wrong film, maybe this was "Girls Gone Wild: Changing Rooms of the Midwest" and not a serious look at anything. Apart of course from the blonde's a**hole, which the brunette analyses kindly as she herself is considering anal bleaching, they then proceed to dry hump each other against the changing room door... it was at this point I was compelled to look away, for good.
