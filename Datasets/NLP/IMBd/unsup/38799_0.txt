Mediocre zero budget wannabe grindhouse horror flick, written by none other than Ted Mikels and Arch "Eegah!" Hall, about cat food manufacturers over acting outrageously and using human cadavers as the secret ingredient in the most popular cat food in town, and thus creating a horde of (or at least one or two) bloodthirsty kitties. The cat food makers are employing a guy who looks like the guy from "The Hills Have Eyes" to even raid graveyards for more people to run through the "grinding machine", until a woman's body turns up in a local doctor's office after being attacked and killed by one of said kitties (why did they take an already dead woman to a doctor?) then the doc and his nurse start poking around the cat food maker's building, and find out what his secret ingredient really is.<br /><br />If you watch this in the right frame of mind it may be worth a single viewing, just to have some laughs from the horrendous acting by Landau and his assistant, and several scenes of people being put into the plastic grinding machine and raw hamburg coming out of the other end - but this movie's pacing drags on forever and it's brief one hour running time seems much longer than it actually is.<br /><br />** out of ****
