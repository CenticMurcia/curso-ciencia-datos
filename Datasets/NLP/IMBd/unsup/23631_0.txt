I love this film and I can't understand why it hasn't been more popular. Try and get hold of a copy if you can. <br /><br />The cast is amazing - Joe Mantegna, John Malkovic, Linda Fiorentino, Jamie Lee Curtis ( in her best ever role), and Kevin Bacon all giving restrained but emotional performances. <br /><br />The soundtrack is wonderful too. An eclectic mix of songs that work perfectly. It took me a long time to track down the song from the closing credits but it was worth it.<br /><br />It's one of those films that you can watch if you're feeling a bit down and it will lift your mood. Especially recommended if you've had a pointless argument with a loved one!
