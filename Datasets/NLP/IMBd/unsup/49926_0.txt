This must be one of the worst films I have ever seen! There is no beginning, no story, and no end! What on earth went through Nicole Heesters mind when she accepted that part, is beyond me. An otherwise brilliant actress has her biggest - an until now only - genuine fiasco.<br /><br />If it shows anything, it's the mess in Fassbinders mind near the end of his life. So many clich√©'s, I'm surprised I watched it 'till the end. I suppose that's because of the clothes, which is an interesting study of the extremes of the time. I suppose you could also see inspector Jansen as a parody, which might make it a bit more bearable, but the storyline is still too thin to make it worth while.
