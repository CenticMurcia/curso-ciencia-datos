-- crap I've seen, why oh why did I have to watch -let alone purchase- THE TERROR WITHIN!? I'm a sucker for Corman, but man did he have a downturn in the '80s between this and HORROR PLANET! Yeah, the effects are all alright, and they didn't kill the dog (Yay!) but GOD this thing blew chunks-o-clich√©. It's like paint by numbers with a plot, and hey... the guy's black, so guess how long he lives? Go on, guess? I can only hope the ingeniously named sequel set things right. Ha!<br /><br />On the Roger Corman timeline, this is right after he got done using 'big' budgets (for BATTLE BEYOND...) and right before he started cannibalizing his own stuff for footage (BATTLE BEYOND... okay, so 'during' the period when he was ripping himself off, but I was thinking of RAPTOR), and the end result is something neither good nor interesting.
