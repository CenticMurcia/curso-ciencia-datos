This movie is one of the most amazing I ever see. I didn't expect so much from it and I was really surprised by that movie, which is totally different from what we usually in american cinema. Here we are with the story of these men, Chad and Howard who have to spend 6 weeks far from their home sent there by their "firm". They decide to have a revenge on women and will both seduce one, they will expect her to fall in love with one of them and they will give her up. We spend our time asking why they really decide to do that, do they really want to hurt someone like that for such reasons ? we try to find a concrete reason to their evilness, but we can't, we want to leave our seat because that's too disturbing but the questions we're asking ourselves can't let us leave it. The conclusion is very hard, but we've got there a reflection about power in general, not only about men and women,about those who have power (like Chad and Howard) and those who don't have the sanme power (Christine and Kif). we're also amazed to see this kind of men, the white collars, be shown that way while they usually are shown as example for the american dream of the individualism and economical liberalism. I told many people to watch it, they all liked it, I even watched it with a feminist, who loved it, but it provides you a big big headache. That's a movie which dares to show things. Neil LaBute is a director to follow.
