An unbelievable cast! I have been wanting to see this movie again ever since I first saw it in college, 30 years ago. The video clip reminded me that the movie is just as good as I remember!<br /><br />McPhisto, played by Richard Burton, reminds me of my old Psych Professor, Don Whaley, who taught a WMU and North Texas State. In many ways Whaley was McPhisto!<br /><br />So if anyone out there reading this ever knew Whaley, email me.<br /><br />I believe I read it's a limited release so it's sure to be a classic collectors item.
