When I first saw this movie at the video store, I thought, wow cool bunch of monks kill vampires. But this was just plain awful. Bad directing, bad effects and the worst script in the world. You would think that the fighting scenes would be good but... no. I must say if your even thinking about watching this movie, your already doing the bad thing. Trust me, this isn't worth paying for, and even if they paid you to watch it please don't, you'll thank me later.
