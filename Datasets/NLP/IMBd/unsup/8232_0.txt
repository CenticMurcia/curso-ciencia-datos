As a long time aficionado of psychological horror and spooky movies, I was immensely impressed by this little Aussie flick. Most "scary" movies these days simply aren't, and many Aussie films struggle to have the production qualities of our overseas competitors.<br /><br />Well, this film absolutely blew my expectations away in both regards. It is a beautifully crafted film - from the subtle yet convincing acting, to the magnificent cinematography, to the haunting sound scape, this is one of the slickest budget films I've been privileged to view.<br /><br />As for the scares... wow. Just... wow. I'm not going to talk about what happens, but the plot always keeps you guessing, and is paced superbly. It's honestly one of the best scary flicks I've seen in years, and now ranks alongside Session 9 as one of my all time faves.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
