An interesting biopic of groundbreaking comic Lenny Bruce with Dustin Hoffman as Lenny and Valerie Perrine as his stripper wife. The movie suffers from one problem: Dustin Hoffman isn't funny. Eddie Izzard playing the same role on stage in London was so funny doing old Lenny Bruce material, I was crying. For that matter, Lenny Bruce himself was hilarious as I discovered in the 2-cd set of his 1961 concert at Carnegie Hall. Although Hoffman does what seems to be a spot-on imitation of Bruce, he never finds the essential relationship with the stand-up material. Without the laughs, the movie fails its goal of showing why Lenny Bruce was such an important figure in American culture. Still, Valerie Perrine has never been more naked. 5 out of 10.
