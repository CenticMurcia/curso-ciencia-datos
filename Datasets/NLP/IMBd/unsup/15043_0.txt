After you've watched The Love Bug, you will notice 2 things: <br /><br />1) You will not be able to get that infectious calypso tune out of your head for at least a week and will be whistling it everywhere you go! <br /><br />2) You will want to rush out and hug the nearest VW Beetle! And when you see one, you will no longer just see a car - you will see Herbie! You will see Herbie's personality spring to life right in front of you! You will see the headlamps as eyes and the wing mirrors as ears...<br /><br />This lovely film is a timeless classic, packed with cute moments, great music, and fantastically funny lines !! Script-wise, it is definitely the best of all the Herbie movies. One criticism I have of the later movies is that I would like to have seen Herbie stay with his original owner Jim Douglas, and follow his adventures with that family rather than see him owned by lots of different people - partly because Jim, Tennessee and Carol are great owners for Herbie, but also because how does the poor little car feel being passed from owner to owner?! If Herbie was mine I would keep him and never sell him!!
