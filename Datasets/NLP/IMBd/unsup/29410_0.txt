Let me first say that I have noted the many favorable comments here but as far as I'm concerned, to quote Fawlty Towers' outboard motor salesman: "This Wine Is Corked". Most definitely.<br /><br />Last of the Summer Wine recently made it's appearance in my local TV viewing area. Accordingly, I have been watching episodes for some weeks, all the while entertaining high hopes that the humor would commence. Not a chance. Not one laugh to date.<br /><br />I have asked myself: Can this be due to a generation gap? No. I am of the same age as the actors. Well then, can it be that it is a certain kind of fare that appeals strictly to the British alone? Well, I cannot say for certain. What I do know is that I find Keeping Up Appearances, Ab Fab, Fawlty Towers, Waiting For God and Are You Being Served? absolutely hilarious (superior, in fact, to anything produced here in the U.S). I have viewed the same episodes of these shows repeatedly and never tire of them. In fact, I doubt that this day will ever come.<br /><br />Now having spoken my piece I think it only fair to end on a positive note. The Holmfirth countryside is absolutely enchanting.
