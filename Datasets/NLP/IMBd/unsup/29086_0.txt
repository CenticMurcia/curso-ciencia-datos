I'm glad I ventured forth on a wind-swept night (while the trains weren't running no less) to see this movie. I always found "Macbeth" to be one of Shakespeare's funniest plays and I'm glad that this filmmaker does as well. After adjusting to the American accents (which add to the humour, because the "Scottish Play" is never actually performed with the appropriate burr anyway), I settled in for an enjoyable 90 minutes of sight gags, over-the-top characters, and word-play that was reminiscent of some of our better television programmes. One wonders if the writer is a fan of Ben Elton or Tom Stoppard (or both?). What Monty Python did for Jesus in "Life of Brian" this film does for Macbeth. Is nothing sacred? Thankfully not.
