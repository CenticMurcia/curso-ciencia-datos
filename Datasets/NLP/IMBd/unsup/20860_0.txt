Firstly let me start by saying that my vote of 7 is based on all 3 Series of the show. If I was voting for series 1 and 2 it would be a 10 but for Series 3, it would be 2.<br /><br />Little Britain as im sure many of you know started out on Radio where it had two very successful series. Then it made the switch to TV. The Little Britain Pilot was shown on the launch night of BBC3 and I was hooked straight away.<br /><br />Series One launched it to a wider audience on BBC3 and then BBC2. It was great. So funny, original with so many laugh out loud moments you couldn't count them.<br /><br />Series Two was even better. Everything was neater and Lucas and Walliams had obviously got to grips with the characters they were writing for. The old faves were all there, Vicky Pollard, Emily Howard, Daffyd et all but some new ones were easily a match for these veterans. Bubbles, Florence, Judy and Maggie were all great and simply were the icing on the cake.<br /><br />No this is where I turn nasty. Series 3 was very disappointing. Not nearly as funny as the first two and to be honest everything was a bit samey ans stail at this point. New characters were poorly constructed. Mrs Emery was simply a 2nd Maggie except it came out of the other end, Desere was a disaster simply because Bubbles was fine on her own and Sid Pegg was simply offensive and totally unfunny. It was left to the veterans to save the day, Daffyd, Vicky and Lou and Andy were the one saving grace for this series. The other thing I really disliked about LB3 was Lucas' and Walliams' apparent need to be in each other sketches all the time. We hardly saw the supporting cast because Matt and David were in everything. Although its their show, one of LB strengths was the supporting cast but sadly in Series 3 apart from the odd sketch (Like FatFighters) we never got to see them.<br /><br />With a approaching Christmas Special which is supposed to tie up the ends for many Characters, we may soon be saying goodbye to Little Britain this may not be a bad thing however as its best to go out on top and if it continued, I believe it would start to flounder as if Series 3 is anything to go by, the ideas is simply not there.<br /><br />So to sum up, Series' 1 and 2, simply floorless with some of the best and funniest comedy I have ever seen, Series 3 - Poor and if not for the old characters, simply a disaster! Roll on the Christmas Special!
