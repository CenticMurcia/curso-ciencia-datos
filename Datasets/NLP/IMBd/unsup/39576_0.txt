The movie is totally pathetic. The plot is just ridiculous, with very poor selection of "funny" scenes, including some totally displaced "sexy scenes". America is not the greatest place to live, and americans are not the smartest nation on this globe, and this movie is just another proof. I regret having spent $5.69 Canadian to watch another stupid movie about american "heroes". I am completely astonished at how stupid movies have become from our southern neighbours. I really feel compelled to start watching any movie but american.
