"Still of the night" is indeed a very silent and dark movie. A few remarks : 1) The characters move from from strange places (an auction room's warehouse, an isolated laundromat) to even stranger places (a tunnel in Central Park, a ghostly villa on a cliff). 2) The significant events only happen at night. 3) The main characters seem totally unable to communicate one with another. 4) They all seem to hide shameful psychological cracks. For all these reasons, I would say that SOTN is an impressionist movie: apart from the finale, all is suggested, more than described.<br /><br />In a way, SOTN is also a fetichist movie. The real heroes are the objects; the characters are their slaves. If you think I'm going too far, watch the scene in which Meryl Streep holds the vase in her hands.<br /><br />Of course, SOTN is a tribute to Hitchcock: for instance, the villa is an obvious reminiscence of "Psycho". But it is intelligently done and contains enough twists to help you forget that (yes) it's been done before.<br /><br />8/10.
