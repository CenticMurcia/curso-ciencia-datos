I am reminded of this serious 1972 TV movie as a result of the newly released film, Brokeback Mountain. I was only 18 at the time, but the Holbrook/Sheen/Lange movie stayed with me for all these years. I think I still have a crush on Martin Sheen in his turtleneck sweater. All three leads in the movie did an excellent job. The movie seemed so serious and rather dark at the time. I just wish we could have talked more about the subject matter back then. It was one of those TV movies that just "disappeared" from site or discussion group comments. (Thank goodness for VHS and DVDs!) I am not aware of any reruns of this movie...ever. I'm sure someone will use it in a documentary some day.
