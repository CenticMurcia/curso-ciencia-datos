It's always interesting to meet people just passing through Thailand doing a documentary. Their conclusions are almost always wrong and their evidence is almost always suspect at best.<br /><br />As one who has lived and worked in Thailand I can tell you that any documentary that does not include a LONG HARDlook at the role of the Police, the Politicians, and the King is leaving out the primary motivation for Thai prostitution in the first place.<br /><br />Without the Top-Down Hierarchy in Thailand essentially Stealing the money via the Banking systems (the same way it is now being done in the US)Thai people would be some of the richest in the world.<br /><br />So any slice of life documentary like this one, fails completely because Thailand is like an onion (or an Ogre), it has many layers, and some of those layers can't be exposed without brining tears to your eyes...
