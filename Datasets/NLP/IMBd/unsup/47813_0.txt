Ususally directors make a film out of a good story. This is not the case. Charlie's Angels 2 is just a money making film. A movie made with no good ideas which seems full of improvisations.<br /><br />The only purpose of the film is to show 3 good looking girls wearing little clothing and beating up the most toughest man in the world.<br /><br />It's a B Class movie without any shadow of doubt. Directors! wake up! Don't waste your talent (if you've got any), money and time making this piece of s***.<br /><br />My advise: it's not worth your money and your time. You better off watching TV adverts.
