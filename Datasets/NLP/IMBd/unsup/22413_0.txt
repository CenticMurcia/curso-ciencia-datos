My god, I must say I've never really been compelled to write comments about a TV show, but.....after seeing this hideous shite vomiting out of the C.R.T, how could I not. These young children are some of the most disgusting examples of whats wrong with the world today. Also unfortunately for the population of USA it's this type of behaviour that gives the country such a bad name in basically the rest of the entire world. While dozens of poor little Cambodian children are chasing after anyone with a $1 NOTE to sell dozens of postcards to so they can afford another day of school, these unlicensed brats are whinging about the brand new "SUV" they received. Only cheering up when the even newer "Spider" sports-car arrives 10 minutes later with their diamond-encrusted Rolex. The biggest problem though has got to be with the parents. How can they let their children turn into such pampered little bastards who believe anything and everything is their god-given right. One of the biggest problems though, is that this isn't the only show that makes the yanks look like a bunch of idiots, Laguna Beach, Rich Girls, The Hills + countless other reality TV. Luckily I've been to the US several times and know that this isn't the real world there. Generally everyone I've met were great people, very friendly and not obnoxious fools. And, the amount of poverty and poor people is quite alarming contrary to what you see on these television programmes. But, it looks like it's MTV's mission to make Americans look like the most annoying, dumbest people on the planet!
