Robot Chicken is simply hilarious.The show is written by Seth Green, who I didn't really find funny as an actor, but as a writer, he is simply hilarious.This show is almost as funny as family guy.Like family guy, it has plenty of pop culture references.It is much more raunchier and f-ed up than family guy was.The show is 15min long(two episodes a night play on Teletoon) and basically involves a series of short stop-motion skits.Some are simply hilarious, the others are just plain random.There have been very few bad ones.If you like shows in the vein of Family Guy, you will love Robot CHicken!<br /><br />10/10
