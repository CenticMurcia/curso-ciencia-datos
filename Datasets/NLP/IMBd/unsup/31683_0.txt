This is an excellent family film with very little violence and questionable language. Our kids loved the film... and we did as well. Emma Thompson does a splendid job with giving depth to a character as Nanny McPhee. This movie could have gone wrong, but instead the movie was fun, with high energy and leaves you with a great moral lesson (especially to kids). Also, good to see a movie set in England with all English actors. The movie has the same feel as Mary Poppins, but with cinematography that matches todays standards. It is definitely worth to see in theatres. Word of advise: The fathers occupation in the film is a mortician. If your child is very sensitive to death I would recommend them not to see this film.
