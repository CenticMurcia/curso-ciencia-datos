I have to admit, the movie trailers leading up to this movie had me, and a few others hook line and sinker for what seemed like a fairly comical movie that was full of classic Walkenism. Unfortunately, those strategically cut previews were the ONLY good parts of the movie which weren't even nearly as good when shown in the uncut full length movie. The script itself was lacking severely and even with a poor script, the acting couldn't deliver an even halfway mediocre attempt at what would have made it a halfway decent movie to watch while intoxicated with this being the only movie showing within a 500 mile radius. <br /><br />I honestly did not think that it was possible to make a movie this bad, and it was actually WORSE than the worst movie I had ever seen prior to this, which I lovingly declare- "Without a Paddle". In fact, the ONLY way "Balls of Fury" could have been worse is if someone was standing outside the doorway to punch you in the face on the way out of the theater. The only positive this film had was that Maggie, the daughter of the over-exaggerated ping pong master Wong, was fairly cute.... but why waste 10.50 to see her for a few shots when there's google images?<br /><br />Verdict-<br /><br />Save your $10.50 and put it towards something that is time better spent... like paying someone to punch you in the face to remove any suspicion you may have had regarding whether or not this movie was worth going to, or actually any good at all. AVOID IT!<br /><br />Oh, yea, and their Scarface homages were feeble at best, and practically an insult to one of the best movies of all time coming from the worst movie of all time.
