I looked at the box and saw a sexy glamorous woman with a gun and thought she was going to go around shooting people and that the "unexpected plot twists" meant something like Pulp Fiction. This is not so -- this movie is mostly about a bizarre friendship and a bizarre romance with some nasty violent scenes thrown in. I found it mostly slow and occasionally creepy (watch out for the Irish Terrorists), and I think that in dividing itself between the male bonding and the love story it failed to make either part very compelling.
