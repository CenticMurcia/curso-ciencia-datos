This is my first review on IMDb as a side-note.<br /><br />Mulberry Street circles around a somewhat worn out theme regarding people deprived of the basics. Fair as some may say, several other directors have approached the matter increasingly (and) specially since the acclaimed '28 days later' by Danny Boyle and Zack Snyder's remake of 'Dawn of the dead'.<br /><br />It may be a bit inappropriate to place all of them on the same step however, there are common aspects which i consider important - the scripting, final plot and directing. Jim Mickle's approach strikes me as a very mature use of directing skills and resources to convey a heavy and raw presentation of gruesomeness.<br /><br />On a final note, there is a conscious developing social reality theme throughout the movie. It helps to build the story line and consolidate the unravelling of the characters, each of which short of being shallow or even forsaken by Mickle and Nick Damici.<br /><br />A definite must for those who appreciate more mature approaches to thriller and horror sub-genres.
