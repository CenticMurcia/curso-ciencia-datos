I like Little Britain very much indeed. I think that David Walliams and Matt Lucas are geniuses. They can get into the mind of so many creatures and almost be exactly like them.<br /><br />I especially like the character Vicky Pollard, her role is so perfectly written and when Matt plays Vicky he brings a certain credibility to the role. I am also a big fan of Lou and Andy. David and Matt are just so sincere when the play them. I also fancy Ann (played by David), but that is manly because she's so funny.<br /><br />I think that I've put enough effort to this so my final words are: GO LITTLE Britain!
