I bought this terrible flick suspecting it was a grade C movie, but might be good for a laugh or two.<br /><br />I was surprised, it was a D movie and full of stupid remarks, forgettable characters, a plot that had an intelligent person written the screen play, might have worked.<br /><br />How such worthless trashy flicks get the bucks to be produced, much less consumed by what must be children and adults with learning disabilities, I don't know.<br /><br />The lack of imagination in how the invaders invade is depressing. They're all humans who have been killed, but somehow their bodies taken over by the invaders. I was unable to waste enough time to see this thing to its end.<br /><br />Other commenters may help here.
