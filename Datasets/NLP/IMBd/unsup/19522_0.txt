A shoddily directed and poorly written knockoff of pretty much every other fighting tournament movie-- except, as bad as other movies of this genre are, at least they pull off the formula. The training sequence, a staple of the "fighting tournament" B-movie, is a perfect microcosm of how the movie is as a whole; shabby, questionable in logic and technique, sparse in action and intelligence, heavy on clich√©s, and despite the possible enjoyment one could get from how bad it is, simply uninteresting. Many unnecessary scenes, absolutely terrible dialogue, and wafer-thin characters played by uninterested actors who stumble through half-improvised dialogue make this "movie" a complete waste of time.
