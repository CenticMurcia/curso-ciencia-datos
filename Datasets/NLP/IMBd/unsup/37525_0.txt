Willie Stargell was the last card he needed for what set? He had a place for the card in a scrapbook with cards from 1953!?? The space for Stargell in the book wasn't large enough for a 1971 Stargell super card. Why in the 7th game of the series do all the Detroit fans cheer when Pittsburgh wins? Why in two different games when the visitors are up the scorekeeper changes the home team's score? Why would the owners of a tobacco company live in Pittsburgh? Especially, right across the street from the Hentons. Mandy said she regretted leaving Honus, but never mentions her husband, Mr Young. (Unless she just changed her name to prevent Honus from finding her, still in Pittsburgh. I don't even think Piedmont was a person's name. I believe it is a region in South Carolina, but I understand this was just done for dramatic purposes. Why would anyone think an autographed T206 Wagner is worth more than an unautographed card? It's not mint anymore. Why did it look like the card was signed in ink when Wagner asked to borrow a pencil? The kid never stops him to tell him to use a pen. Why put a $400,000 card in your pocket, pass it around to everyone, and tap it against your head? Why didn't he buy something to protect it when he was at the card dealer? Also the card seemed a little off center which would ruin the 'mint' appraisal. Why wasn't he more upset when Wagner threw the cards in the fire. Joe could have kicked the fire out and saved the cards, enabling him to go back to 1985 and give back the one card to her, while still have plenty for himself. How could Honus throw the cards in the fire knowing how important they were to Joe? Lastly; how could Joe go back to 1985 and explain to the card dealer that the card he showed him before now is autographed. (This would probably drop the value of the card to about $100,000.)
