The book was great. I realize that rarely does a movie cover a book well, but this was absolutely ridiculous! Half the scenes in the movie were completely fabricated from the screenwriter's imagination, and bore no resemblance to the events portrayed in the book. Furthermore, the casting was awful. Willem DaFoe as Clark? Give me a break! DaFoe is a great actor, but horribly miscast here. All in all, it was disgraceful. Even as a stand-alone movie, it stunk.
