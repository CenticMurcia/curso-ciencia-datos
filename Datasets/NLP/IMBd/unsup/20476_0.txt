In my opinion, its a movie you can watch over and over and still over again and still get the same emotional impact every time. This movie is just that. A feel good movie that compares big city life to Mayberry-type charm and innocence. Great characterizations and casting. In regards to the movie,I find myself reflecting back in my own past life living in a small city where everyone knows everyone. One of my favorites scenes is the the scene where Ben Stone has left Grady and is in Hollywood. He finds himself actually missing all of intimacies of Grady. One evening, He calls the Grady city phone number and gets a recording of a gal(Bridget Fonda) who has this peaceful southern Grady-draw accent as he is overlooking the busy Hollywood skyline. I think it is a this point, he decides he wants go back to Grady.
