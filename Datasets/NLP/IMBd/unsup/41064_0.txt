Nathan Fillion is a good lead and he is most of the reason that you will stay watching! The plot however is really bad! At first I thought it would give a spin to the original and would dazzle us! But in stead we get nothing! There are a lot of moments that suppose to scare us. To be honest these scares did nothing to me! I expected them so I didn't jump up like I was meant to! The whole plot is uninspired and boring! To say that this sequel is better than the original is not something I agree on! The original wasn't a very good movie either but at least it contained more surprises than this one! I also think that the first movie was more creepier! The use of special effects was very minimal and more effective! "White Noise 2" has to much special effects and kills the ambiance this movie desperately needs! Compared to other similar horror movies that came out this year "White Noise 2" is a major letdown! Miss this one!
