This movie will get its share of awful votes. Some will be disappointed Adam Sandler fans. This is not your normal Adam Sandler! A few will be disappointed in the way over the top performance of Tea Leone.<br /><br />My problem is with the writers. This is the least entertaining screenplay I have ever seen. It may be making a bunch of social statements but I do not find them entertaining. Worst of all every improbable piece of every slowly developing story line just never plays out to any reasonable conclusion. I found my self so dis-satisfied that after the movie stops (it has no ending per se, it just stops), I walk out trying to write my own fairale stopend to Spanglish, a comdram I could have done without! I got it - illegal immigrant gets Bachelor's from Princeton, Master's from Yale and PhD from Harvard, becomes President of the US. She changes law so that Sandler's character can marry her mother while still married to his own wife.<br /><br />This movie should be rated D for Dumbest Sandler effort to date.
