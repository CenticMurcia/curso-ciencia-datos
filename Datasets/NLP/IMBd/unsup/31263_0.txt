I read positive reviews of this movie before heading to a Boulder video store and grabbing it off the shelf. I was extremely happy I did so as I haven't laughed this hard in quite some time! I was literally in stitches about 1/3rd of the way into the movie. I really can't remember the last time I laughed so hard while watching a film! <br /><br />Question Mark is also one of most interesting and original movies I've ever seen. The first thing you'll notice are the unique dialogues between West, Art and the other major characters of the film, but especially between West & Art (the main 2 characters). This movie is truly memorable. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for something beyond the usual Hollywood crap, although the language may turn some people off. It's a refreshing blend of genres, something like Dark Comedy, Drama, mixed with a little Action. Highly quotable, hilarious, and very entertaining. It was a blast!!
