Although a few people have pointed out this was a 70's TV show in the UK, this is not a spin off movie. It's actually an abridged version of the show, cleverly edited into a movie. The fact that nobody has noticed that (even the people who remember the show) just proves the editor has done a very good job.<br /><br />As others have pointed out, if you remember watching this on TV then this is an excellent piece of nostalgia. Even if you never seen it first time its still an enjoyable watch, but just remember it was shot on a 70's TV show budget (a UK one at that) so its not a major production. Although in my opinion it just adds to its gritty charm.
