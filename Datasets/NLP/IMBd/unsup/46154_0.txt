"Telegrafisten" is one of the worst movies that I`ve ever seen and this is how Norwegian movies mostly are: pis# poor! The movie is based on a poor book, has a poor script, bad directing, terrible actors and a totally uninteresting story taking place on a small island in the northern part of Norway. We were forced to watch this crap at school last year, and I recommend all of you to steer clear of this guff.<br /><br />0,5/10<br /><br />
