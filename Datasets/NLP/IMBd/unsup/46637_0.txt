This is undoubtedly the most tedious film that I've seen all year. It is the sort of film that gives 'art house' films a bad name.<br /><br />The acting is wooden throughout though worse than usual as it appears as if all the actors have been heavily doped with some sedative the slow, deliberate way they ponderously shuffle about. The dialogue is wholly unconvincing but, sadly, only occasionally risibly so.<br /><br />There were a couple of highlights. In one scene there's an interestingly designed basket of lemons hanging on the wall - I had time to commit to memory and it might work well as a wire basket. There are also numerous scenes of somebody playing billiards with himself (no, not pocket billiards!) on a real billiard table. You don't see many of those about these days.<br /><br />They don't seem to have been clear about what language the film was supposed to be spoken in. It mainly has rhotic 'r's, but not always. It is beyond me why, when they were supposed to be French, they didn't just hire real French actors and actresses - even if they then tried to speak English it would have been more authentic sounding. It would have been better in the original language with sub-titles.<br /><br />The garden looked just like you'd expect a hastily prepared film-set garden to look - quite unconvincing.<br /><br />The beard continuity is all over the place. The lead robot grows several beards that all look different.<br /><br />On top of all these failings, it is nastily, gooilly sickly- sentimental. Mawkishness drives almost every scene.<br /><br />I wish somebody had told me to avoid this film. See it only if you want a kip.<br /><br />Somebody must have bribed somebody a vast amount not to have this sent straight to DVD.<br /><br />Amazingly the director also directed 'The Red Violin', a first rate film in almost every way - he must have been drinking himself into a coma every day since then or had a nasty accident that damaged his brain. <br /><br />Do not be misled by the comments suggesting that this is artistic or worth watching!
