I have to agree with giveitsomeblonde. This show is just terrible in every way.<br /><br />It's insane to think that we live in a world that tries to idolize stuck-up, snobby little brats like these. Even if the point is to show people just how obnoxious these kids are, they're still doing nothing but raising up their pedestal higher.<br /><br />The show contains nothing but 'teeny-drama'. Little kids screaming and cursing at their parents for booking Ciara instead of Janet Jackson. Yelling at directors to 'get to work'. Telling the 'ugly' people that they aren't allowed to come to their party. It's just disgusting. MTv has really let us all down by showing this atrocious children get their way.<br /><br />If you haven't watched it yet, save yourself some time. Every episode is the same, all these brats are the same.... Worthless. I would have certainly given it a 0 if I could have.<br /><br />-Touche'
