I'm not a writer and probably wouldn't know the difference between a great or not-so-great story, but as one of the many baby boomers who has seen every episode of Star Trek - The Original Series, I feel "The Man Trap" is one of the best written. There were so many little sub- scenes that were out of character with most of the episodes that followed. For example, when Yeoman Rand brings lunch to Mr. Sulu, or when Capt. Kirk is eating a snack while on the bridge conducting a search, or when Uhuru is trying to make small-talk with Mr. Spock while he's at the helm. This was all great for character development, but I really missed this type of "not part of the plot" interplay in the episodes that followed. Also, the message of the right to survive vs. extinction was nicely done. I've made it a point to check-out some of George Clayton Johnson's other work . . . his Twilight Zone episodes in particular.
