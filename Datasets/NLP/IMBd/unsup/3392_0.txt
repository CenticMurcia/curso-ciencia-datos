This was a very well written film about two young and quite brilliant children. They have a frantic mother and a somewhat aloof father. But the story ties them together well. If you are expecting this to be a simple film for the young,you will be disappointed. My children loved it. The mathematics and science are brilliantly weaved into this story of everything good and pure about us, or rather, what could be. E.T. for a new generation? It really could be. I have seen where some have said that children might be a bit bored with this movie. The theater I was in wasn't full of bored children. The children I saw were on the edge of their seats; as was I.
