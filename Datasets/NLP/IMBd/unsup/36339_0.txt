Georgia (Nia Vardalos) is an American living in Greece and working as a tour guide. She hates her job, thinks all tourists are idiots, and is sick of Greece, too. But on her next four-day trip everything will change for the better, thanks to the quirky members of her tour and her moody bus driver.<br /><br />This movie had so much potential but is really terrible. It's neither funny nor romantic and the dopey cast is always blocking our view of beautiful Greece. The plot is a lackluster rip-off of the very funny "If It's Tuesday, This Must Be Belgium" but lacks its charm and good script. Vardalos' self-deprecating character that was so witty in "My Big Fat Greek Wedding" is just tedious here, making her transformation at the end ridiculously far-fetched. The tourists are have corny one-dimensional personalities and are uniformly over-the-top. Veteran actor Richard Dreyfuss plays the stereotypical saintly old man who turns Georgia's life around by urging her to find her "spirit." I was fascinated that he looked so much like Eli Wallach but he was such a know-it-all that I couldn't stand him. Rachel Dratch is also extremely grating as a fellow passenger on the Bus of Fools and there's nothing appealing about Alexis Georgoulis who plays the object of Georgia's affection. The plot is so predictable, it's insulting.<br /><br />Stick with "If It's Tuesday" for a genuinely funny look at the trials of the guided bus tour. I gave the movie two stars for the lovely scenery.
