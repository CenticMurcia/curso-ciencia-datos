I had the opportunity to see this and meet the director at the New Orleans Film Festival. Of all the movies shown which ranged from documentary, sci-fi, drama, romance and comedy this one really stood out for me. The style and cinematography were incredible. The story is witty and will make you rethink your views of the social scene and even love. It is the stories great concept that really challenged me to look at things differently. I won't give away any of the story. It's something you just have to experience to fully appreciate the work and talent put into this. David Drach brings a unique and interesting flavor that has been void in many movies today back to the big screen. I can't wait to see what's next for David Drach.
