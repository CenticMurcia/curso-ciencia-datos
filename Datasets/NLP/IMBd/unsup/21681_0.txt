"The Galileo Seven" has always been one of my favorite Star Trek episodes. I know "City on the Edge of Forever" is the one show often cited as the best Star Trek episode, but I think "Galileo Seven" is almost as good. It is an interesting show because it reverses the series' formula in an interesting manner. In most Star Trek adventures, Spock serves as a harsh critic of human behavior. But in this episode, we get a chance to examine Spock's logic and see how effective (and practical) the Vulcan's ideology really is under pressure. I did think the story goes a little overboard in demonstrating the differences between the emotional humans and the cold Vulcan. However, the episode does make more than a few interesting observations on how leaders must use their intellect and heart in order to make sensible decisions. I have no doubts that this is indeed one of the show's best offerings. Highly recommended.
