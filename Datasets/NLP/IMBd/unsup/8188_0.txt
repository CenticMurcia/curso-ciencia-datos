Yes, Jason Mewes. He practically brings the whole movie together along with Kevin Smith. They kinda add the funniness to the movie. What can I say? They're Jay and Silent Bob, they have to be funny. This has to be one of my favorite movies definitely, considering the fact that I am a teenager and enjoy movies like this. I also like the fact that it takes place in a mall, considering I am a shopaholic and go to the mall every week.Good job Kevin.
