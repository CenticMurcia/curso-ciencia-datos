A ridiculous portrayal of Navy SEAL selection and training.<br /><br />SEALs-to-be go through such a rigorous training that it seems hardly likely that Del Piso would have sufficient energy after daily training to pursue any woman let alone the captain's wife. <br /><br />Also odd that Del Piso disappears for hours on end to meet with Michelle without being missed. Where does he find the time? And when his team mates are let-down you'd think they'd come down hard for his lack of commitment to the team. <br /><br />And what is with the civilians strolling through the training exercises?<br /><br />"Hell Week" seemed like a cake walk compared to what I've be told and read. This can't be anywhere near a realistic representation - if it's no tougher than this I could be a SEAL . . . NOT!<br /><br />The bottom line is that there are more entertaining love stories (An Officer and a Gentleman) and more realistic movies about military training (Navy SEALs: BUDS Class 234) - watch one of these instead.<br /><br />Footnote: One excellent shark attack moment at about 77 min into the movie - brief but truly effective.
