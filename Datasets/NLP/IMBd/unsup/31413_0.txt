This movie has absolutely no direction. The film is obviously trying to connect with a nihilistic generation. It should be so lucky. At least nihilism has an ethos, albeit a simple one: nothing. The Doom Generation can't even live up to that. A muddled hodge podge of perverted sexuality and half-assed attempts at dark humor, this film is like a man in a darkened gas-station bathroom, randomly spraying pure waste until he hears the sound of a resonate splash. Maybe Suburbia is a good stab at explaining a lost generation. Tarantino has written four incredible films rich with gunplay and dark humor. Watch one of those. But The Doom Generation is quite simply an abomination.
