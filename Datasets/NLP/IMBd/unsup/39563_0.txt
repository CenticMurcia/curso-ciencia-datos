I can't tell you much more than this: this film looks as if it has been written by a league of film students who graduated through online courses, the soundtrack has been composed/chosen by a bunch of supermarket execs, and the director's biggest merit so far has been a shampoo commercial.<br /><br />I do not know what made me rent this film, but I do regret it. A film that's been advertised with names like 50 Cent, Jessica Biel, Christina Ricci, and - above all - the almighty Samuel L. Jackson - does give you the tickles this must be a hoax. And it is. I am sorry, I have a loss for words, but HoTB reaches comical levels on almost every scene, it is just a pain to watch for a cinema lover. Then again, we DO need this kind of horrible mistakes to make us love the art more.<br /><br />I would gladly label this as pro-patriot, pro-USA, pro-war, anti-intelligent, if there just was enough substance in here to put my finger on. Unfortunately there isn't, so I will just call it another wasted 100 minutes in life, a complete failure & misery and... exactly therefore, a possible future slapstick classic for the history/art classes all over the globe.
