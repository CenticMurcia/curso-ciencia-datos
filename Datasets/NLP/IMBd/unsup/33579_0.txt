This movie is disgusting, and yet, tries to be funny.<br /><br />I hated the kissing scenes, and Preity Zinta use to be my favourite actress but not now, after watching this movie!! This movie had no story and failed to get my interest! Yash Raj films are going down. Bunty aur bubily was rubbish and so was Salaam namaste. Neal n nikki was just as bad!<br /><br />The name of the films does not match the story VERY well. The music was quite goot. The music videos were sick. To me, this movie should be a flop! The worse movie i have ever seen! I wish i could give the movie NONE out of ten!
