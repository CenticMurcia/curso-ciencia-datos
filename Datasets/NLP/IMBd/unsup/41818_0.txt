This movie is a must for persons who also want to make a movie in the future. Then you'll know there are always worst. The actors are so bad that they are becoming funny. The discussion at the table before entering the house is excellent. The "special effects" are the worst I've ever seen. The crew did have the guts to make and show this crap on TV, and that's brilliant. We were constantly laughing, you must realize that this movie is not seriously meant (I hope).
