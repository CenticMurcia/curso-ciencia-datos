I am a personal fan of Whitney Houston, and I believe she didn't cause any dishonor to her flawless reputation. Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston truly portrayed the couple of the year. What I like about this movie is its simplicity, honesty and magnificent music. I don't know why the Razzie Awards attacked the film so much, it's a truly classical love story with great performance, music and directing. Although the roll was originally for Diana Ross, I can't imagine Rachel Maron being interpreted as any other woman but Whitney Houston. If you haven't watched it, I honestly think you should, because this is a mist-see cinematographic treasure that is rare to find in today's modern chaos. It has no special effects or any computer tricks, it is as simple as it gets, and I believe that that's the secret to a great film. The outline of this movie is Frank Farmer (Costner) being an extremely serious bodyguard protecting Rachel Marron (Houston), an extremely immature person. The different points of view of both affect Farmer's way of working, causing chaos during the process of Rachel's protection.
