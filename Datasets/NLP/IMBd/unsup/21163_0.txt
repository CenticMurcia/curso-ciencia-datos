Did any other wonder, after Connie drove to Michelle's home in the NM van she had stolen, why Michelle didn't (a) get the license plate number and (b) call the investigator who had been working her case???? I'm hoping that this was just a production error<br /><br />Other than these points, my husband and I loved the movie, knowing that identity theft can happen to anyone under any circumstance. I'm so glad that, since Michelle's ordeal, legislation has been implemented for tougher sentences. It's so unfortunate that identity theft occurs every six seconds as stated in the movie. It just might be worth closing established accounts and open new ones every so often to help prevent it.
