....display of commercially calculated, formulaic, cynical, uninspired and empty Hollywood 'movie-making' in at LEAST 5 years. There are only two movies since, say 1999, that I have had to seriously battle the urge to walk out of, and this was one of them. And I will sit through pretty much anything. By the by, the other movie was Saving Silverman. This movie is offensively predictable and mind-numbingly brain-corrosively unfunny in it's BEST moments. The best analogy to made is to imagine someone sitting around the camp-fire telling a story. The person telling the story is drunk and half-asleep. And he is telling that story to someone who is presumably retarded. In this scenario, the story-teller is this 'movie', and you and I, fellow movie-goers, are, yes, the retard. Yes, it is THAT insulting. Sad to say, Samuel L.Jackson, as cool as he WAS, is now a hack, collecting a paychecheque for any movie that pays him to utter any variation on a sentence that includes the word 'motherfucker,' and sneer every second line of dialogue in that now clich√©d semi-yell he trademarked in Pulp Fiction.I saw this movie for FREE and still regret the two hours of my life I will never get back. Consider this rant as my therapeutic outlet. A VERY BAD movie. This has been a public service announcement.
