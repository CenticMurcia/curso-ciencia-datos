"Convergence" was a more appropriate title than "Premonition". At the beginning of the movie, Christopher Lloyd, says, "You look for reasons in this life, and sometimes you get an answer even if you have to wait awhile." This is a movie that you must watch and pay attention or you may miss something. Cynthia Preston was good as Ali and I liked Blu Mankuma's role as John. Adrian Paul did a very decent job in his part as Brady. Christopher Lloyd was wonderful and his thoughts were how I felt through out the movie. Several scenes made no sense at first and I am not sure that some ever did make any sense. It is definitely a psychological thriller and I felt like it gave me lots to think about after it ended even though I felt as though I was missing something during the movie. Nevertheless, even with the flaws in this movie is still worth watching. I would recommend this movie highly for those interested in the genre. It was at times confusing, but so is life and it will leave you thinking.
