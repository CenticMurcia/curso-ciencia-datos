Have you ever flipped around at 3AM looking for a movie? If you reach "recatuma", flip on (it will never be shown at any other time, I'm sure).<br /><br />I've nothing against gutter humor, e.g., "There's Something about Mary", or the "American Pie" series, but "recatuma" is just not funny. It looks like the product of two 8-year-olds who got their hands on a camera.<br /><br />It's beyond me how this movie has one of the highest ratings I've seen on IMDb (votes by the director and friends?), but this movie seriously makes me question IMDb ratings.
