Really, if you have insomnia, watch this move. I sleep after watching half of the movie.<br /><br />This movie is basically about a special agent/assassin who fails in a mission and is sent to an island for "reeducation".<br /><br />Ultimate Force will only please those Mirko "Croatian Cop" Filipovic hardcore fans and nobody else. Cro Cop acting is bad. Specially when he's fighting... You'll not see a lot of MMA (Vale-tudo) fights in this movie which is a shame.<br /><br />And it's funny how he uses this movie to show some despite to a certain Brazilian Vale-Tudo fighter. The only part of the movie that made me laugh out loud.
