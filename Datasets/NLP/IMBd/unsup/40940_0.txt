"Triloquist" centers around a sister and brother who are taken in by their abusive uncle after the death of their mother, a famous veltriloquist. When they kill their uncle, they go on some kind of killing spree with their doll. Sound exciting, but the story is rather dull. The weakest part is the cast, they are extremely annoying and really get on your nerves. Their characters are badly written, the story is supposed to be scary and funny at the same time, but the result is neither. It simply does not work on any level. This is certainly not a horror or comedy. <br /><br />75 minutes is even too long for this boring tale. Don't bother, I cannot think of one reason why you should watch this...
