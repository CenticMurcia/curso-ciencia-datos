As good a gangster movie that has ever been made as DePalma does justice to Mamet's electric script. The acting on show is right out of the top draw, the inevitable ease that DeNiro puts menace into Capone is quite impressive, whilst the fresh faced pugnacious tenacity of Andy Garcia's George Stone is something of a delightful watch. Yet that is not enough because we still need the central actors to carry the film if it is going to triumph. Connery is a given performance wise {accent aside of course, but then again who cares when the character portrayal is as sharp as it is here ?} but it is Costner as Eliot Ness that shines like the star he was soon to become, it's a magic performance that manages to fuse genuine tenderness of family love with little trips to the dark side in pursuit of making good triumph over evil.<br /><br />I love that the film is showing how violence and fear affects families, mother and child is a theme that is central to the films heartbeat, notice how some of the more violent scenes are followed by tender scenes of Ness and his family. The set pieces here are attention grabbing entertainment, a roaring Canadian border rumpus and a smashing roof top pursuit and face off are top value, but it's something of DePalma gold watching a brilliant Battleship Potemkin homage at the train station that takes the cake as the film enters its last quarter. Surely historical facts does not matter when film's are as sharp as this one is,? it's frightening, touching, and even witty. So for me at least, the film is 10/10 in every department {yes, even Sean's accent}.<br /><br />Footnote: The academy saw fit to nominate Ennio Morricone for his wonderful score, yet strangely he used most of it for John Carpenter's 1982 film The Thing, they must have missed it that time I presume! Must be the genre angle one thinks....<br /><br />10/10
