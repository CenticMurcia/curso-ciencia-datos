It seemed like bad cut scenes from a video game. A couple of the cast are known actors, but they don't want to be known by this film. The camera work may have been done by a Jr. high Student. Please forgive any insult I have made to Jr. High cameramen who are competent. The location and costumes were not bad except for the bandanna's that were worn like capes. The plot had a chance but the script and score made it imposable to care about. There is no reason to rent this movie. If it's in the $.99 bin do not buy it. Don't let friends watch, rent or buy this movie.<br /><br />This movie is very slow and plodding. there are no surprises or plot twist to make watching this mundane movie payoff in any way.
