A masterpiece of work covering two totally disagreeing subcultures filled with belief. It was a long time since I saw a movie showing how it could be for real by being a member of a subculture and actually I think the last time I was really OK with it's coverage must have been "Romper stomper" from 1994.<br /><br />All though the plot is a bit miss-guiding, this movie was great. The main characters are well played by it's actors and with a such unique story, this couldn't go better than this.
