I think i am obliged to write a comment about this movie, cause it is far underrated. The average is about 4.3, not even reach 5.<br /><br />As a scary film, I saw many monsters , I achieved my objectives, got the feeling I wanted.<br /><br />Well, yeah, the plot is not that good. but the actors are at least attractive but not ugly.<br /><br />The appearance of the hybrid monster are scary enough. They look like a real monster which is unlike to usual ones.Efforts are seen from the productions. Thus it can be said to give you a surprise.<br /><br />I think if you want to be scared , u can get wt u want. This movie worth 7 IMO
