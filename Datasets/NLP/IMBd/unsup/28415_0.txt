This is one horror movie I would find sexually moving. "Shivers" is a movie that is mostly that way itself. Here you have a apartment complex that has a lot of couples there. Unknown to anyone, there's something unnatural going on. One doctor makes a parasite that should replace a diseased organ. That plan did work, however, the side-effect was increased sexual desire. Once that gets out, all hell's break loose. The young girl whom he had an affair with is the first, the second victim is the guy who works for a firm keeps a secret from his wife. The more people getting infected by these parasites, the wilder eerything gets. Everyone wants the desire for sex. Well, there's no telling how an infected person looks like. The only way you can tell is when you're getting mobbed by these horny, over-sexed freaks. Like most zombie movies you would smel dead flesh in the air. In "Shivers' it's not love, it's sex, and it's wild. This movie should be titled, "Invasion of the Sex Fiends". But that title can be considered pornographic! 3 out of 5 stars!
