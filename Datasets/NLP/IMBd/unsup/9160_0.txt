This film is a genuine and moving portrayal of growing up in Australia. On some level, the film makes the mundane haunting and beautiful. For people wanting to see the 'real' Australia, rather than the Crocodile Dundee myths, this movie is a classic.<br /><br />Definitely a film for the sentimental thinker. Like most Australian movies, it lacks the big-budget shoot em up special effect American style. It is more laid back, and lets the characters tell their stories. It made quite an impression in Australia when released, but was less successful overseas.<br /><br />The sequel of this movie, "Flirting", starred Nicole Kidman and Thandie Newton, who played a cameo in "Interview with the Vampire" opposite Tom Cruise.
