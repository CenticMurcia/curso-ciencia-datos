"The Awful Truth" was a ground breaker in terms of some of the conventions that were used in screwball comedies of the thirties. It is one of the first times where the actors were encouraged to ad lib responses, and make comments on top of other characters lines. This may seem a small step forward in Hollywood film history, but think of the influence it may have had on directors such as Robert Altman who was praised for this type of work with "M*A*S*H", thirty years later. Or more immediately with Preston Sturges and "The Palm Beach Story". The natural interplay between characters is essential in this kind of screwball comedy.<br /><br />The genius here is Leo McCarey, who may be better well known for "Duck Soup" or "Going My Way", but here he trusts his stars, who are all perfect, to take the story and run with it.<br /><br />Cary Grant is, well, Cary Grant. How many times have we seen this character, and how many times do we wish he were still making movies like this. He is perfect in this role. Irene Dunne is absolutely beautiful and in every measure Grant's equal in terms of performance and comic talent. Ralph Bellamy, again, is the classic foil. The wide-eyed, wide-eared Okie, who's just made it to town. All three are gems.<br /><br />9 out of 10
