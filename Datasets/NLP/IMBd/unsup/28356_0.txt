Willie is a man who is always feeling discriminated against, he also the peasant one of gang. And finally Tommy. Tommy dreams big and super stardom. Somehow he will make it big.<br /><br />The description of the characters not only fit our friends but ourselves. Hanging With The Homeboys is almost The Guys Night Out Bible. When you feel lonely on a Friday Night pop in Hanging With The Homeboy either that or Porn.
