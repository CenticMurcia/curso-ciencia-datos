Saw the premiere at GenArt festival in NYC on 4/5. The audience couldn't stop laughing. Unfortunately, "Dreamland" is not a comedy. It IS the biggest ego trip I've seen a filmmaker go on in years. "Let's extend this shot for another fifteen seconds so they can really FEEL the emotion. No, THIRTY seconds!" I'd blame the casting director for the hilarious choices, but I have a feeling final calls were made by Mr. Matzner. As ridiculous as it is to have us believe that four of the most beautiful humans on the planet (Gershon, Corbett, Garner, Bruckner) live next door to each other in a trailer park, the casting of Justin Long takes the cake. Even my sports-hating PR girlfriends have heard of UNLV -- we're supposed to believe a 5'8" 130-lb weakling plays basketball for an elite program? Now THAT's comedy! SKIP THIS MOVIE
