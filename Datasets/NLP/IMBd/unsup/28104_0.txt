This movie was of particular poor quality. While I can see that a lot of the images and camera-angles were in place to highlight the "new" technology of digital filming and video games, these images lost me and left me feeling a little nauseous. They were not effective in making the film scarier or more compelling. It seems the movie was made too fast, just to get on the market to show off the technology. It looks mass-produced and uninteresting.<br /><br />The plot was nil and the ending atrocious. By the end, I nearly turned off the movie because I could not handle the unfinished story line, poor acting and predictability. The plot "twists" were unexciting. Unfortunately, this movie was absolutely terrible. I felt nothing for the characters, who were not well-developed and the plot did not entice me, and honestly, I'm pretty disappointed. The film case makes reference to the ring, but this film has no relation (in story or quality) to the ring, ringu, any remakes or any sequels.
