I disagree with the comments that the movie was dated... The issues brought out in the movie are just as current today as it was in 1946. The traffic problems then are no different today and should be used as clear examples for today's young driver students. This movie could be used to attract young drivers to this very important topic.. It is sort of nice seeing that the problems of the 1940's are still pertinent to today's problems. The fact that the movie is dated gives it the charm and provides a unique emphasis on the problems of highway traffic. I think that this movie should be offered as a training aid to high school students... The message it puts out is just as true now as it was then.<br /><br />Thanks
