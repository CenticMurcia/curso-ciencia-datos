I am just baffled as to why this show is so popular. This show is one of the poorest animated series I've ever seen. Characters such as Mandy are bitter and painful to watch, while the rest are lacking in basic intelligence, like Billy for instance. Sometimes, an idiotic character in a show is a good thing, but this show overdoes it, and that aspect doesn't work for it. It just degrades the quality of this cartoon even more. This show has no integrity, either, as its values are corrupt and poor, and after watching an episode, what has one actually learned from this, or what purpose has this show made? It tries to aim at comedy, but most of it is unintelligent comedy, which they overuse quite often. What's even worse is the graphics. This cartoon has some of the poorest animation I've ever seen, and that is another turn-off for this show. This show bothers me very much, and I don't see why people enjoy it so much. To me, this show has no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and it's nothing special from any other show on TV. If anything, it is much worse and should be ignored in favor of other shows that have much higher quality production values. I think that this show should be canceled, or if not, the creator should give this show a massive "face lift" to provide the show with a more positive aura.
