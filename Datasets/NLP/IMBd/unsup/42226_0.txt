If I was programming a "cringe" film festival Bastards would be my opening night gala. For the most part this film is a tireless tirade of anti-globalization sentiment and dirty dreadlocks. The trees in this movie are less wooden than the actors, it's shot on video in a kind of amateur porno POV style and fearlessly goes nowhere. The clumsy comparison between 9/11 and clear cutting in British Columbia was enough to make you toss your granola bars. <br /><br />It is ironic that this film through some kind of miracle of globalization and free flowing capital got funded and found distribution on TMN, Canada's poor cousin to HBO. It does make you think though, about going to bed.
