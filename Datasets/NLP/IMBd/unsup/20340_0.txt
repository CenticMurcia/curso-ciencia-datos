The Endless Waltz, a fine piece of anime at it's best. Heero's human side has shown him to be a very virtous and honorable fighter. His own personal struggle has greatly been an intricate part of this movie. We get to see a forming romantic bond between Relena and Heero as well. Mariemaya Krushrenada was a victim of greed in this movie, and a pawn in a bigger scheme planned by her sick, sedistic, madman she calls Grandfather (Dekim Barton). Spectacular Animation! Awesome storyline! A must see for any anime fan!!!!!
