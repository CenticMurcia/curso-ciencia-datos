I'm NOT a Woody fan, but his comedy about male/female relationships makes you laugh. The subject is just as current in our post-modern, dated-you-yesterday ... dating-someone-else-today world. Too bad there's the eventual bedding of Ms. Keaton which just doesn't ring true. I recommend watching a Bogart film before (or with) this comedy to appreciate Lacy's portrayal of Bogart. He's credible! There's seamless choreography in some scenes involving Woody's imagined interplay with Bogart while "real" characters converse with Woody. My favorite line is "I fought those guys. My face hit his fist and my nose broke his knee." My favorite visual is the Jennifer date that ends with the door closed on him as he talks.
