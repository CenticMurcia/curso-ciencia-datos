I saw this movie twenty years ago and thought what absolute nonsense.<br /><br />Overly melodramatic with the three persons Tyrone Power briefly encounters at the beginning.<br /><br />"Have you seen her? Have you seen her?" Said to be based on a true story, I made inquiries back then and was told that there was indeed a ship that sank as quickly as this one, the fictitious Cresent Star, was purported to have done, but there was no incident with an officer passing survivors off of a lifeboat into the water. The officer himself was pure fiction.<br /><br />There is a remake with Martin Sheen about 1975. This one proposes a trial of some sorts afterward.<br /><br />In truth, there was several incidents on the Titanic alone that involved lack of room in lifeboats, one such situation was the lifeboat had standing room only and the survivors appeared to be walking on water as they edge of the boat was that close to the water, but no one was passed over the side.<br /><br />This movie possessed no more thought and insight other than to go "what would you do?" if you were in a similar situation.<br /><br />I couldn't help but notice there would even be an incident with a shoe, which occurred in Hitch's Lifeboat.<br /><br />I think Mai Zetterling threw the shoe overboard.<br /><br />Just a lot of intense, overly melodramatic nonsense.<br /><br />Definitely check out Lifeboat for much greater thought and human development.
