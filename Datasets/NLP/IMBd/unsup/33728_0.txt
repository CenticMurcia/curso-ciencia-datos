Writer-director Neil Jordan (on a roll after the critically-acclaimed "Mona Lisa") nearly took his name off the credits of this low-level whimsy, saying the final result had been altered by outsiders. Perhaps they were hoping to find (or save) the center of Jordan's muddled plot, but in the end it's still a wash-out. Jaw-droppingly poor, heavy-handed comedy has tourists in an ancient Irish castle mixing it up with the ghostly apparitions residing there. The cast (including Peter O'Toole, Steve Guttenberg, Daryl Hannah, Liam Neeson, Beverly D'Angelo and Jennifer Tilly--a highly uneven troupe if there ever was one!) cannot get a grip on their characters and flounder (they should've threaten to remove their names as well). Romantic and comic shenanigans lands with a big thud. NO STARS from ****
