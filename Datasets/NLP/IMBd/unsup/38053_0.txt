A singularly awful movie. Very few films have the awful power of "Fa√ßade". There is evidence some form of satire was attempted. It's a botched job. Eric Roberts (as businessman Colin Wentworth) meanders through the proceedings in a hopefully inebriated state. The obligatory "hot chick" moment is over quickly, blessedly; if you're watching for that reason. The soundtrack rips off "Strangers in the Night" (doesn't anyone own the copyright on that song?). Quite possibly, this is the worst film ever made with Eric Roberts. One would certainly have to hope so, anyway. The credits end with a 1997 production date, so this may have been unreleased for a number of years. Really, they needn't have bothered. <br /><br />* Facade (1997) Carl Colpaert ~ Eric Roberts, Camilla Overbye Roos, Angus Macfadyen
