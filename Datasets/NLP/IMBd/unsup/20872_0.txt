I saw this series when it first premiered in 2003, and I really liked it! It had characters like Des Kaye and Ray McCooney, who were actually quite funny. I liked the show a lot, and couldn't wait for it to return.<br /><br />Then series 2 arrived. I was shocked by the drop in quality. No more clever, versatile characters like Ray McCooney. Repetitive, disgusting (and not in a funny way) characters like Bubbles De Vere and that puking woman (can't remember her name!) were the focus now. Even classic characters like Lou and Andy had become shadows of themselves.<br /><br />I saw series 3, in hopes it would improve, but to my dismay it got even worse! I left the series with a bitter taste in my mouth, and went off to re-watch a true classic (Brass Eye).<br /><br />I saw the rating of 8.0, and was amazed at how high it was. One great series, followed by two god-awful ones, does not deserve something higher than a 4.<br /><br />My advice, buy series 1 if you're curious. Save your money on the rest (including Little Britain USA).<br /><br />Rating 4/10
