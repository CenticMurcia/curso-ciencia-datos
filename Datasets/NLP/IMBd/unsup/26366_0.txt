this movie rules more than buttheads will like to admit. It starts out being incredibly confusing, then you kind of figure out whats going on, then figure out you were toad-ally wrong. the highlight of the film was a man standing in a closet, falling on a box of spilled marbles. THIS IS AN AWESOME MOVIE! even though lame-os will whine about the name not making any sense, that's part of why it's so awesome. The name kind of makes sense anyway, i'll bet that half the people who hate this movie didn't make it through the first hour. They said, "THIS MOVIE SUCKS" and then turned it off long before it was over, and started to make any sense. besides, there's a picture of a girl with a huge butt on the cover, what more could you want?!?!?!?
