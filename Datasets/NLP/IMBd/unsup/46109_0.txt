In contrast to some of the reviews I've read, I thought this film was a poor effort on every level.<br /><br />I grew up in the North of England in the 1970s - was one of the first punks in Sheffield (where I understand the film is set) - and I don't see any authenticity in it. Just a bunch of caricatures meandering through a faux 70s setting.<br /><br />The plot lines were dreary and unfocused and the resolution ridiculous. Two lackluster juvenile leads and the remaining talent chronically under used. <br /><br />It fails- as most British movies do - to actually look like a film. It looks cheap. It has televisual sensibilities - and budget TV at that. The disco sequences really rock - not. Hard to spread out fifteen extras to make a room seem full I know.<br /><br />All in all it is rubbish. And its no wonder it was a flop when originally released.
