The first time I ever saw this Warner Brothers short was @ a pizza parlor over in Irving, Texas. It always makes me laugh when the little owl heads over to radio station G-O-N-G! Jack Bunny is the host & judge of the talent show. It's kind of a spoof of the old Major Bowes Amateur Hour radio show, complete with a gong. Today, people would think of it as The Gong Show Meets American Idol with Jack Bunny as a cross between Simon Cowell & Chuck Barris! When the owl saw his family @ radio station G-O-N-G, the father had a change of heart, just before Jack Bunny's about to gong him off! I Love To Singa is a clever movie & it doesn't deserve the G-O-N-G!
