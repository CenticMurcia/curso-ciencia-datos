This film is just one tick above being a laughable propaganda film like Reefer Madness or Cocaine Fiends, only the agenda is the almighty handgun. The screenwriter tossed in one speech by the assassin about how a gun makes him feel like god so he can feel balanced I assume. But the film is basically a 75 minute speech about how we need guns. It begins with a poor little boy who cant have a toy gun because his mother wont let him and the sheriff who's dying to do the single mom buys it for him anyway; way to go sheriff, that'll get you some! The boy tells mom his classmates call him sissy for not having one. The ex-secret service father in law to the mom (dad of her war-slain hubby) gives an over the top speech about how great guns are and how she shouldn't cry for her dead hero husband. Minutes later he chastises her for just "being a woman" when she is concerned about him electrocuting himself when fixing a TV. It's really shameless. The ending is telegraphed far in advance when the little boy shoots the assassin but just barely misses, the gun-hating mom picks up the gun and shoots him but just wounds him and then the macho sheriff takes it and does what only a man can do - justifiably kill a bad man with one shot. Well the boy and mom didn't get the kill, but at least now they are men, well sort of, in a way. Oh brother.
