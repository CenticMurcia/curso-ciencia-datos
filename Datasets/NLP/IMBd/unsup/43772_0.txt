First the bad news. This supposed black comedy is totally devoid of black comedy, and any other kind of humor for that matter. What you get are two separate converging stories neither of which is remotely funny. Jumping back and forth, the viewer is totally bored and confused, not a good formula for entertainment. Trucking out endless vaudeville acts may be entertaining to an extremely tiny minority, but to everyone else "Funny Bones" will be unending torture. After one hour of this total nonsense, I most fortunately consulted the DVD case, which informed me that it was 128 minutes long. I had had enough. Now the good news, I ejected this artsy crap, and didn't waste another minute. - MERK
