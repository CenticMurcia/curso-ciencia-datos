This movie is incredible. Robin Williams shows that he has potential as a dramatic actor, not just FLUBBER and JUMANJI, material. He plays the wonderful role of Prof. Keating and inspires a class to think for themselves. There is some great humor in this, too. "Mr. Pits... live above your name." "Cccaaaarrrrrppppeee... Cccaaaarrrrrppppeee Diem..." "RIP! RIP IT OUT! Goodbye, Mr. J. Evans Pritchard, PhD. I want to hear the sound of more RIP!-" and then the headmaster steps in. And the "phone call from God... if it had been collect, it would have been daring." But all of this humor sets you up without knowing for Keating's fall from grace due to the suicide of one student (who I won't name). So, incredible.
