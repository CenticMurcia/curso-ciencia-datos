I gave this show a perfect 10. The reason for that is simple, there aren't many shows that after five, six, seven or more seasons remain as good as the were at the start of their showing, but NCIS is only getting better. The writing is exceptional, the casting for the roles was perfect, every character is unique and the actors perform exceptionally. Every episode brings something new to the table and makes viewers to nervously wait for the next one. Also, I believe that agent Fornell should get more air time, his character fits perfectly with Gibbs which was nicely shown in the last episode.<br /><br />This show is a great mix of humor and action with some serious notes, hopefully it will remain on air for very long time.
