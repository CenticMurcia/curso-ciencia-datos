I first got this film out of the video store last year because i wanted to see what Drew Fuller was like outside of his role in Charmed. He was very good in it so I was quite keen to see it. Then I saw that Abigail Breslin was in it and I thought "Well I definitely have to see it now!" I am so glad I did! It was such a beautiful and heart worming story and Fuller and Breslin are fantastic together. I have always thought it is such a clich√© when people say "Oh this movie made me laugh and it made me cry." But I must say that this film actually did make me laugh here and cry there! I actually think this film is my favourit movie, and thats saying a lot seeing as I say I have a lot of "favourit" films and I am a film student. This is a must see!
