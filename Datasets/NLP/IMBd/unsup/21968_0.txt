this movie was excellent! I loved Ally and Amanda's acting and their song on the ride was perfect with the movie. I think they used all the right characters for each part. Everyone in this movie was a talented performer! Congrats on an excellent movie! I am so proud of Disney!!!!!! Remember to also listen to all of the songs Aly and AJ have written because they are all talented! Sticks and Stones especially because it helps many kids with bullying problems to find their inner self and to stick up to the bully. Please watch this movie. Disney and all other production companies did an excellent job with it and all of the cute boy characters are really and truly cute! Love this movie 5 stars!
