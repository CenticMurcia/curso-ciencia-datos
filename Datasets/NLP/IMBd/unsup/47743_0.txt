Shot on a poor-looking video, the editing, scripting and plotting of this movie are staggeringly bad. The use of music is also atrocious, music library stuff plugged in randomly and starting and ending without any logic. There's some sped-up footage of teeth-brushing, and a conversation is also fast-forwarded through.<br /><br />In the opening, a woman leaves a successful date to be hit on by a stranger, then abducted by men in a van who dismember her with piano wire. A doll later on is supposedly a likeness of her, but isn't by a longshot. One of the dolls is named Marionnier (I thought this might be a person who manipulates a marionette, but no). One of the abusive guys gets strung up by rope after he attacks a woman, and attacked with huge shears and a sledgehammer. A woman turns into wax in a lake and is then sculpted into a doll.<br /><br />All of this may sound very good, but it is so incompetently executed, you're better off spending your time elsewhere. Go revisit Child's Play or Dolls.
