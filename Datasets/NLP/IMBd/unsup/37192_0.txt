You are a SEEKER Will! Don't you know what that is?!? This movie is pretty much all that you hate in a movie. The premise of the film is that evil needs five days after Will's 14th birthday to destroy the world. <br /><br />The script is inanely two dimensional. Each character has his or her own theme and that's that. There are no character developments or even a care to it. It just seem that they had a cool outline for a movie and decided to put them in without any consideration to a story.<br /><br />Just so you know, it's not very hard to be a Seeker in this movie. He goes back in time when he sees a sign. He doesn't even need to know what time period, his seeker abilities take care of that for him. Not only do they take him back in time, but he hallucinates the symbol for the "light" wherever a sign is located. So his job is to be involuntarily transported back in to to an empty room, see a transparent symbol and put his hand where it was. That's it. "I never thought you would get this far." You've got to be kidding! This movie plays out like a little kid's video game!<br /><br />The villain is the complete opposite of intimidating, every time he is on screen I chuckled. His weapon of choice? Crows. Yes, that's right, you read that correctly. He uses crows to attack people. Yeah, he's here to destroy all light on the planet and he uses crows to scratch people. Yes, this makes me very scared indeed. <br /><br />The camera tries to make the movie seem like there is action about to happen, but after the third time of these "action" sequences that end in a protracted dialog that was, "Give me the signs boy!" "No, I won't!" "Fine, Have it your way" you laugh at the bad guy for his terrible aptitude for being a bad guy and how easy it is to defy this evil power. Then the villain rides off into the distance. It just never made ANY sense. This movie is probably the worst film of the millennium.
