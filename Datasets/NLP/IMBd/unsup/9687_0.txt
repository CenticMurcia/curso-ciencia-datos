It's a great movie that shows the changes that happened in the Egyptian Society from the age of the kingdom of Egypt until our age now. He shows this by a building called The Yacoubian Building in which each character in it signifies a character in the Egyptian society. I've one comment on the movie, I don't know why the author included a sex issue in each character as if sex is a main axis in our life. Also the character of Hatem and Abd Rabo I think it's a very rare case in an Islamic society although the actors role was very complicated and hard but they made it with Professionalism. the movie is really so good and the director succeeded in making the movie although its his first movie. enjoy it.
