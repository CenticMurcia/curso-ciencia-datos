I say: See this movie at least twice. First time I saw it was at the Philadelphia Film Festival. I laughed quite a bit... I thought Wilbur's subtle words of wisdom were rather funny. Second time I saw it was about a week later once the Ritz Theater's had picked it up. I sat there and saw the movie as being much more sad. I still found certain parts of it to be funny... but I saw it as a much darker film than I'd initially thought. The little nuances of the actors and actresses in the movie make it into an absolutely down-to-earth film; they just seem like normal people... a bit nutty, but totally believable... you'll think you knew them by the end.<br /><br />I highly recommend seeing it if you get the chance... Make the effort. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll smile.<br /><br />Added: And now I've got it on DVD. Diagnosis... wow. It's just so sad and real.
