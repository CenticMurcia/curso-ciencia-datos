I didn't actually intend to watch this. It was one of those movies of the week with incredibly low production values and a script weaker than aged parchment.<br /><br />I don't actually need to get into details here. The film is predictable enough that anybody watching it should have it figured out within about ten minutes. However, to give you a brief clue, yes, it's exactly what you think.<br /><br />Worst film I've seen in a while.
