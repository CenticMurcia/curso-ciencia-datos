Despite some criticism of the film and quite a low general rating on IMDb, I liked the film and thought that it was a tense and interesting film by Roger Michell. <br /><br />I liked the more unusual tragedy and how it started off the film and gave a background of what was to come in the film, and i thought that the build up of Joe or Joe-Joe (Daniel Craig) character was very well done, the sophisticated London style lecturer and entrepreneur life in which he leads.<br /><br />I noticed that the plot is quite slow in building up and reaches its climax, at the end quite abruptly and for most films, i would use this as a deterrent but i think it suits the genre of the film, as a tense thriller but think it is more than just another thriller, ripping off other films of its kind, i think it has some amazing and typically thriller-esquire moments but i think the film is so much more than that, i love the colours in London and in the rural field outside Oxford and i think the music perfectly fits and interlinks with the plot, creating a classic film.<br /><br />The end is quite predictable perhaps, in parts but is a perfect send off to the film. The finale with Jed at the end, with the kiss, is perfect for the film, despite being very gruelling on the eye, not meaning to be homophobic. And on the field at the end of the film, is a good sort of twist, but nothing to complex and the events bring you back to what happens at the beginning, and i like this aspect.<br /><br />Having not read the novel, by Ian McEwan, i do not know how it fairs as a novel to film adaption, most readers of the novel, however, seem to dislike the film and i admit, perhaps if i had read the novel, it may have put a downer on the film.<br /><br />I watched the film as a part of Film Four's thriller movies, along with One hour photo, another thriller i was impressed with, despite not normally taking a liking to thrillers. I preferred Enduring Love, however, because i think it is more unique and has the right balance to a thriller film, and thought the actors suited the characters well, especially, Daniel Craig. I do admit, however, before the films having a doubt about the casting of Rhys Ifans as Jed, however, i am glad to have been proved wrong and was impressed with his performance of a Jesus-freak psychopath.
