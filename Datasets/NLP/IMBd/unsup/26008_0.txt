Marie, a writer is seeing strange images and is sent to a small town to get away from things. But when there the delusions continue and she gets herself muddled up in a mystery to do with werewolves and a nun.<br /><br />The story in this film drags on at a terribly slow pace. Just keeping the film on was difficult. It is suppose to be a werewolf film yet we don't even see one until after an hour of Marie just walking about the town and occasionally hearing howling noises coming from the woods. Some of the directing isn't too bad with a few stylish shots here and there and the acting is ok for a B movie but nothing to shout about. The film is more of a mystery than a horror but it doesn't work well as that either. The effects in the scene where Richard melts away are pretty cool and it's a very different transformation. It doesn't really make up for anything though. The doctor as a werewolf must be seen to be believed. The ending is terrible just don't even get me started on that. Terribly boring and just plain bad. The only good thing about the film is the ok effects but there are so few of them that it doesn't really help at all.<br /><br />4/10
