The messages were many: cooperation, perseverance, strength in the face of adversity and to not fear new ideas.<br /><br />This is supposed to be a movie for children; but some of it is pretty brutal: I would not take small children in spite of its `G' rating.<br /><br />The story is sweet and simple; allowing more time for the messages and character development. I found myself actually caring for these hideous creatures and cringed when one of them was injured.<br /><br />Max Casella, who seems to be eternally cast as some kind of geek on television and movies again plays a geek -- only this time a primate.<br /><br />Della Reese's voice is instantaneously recognizable as Â‘Eema' the old, caring, mother figure. Kind of the `Mother of All Dinosaurs.' She does it well.<br /><br />The many outstanding locations used as backgrounds were magnificent. You will recognize the waterfall from `Jurassic Park' immediately.<br /><br />The CGI was done very well -- but not (sadly) as well as `Stuart Little'.<br /><br />The score (apparently by James Newton Howard) is absolutely outstanding: majestic, serious and haunting in all the appropriate moments.<br /><br />I am pleased to say that this was a much better film than I was expecting -- I enjoyed it completely.
