There aren't many films that I can't find *something* good about to mention, but this is one. Waste of an evening. Story that is sometimes weird, sometimes just bad. I can't be sure what point the director/author was trying to make with this one. Locations, sets, dialog, plot, music, all lackluster. At least it wasn't two hours long!
