Even though Lighthouse doesn't exactly deliver a story that anyone would consider as original (some people are stalked by a merciless serial killer on a deserted lighthouse), it is a surprisingly watchable movie. Director Hunter adds nice twists to "classic" stalk-scenes, and the movie is chilling right from the beginning. The killer surely is a creepy figure and possibly makes you gasping for breath sometimes. The only letdown for horror-buffs like me is the fact that there's not much gore in this movie - but the few bloody scenes are staged very well and surely not for the squeamish. All in all a chilling and entertaining thriller: 7 out of 10.
