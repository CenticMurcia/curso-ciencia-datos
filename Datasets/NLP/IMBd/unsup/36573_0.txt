or "I am a Really Bad Actor" or "I am Sexually Immature" or "I Learned Nothing in Film School"<br /><br />The subject matter doesn't bother me. I was hoping to see a somewhat insightful film about a man coming to terms with, and rationalizing, his own sexual hang-ups and cravings. That is what the director/writer/star would like to say he's doing with this film, but he fails miserably. The story itself is essentially a history of his sexual experiences, poorly reenacted, complete with laughable orgasm sounds. His flimsy directing and wooden acting is on a par with Ed Wood. The whole production, from sets to camera movement, to acting, comes off like something made by a few twelve-year-old kids with their first camera. His story is not shocking, merely self indulgent and boring. <br /><br />I could almost forgive him... almost... if this was his first film. It is his eighth.<br /><br />I beg his parents to please cut off his trust fund so he can't keep making these terrible movies.
