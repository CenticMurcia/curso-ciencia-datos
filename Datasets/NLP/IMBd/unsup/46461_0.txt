Waldemar Deminski,the famous half-man half-wolf(in theory) finds himself dead in what may or may not be a hospital.Okay it's not,it's some guy's home.Two very necrophiliac-looking doctors make the stupid mistake of taking silver bullets out of his heart and that makes the big W revive again.If you didn't expect that,professional help is on the way.A very promising prologue,and stuff keeps looking this crummy throughout the movie.This thing delivers.<br /><br />So,with the hairier-than-average man back on the loose,we're going to need victims.And behold,two women get stuck in the middle of nowhere.After a suggestion by the more beautiful woman that they will probably be attacked by Frankenstein(in Spanish,you can say that in two words),Waldemar finally shows up,in the slightly more human form of garbage legend Paul Naschy or Jacinto Molina or whatever you like to call him,call him Harry Pubes,see if I care.In two shades of a lamb's tale,they end up in a very crappy house owned by Waldemar and his sister who hangs out there too,and who speaks three languages,la-di-da.<br /><br />There's a certain charm to what Naschy does, and I'd still pick it over some Jess Franco projects, but on the other hand it sucks pretty bad.He just can't really make movies.But I do respect how me made it fairly big with little talent.
