I'm still wondering why "Axe (a.k.a. Lisa, Lisa)" was one of the notorious video nasty's in the 80's. It really doesn't have the quality or the shocking moments that made comparable movies like "Last house on the Left" and "I Spit on your Grave" so infamous and instant classics. The story is rather dull with almost no action and the characters are very stereotypical. The most strange thing is that there appear to be two different versions: the cut and the uncut one. I'm sure I saw the uncut version, but I'm wondering what in the hell had to be cut out for the "R-rated" version. There's no gore, just some blood which was rather fake, red paint that was way to bright. The movie clocks off at 68 (!!) minutes, but that's o.k: I guess you couldn't stretch this simple story any longer. Worth a look only for the 70's and early 80's mood, that's done well but no classic in my book.
