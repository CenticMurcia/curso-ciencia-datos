I believe this movie is graced by O'Toole's and Sharif' best performances ever - very different from their roles in Lawrence of Arabia and Doctor Zhivago. Even though it is extremely long (134 minutes), still you never notice the time passing. There are no epic scenes or battle scenes - mainly it is two to three people talking leisurely in each scene... still it somehow has some kind of magic that keeps your attention all the time. The main theme of the hunt for the prostitute murderer is intertwined with the terrible final days of the Reich, culminated together at the same time. Definitely a milestone in movie history. All the actors and actresses are fine, and the story is just amazing. 10/10
