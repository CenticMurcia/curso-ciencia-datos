OK...you remember those movies in high school film classes? Remember the ones that tried really hard to be creepy and gory with ketchup and jump cuts? Those movies were TEN TIMES BETTER than this one. There is no telling what is going on at any point in the movie. This is for sure though: there's a girl, this guy kills girls and turns them into dolls, and the dolls come to life. I'm really disappointed, because being an avid horror fan who's always looking for a new and unique scare, I really thought this had potential. NO. The film work is juvenile at best, and the plot is so incoherent that it's difficult to even pay attention. You want a bottom line? Here's my advice: watch Puppetmaster.
