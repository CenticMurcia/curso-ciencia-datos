I found that this movie had a very original storyline. A little bit of 'Real World' mixed with 'I Know What You Did Last Summer'. This was an Indie movie at best. It seemed more surreal when it came to the 'cruel' scenes of murder, as far as acting. Everyone's acting was exactly how anyone would react in the situations they were put through. Especially, when it came to the meet and greet sessions pool side. Edward Furlong plays a great villain in my book. The Asian girl kicked ass fighting for her life. Thats the way to do it. If I was put in that situation and I knew martial arts I would use it too. The action was well placed, and the music kept you thinking, "Uh oh, somethings getting ready to go down." Whats best about this movie is that the music didn't overtake the dialogue and action in this film. I recommend this movie for all Indie film buffs. Watch and Enjoy!
