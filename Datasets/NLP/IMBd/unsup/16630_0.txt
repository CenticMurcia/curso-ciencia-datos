I have watched this movie more than a hundred times. Not to sound too neurotic, I even have a spare (second) tape of it. Unlike many comedies, wherein knowing in advance distills the comedic moment, in this movie I can't wait to see those moments again and again. Steve Martin's excellent, over-the-top version of a low-level mafioso stuck out west at "123 Happy Street" waiting to be a witness for the prosecution in a big mobster's trial' is a treasure. And all the supporting actors and actresses are extremely well cast, a factor that - to me - is paramount in building the afterglow of a really good flick. Joan Cusack is perfect; Rick Moranis is perfect; Bill Irwin is perfect; and so are virtually all the others, too many to list. And the highlight moments flow into each-other like fluid gold. The "stolen car" portion; the "merengue dance"; the "undercover uncover"; the "return at the airport", and on and on. And behind all of this is a terrific, light score that magnifies the airy movement of the script. There are scores of comedies I like and watch numerous times. Many have bits that are extremely funny, often incredible. Who could forget some of the stuff in "Tommy Boy?" But if I could keep only one that I knew would never get old, this is it!
