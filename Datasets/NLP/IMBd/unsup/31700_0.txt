I saw this film on television perhaps 24-25 years after its theatrical release and caught what must have been close to the original 1969 theatrical release or cable version. I was shocked by a brief, partial nude scene that exposed Debra Kerr's breasts (Burt Lancaster on the couch with Kerr). Now I have absolutely nothing against seeing breasts on film - but this had to go down as a contender for the least appealing appearance of a woman's breasts in a film (ranking right up there with Olivia de Havilland in 'The Adventurers"). Yikes! The general rule should thus be: with some very rare exceptions, women over 45 should NOT appear nude on film.
