I liked the movie a lot because the two leads- Douglas and Paltrow look and are great. Douglas looks good for a middle age man, and I like the idea of his being married to a gorgeous young highly intelligent woman. Paltrow is young, very beautiful in a sexy sleek Audrey Hepburn way. The plot is kind of obvious, but the script and dialogue are good, and the movie pace is fine. Douglas and Harrison Ford are the two best male actors today. Maybe it is a little uncommon for a young, beautiful very wealthy woman to be married to an older man, but that doesn't affect my enjoyment of the movie.
