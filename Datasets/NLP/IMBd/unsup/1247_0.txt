Before there was "In The Company of Men", there was "Patti Rocks". David Burton Morris's raw, honest, perceptive exploration of the open sores that exist between men and women is a neat two-hander. Chris Mulkey and John Jenkins hit the road to visit Patti Rocks, a woman one of the guys has knocked up. Their road trip becomes a fascinating dialog on the way men perceive women and women fail to understand men. The film was slapped with an "X" rating for language originally, but earned an "R" on appeal. These days, you'd probably hear similar chat on an HBO series, so the language is no big deal, but the script is very well written and the resolution is novel. For the saltiest X-rated language these days, look no further than a Max Hardcore video (preferably an uncut Euro version). Happy hunting.
