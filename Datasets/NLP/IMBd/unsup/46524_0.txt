I rented this hoping for either a) a documentary-of-sorts where celebrities were interviewed honestly believing Pauly Shore was dead or b) a well-done mockumentary with the awkward humor of This is Spinal Tap (okay, that's a really tall order, I realize).<br /><br />I was prepared to be disappointed, but not THIS disappointed. Why in the world was so much screen time devoted to porn stars, references to porn stars, and masturbation? I'm no prude, but so much wasn't relevant, it was annoying.<br /><br />The movie had the potential to be a This is Spinal Tap-type, but it fell short. I do applaud Pauly Shore for writing and directing and openly mocking his past, but it seems like he shied away from going all-out with it and used a poorly thought out "dumb hick" side plot to... to do what, I don't know, but whatever that was for, it didn't work. Also, it seemed the whole time that he couldn't decide if he was making a comedy or a mockumentary. Some of the movie is shot like a conventional story and some is shot as though there were an inexplicable camera catching people's private reactions to the news... it just didn't work.<br /><br />I gave two stars instead of one for guts.
