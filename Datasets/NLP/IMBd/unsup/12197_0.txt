the edukators is a hugely enjoyable film that perfectly balances the human themes of friendship, love and trust with it's more political undertones.<br /><br />the main characters are all performed with warmth and a playfulness that keeps the human side of the story engaging, while the plot develops with continual twists and tension. of course the idealism and activism of the protagonists plays a central roll, but the film never falls to the temptation to preach or bog itself down with weighty polemic.<br /><br />all in all, the edukators is a breath of fresh air that is both satisfying to the head and the heart. highly recommended.
