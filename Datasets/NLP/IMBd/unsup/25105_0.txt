This movie is one of our favorites. We own it and watch it almost every time it is on TV. We are RVers and travel to remote areas where DVD or video are our only choices. Dogman is always with us. We have traveled thru the area in Canada where this movie was filmed-it is some of the most spectacular scenery we have ever seen. The first time I saw the movie the story line was so believable I had to look it up on the "net" to see if there was any truth to the story. Where the story itself is not based on fact, the actual Indian beliefs and thoughts I think are true. Tom Berenger is excellent in the role of Lewis and the dog is great. We are dog lovers. We also have a great fondness for Native American stories and traditions. This movie should be part of everyone movie library.
