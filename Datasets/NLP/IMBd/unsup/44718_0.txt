I saw this on VHS at my video store and curiosity peaked. I usually watch stuff like CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, SALO, and other controversial films, but this just sickened me out. CHICKEN HAWK is a film about NAMBLA (The North American Man/Boy Love Association), a bunch of weird old men who think it's okay to love boys as young as nine years old.<br /><br />What I didn't like about this documentary was the fact that it seemed like it was promoting these people as decent, hardworking human beings. But when the camera reaches these sickos, they talk about how young boy's bodies are the most perfect ever. Gross! I believe in the First Amendment and all, but I think the members of NAMBLA are a bunch of perverts who can't control their own insecurities. There is nothing right about pedophilia. End of story.
