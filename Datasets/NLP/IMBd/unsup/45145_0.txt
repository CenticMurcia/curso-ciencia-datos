I watched this recently on DVD and nodded off before the end. I have no doubt the artistically-minded will be up in arms but to be honest this is not really a film. A film should provide at least a semblance of entertainment, whether in action, photography, dialogue or story. The cast seems to be assembled from actual monks & country peasants but the naturalistic approach produces a result that looks entirely unnatural, with all the characters looking desperate to get their designated line into the dialogue. I was disappointed to waste part of my evening on this - heaven alone knows what a paying cinema audience would have made of it!
