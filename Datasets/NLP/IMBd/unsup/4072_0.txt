The many Shinya Tsukamoto's films (such as "Snake of June","Tokyo fist","Tetsuo" and others) appears psychological exploration of "love triangle" situation.Unusial in "Gemini" absence urban constituent.Therefore "Gemini" is not hypertrophied as "Tokyo fist",not surreal as "Tetsuo" and not so atmosphere as "Snake of June".Total is not so intensive as others Tsukamoto's works.But it is a good movie because qualified lighted , acted and cinematographied.Pleasant momentary turn (by using equipment in manner sci-fi movie) from "historical film" to "modern" (plague child scene).Synthetical music soundtrack is the part of "urban" instruments of director Tsukamoto.
