Quincy ME brought us the fascinating world of Forensic Pathology and yes, even crime scene investigation 30 years before we would be flooded with analogous programs. However, Jack Klugman seemed to be able to pull it off without lavish and superfluous special effects seen all too much in the modern era. Instead, Quincy was disciplined in the drama of the storyline, and the science that was involved. Perhaps the Television of today has doubts about their actual content and dialog, that vacuous imagery has been made a cornerstone, rather than window dressing.<br /><br />Not to mention, Jack Klugman is just a terrific performer. Proving here, just as he has done his entire career that range is not a problem for the actor. We laughed out laud with him in the "Odd Couple", and here we piece together a victims death, along with Sam ,Lt. Monahan, and Astin. As always with Quincy, you are in for a good does of education too.<br /><br />However, towards the later seasons, it seemed that the show became too preachy with its public service tone. I remember being a bit annoyed as certain episodes resembled after school specials, rather than the medical/ crime drama I became addicted too. It would have been a better choice for Quincy to stick with Pathology, and dish out the social commentary's in much smaller portions.<br /><br />In any case, no matter what metric is used to measure Quincy with its crowded (how many CSI's do we need?) modern counterparts, I believe Dr Quincy emerges the most believable and cognitive of the group.
