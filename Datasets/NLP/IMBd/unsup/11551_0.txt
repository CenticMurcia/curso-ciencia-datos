Paraphrasing from Mark Twain's foreword in the book Huckleberry Finn, "Anyone trying to find a Plot in this, will be Hung. Anyone trying to find a moral will be shot." This movie is meant to be enjoyed and not Figured out.<br /><br />Surf 2, the end of the Trilogy was always playing at my house. This is one of my favorite movies. I like listening to this movie even if I am not in the room. I used to watch this movie and then play it again.<br /><br />I compare this movie to Cheech and Chong and Fast Times at Ridgemont High. <br /><br />I love this movie because of the dialog. Every line makes me laugh. <br /><br />Everything that is said is really silly. It's a slap stick kind of humor. I was 14 when this movie came out. So I could relate to being a teenager, partying, girls, and just being silly.<br /><br />Some of my favorite lines are<br /><br />"One time I was surfing this 50 foot tidal wave, and what appears beside me?" "I don't know? What?" "What you mean you don't know? You were there beside me." "I know, but I love to hear you tell it."<br /><br />"What's that noise?" "It's the beach. never mind" "It's a Great White."<br /><br />I could go on and on, but this is one of the best Unknown movies. <br /><br />If you like this, be sure to watch "The Search for One Eye Jimmy"
