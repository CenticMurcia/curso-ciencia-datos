Not surprisingly, many people feel this movie has been over-rated. And its true.<br /><br />The story of a blind girl, a social outcast changed by a great teacher should have been a much more beautiful story with great talents to act the parts. Anyone could have done better than Bacchan. He totally overacted in this one. And why not? No director seems to have control over him, for many would blindly go and buy tickets if they see his name in a film. hence the director seems to have left him on his own.<br /><br />And what about the kid? She has a lot of potential, but directorji has misused her to look like a crazy kid instead of a blind girl. .<br /><br />the only sensible thing in this movie is Mukherjee. She has played her part to the fullest. but she cannot stop me from saying THIS MOVIE ABSOLUTELY SUCKS!!! watch only if u are forced to!
