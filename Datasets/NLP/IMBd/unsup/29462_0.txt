Subhash Ghai makes a beautiful film after the disastrous Yaadein. The highlight of this film is most definitely Rehman's soul-stirring music! It is absolutely excellent! My favorites are Hum Hain Is Pal Yahan, the flute-piano theme, and My Wish Comes True. What I appreciate is that the revolution, fight for Indian independence, and Hindu-Muslim riots were kept as a backdrop and that the movie didn't sidetrack into a historical film. It is a love story from the beginning to the end. It is an interesting illustration of how love can cross cultures and is not skin-deep. The movie also shows good examples of where the British and Indian cultures/societies blend to create harmony and clash to create havoc. I thought everyone gave a good performance. The visuals are simply stunning. This movie has a very good script with excellent scenes that truly touches your emotions. The only thing I didn't like is the picturization of the songs during the church scene. It was unnecessarily melodramatic and just plain out weird. Also, two beautiful songs are just jammed into each other in an ear-screeching fashion. Other than that, though, this movie is an awesome romantic adventure.
