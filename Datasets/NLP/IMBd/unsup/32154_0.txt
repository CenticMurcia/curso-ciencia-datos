I never thought I would be forced to rate anything this low, but my respect for the book compels me to just that. This is the worst crap I have ever seen. The makers should be crucified. J. R. R. Tolkien, rest his soul, would cry in the view of this utter destruction of his phenomenal work. I weep while I force my self to watch it to the end. Why it was made in the firs place one can only wonder. Characters personalities are warped, they are used in wrong context and even left out. The meaning and point is lost. What is left is a dish without texture and taste which should never have been. There is but one reason to watch this and that is to know how it was utterly destroyed.
