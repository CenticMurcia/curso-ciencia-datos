Very enjoyable film, McConaughey is your average OTT American military man (always chewing a cigar etc), Bale's cockney accent is cringeworthy at best but they are two minor faults to an otherwise great film.<br /><br />The locations are great, the dragons are superb, the acting is ok but its a great film and one that I will be definitely be watching again and would recommend anyone else to do the same.<br /><br />Special note goes to the special effects man, some of the best fire effects I have seen in any film.
