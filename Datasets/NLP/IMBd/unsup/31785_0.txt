I watched this movie because there was really nothing else on at the time, but I found myself enjoying it. The actors were good at portraying the ultra proper manner of the English aristocracy. I had heard the story of Charles and Camilla before, but this movie brought it home to me. It makes me understand why Prince Charles would go through everything he has endured to be with her.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I was unable to watch the end of the movie, I had to leave right as Camilla offered to find Charles a wife. I was one of the people who watched as much of the Royal Wedding as I could and I watched the coverage of Prince Charles marriage to Camilla and as such, I wish I could have seen the rest, especially his relationship with Princess Diana.
