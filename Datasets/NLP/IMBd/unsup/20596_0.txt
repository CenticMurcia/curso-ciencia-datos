I think its one of the most funniest films I've ever seen, makes a pleasant change to have a film with NO BAD LANGUAGE in it. Makes me laugh from start to finish,and sadly not many films do that for me these days. I would love to get a copy of it on any format I can get, preferably DVD though, but video would do. There are a lot of famous people in it which play their part perfectly, and the music is enjoyable too. I don't know why every one gives it such a bad write-up, I would sure like to see it over and over again, hence why I want a copy from somewhere. The TV stations don't even seen to want to show it, its most frustrating. Can any one help me find a copy?
