Yes, I know I am an adult, but this movie just brings back good memories. I used to watch the care bears every day, and even play care bears with my friends. These cuddly little bears help teach us the important lessons of life, like how to care, share and grow up to be wonderful members of society.<br /><br />The plot is that two children who are put up for adoption begin to doubt the world and humanity. The care bears sense their trouble and whisk them off to care-a-lot. Meanwhile, another little boy who works for the circus unleashes a nasty spirit that causes everyone on earth to quit caring. It is up to the care bears to teach the kids how to care, and teach the whole world how to care before time runs out. It's full of adventure and delightful characters. And meeting the care bear cousins in the forest of feelings was a great addition. Will the world ever care again? Watch and find out.
