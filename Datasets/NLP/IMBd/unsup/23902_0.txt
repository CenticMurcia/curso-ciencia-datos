This is truly a great film and was very well produced considering it was in the early 30's. Lew Ayres(Louie Ricarno),"Calling Dr. Kildare",'38, was a crook trying to go straight and start a new life for himself and did everything to protect James Cagney,(Steve Mileaway),"The Public Enemy",'31, who was a fellow side kick in the rackets and was also fooling around with his wife. Louie's wife decided that by taking off her wedding ring it made it legal for her to fool around, which must have shocked the audiences of the 1930's. All these actors were just starting their careers in this film and gangster films were very popular. If you look close, you will also see Dwight Frye (Monk, a gangster),"Frankenstein",'31 and Ward Bond(a policeman that was uncredited in this picture) Ward Bond appeared in many of John Wayne Western Films. The producer of this film wanted the public to realize that "CRIME DOES NOT PAY".
