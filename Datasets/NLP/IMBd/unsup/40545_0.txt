I was most intrigued by the set decorations - or lack of them in this peculiar photoplay. Our seemingly lonely two stars live in a bayou house on stilts and never clean they only well, you know, have lots of sex.<br /><br />I rented this movie and shut it off after the first twenty minutes only to return to find out if they ever cleaned up. I can't tell you the ending that would spoil all the fun. I suppose if you can make it through the first reel you are hooked.<br /><br />I think that Natasha Wagner has quite a career ahead of her and I look forward to more, but, this is one of the bombs, sorry.
