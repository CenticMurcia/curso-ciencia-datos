and you'll see that they're quite similar. I Want To Keep My Baby starred Mariel Hemingway as a girl who became pregnant by her boyfriend and decided to keep her baby, whom she named Elizabeth, after the youngest daughter on The Waltons, rather than give it up for adoption or raise it at home with her meddling mother. Sue Ann Cunningham is your average Southern California teenager. She gives birth, and becomes an irresponsible mother. Her boyfriend refuses to take care of their daughter, and she goes about her normal teenage activities, including going to the pool in their apartment complex, with her friends. This is similar to the ABC Family series The Secret Life of the American Teenager. This movie was the inspiration for that series. It also inspired the ABC After School Special Teenage Father, and three episodes of 7th Heaven about teenage pregnancy. Watch this movie and then ABC Family's The Secret Life of the American Teenager, and you'll see the similarities.
