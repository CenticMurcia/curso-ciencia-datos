I think the only work of Stephen King that I actually enjoyed was The Shining. Apparently, King crammed all the ideas of his previous novels into this steaming pile of dung. We had the "red fungus" which reminded me of the green plant growth from creepshow. The group of friends who all share some trauma as kids, and grow up and meet together every 20 years or so. Remember IT? Telethapy, from The Shining also rings a bell. Ive never seen a movie go in so many directions and end up nowhere, but Dreamcatcher does just that. The biggest thing that I didn't like about this movie was how it was written. They went great lengths to make visual and audible clues to the storyline, that were not needed, not to mention incredibly cheesy. I know books are written a different grade levels. This movie would be like at a 4th grade level. I do have some questions, Why does the alien talk with a poor British accent? If these friends are so telepathic, why would one have to answer a, and Im not making this up, a ringing gun...then talk trough it like it was a telephone!! Morgan Freeman, Jason Lee, and Tom Sizemore, what on earth were you thinking? Boys, I would be firing your agent. Of course this is just my opion...It may be wrong
