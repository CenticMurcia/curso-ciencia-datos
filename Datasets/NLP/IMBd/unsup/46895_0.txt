I`ve rented this film from my local video store under the title "Shiver".Until that moment I could never believe that it could exist such a bad movie.All the ingredients of the movie`s recipe are extremelly bad.The actors are playing terribly,the story is ridiculous,the technical part is awful and directing is unexistable.I am sure that I`ve never seen in my life worse movie than this and I am very curious how Philip Yordan ,a brilliant writer had participated in this. As I saw in credits the directors were three.Probably is required a special talent to make a combination of so many bad things.A miracle of bad taste!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
