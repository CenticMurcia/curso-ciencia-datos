A great documentary with a thoughtful ending. Madonna on tour during her Re-Invention Show, this tour celebrated 20 years of Madonna being in the music industry and all her favorite songs were covered from every album. The beginning of the show and documentary have the same haunting images from the song The Beast Within, the photography was used for a limited edition book called X Static Process and the photographer was Steven Klein. I think Madonna was showing how she had changed since the movie In Bed with Madonna. It's been a few years now since this was filmed and at the time there were big issues about the United States involvement with the Iraq war and Madonna own thoughts are aired. During the film there are flashes of music from the Re-Invention Show that are heavily edited.
