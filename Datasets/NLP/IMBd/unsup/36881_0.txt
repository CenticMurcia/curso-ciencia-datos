There was a great gaping black hole where any skill that could have been was lost entirely. I am at a loss for words of how terrible the direction in this film was. In fact, this goes for everything in the film. The filmmakers' had spunk, I'll give them that. It takes a lot of guts to let someone put your name on the credits of a movie like "Defiance." The acting (with a partial exception) was exponential horrible. It sucked harder than Mega Maid. (It is an absolute torture to watch Tony Twist in the role of Nathan Cross--he brings the same boring nothingness to the screen that he spurted for Blues on the ice!)<br /><br />And another thing, the villain was the worst in the history of cinema, that's including all B-movies. You couldn't take the guy seriously. I admire the actors who didn't crack up just by watching him act. At first, I thought this film was a comedy, then I realized they were trying to be serious. That made it all the more hiliarious, if you add, 'under the sheets' to every line that the horny old guy, the villain, and the narrator said. My friends and I had a good ol' time tearing every line apart, limb from limb, adjective from noun. Speaking of lines, the dialogue was some of the worst ever written. It just fused together with the terrible acting to create a great busty beast of performances where it felt as if they were just quoting memorized lines with no emotion whatsoever.<br /><br />Only complaint: I saw this movie. From the first scene, it felt like something I would see if I handed a camera to a couple of horny old men and watched them go into my backyard and starting filming something which I cannot put into words. That's what this film means to me.<br /><br />All in all, frustrations and failings aside, this indie sucked.<br /><br />-7/10
