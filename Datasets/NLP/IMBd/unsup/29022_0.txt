I loved Stolen! As someone who tends to shy away from documentaries, Stolen kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time! The Producer and Director did a beautiful job interpreting their very lengthy and detailed investigation on film -- I really got it and I wanted to find the thief myself. It makes you appreciate fine art and the emotions that humans attach to its presence. Stolen plays like a feature, where the suspects and the informants are all characters -- with the sweetness and brilliance of Harold Smith, to the hilariousness of the suspects from abroad -- Stolen is a true "masterpiece". It's no wonder it's been successful all over the country. It engages viewers who are not from the Boston area and deserves all the accolades and kudos it receives. I say, "Well done!".
