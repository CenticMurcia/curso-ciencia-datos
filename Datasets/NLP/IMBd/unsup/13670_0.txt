while this is not a masterpiece, as another reviewer mentioned, it is an interesting and realistic portrayal of true life sociopath Audrey Marie Hilley.<br /><br />For some reason, when this film was first shown, there were segments which portrayed the poisoning of Marie's mother- and that she initially lived in a trailer. Her primary goal, no matter what, was to get out of that small town in Alabama.<br /><br />The daughter is well played by Kelley Overbey. She is an unknowing victim. David Dukes is excellent as the Alabama prosecutor, who follows Hilley through her latest escapades. As one detective mentions, there is an increasing level of violence, starting small, with bouncing checks, to arson, to insurance fraud and eventually murder.<br /><br />David Ogden Stiers portrays Hilley's final conquest; she manipulates him from Florida to New Hampshire- he will buy her anything she wants- that is all she needs to know. It is amazing to reflect on the number of people who were taken in by Hilley, her many false identities, and stories. When she returns as Terry, Robbi's "twin" sister- it is almost too much. Apparently Hilley really did do this, and with the exception of one co-worker, everyone believed her. The husband, as played by Ogden Stiers, seemed particularly dense.<br /><br />There are some amusing scenes also, such as when Hilley teaches her daughter how to parallel park, by driving through (and over) the graves at the local cemetery. This story is all the more intriguing because it is based on truth, and apparently John Homan (Hilley's beleaguered husband) was also murdered in a bizarre robbery incident in 1989. Definitely worth watching. 9/10.
