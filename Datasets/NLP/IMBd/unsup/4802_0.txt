This movie shows the hurt that a number of characters suffer as a result of disability, race, or personal circumstances. Into their lives comes an intelligent, caring person who happens to be deaf. He helps each through the tough times and yet at the end of the day, he too had to deal with own hurts and rejections. The leading character is a young man named Singer, performed by Allan Arkin, who is still going strong forty years on.<br /><br />The movie presents the viewer with a number of sub-plots that become slightly unwieldy. Yet all the characters feel the ray of light and hope that their friend brings into their lives. The ending is puzzling at first but we can see that the problems of some people are often easier to handle than those who are their strength and support.<br /><br />A fine movie with a great performance by Allan Arkin. Cicely Tyson, Steacy Keach, Chuck McCann and Sondra Locke give great performances as well.<br /><br />This unassuming movie has a lot heart and maybe that's why it works so well.
