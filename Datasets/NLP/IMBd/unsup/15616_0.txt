Thankfully , the terrorist attacks ended the boring , multi-lingual dialog , when I could not stand it any more. The ancient director managed to bring together some of the finest actors in moviedom , each speaking his own language, having the most boring , pseudo intellectual conversations the screen has ever seen, in a cacophony of English , French, Greek and Portuguese and in between some elementary school level guided tours to famous cities along the Mediterranean. Some of the photography is indeed captivating , if you have never been to Pompeii or to Athens , then you might as well visit them on the screen. This is really a Horrible movie, shown at festivals around the world.<br /><br />The emperor's new clothes.
