1stly this entire film is based on a total misconception. British Universities have NO fraternity system what so ever. So the need for inter house cups and challenges doesn't actually exist.<br /><br />Take 1 character from the original Van Wilder and move him to England. Then put him amongst as many British stereotypes as possible.<br /><br />The British University system actually allows people from all over the country to attend Universities so all accents and classes are represented.<br /><br />The only actors most Brits are going to know are Taj's parents, One from Eastenders and one from The Kumars and Goodness Gracious Me.<br /><br />This is a very poor representation of Britain and the British University system which is nothing like this. Fencing? A rarely played sport. Most Black Tie University Balls are conducted at the end of a term too.<br /><br />As for the very racist notion that the Upper class don't welcome Asians to our country is total rubbish. Many areas of Britian have huge Asian Communities.<br /><br />This is a bad film with no basis in reality and very poor stereotypes, few of which actually exist in modern Britain.<br /><br />Oh, and doesn't EVERYONE know Earl of Grey is joke about Earl Grey, the type of Tea?
