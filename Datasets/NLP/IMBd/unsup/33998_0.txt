[SPOILER ALERT]<br /><br />A Catholic priest who doesn't even blink trying to take the devil of a South American girl's body, who suddenly burns herself. An extremely modern psychic clinic in the '70s. A machine which makes Linda Blair go back to her past memories for no plausible reason. A possessed Linda Blair from the past trying to kill Louise Fletcher by taking her heart or something. An African boy from the past full of grasshoppers and possessed. A sleepwalking Linda Blair trying to jump from her building. That 'alive statue' who is said to be a priest going on a trip to a stereotypical African tribe, where he finds James Earl Jones, who is the chief of a tribe, or a leopard, or a doctor. He gives the priest a ridiculous theory involving grasshoppers and possession. Linda Blair going back to Georgetown, following the priest, who is hypnotized by that machine. There she finds many grasshoppers and a possessed Linda Blair (yes! two!), while her old house is on fire because of a car crash involving Louise Fletcher. Well, that's just an idea of what "Exorcist II: The Heretic" has to offer.<br /><br />Is it a bad movie? Yes, it is. Not just bad, but disgusting, with a terrible brown cinematography and awful performances. Linda Blair, who did a great job in the first "Exorcist", is just annoying here. Not to talk about the actor who plays the priest... And the story is just implausible, with a screenplay full of holes. It's a 'sea of holes', in fact. In addition, it often loses its point.<br /><br />"Exorcist II" was a huge disappointment for me, specially because "The Exorcist" is one of my favorite films. It was intelligent, scary, memorable and impressing. This sequel has its lone qualities, but they are very small. The movie is nothing but a big dumb mess. But if you are a masochist... That's another story...<br /><br />4/10
