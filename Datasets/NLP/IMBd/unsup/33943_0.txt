Pitiful. Desperately boring. I've seen this movie the same day I watched the 5th Element. The story is just unbelievable. Example : Delon and Belmondo do not know each other, but when they take their weapons for the gunfight (in an arsenal worthy of Saddam Hussein in his best days), they joke about an hypothetic "good old time" when they obviously have met... Another example : everyone knows that a latex ball (you know, the kind your dog likes to bite) is the perfect tool to steal a Mercedes or a BMW : just push it hardly, it's magic, forget the keys !!! I could have talked about the "hidden daughter" that comes back after years, but it has been used and reused so many times... I was even surprised to learn that Leconte had been unimaginative enough to use it again ! As an advertiser, he knows his job. But this movie convinces me he should stop spoiling film... Turning to Belmondo and Delon, they are lost for action movies. And Paradis... well, she was a rebellious teenager in "Noces blanches". And she looks quite the same in "1 chance sur 2". Perhaps she'll dare to act as something else one day... who knows, maybe as an actress !
