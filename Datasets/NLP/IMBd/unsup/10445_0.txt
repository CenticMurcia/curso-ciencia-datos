I came because I heard it was a cross between Buffy the Vampire Slayer (The Seried) and Charmed, I stayed because it was something so very different.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I'm an avid BtVS fan, and a former fan of Charmed, and I was aching for some new dark fantasy / supernatural material. I've only seen the two episodes, but you can be sure I'll watch more.<br /><br />Where BtVS and Charmed may have dealt with some dark issues, they were in general light shows. Hex is a dark with light moments. From the very beginning, this show made it self stand out from the current supernatural shows simply because it's so dark. This is not a funny show, but a dramatic one that draws you in to watch the journey that Cassie must face. Though, I must say that as I saw the end of the episode, I declared a pure Joss Whedon moment - even if he had nothing to do directly with this show.<br /><br />I highly recommend this show, if you like British dramas and dark fantasies.
