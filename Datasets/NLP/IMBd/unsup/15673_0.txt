Don't go into this expecting serious stuff. But as a light comedy, done with some warmth, it is pleasant. A shame that it has been deeply cut, all the section about the house across the road is missing (all you get is the mention from mother at the start) and since the result is a really short film with a jagged disconnect at the end, one wonders why they did that. It isn't as if the DVD is overflowing. Did the DVD editor go on holiday or just drop a can of film? Weird. The result is just wrong. Didn't anyone on the original production review the work before issuing it?<br /><br />Some sequences are laugh out loud funny. The eye candy, the tattoo, was happening, and a few other cameos. And if you ignore the comedy for a moment, there is a message and a question in this which is still unanswered, as it has been for hundreds of years (compare to the Streets of New York). The film ages reasonably well, some styles and situations are already dated but it hardly matters.<br /><br />Picture quality is generally clean, nice color. Sound quality ok but it is a pity the editors could not make an effort to give the music more body. Its just a so-so stereo track (the voices don't even seem positioned with aid of the center front speaker) and I presume for something made by Cheech in 87 there would have been some good quality masters available and an ability to position the dialog. But then editors who drop a whole section of the story probably have no motivation to spiff up the sound track either.
