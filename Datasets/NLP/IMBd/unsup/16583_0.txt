If this movie was intended to make me feel sorry for the illegal Mexicans flooding this country, well, it did not. Many years ago I saw El Norte and I was deeply touched by this movie.<br /><br />But in the meantime 30 years have passed and illegal immigration has become a sport. A competition in between Mexicans, who can falsify documents better, find a new way to cross the border and screw the system in the US better.<br /><br />I know plenty of illegal Mexicans, who live since years in the US, own houses, cars and phones and have good paying jobs. I have never seen any raid anywhere they are working. There are hundreds of day workers on the streets every day and nobody cares. The only thing they have to be afraid of is being robbed by other street people.<br /><br />The tear jerking story of the mother, who leaves her child to clean toilets in the US and sends back money for sneakers and birthday parties, did at no point convince me that there was any necessity for her to leave her child and come to the US.<br /><br />The whole movie makes fun of the immigration problem and is actually misrepresenting the situation to get tears.<br /><br />If Mexicans would put as much effort in creating jobs in Mexico as they put effort into falsifying documents and crossing the border illegally, maybe Mexico would be better off. It is a beautiful country and I always wonder why people want to leave their families, culture, tradition and friends to clean toilets for other people and live in crammed quarters in usually ugly neighborhoods. The American way of life does not mean quality of life and at least the mother in the story sees that point.
