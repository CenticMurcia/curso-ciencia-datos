This is one of the worst films of the year. There is no screenplay to speak of. There was not enough scares. They didn't need all the gore that they put in this film. The characters are so paper thin that they could float away. G. Rush overacts big time in this film. This was a complete waste of my time. Even the "surprises" in the film aren't clever or they are completely wasted in the next scene. This was a poorly done film with scenes just thrown together to make a movie. AVOID THIS!!!!!!!!!!
