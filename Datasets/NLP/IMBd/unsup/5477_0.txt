I loved this movie.<br /><br />**** Spoilers below ************<br /><br />It has the the supernatural going on all around while no one can see it. Is it really happening or are they hallucinating? A priest with a number running around high on LSD and virgin's blood.<br /><br />The play on all the popular satanic subcultures was funny. A priest, trying to do evil like an amateur and then getting beat up at a death metal show. Drug guzzling death metal loser who lives with his mom saving him at every turn, not to save the world, just hanging with his new pal.<br /><br />It made me laugh while keeping me on the edge of my seat the whole time.
