and that particular year says more than you can think of. and the year is probably the only reason that i first started seeing that awful movie. the plot is about a group of students coming too their psychology teacher's house, who get his kicks in telling "scary" stories. every one of them on his turn telling his spooky stuff. and add to that crap, - while the whale thing is going, there's a stranger with an ex outside. oh well, that movie is a great example of just nothing interesting. the story's are all boring one after another, and the outline happening is lame too. so there some walking talking skeleton effect.. so do the 1958 "The 7th Voyage of Sinbad" do, and it looks much cooler. one of the inner story's is on four girls looking for a place that they can get into, because of their young age, after failing in that, they are find themselves in the "bad part of town", well that just could be a real cool story, but that bad part of town, isn't really as you might expect, it's just a typical warehouse area. now that's a real shame.
