This is so forgettable. I know that if one were to dig, he could find some kind of clever sci fi in this. It's just so darn dull. The characters are caricatures. They are entirely tongue in cheek. That's find when you have a solid jumping off point. To get to the yucks, you have to wade through so much uninspiring dialogue. Many have said they thought Kay Lenz could carry things. As a Hollywood beauty, she is passable. She is an actress from a time of really forgettable actresses. They would pop up on TV shows and then disappear. Unfortunately, she isn't that great, at least I see nothing that separates her. Also, the events that pop up are uninteresting and we aren't part of the joke. Don't bother with this.
