Go out and buy this DVD. Better yet, Amazon currently is offering all three in the series (Gondry, Spike Jonze & Chris Cunningham) for $35 with free shipping.<br /><br />I bought all three at a retailer for $45 and I thought THAT was a bargain after watching this one on Michel Gondry. If the other two are as good, it IS a bargain! But at $35 for all three, now that's something nobody interested in "new directors" should pass up.<br /><br />The fact is, I've rarely seen anything as brief, intoxicating and innovative as the videos on the Gondry disc. Not only do you get a two-sided disc with 20 or more music videos, you get some of this guy's early work (home movies), a 52-page booklet designed by Gondry, very funny interviews and videos of his early band (Oui Oui) performing at the base of the Eiffel Tower.<br /><br />The four hours plus of material is fascinating.<br /><br />I highly recommend this disc.
