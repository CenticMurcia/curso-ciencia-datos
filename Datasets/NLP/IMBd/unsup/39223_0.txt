A review from mattymatt4ever from Jersey City isn't helpful in reviewing Lucky Numbers. Matty gives it a 7 while the average voter gives it a 4.9.<br /><br />It isn't a bad film, but shallow. Definitely below average. So the average around 4.9 is maybe more appropriate than a higher number; certainly 7 is 'way beyond the range.<br /><br />What can you expect of a film that has Michael Moore in it. That alone knocks it down at least two full points.<br /><br />You get what you pay for, so don't pay any money for this one. See it free, and even then you are spending your precious time, more than enough payment. Better yet, avoid ALL movies associated with Michael Moore.
