I can't sit still to watch many movies. Yet, this one I could. Reason number one, three hot latina women. I love latina women. Reason number two.. ehh none. It is pretty entertaining. Each of the three women have very distinct personalities. One values beauty, the other education, and the other culture. Also each one is from a different city. The man, Tomas is dating three different women. Somehow all three women end up at his house, when he trys to explain his situation, he falls out under a tranquilizer pill he took before. Then the women see a 4th woman looking in the house, and think she is a 4th woman. She is really an FBI agent. The movie's good points are some animated cut scenes which you cant tell if they are geared for kids or adults, some Spanish words. I enjoyed that given I am almost fluent in Spanish. The end gets somewhat cartoonish... I won't spoil it. But if you like Spanish culture, or pretty latina women, you should not be bored with it, also it is kid friendly.
