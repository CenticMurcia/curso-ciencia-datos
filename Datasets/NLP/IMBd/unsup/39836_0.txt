My heart bleeds for almost everyone involved in this film. They obviously tried VERY hard but the low budget shows in every frame. There is an epic movie to be made about the English Civil War ("Cromwell", with Burton and Guinness is by far the best so far), but to do the subject justice you need decent funding. Battle scenes involving 10 actors shot in close up and "can't be bothered" extras are just embarrassing. The other big problem is the casting of the enormous Rupert Everett as the tiny King Charles I. Everett is a good actor and does his best, but his casting is completely inappropriate. Just about everyone in this enterprise deserved to be praised, but it's still a rotten film. 10/10 for effort, but 4/10 for the finished product.
