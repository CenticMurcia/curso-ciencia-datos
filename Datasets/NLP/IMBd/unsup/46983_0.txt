I rented this movie thinking it was a sequel to the vastly superior Ninja Scroll. It, however, was unconnected: in fact it seemed to be unconnected even to itself, as the various segments which I managed to watch seemed haphazard at best. I would strongly advise against watching this movie, as there are plenty of better things to do with your time. This comes from someone who enjoys watching "Plan Nine from Outer Space" from time to time. While I'm not an avid anime fan, a friend of mine who is despised it even more than I. I was further horrified upon visiting this site to learn that a sequel had been made to this wretched bit of cinematics. Please, save yourself the headache and go do something more productive, like staring at the nearest wall.
