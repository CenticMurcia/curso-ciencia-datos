Horribly one sided, this propaganda piece spouts the supposed merits of inoculations (whill conveniently NOT telling that those same shots can in some instances be MORE harmful than what they innoculate against) I learned of THAT travesty first hand and it's a bitch. That part of the animated short made me so damn mad that it tainted everything that was said afterwords. Not only is this pure unadulterated propaganda crap, it's also EXTREMELY dated and isn't worth watching due to it's horrendous use of fear tactics. This animated short can be seen as an extra in the "From the Vaults" section on Disc 4 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2.<br /><br />My Grade: F
