Raw, powerful film that grips your shirt collar and proceeds to rip you into the roof of rage, drag you down walls of ugliness, beauty, disgust and sorrow that are all human, and finally drop you breathlessly into serene consciousness. Actors are terrifically on-target; I hope this opens new doors for Warburton and gets Matiko greater exposure. I've always been a Roberts fan, but this one brings out something in him I've not seen in a long time. Writer/director Beaird also did the film Scorchers, which I recall recommending to folks years ago when I worked in a video store -- now here's another to add for truly, refreshingly, "touch-my-soul" viewing.<br /><br />Additionally, since Maxwell Bright was shown as part of Scottsdale's International Film Festival, producer Steven Wolfe and actor Patrick Warburton hosted the filming and stayed after for a Q&A -- REALLY wish there were more of that in this country. Both gentlemen offered a grounding, personable and humble connection between film-goers and film-making (smilin', but I can't resist -- Warburton appears much the shy boy, proving his talent on screen, and Wolfe brings an authentic, accessible face to the business of producing). Nice, truly. Really nice. Fantastic evening.
