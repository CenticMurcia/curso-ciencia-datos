I recommend this movie: "matando cabos" It's a very funny movie, you will forget your problems because you will be laughing since the movie start to the end. There are more good movies in Mexico, like "Como agua para chocolate" , Nicotina , Amores Perros"., so Mexican people are doing a good job with this movies. In my opinion, the actors are good, anyway, this kind of movies are good for distraction, laughing, and when you want to have a very good time and want to forget your own problems. The director did an excellent job with this movie, including the actors were working on it. Some American movies are boring, and they suppose to make you laugh.
