I am a big Arnie fan, have been since I was old enough to operate a V.C.R and I will defend him as charismatic Actor who has been in some brilliant films. However this is not one. Arnold himself would agree. But as a young 22 year old Austrian Bodybuilder's first film it's not his fault at the time he couldn't even speak full English.<br /><br />As a comedy this film is hilarious I just played a little bit of the film for my friend and he fell to the ground laughing at the part where Arnie flys past the plane window. The editing is terrible sound keeps changing per frame (As a film student I would get failed for such sloppiness), the lines are cheesy but funny in an unintentional way and that bear fight.<br /><br />I guess the reason I find it so funny is it reminds me of the half assed films me and my friends have done bored when nobody can act and lines seem stupid.<br /><br />I urge you to watch this film at least once big Arn has come along way.
