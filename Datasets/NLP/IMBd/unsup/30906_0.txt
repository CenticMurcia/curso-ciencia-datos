The Evil Dead was called La Casa in Italy and that means The House, Evil Dead 2 was La Casa 2 but Ghosthouse is La Casa 3 so this is Evil Dead 3 in Italy but although this has nothing to do with a cabin and deadites Ghosthouse is a very good film. The music is very creepy and does sometimes send a chill down me especially with the ghost of the Girl and the Clown doll that haunt the people in the house.<br /><br />The gore is another interesting thing because the murders are something different for a ghost film, the acting is OK in some parts but that isn't a main thing for Ghosthouse. If you're interested in a haunted house flick with something different to it then check Ghosthouse out for some creepy and gory scenes.
