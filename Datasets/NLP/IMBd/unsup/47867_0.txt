I don't know where to start but one thing is for sure, this is the worst film I've ever seen.<br /><br />The plot is everything but good (a guy wakes up to find out that he has "lost" his penis), the acting is poor - Joop for example mumbles his lines which makes it sometimes very hard to understand him at all - and the few attempts to be fun (Jekyll tries to have sex even without his penis) simply fail.<br /><br />I really started to like German movies in the last some years but if this is the new German style I just have to stick to Hollywood productions.
