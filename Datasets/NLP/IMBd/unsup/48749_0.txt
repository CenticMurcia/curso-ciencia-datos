In this short, under an hour feature, all we have is the narrative, which, although risque in 1915, seems tame today. There are no production values, directorial technique or performances that are in any way above the merely adequate. What is most interesting is the ending where the racial intolerance of the age manifests itself with a courtroom rising to lynch the Asian who has branded the white woman for failing to keep up her end of their bargain. Society may tolerate him as a plaything, but he must never think he is one of them. Don't bother seeking this out unless the racial bigotry theme interests you.
