The only excitement i got from this movie was from watching the rather pert behind of Tamara "Sexy Eyes" Davies who has clearly been doing some Yoga.<br /><br />The whole I'm an ex- CIA agent, whose still really working for the CIA - shhhh don't tell anyone got old after Mission Impossible 1 and stinks here about as much as MI3 does.<br /><br />Lovely Tamara runs around a lot which is good, really good ...pause, rewind, pause, rewind - but the plot/storyline and ending are just rip after rip after rip off.<br /><br />If your a seagal fan don't watch it, he was probably depressed when He made it..and now I am.
