For generations, the people of the City of Ember have languished in a world of artificial lights. But Ember's once powerful generator is failing and the great lamps that illuminate the city are starting to flicker. Now, two teenagers in a race against time, must search Ember for clues that will unlock the ancient mystery of the city's existence, and help the citizens escape before the lights go out forever.<br /><br />One of the most entertaining adaptations from a book that I've ever seen, even a different league from Harry Potter himself, "City of Ember" is one of the best films I've ever seen. It's painfully short and saying that is a paradox of a compliment and a flaw. The first book in the series of four books is obviously a set up and the movie acts like this too, which is unfortunate.<br /><br />If you couldn't already tell, this film didn't make a lot of money in the box office. Basically, it bombed. What does that mean? The possibility of the next three movies is very slim and that means you and I are going to have to read the books to find out what will happen. Like I said, it's just a shame. The film is fantastic with an incredible amount of imagination, a fantastic production design, and a grim look. It would've been great to see all four films get made.<br /><br />Getting that out of the way, I loved the fact the film was darker than most family films. It's dark, yes, but not very dark like "Prince Caspian" or "Harry Potter 3" but it's dark enough to have teens and adults be drawn and spellbound by the movie. It's very enjoyable and the movie ends like that because of the fast pace. I honestly wanted the movie to be an hour longer because everything went by so fast.<br /><br />Oscar nominee Saoirse Ronan is here still giving her best. Her performance is very well done and just authentic. She's one of the better young actress out there and shines this bright light at us that we fall in love with her the first second we laid eyes on her. Harry Treadaway does well as her friend, although nothing very special. Tim Robbins and Bill Murray seemed wasted here because they don't appear in the movie that much.<br /><br />The movie is very entertaining with a great use of imagination, fantastic special effects and production design, and a very intriguing plot that would captivate any willing viewer to watch the movie. Like I said earlier, it's just sad when you see such a good movie go to waste when people don't watch it and forget about it. Let's just hope they will make another movie.
