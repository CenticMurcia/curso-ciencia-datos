I rented it on a whim from the 99cents section at my local blockbuster. It's premise sounded cute and I like to take chances on independent films. I'm still not sure how this film found it's way to my local Blockbuster. The actors were just as good as middle school children in a local theater production. In others words you could see them trying to act and failing and there is no chemistry between any of them. The only redeeming quality of the film is the songs used through out the film. I could go on about the quality of the cinematography, but I will not. I think if you still want to see it after hearing how bad the acting is, then it's your time and your money to wasted. Don't say no one warned you.
