Very poor and unimaginative action pic which finds detective Buster McHenry (Kiefer Sutherland) teaming reluctantly with American-Indian Hank Storm (Lou Diamond Phillips) in order to catch some crooks who stole a priceless Indian spear.<br /><br />The story, from David Rich, is little more than an excuse to get these two former brat-packers back together for one last fling. As a pairing they are pretty good, but neither of the two really put out in this flat, predictable cops and robbers garb. Jami Gertz (from "The Lost Boys") pops in as the heavy's girl.<br /><br />Over all this was an all too forgettable way for these two young, potential laden actors to close out the eighties.<br /><br />Tuesday, November 3, 1998 - Video
