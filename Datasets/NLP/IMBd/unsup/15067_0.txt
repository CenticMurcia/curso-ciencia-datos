In April 1994, the middle-aged Canadian journalist Bernard Valcourt (Luc Picard) is making a documentary in Kigali about AIDS. He secretly falls in love for the Tutsi waitress of his hotel Gentille (Fatou N'Diaye), who is younger than him, in a period of violent racial conflicts. When the genocide of the Tutsis by the Hutus in Rwanda begins, Bernard does not succeed in escaping with Gentille to Canada. When the genocide finishes in July 1994, Bernard returns to the chaotic Kigali seeking out Gentille in the middle of destruction and dead bodies.<br /><br />The heartbreaking and powerful "Un Dimanche à Kigali" is certainly the best Canadian movie I have ever seen. The engaging story is a sort of complement of "Hotel Rwanda" and "Shooting Dogs", focused in the romance of a Canadian journalist and a Tutsi waitress, but disclosing also the genocide of the Tutsis in the landscape of a troubled Rwanda while the West simply ignored and turned back to the fate of millions of people. Luc Picard has a magnificent performance that would deserve a nomination to the Oscar, if this award was really concerned with great movies and performances; the gorgeous Fatou N'Diaye has also an awesome performance in the role of Gentille. The direction is realistic, supported by stunning cinematography and scenarios. It is worth seeing this gem recommended to lovers of great movies. My vote is nine.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Tensão em Ruanda" ("Tension in Rwanda")
