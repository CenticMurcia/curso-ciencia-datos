This film is brilliant, i loved it,everyone should see it, I only bought it because vincent kartheiser was in it. Im so glad i bought it,definately one not to be missed.A brilliant performance from Vincent Kartheiser (Angel AKA connor)who plays the misguided child, Tommy.Also Andy Garcia (oceans eleven) and Linda Cardellini (scooby doo).
