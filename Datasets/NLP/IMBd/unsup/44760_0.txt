The idea was not so bad...but the script was. Too much theories, too much dialogues for nothing. And when i say nothing i perfectly describe the end of the film. NOTHING. An hour and a half of runing away, from Florida to Bahamas, to end on a "I hope this will save our world" on a magnificent ocean sunset. The hole film is about a stupid disk on wich an old man says he found the key to predict the futur and wich is also the proof that god exists. Come on... And what is that key and How does it work? Is it really on the disk? All questions left without answers. All that with a really bad photography, bad acting and no sens scenes that would be best put in the "Deleted scenes".<br /><br />I do not recommend this film.
