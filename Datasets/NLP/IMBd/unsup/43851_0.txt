This film was truly awful, its a shame i read a review saying it was like true romance, "true romance being a 10 and this an 8". As true romance is my favourite film i thought i'd given it a go. I wish i'd watched true romance instead. Christian Slater is the only good part in this film and the only reason he is in it is because he must be a bit hard up for cash. The whole way through this couple are disgustingly cheesy and its an extremely cringeworthy film to watch. Also i just kept thinking, why? Why on earth would you do that?! Hated it and cant believe i watched it till the end. I gave this film a 2 and to be honest even thats being a bit generous. I don't blame the actors for the cheese in this film because they weren't overly that bad, but the writer, some lines were terrible. This film is nothing like TRUE ROMANCE.
