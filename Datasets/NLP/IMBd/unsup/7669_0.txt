Cannibal Apocalypse(U.S. title) is the only Margheriti film that is ultra-violent. I am not a big fan of the gothic Italian cinema, though he is regarded as a master of this genre. I have seen an interview with him where he states he didn't want to make this film as violent as it is. He claims that was the producers desire. Although not as gruesome as the third world italian cannibal film cycle( the whole film takes place in Atlanta, GA)there are scenes of exreme violence: eye gougings, face smashings. throat ripping, and a huge hole blown through the torso of John Morghen. Features John Saxon of Enter the Dragon Fame.Italian gore freaks take note.
