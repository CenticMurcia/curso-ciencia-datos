If anyone is labouring under the misapprehension that Mickey Rooney can act, they will have their belief crushed in this dreadful work. In fact, the only decent acting (amongst the major actors) comes from Lewis Stone, but he looks so out of place with the rest of the cast, that at first you think he's the bad one. Stone's delivery is actually very well timed and delivered with aplomb, but this doesn't match the rest of the cast, and it is initially easier to put the blame on him, rather than the real perpetrators of the poor delivery. Oh yes, I should add that Judy Garland has considerable talents, but none of them are properly exploited in this filmic dross. 1939 was destined to be her best year (Wizard of Oz).<br /><br />The script is dire, and worthy only of an essay written by an average 10 year-old. In fact, it is often worse, and quite confused. For instance, the scene where Rooney is asking Stone for money to buy a car is probably the worst bit of writing I have ever seen on screen. Actually, 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!' positively shines, and becomes worthy of an Oscar in comparison.<br /><br />On a more personal level, I did enjoy the inclusion of the 'Ham Radio' scenes, as it was in its infancy in 1938. I found it interesting to see that all the procedures and conventions had already evolved into much the same form that is still used today. However, I should also add that this does not mean that the actors were up to the task of being convincing during the said scenes. Far from it, in fact.<br /><br />To be fair, the technical values of this film are good, for the time. There are some nice camera angles and the use of light and dark was almost up to 'The Third Man' standard. Unfortunately, the script and acting let it down.<br /><br />I have not seen any of the other Andy Hardy films, so I have no way of comparing them. Now I have seen this one, I am a bit loath to 'dip my toes' in any of the others! Overall, I gave this film a 2/10 rating, but I wonder if that should really have been a 1? It was a close run thing!
