At home, old carpenter W. Chrystie Miller's wife Claire McDowell is in failing health. At work, Mr. Miller finds himself pushed aside for younger, more agile, hands. Fired, the aged Miller finds it impossible to find a new job. When his money runs out, Miller is unable to support his ill, starving wife; desperate, he turns to crime.<br /><br />Director D.W. Griffith uses film to ask the legitimate social question, "What Shall We Do with Our Old?" Miller is fine as the man whose crime was getting old. McDowell was not old, but suggests it with some success. The always great Biograph team is highlighted by Donald Crisp, performing very well in court; he is the expressive bailiff in the foreground, to the left of your screen. Mr. Crisp is clear; the conclusion is not so much. <br /><br />**** What Shall We Do with Our Old? (2/13/11) D.W. Griffith ~ W. Chrystie Miller, Claire McDowell, Donald Crisp
