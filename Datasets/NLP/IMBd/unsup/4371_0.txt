The 1970 version of The Out of Towners was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I first saw it when I was a teenager back in the 1980's, but I rented it just last week because I needed to be cheered up.<br /><br />This is the type of movie that when you watch it it will make your day. You cannot think about anything else but the craziest that is happening on screen.<br /><br />Jack Lemmon was fantastic as George Kellerman. He is truly insane and the movie would have been dull without him. Sandy Dennis was perfectly cast as his wife and was a perfect compliment to Jack Lemmon's confrontational and neurotic character. I see that the director was careful to not put any distractions that would have taken anything away from the film such as making sure that Gwen Kellerman was an average looking (and acting) wife.<br /><br />The whole movie was hilarious, but I thought the funniest parts of the movie for me were 'The Car Chase' when George and Gwen went along on a high speed chase in the police car that was supposed to take them to the armory. Then, if things couldn't get worse, the crooks take over the cop car with George and Gwen still inside and then decide to dump them in the middle of Central Park. The second hilarious scene was scene with the lost little boy and the chase by the policeman on horseback in Central Park. Later that morning, after being kicked out of the church where they were praying, George Kellerman goes on a tirade in the middle of the street "YOU HEAR THAT NEW YORK, WE DON'T QUIT! NOW HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT!!..." This is the perfect movie to watch on a rainy Sunday morning or if you're feeling down and that the whole world is against you.
