Jennifer Jason Leigh is a consistently unsurprising actress. As the years go by, the virginal teenager she played in "Fast Times at Ridgemont High" appears to be the anomaly on her resume. Specializing in characters on the proverbial brink, Leigh becomes rudderless in 'ordinary' roles, such as her corporate's assistant in "Backdraft". That said, Leigh fits right in with this cockeyed character study-cum-thriller about an unstable girl who inherits a nightclub with a shady past. The narrative is so gummy, at first I couldn't figure out if the building was also used as a hotel, or if Leigh's character was planning on living there full-time. A few jagged bits of delusion stand out; otherwise, the ingredients of this stew fail to come together cohesively. Leigh plows through all the silliness as if it really means something--as if her life depended on it--but her conviction in being the ultimate square peg says more about the actress than this character ever gets to express. * from ****
