After watching this, strangely Faustless version of Faust, two things came to mind... One, that this was never intended to have anything to do with "Faust" and two, that I had just wasted two hours of my life.<br /><br />Now, B movies are great. if you want to laugh at campy dialogue, bad acting, gratuitous violence and no hint of plot what so ever, B movies are king queen and half the court. But this takes it all to the Nth degree, and everything comes off as trying far too hard, and being just too stupid for words. From the impossible tangental character shifts, to the way the lead "actors" eyes cross whenever he's upset, this movie is enough to make Mephisopheles himself throw the television of the window.<br /><br />The only up side to this travesty is the decent special effects (the Demon/Batman-wolverine guys costume accepted.) Indeed even before the credits appear, it is shown in large letters that yes, this movie did win an award for them. However, in the context of the rest of the picture, it only makes the viewer realize that special effects don't mean as much as they once did, since any idiot with a computer can make a half realistic looking... anything.<br /><br />If you want to enjoy a good B movie, watch the Evil Dead Series, Death Race 2000 or one of my favorites, They Live. But please, for the love of Ed Wood, if you ever get curious about "Faust," remember that you can get the same experience rubbing sandpaper over your open eyes and less the cost of the rental.
