Perhaps one of the Scorsese minor masterpieces that sometimes get lost when considering "Goodfellas" or even "Mean Streets," films that get the bulk of the chatter. This, along with "King of Comedy" run in a very different vein, combining black comedy with tension and suspense as a central spine to the piece. Sure, Goodfellas has some black comedic moments, but on whole, it stands as a "drama" rather than a comedy. This is a VERY different film and will cause you to laugh and to shake your head in sympathy and mutter "Oh NO" more than once. I rated it a 9, I have no idea why this got lower marks than that. See it more than once.
