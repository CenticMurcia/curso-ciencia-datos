This is an awesome production. 4 DVD's and almost all of the show. It includes highlights of the day including Queen, Black Sabbath, and The Pretenders. I bought 4 of them and gave three to friends for Christmas. The list of artists includes many hugely influential musicians, including David Bowie, Eric Clapton, Madonna, Elton John, Neil Young, the Beach Boys, Paul McCartney, U2, The Who, Sting, Bryan Adams, and many more. This release features more than ten hours of performances and a documentary called FOOD, TRUCKS & ROCK N' ROLL. Proceeds earned from this release go to the Band Aid Trust, which provides food to hungry people in Africa
