"Quantum paleontologist" Dr. Rick Marshall (a gone-really-feral Will Ferrell) provides another apt description of the agony in store for viewers of this thoughtless rehash, but it is so sacrilegious that he'd already be erased if he'd said it about the Prophet, rather than about Jesus. Couple that with all the unfunny gay and masturbation "humor," and most viewers will come away with shoulder cramps from cringing during LAND OF THE LOST. When a movie tries to appeal to boomers, teenagers, and families simultaneously with a mixture of non-erotic sex and cheesy special effects along the lines of those in BE KIND, REWIND (only 1,000 times more expensive), it stands to alienate all three potential audiences. I've seen all 10 of IMDb's recommendations for people who like LOST, and each of them is DISHONORED to be mentioned on the same page with LOST. Out of the 5,000 movies I've seen, only ONE of them merits to be in the same circle of hell as LOST: 2007's AQUA TEEN HUNGER FORCE COLON MOVIE FILM FOR THEATERS.
