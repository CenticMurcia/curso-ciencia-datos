This is one of the movies i really, really hate. The plot is so generic and clich√©d, it made me cringe in embarrassment. Stableboy ascends to hero and, with the help of his dragon and a few Chinese Kungfu-fighters (who looked like they were outfitted in a bad costume shop), overthrows the evil usurper, who happens to be another dragon. The twists were highly predictable, the ending disgustingly saccharine. To make a bad movie worse, the PG-Rating took the last drop of seriousness from the movie, leaving a witless comedy for handicapped toddlers. What can i say, there are no redeeming qualities in this under budgeted, soulless mess, except for the score which was a rehash of Randy Edelmans magnificent work.
