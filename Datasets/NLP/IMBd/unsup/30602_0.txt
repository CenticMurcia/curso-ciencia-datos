Lester's "serious" film is a stylistic and cinematic masterpiece that -like much of Lester's work- has been underrated for decades. "Petulia" features the performance of a lifetime for Julie Christie and stunning work by George C. Scott and Richard Chamberlain.<br /><br />This film is amazingly shot by Nicholas Roeg (!) and is a riveting piece of timeless cinema. A must-see.
