A wretched, wretched film that I recommend NOT seeing. I hated it. Bill Murray is capable of much funnier stuff! I'm not sure how this script was ever approved by movie execs, but someone must have been feeling drunk that day. I'm also not sure how they got Richard Dreyfuss or Bill Murray to star in the film. Maybe they had some really good blackmail on the two of them, or they just needed some beer money?
