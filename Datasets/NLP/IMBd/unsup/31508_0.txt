they turn milady into a ninja sorceress, for no apparent reason. the ensuing special effects are lame. lackluster wirework, sword fights few and far between. some of the actors are pretty (boys and girls, with character) but there is no real chemistry nor, alas--and this is the real kicker--any 'panache'. a long, humorless, horribly misguided waste. <br /><br />there really isn't anything more to say of any importance. they retain much of the outline of dumas' story, but it is perfunctory, and disposed of as quickly as possible in order to move on to pointless development of the devil sorceress "plot". <br /><br />also, us DVD release of this movie is dubbed, badly, with no option to view with original soundtrack.
