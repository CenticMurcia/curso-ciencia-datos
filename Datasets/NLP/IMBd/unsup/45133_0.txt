Nona Brooks is an American singer in a nightclub in the middle of the African jungles, is trying to scrape enough money to get back to the US. When a British intelligence officer is murdered by a pair of Nazi spies in order to get a document that would reveal their identity, Nona escapes from the nightclub, unaware that she is carrying the document. She joins up with Larry Mason, an American archaeologist, and they, along w/ Larry's valet Jeff, try to prevent the spies from capturing them, until they fall into the hands of a cannibalistic tribe. It seems Monogram was trying to cash in on the fun they had with King of the Zombies, but lacks the style that picture due to Yarbrough's listless direction, making this one feel just ho-hum. Not much to rave about from King, Judge, and Moreland, however Criner steals the show as the Oxford educated tribal chief, unfortunately he's only in the last 10 minutes of the movie. Rating, 4.
