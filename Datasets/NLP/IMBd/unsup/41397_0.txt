Albert Finney as Winston Churchill, Vanessa Redgrave as his wife Clementine and Linus Roache as Ralph Wilgram star in a fine, pre-WWII biographical look at Winston Churchill from his being viewed as a minor irritant and alarmist to his rise to the head of the Royal Navy, before his becoming Prime Minister. At the start, Winston is a vocal opponent of the appeasement policies of the Prime Minister Chamberlain but few pay any attention until a man with access to top secret information begins to feed him real data revealing the truth of the buildup of Nazi military forces which indicate a definite goal of European domination. Frequently despairing of ever being listened too, we see Winston go into times of deep depression overwhelmed by the feeling of powerlessness in a nation whose memories of WWI still horrify the populace into desiring peace at nearly any cost. However, always at his side is his rock, his beloved Clementine, not only consoling but encouraging him to remember his motto to ?keep buggering on? no matter what. Armed with the top secret data, he begins to finally get the attention of the nation as he desperately pleads with his countrymen and women to build up the vastly depleted British military just in case the demented madman, Hitler, turns a lustful eye to Winston?s beloved country. Absorbing and insightful, I wasn?t bored for a minute watching the story of this great man?s beginnings and the great woman who bore with him and supported him through all the frustration and aggravation of trying to turn around a nation still grieving the horrendous losses of the previous war. 3.5 out of 5 stars
