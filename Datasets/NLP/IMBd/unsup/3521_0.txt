What a relief after the deluge of gravity-defying and morally reckless athletes that careen through commercials and the evening news. What a release from the exploitative and predictable portrayals of African-Americans in films such as Black & White, Any Given Sunday, I Got the Hookup, and Next Friday. <br /><br />Finally, An intelligent thoughtful film about articulate, intelligent, upwardly mobile black people. A romance with enough sparkling humor to have me laughing aloud though I watched the film alone. In the vein of Waiting To Exhale but vastly superior to that film, we have young African-Americans struggling with love and friendship. Lee is able in elegant fashion to fulfill the greatest promise of film, which is to present a captivating fantasy that teaches us something about ourselves. <br /><br />There were believable performances in every major role with Howard and Lathan leaving the pack. Beautifully directed and moving until the end, I can't recommend this film highly enough.
