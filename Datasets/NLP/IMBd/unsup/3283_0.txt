~contains spoilers<br /><br />Whatever the director was trying to achieve with this film, I do not know. In my opinion, all he delivered was a messed up plot that barely rivals that of Executive Decision, a film whose story it was painfully obvious that he wanted to recreate. Come on. A vice president traveling in a standard 747 passenger plane? That would never happen, especially in 1997, when this movie was made. The VP always travels in a US government plane, Air Force 2. This is clearly a low-budget, poorly-made film that the makers of Executive Decision didn't want to sue since the makers of Executive Command wouldn't have to money to pay them anyway.
