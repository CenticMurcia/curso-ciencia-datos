If you read my review of "Married with Children: The E! True Hollywood Story" you already know that I hold that to a higher standard than this and for good reason. While that was actually informative, compelling, and highly watchable for even the most casual and hardcore fan alike. This is just taking heads with a lot of clips of past Married shows. No thought went into it whatsoever and it was supremely boring and tedious. Any TRUE fan of this brilliant show was let down to no end with this lame, lackluster special. Go watch the E! one (if you can track it down). This one is highly more accessible as it's an extra on the Season 1 set of the show, but it's vastly inferior.<br /><br />My Grade: D-
