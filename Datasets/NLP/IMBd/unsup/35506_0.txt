Great. Another "wunnerful" Canadian film for the cognescenti and literati to gush and chortle over as they sip their Perriers and double lattes at the latest trendy film festival. Dahling... Didn't you think the message was so, well, messagy. It's too long. What could have been done in two hours mushes and slushes on for almost three. I still don't know what it was all about despite the "helpful" explanatory subtitles on the DVD. And although creative lens flare can be a useful technique, there is so much of it here that it looks like simply slovenly photography. But weren't we daring with that full frontally nude chase across the ice for ten minutes or so. I was impressed that neither the poor actor nor his willie didn't freeze solid! As a dutiful Canadian, I forced myself to watch this eternity of people humping and hunting each other across the ice. But I hated it. Hate! Hate! Hate! Why do we insist on making movies in this country? We're much better at wine and whiskey. And if you can't be dissuaded from enduring this frozen turkey, I suggest you keep an ample supply of both on hand for your three hour ordeal.<br /><br />
