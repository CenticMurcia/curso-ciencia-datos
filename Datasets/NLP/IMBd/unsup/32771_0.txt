... Or, at least, until I stopped watching it. Lame dialogue, choppy story, and editing for which the word "cheesy" would be a glowing compliment. The acting was average at best; most of the performances were either cliche or stilted. The characters themselves were, to a person, unlikeable; I didn't care what happened to them. The movie limped along to its uninspired climax. (No pun intended, I assure you.) The word must have gone out: Give this movie good reviews; it's a lesbian flick.
