What a load of c***! The acting was lousy, the special effects could have been done better with a fork and bucket of water, as for the scenery well they could have at least done the house up a bit....Too much swearing and a on going plot that never develops were too much for me!! Even though I just managed to watch it the whole way through!! The end was rubbish too!! The acting could have been made better if monkeys were the stars!! What c***!<br /><br />2/10 and that was only because the beginning was funny!!
