When celebrating the cycle-of-life "Cabaret" sits on the spice shelf.<br /><br />A town which is occupied by a sausage-factory which comes to life when the meat-plant workers come in for rest and relaxation and perform the lessons and morality-tales which are learned from safe and unsafe handling of food and objects around different life-forms.<br /><br />That sex, love, and family must sometimes be sacrificed to perform and follow the foot-lights of the stage.<br /><br />War is sometimes a bi-product of military-personal racing to their favourite performance venue(s) where "other" children and wives lived and worked in Europe and especially in Germany.<br /><br />The cycle-of-life is the call for many to chase the memory and contact with those people and places which made them excel at something, namely war.<br /><br />That in the end the only way to keep some of the universe's life-forms from racing to a celebration of war as depicted in other films such as "Wood Stock" and "Schindler's List" was to electronically engage and control the minds and movements of those who chase a special moment based on the destruction of others.<br /><br />The difference in the end was the sausage and the workers.<br /><br />Which are you?
