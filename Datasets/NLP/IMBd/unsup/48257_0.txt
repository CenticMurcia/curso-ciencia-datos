When I watched this movie, I couldn't but shake my head and smile at the lacks,insufficiencies and oddities of this movie. The costumes, save those of the British troops, are highly anachronistic. The Indians, all with braided wigs,do not at all resemble eastern woodland natives at that period, and the rangers hardly wore green identical fringed leathers suits with matching hats. Costumes aside, the Rangers all look like bearded and jolly mentally challenged men, their sleeves tearing loose from their arms as a symbol of their increasing fatigue, contributing to the involuntary entertainment of this period piece. I realize that the old way of making movies is not the same as today, and god bless for that! I must be honest and state that this doesn't hold water today, save its aforementioned involuntary entertainment.
