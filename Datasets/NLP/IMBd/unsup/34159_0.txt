For the last two weeks, I've been watching HBO's "The Wire" on DVD, which made a big impression on me. So trying to find a replacement, I stumbled upon "The Tudors", thinking it'll be a tale of political intrigue and social transformation set in the 16th Century. What I got was a glossy soap opera interlaced with tit-bits of Cinemax porn, featuring 20-somethings hamming it up while naked. Why certainly the historical costumes and English accents could make up for everything? Call me a rube, but isn't Henry VIII that guy singing Greensleeves in one of those Skittles commercial? Guess he became that way by being such a whiny, angst-ridden little runt when younger, as "Tudors" would have you believe. I might as well be watching "One Tree Hill".
