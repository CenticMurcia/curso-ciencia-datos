This is probably the film were the budget was best used in all cinema industry. The movie takes you all over asia, from HK to Malaisya following the trail of 2 remarkable killers. One a movie Buff who reproduces the scenes of the most famous action films like Leon or Le Samurai, the other a Cold blooded Bastard who's clean as a surgeon. there are some incredible action scenes but i miss the Ballistic Ballet of Woo or Hark. Still a very recommendable movie
