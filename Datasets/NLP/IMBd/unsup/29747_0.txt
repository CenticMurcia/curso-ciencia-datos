a film encompassing an edgy kind of exquisite sensuality one of sensual exploration into the world of female sensuality and sexual pleasure and it brings one to a new understanding of many modern young women who are becoming increasingly bisexual. This film moves through this exploration without giving offence and in a careful manner. A lovely location where all is believable. The older husbands attitude is perhaps not unique as many older men respond to their wives or partners in a similar way and would be aroused and want to allow their younger partners to explore with their help and assistance. At the time the film was released however attitudes were not nearly as liberal as they are in the 2000s it was not so much the films content but what it silently inferred that was to shake people up and to raise questions their own minds.So that we focused on was it right for her "Emannuelle" to be touched by another woman, to have multiple hetro sex, or to be anally penetrated? these were serious issues in the 1997s some even illegal. But we have to judge this film in todays climate and many issues like those above no longer provoke amazement or distaste, as the moral climate has relaxed
