This movie has moved me since it first came out in the 1980's. The<br /><br />performances- particularly by Cher and Eric Stoltz as Rusty and Rocky<br /><br />Dennis- are fantastic, the camera work (by the great Lazlo Kovacs) fluid<br /><br />and superb, the make up won an academy award, the music perfect, and the<br /><br />story, well, it's almost too good to be true. It's real life we're<br /><br />watching here, and knowing that it's also a true story makes it all the<br /><br />more touching and wonderful. I watched it with my boyfriend, then my<br /><br />husband, and now with my children. It's a simple tale of triumph of the<br /><br />spirit, but it goes deep and really stays with you if you let it. If you<br /><br />haven't seen this movie yet, go out and rent it tonight, you won't be<br /><br />disappointed.......
