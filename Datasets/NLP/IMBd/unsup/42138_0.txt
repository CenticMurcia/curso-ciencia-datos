My uncle recommended this movie to me recently and since we often share tastes I thought I would try it--I like Bonnie Bedelia and Delta Burke so I thought it would be interesting. (All I can say is "what was HE thinking?") It started off pretty slow and while it introduced some very interesting characters, the story line lacked big time. Delta Burke needed a bigger role (and perhaps should have been portraying Latrelle, although Bonnie was doing a good job with that character). We could have done without Olivia Newton John altogether and they needed to do more with Beau Bridges' handicap--I'll say nothing more about it so as not to spoil this for anybody who still wants to see this movie. I can only say that this movie resembled a mix of the Jerry Springer Show, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof and maybe Kiss of the Spider Woman or Body Heat--all of which, including Jerry Springer, are better productions. They certainly did get down the Texas types, especially the women--big hair and often foul mouths (and yes I AM a New Yorker). The character portrayals were actually pretty good--Earl and his Tammy Wynette fetish was actually funny in a few spots and I thought Latrelle was well-portrayed by Bonnie Bedelia--and there was a development or two in her relationship to son Ty.<br /><br />All in all this might be worth a watch for the characters, but otherwise the whole thing fell flat. I gave it a mercy 4 for the characters and pretty Ty.
