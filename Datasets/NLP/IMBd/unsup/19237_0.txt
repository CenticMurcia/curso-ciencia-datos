i LOVE this movie. it shows that it's alright to think outside of the box as long as you have passion to do it. some of the fighting scenes outstay their welcome, but over all the movie is fresh and full of ideas. i also understand why some westerners may think the movie is strange and don't fully understand all of it. it's just culture differences. just as i watch any other foreign film, i probably miss the slang, the meaning of the songs that link to the situation in the film, and the different way of life.
