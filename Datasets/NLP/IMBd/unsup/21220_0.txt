This film was a failed attempt at recreating an urban version of 'Charlies Angels'. Don't get me wrong it could have worked if they had a better director and people that could actually act. I did not feel any chemistry between the three lead actresses all they did was say the lines. Also the way the three of them hook up in the end with the men is just ridiculous,in other films people get together naturally or there is a subtle hint that they might get together. Not in this film it was just like right your gonna be with him, you with him and so on. The action scenes were rubbish so unreal, they didn't have me hanging of the edge of my seat at all. I know that they had a low budget but there is so much they could have done. Some of the greatest films were made on a low budget i mean look at 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' that was a fantastic film. The case of this film fools you and so does what it says on the back of it as when i read it i thought it sounded really good. I still advise anyone to watch this film, as it is a good example of how bad a film can be and it gets you thinking how it could have been improved.
