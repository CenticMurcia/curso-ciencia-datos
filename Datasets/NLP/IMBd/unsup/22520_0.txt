Denise Richards and Paul Walker are two rising young stars with lots of talent. The first time I saw Richards was in the 1997 sci/fi epic "Starship Troopers" and since then she has appeared in "Wild Things", "Drop Dead Gorgeous", and the recent James Bond film "The World Is Not Enough". The first time I saw Walker was in the 1998 Disney release "Meet the Deedles". Since then, he has appeared in "Pleasantville", "Varsity Blues", "She's All That", and most recently, "The Skulls". But I find it hard to believe that a couple of years before these two actors started showing up in these movies, they starred in "Tammy and the T-Rex". I saw this movie on the USA station not too long ago, and I couldn't believe what I was seeing. This movie is a complete mess. The first 15 minutes of the movie were O.K. which starts out as a love story between two teens (played by Richards and Walker). Then the movie takes a disasterous turn after the opening 15 minutes by turning into a sci-fi/horror/comedy with no wit and no imagination. The comedic moments are not funny, and one scene in the movie (involving Paul Walker) made me cringe big time (if you've seen this movie you probably know what scene I'm talking about). The filmmakers should have stuck with the love story then they might have had a good movie on their hands. But no. They had to throw in the plot with the dinosaur. Ridiculous. If you really want to see a good movie staring Denise Richards, see "Starship Troopers" or "The World Is Not Enough" (even though most people didn't like her in the latter). If you want to see Paul Walker do some good acting, see "Varsity Blues". Don't waste your time with this nonsense. I wouldn't be surprised that if you walked up to both of these actors and asked them "what was the worst movie you ever made?" both Richards and Walker would say this one. I'm sure they regret that they took part in this disaster. <br /><br />1/2* (out of four)
