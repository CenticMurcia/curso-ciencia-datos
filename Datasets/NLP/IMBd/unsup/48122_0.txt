I went to "Best Buy" one day browsing through the horror section and I happened to glance at the movie "The Dead Next Door" and i had before read reviews on numerous websites that stated it is a fun and enjoyable cheesy horror b-movie...BIG MISTAKE buying this movie...The Budget not only made the movie cheesy and sh$#ty but the acting was Horrendous!!! I almost could have believed that a few young kids made this movie with ketchup and other home appliances...Basically, the plot was lacking and the acting stank-ed.<br /><br />I would never recommend anyone to go out and buy/watch this movie on account that you will feel used and bored half of the time.
