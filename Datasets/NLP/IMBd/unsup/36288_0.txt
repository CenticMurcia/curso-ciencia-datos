My English is not very good (and i'm sorry for that), but this ''movie''is one of the stupidest I ever seen! Low budget movie with stupid, simple and awful story about 3 guys going to Bratislava (capital of Slovakia) to have some fun with slovak horny girls and they get killed by unearthly brutal people of small country Slovakia. This movie shows Slovakia like some kind of backward, poor and dirty country. If you know Slovakia, you know that this movie was filming in Czech Republic(there is a lot of signs with czech language on it, also the language they speak is czech), which is lovely country with beautiful history. You can see kids robbing these guys on the street by daylight!?What is that? This is not Kosovo, Afganistan or Iraq. They are not in the war or something. You should check some websites about this. Everybody who knows something about Eastern Europe, and saw this movie, know that this is degradation of this two countries and the producer Eli Roth is moron!!! It is a shame, that they earn money on this lame, full of lies rude stupidity!
