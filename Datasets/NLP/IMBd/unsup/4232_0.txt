Holy shyte, my, my, my. this episode is amazing. I remember it being good... but... DAMN!<br /><br />They pushed the envelope once again. It's probably the darkest episode of the show besides 'Home', or at least in the top 3. Man, o', man!<br /><br />What's not to love? We had a snake eating up a guy, a girl cutting her wrists, piggies, cults, executions, satanic rituals. My, it's like going to the circus!<br /><br />I loved Miss what's-her-name. Seriously creepy and evil. An incarnation of Satan. Satan's very cool. I should really think about getting my own cult. <br /><br />Like I said, dark, well written, creepy as hell. ***** freggin' stars.
