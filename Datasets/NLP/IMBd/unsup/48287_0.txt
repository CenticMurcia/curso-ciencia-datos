Yes, I only gave it a 1 out of 10, but if you're voting on the Fabulously Awful Scale then it's really probably a 10 out of 10...I only caught the last 20 minutes on the Hallmark Channel today, but I could tell from just that short period of time that this one is a keeper for my Hilariously Hideous Films collection...Highlights: 1) the Egyptians costumes, 2) the bad make-up job on Moses, darkening his skin. (He looked like he had a streaky, orange fake tan, a la Charlize Theron at the Oscars)...and my personal favorite, 3) Joshua being randomly British, when all the other actors sounded American. (Perhaps it was explained earlier in the film somehow? Like, was Joshua from a different tribe or something?) Overall?...I'd say it was totally great, if you enjoy bad movies.
