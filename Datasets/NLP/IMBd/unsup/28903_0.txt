The interpretation of Cary Grant is very great and appreciable. The story is very nice. This is another of the excellent films made by Cary Grant, who I consider the best actor in the cinema's history. By the way, I must say that watching "Penny Serenade" on TV I have discovered a very clever actress, too, who I haven't known before, Irene Dunne.
