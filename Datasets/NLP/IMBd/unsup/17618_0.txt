As someone who was apathetic about the semantics of "marriage" vs. "civil unions", I found this movie to be very informative and very well done. It made the struggle for marriage rights real, not only for Massachusetts residents, but for the rest of this country. After watching this movie, it all makes sense - as Americans, we are all entitled to the same rights and privileges regardless of our race, creed, gender and sexual identity. That's the bottom line. Yes, the movie comes off as pro gay rights, but as the filmmaker stated after the viewing, the other side was approached, but for the most part, they refused to respond on camera. Now why is that? What do they have to hide? This film puts it all out there. It's about protection of all of our civil rights.
