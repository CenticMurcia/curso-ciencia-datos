I can't believe the show didn't get picked up for the fall schedule. After seeing the pilot on iTunes I was hooked, and wanted more. In fact most people have commented that the CW has made a HUGE mistake by not picking it up (the average itune rating is 4 & half stars out of a possible 5). The casting was excellent (Justing Hartley without a shirt most of the series, what self respecting girl wouldn't watch?) the acting was superb, and the writing was amazing. The show was far better than some of the shows that got picked up, and even better than some returning shows. Who really needed "7th Heaven" for an 11th season when they could of had "Aquaman". The CW is making an incredible mistake and I hope other networks see the response that the pilot episode is getting and they snatch this gem of a show up.
