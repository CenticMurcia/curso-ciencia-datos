Watching this movie was a waste of time....Nudity, for one thing....this was GROSS! Not only that, the storyline was quite dull and delusional. Rent something else if you see this movie on the shelf. I think "Dead-Alive" would be better than this! Heck, if you see this and don't have anything to rent, watch your television.
