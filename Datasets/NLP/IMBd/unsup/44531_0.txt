I hate movies like this. They're all the same, some white girl falls for some black. The black guy is of course rough and tough, but has the sweetest heart underneath it all. Yeah right. Only in the movies.<br /><br />I happen to be a black female, 22, and I get so sick of the way they have black people act in films. The black girls always have that "attitude". We don't all have an attitude, but you never would know that, if you watch movies. It just bugs me, this movie bugs me. Why can't the white girl ever date a black guy who isn't from the "Hood"?
