This had to become a show. they fund crappy cartoons to be crappy shows with boring story lines, and they didn't fund this or what is the problem? this is a hilarious show. I offer you the formula for this show.<br /><br />The slapstick kind of comedy of Tom and Jerry + The sarcastic humor of Family Guy = Larry and steve.<br /><br />Larry and Steve is a short animated comedy that depicts a dog, steve (Voiced by Seth Macfarlane) and his idiotic owner Larry( again voiced by Macfarlane himself) the chemistry of those two characters is just hysterical.<br /><br />i have seen the short comedy macfarlane made in 95, the life of larry. but larry and steve is even funnier. larry and steve is mainly focused on physical humor where ourrageous explosions and car crashes occur in every 20 seconds.<br /><br />if i was seth macfarlane, i would consider making this as a sitcom, there is no doubt that it'll be successful.
