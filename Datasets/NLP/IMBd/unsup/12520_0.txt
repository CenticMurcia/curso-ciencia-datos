I had to confess that i love this movie. i have lost count of the number of times i have seen this movie in a week. Wow.... Kristen Bell as Gracie plays a superb role in this movie trying to look after her 1 half sister and 3 half brothers. Eventually she adopts them and becomes their mother. A lesson out there for the parents who are ill treating their children. A must see movie for everyone. I also like the soundtrack of the movie called : I Belong" by Cherie.... when Gracie was outside racing with the other girls and met his black friend.<br /><br />10 out 10 vote for this movie. Thank you Lifetime for this inspirational movie.
