I saw a sneak preview of WALTZING ANNA and I truly feel this was one of the most enjoyable films I have ever seen. It was a breath of fresh air compared to what the studios are putting out. I can't remember the last time I cried in a theater and was so touched by a motion picture. I was moved by every performance and cared for every character. Robert Capelli Jr and Emmanuelle Chriqui, who co-star in the film, had excellent chemistry. The give and take between the two reminded me Tracey and Hapburn of years past. Pat Hingle, who plays a resident at the Nursing Home, gives a performance of a lifetime. He should be nominated for a Best Supporting Oscar.<br /><br />WALTZING ANNA, a heartwarming tale of a doctor who is sent to an old age home to work on his bedside manner, was a true delight. The first half of the movie was light hearted and touches on subjects that we deal with on the surface. But the second half was the pay off. Midway through you are captivated by the story line and find yourself caring for every character. The subject manner was deep and emotionally driven. The payoff was truly honorable. I found myself walking away from the theater feeling better than I ever felt when exiting the film . I am glad to see filmmakers touching on topics that deal with elderly care. It sounds clich√© but you'll laugh, you'll cry, and walk away with a smile on your face. It was a beautiful movie and hope it gets the attention it deserves.
