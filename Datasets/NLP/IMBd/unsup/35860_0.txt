Probably the worst film i have ever seen. On the other hand, it was quite funny because of it. I thought it was amazing that they could make all those bricks look so much like polystyrene. It's a shame because i really enjoyed the first Mortal Kombat film. Line that sums up the film, plot-wise at least. - Sub-Zero? But i killed you in first tournament - No, that was my brother, Sub-Zero. I am Sub-Zero! (Something like that anyway)
