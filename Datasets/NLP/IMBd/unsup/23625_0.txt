Another boring early 90s movie about desperate, unattractive males and the desperately conventional women who coo and giggle at them. What is comedic about this? Why is it considered entertaining to watch uninteresting, perpetual losers? <br /><br />Self-conscious "homosexual" subplot is supposed to make it new and different. Fails.<br /><br />Merits: Tom Waits, and a decent soundtrack. And perhaps a third: the Artisan DVD indicates Queens Logic was filmed in 1:33. That means no dizzying pan and scan.<br /><br />It's movies like this that turned me towards the classics. Not even the presence of John Malkovich or Jamie Lee Curtis can redeem this criminal misuse of celluloid. 3/10. Get rid of it.
