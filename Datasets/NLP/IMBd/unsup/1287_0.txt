As standard direct-to-video erotica goes, this film isn't bad, but remember, these films aren't about the plot or the acting, but about the flesh. Let's face it, if you're truly looking for a good movie, then you KNOW from the title that this isn't likely to be the answer. So a movie like this comes down to what you think of the appearance of the female leads (sexist, but true). For me, Tane McClure looked old and tired and plastic, just like she always does. But Gabriella Hall made the movie bearable, for she is simply drop-dead gorgeous, with a stunning body and a face to match. I'd apologize for the superficial review, but that's what these movies are all about. They're all about liking what you see, since the writing is rarely good enough for you to like what you hear.
