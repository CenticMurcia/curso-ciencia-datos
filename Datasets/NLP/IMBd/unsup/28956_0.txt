This is the second and final collaboration between director Christopher Cain, cinematographer Juan Ruiz Anchía, and composer James Horner. Two years earlier, these three men collaborated on one of the best 1980s dramas, "The Stone Boy". Although all the factors of that earlier film are present here, it's a very much different experience. "Where the River Runs Black" is a somewhat hybrid action/adventure/fantasy film, with enough acting power in front of the camera to make it dramatically compelling. Many fine performances appear throughout the story. Alessandro Rabelo, as the main character Lazaro is engaging. Charles Durning, Peter Horton, and Divana Brandão all give very committed performances. Durning lends depth and credibility to each word he speaks.<br /><br />Visually, this film is extremely well realized, though the VHS release gives somewhat less evidence of that (it's yet to be put out on DVD). Juan Ruiz Anchía creates many stunning sequences. There is a slow motion scene of Lazaro running through the rain that took my breath away. The visual sense of the film offers much to keep the viewer interested. On top of that, the music of James Horner constantly brings back themes of longing and beauty. It's a wonderful soundtrack.<br /><br />Overall, the story is a bit too disconnected to make this a truly great film. The many changes in pace and focus make it feel like many different films at once, and not necessarily to its benefit. For a children's film (though I hate to categorize something only as such), it is very good. The constant changes is style should keep kids interested. I certainly recommend "Where the River Runs Black", but it's not quite as believable is it should be, and not quite as balanced, even for a fantasy. It's certainly worth watching once, maybe twice. But wait for the DVD if you really want to see it as it was meant to be seen.
