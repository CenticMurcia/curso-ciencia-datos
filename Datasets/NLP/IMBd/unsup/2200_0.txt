When you aren't plenty of financial resources you use more your imagination. In this case Ate de Jong & Brian Helgeland indeed made a great use of their imagination. Truth be told; this is a light movie, the dark and horror elements are included in a fantasy context. But that doesn't make this a bad horror tale, Highway To Hell not only is a very imaginative B-flick, it's remarkable and demented (in a good sense of course); that makes it a piece hard to forget.<br /><br />The concept of hell of Helgeland is very original, there's some Dante's references here and there but mostly is Helgeland's merit all the wild ideas. A great detail is that the hero of the tale is a common kid, who finds his bravery facing the monsters he finds in the underworld.<br /><br />The creatures are fabulous, especially the she-demon that disguises herself as the girlfriend Rachel Clark and the Sgt Bedlam of course. Don't expect gallons of blood, there's a lot of creature's blood but not human beings' blood. This is more like metaphysical fantasy not a slaughtering. It can be enjoyed by teens and older people. The script is better than many of Helgeland's modern scripts (specially those movies starring Heath Ledger). It was released in the early 90's, back when it wasn't a good move release a film like this one.<br /><br />Also there are some notorious names in the cast list, whether you are interested in B-movie stars (Patrick Bergin, Kristy Swanson), rockers from the 80's (Lita Ford) or the early apparitions of today's Hollywood stars (Ben Stiller).
