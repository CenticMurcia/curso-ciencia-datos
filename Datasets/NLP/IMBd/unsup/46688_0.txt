A man is risking his life trying to find his wife after an explosion, seemingly not caring if he dies right along with her. He knows there is toxic waste in the air but when in his house he waits long to seal it off. Shortly afterwards his wife appears at the house BUT THEN HE WON'T LET HER IN! He could have been contaminated himself just anytime of the long time before he sealed the house off but after he made his late decision to seal the house off he won't let his wife in and there is no question anywhere around that he might even consider dying with his wife that he seemed so devoted to just minutes before.<br /><br />If there is any punishment for horrendous in-consequence and total idiocy then he has surely deserved it. I did not wait to find out if he got his punishment but another reviewer thankfully spoiled the plot and it seems he will get such punishment but probably for other reasons.<br /><br />Well, so far the movie. The situation the movie depicts, is however interesting. In a society where the scoundrels have the say so - who will then believe authority in a crisis? Who will omit spreading a virus for the sake of humanity, if such a authority of scoundrels tell you to? Could you believe them or, even if you believed them, would you care to save THEM? Interesting consequence of market economy with its business and general skulduggery, in other words. I guess there are many more flaws that may turn up in crisis - evil will not survive for long. Let's just hope that we are wise enough to exterminate it before it exterminates us.
