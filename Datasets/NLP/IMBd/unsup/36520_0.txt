This movie is really really awful. It's as bad as Zombie 90 well maybe not that bad but pretty close. If your a fan of the Italian horror movies then you might like this movie. I thought that it was dam near unwatchable of course I'm not a fan of the Italian movies. The only Italian movie that was OK was Jungle holocaust. Which is one overrated movie. This film is way overrated. But let's get started with how horrible this film really is shall we. The acting is goofy and horrible. The effects suck. No plot with this movie. Little gore which is the only good thing in the film isn't showed nearly enough to be worth watching this wreck. The zombies are very fake looking. It looks like it's a bunch of dudes wearing cheap dollar store masks. Please avoid this film at all costs.
