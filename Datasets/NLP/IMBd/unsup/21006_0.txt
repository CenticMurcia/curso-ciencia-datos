Can I give it zero stars? This just doesn't do it for me, and I don't see why they made it. The plot here is very forced, and has been used countless times--revenge on the good guy. Especially notable is Robin Williams' absence. (Instead, Genie is voiced by somebody from "The Simsons". I mean, come on!) The songs were an insult to Alan Maken and Howard Ashmen's wonderful soundtrack for the first film. And worst of all, the characters seem alien, like I've never known them before! I regret wasting my money back in 1994 for this trash. I would like to dispose of it, but someday I may watch it if I have absolutely nothing else to do. Besides, I regret to say (but it's true) that without this junk I wouldn't own the complete "Aladdin" trilogy. "Aladdin" fans might want to watch it once just to know what happens, but that's pretty much it. Dust off your old copy of the first one and watch it instead. Or watch "Aladdin and the King of Thieves", which was very good and featured an especially impressive return performance by Robin Williams as the Genie.
