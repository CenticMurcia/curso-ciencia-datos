I am sorry to admit that I didn't think this was good at all. I'm not the target demographic, admittedly, but if not for being with my mother, I'd have walked out of this movie. Despite an intriguing premise, the movie never really goes anywhere. There are myriad plot holes and the acting is also some of the worst I've seen in a long time. The climax was dull and unsatisfying, and likely to offend most if not all non-Christians. Religious films can be done well, but they are definitely hit (The Exorcist, The Believers, King of Kings, Ben Hur) or miss (Exorcist II and III, Stigmata). Revelation is, unfortunately, in the latter category. DON'T SEE IT.
