I am a big fan of Jeff Foxworthy. The Blue Collar Tour movies and Blue Collar TV are hilarious. Unfortunately, this roast did not follow in their foot steps. I, usually, think Larry the Cable Guy is very funny, but not this time. His comments about Corky from Life Goes On were totally uncalled for. To make such a comment about a person born with Down Syndrome was in poor taste. His comment about Christopher Reeve sat badly with me, also. If I was a member of Mr. Reeve's family I would have liked it even less than I did. Several made comments about Jeff's 'clean' comedy, but they chose not to follow in his footsteps by repeating such words as f**k over and over. When will they learn four letter words are not what makes a comedian. This show put down others more than it did Jeff Foxworthy. It attacked those with Down Syndrome, Mexicans, gays and, of course, the South, as well as others. If you were a comedian on this show, you might want to take lessons from Mr. Jeff Foxworthy. This show fell short of the usual Foxworthy standards.
