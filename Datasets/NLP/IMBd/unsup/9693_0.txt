If I compared this movie with all Egyptian movies, i'd give it 10. What's different about this one ? Same actors. that's about it. Everything else is specially different. I've never seen such performance. Lighting, music, clothing, decor, lighting again and editing.<br /><br />There is a theme given to every characters that is shown by camera positioning, specially the background. no stupid close-ups like Egyptians love. no clown makeup on every actor and actress. no exaggerations. No on-stage-like acting in real-life situations (you'll only know what i mean if you've seen enough).The screen writer who is also the director is brilliant.<br /><br />However, the story itself has no obvious target. the end is something like "and so on. no comment" or "Life goes on. stay still"!! it just shows you events and people. it's OK but not what i expected.<br /><br />This is my first review so... thanks for reading
