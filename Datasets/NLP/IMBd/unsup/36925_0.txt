Overall, I did not not like this movie. It is my fifth John Waters Movie and I am usually a big fan. Hairspray is my favorite movie of all time. I also loved Serial Mom and Pecker. I did not like this movie or Cry Baby.<br /><br />I gave it a four out of ten, because it had some funny scenes and I did enjoy some of the characters and performances; however, I did not like the story at all. <br /><br />I felt that the story tried to mesh together some of the themes from Serial Mom and Pecker, without success. I enjoyed the Kathleen Turner character in Serial Mom better than the Tracey Ulman Character in this movie. Also, I enjoyed Pecker's older sister more than Selma Blair's character (the huge boobs were a great touch though). I couldn't figure out who was supposed to be the protagonist in this movie. The only character that I liked was Chris Isaac's - maybe they should have had him be more of the focus of the movie, in the way that Pecker had the central role in that movie (and the only normal one).
