Dreary and very slow. Almost pointless. There maybe something here, but that would be a real stretch. A game between the socio-economic classes: the have's and have-not's. Pseudo-psychological? Is it possible that Nastassja falls for a male bimbo? It is no wonder that this film will probably never see the light of day in a DVD format. The darkish, grim European dock/waterfront slightly lightened up a bit by a red convertible car, driven by Nastassja.
