I've been a fan of YB for as long as I have JC, it's hard to believe he's never quite "made it" in the same way as JC & SH. In my opinion he's as good at fighting , acrobatics and stunts as JC & SH put together and that's saying something. I'm a huge fan of JC & SH. This movie is perfect for Yuen. He's able to shine in his own right with some unbelievable moments of genius! SEE IT NOW!
