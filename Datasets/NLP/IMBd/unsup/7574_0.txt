I've been wanting to see this movie for ages because I love tongue in cheek musicals and Christopher Lee is good. Unfortunatly I got the dvd recently and watched it, it's just not entertaining or funny. The singing is rather bad, even if it's comedy singing you want to have people who can sing to a certain degree, the plot is full of holes and some places makes no sense at all. But all that isn't important if it's funny and entertaining, but it isn't. I said The Fantastic Four was more entertaining, and it is (The unreleased Corman movie that is). This film was lacking that spark, the songs were poorly constructed and the actors uninspiring, if you liked Rocky Horror & Little Shop of Horrors then avoid this, the values those films had aren't here. There was one point where he was being attacked by vacume cleaners where he said "This really sucks!" my sentiments exactly. 3/10
