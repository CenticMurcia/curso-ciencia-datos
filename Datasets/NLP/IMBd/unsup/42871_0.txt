I picked this up in a cheap DVD dump bin, having remembered it from childhood - and wow has it dated. There's very little to smile at anymore! Two poms with bad comedic timing bumble around with a plank, encountering stereotype after stereotype including an equally bumbling Constable Plod who is more interested in picking up than anything. It's really only relevant today as an historical snapshot (much like the Australian film JEDDA) - a museum piece, if you will. Slapstick has been done far better than this.<br /><br />2/10 for its quasi-charm (though even that was more annoying than charming after 3 minutes!)
