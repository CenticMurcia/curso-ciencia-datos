I caught this film this past week at a film festival, and was very happy I did. The film is both well directed, and well acted. It's not edge of your seat entertainment, nor do I imagine it was intended to be. But what it is, is a very effective, believable and absorbing character study that's both technically superb and believable in its execution. <br /><br />Though he might not look like a conventionally leading man, Gabriel Marantz more than carries the film. He portrayal of the lead character is both believable, and rife with pathos. Solid film and I highly recommend it.
