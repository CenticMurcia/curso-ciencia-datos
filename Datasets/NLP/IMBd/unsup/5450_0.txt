I picked this DVD up at Hollywood Video with some hesitation. I truly enjoy the genre but have seen some much less than good "Exorcist" ripoffs. Not only was I surprised to find this one entertaining...but I enjoyed it a heckuva a lot more than "Emily Rose"! The film makers took a low budget and worked extremely well within those confines, finding innovative ways to create "demonic possession" type F/X resulting in a truly entertainingly frightening little film! This film delivers a series of good old fashioned exploitation shock effects as opposed to lengthy boring dialogue sequences followed by a mediocre "bang" for your four bucks. The Asylm Video company is consistently releasing better and better direct to DVD fare, many of which eclipse the lackluster theatrical releases that these lower budget films are counterparts to. I only wish that I'd seen this one sooner...as it would have made great Halloween party movie entertainment!
