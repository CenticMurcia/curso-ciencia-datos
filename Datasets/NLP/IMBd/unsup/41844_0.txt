This is without a doubt the worst gay-themed film I have ever seen. It's an embarrassment on every level. The script is hackneyed and unfunny. The direction -- well, what passes for the direction, is inept. The actors appear to have been handed the orders "ham it up!" Yet, the ones who aren't over-the-top are wooden and stiff. It's a shame when gay filmmakers like this Q. Allan Broka can get films like this made and provide free ammunition to the right wing who want to impede our freedom. Thankfully, talented straight allies like Ang Lee and Larry McMurtry and Diana Osanna are around to make groundbreaking films like Brokeback Mountain and undo the dame done by stinkers like this.
