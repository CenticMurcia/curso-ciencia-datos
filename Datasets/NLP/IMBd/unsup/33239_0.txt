If this were the 80's this movie would've been released directly to video. Now it should be DVD. If you have too much time and you're into b-movies, than you might like this. Although if you really have too much time, why not watching a good movie instead? <br /><br />We all have different tastes, so some people might actually like this. But the majority won't and the(ir) reasons will be the following ones: bad acting, bad script and not really the highest production values. Of course the latter is understandable, it's a low budget movie. There is nothing really good about this movie and even a Tony Todd can't save it. But since I have seen worse pictures (at least you can see they're trying here and my b-movie fable might also play a role), I gave it 3 stars!
