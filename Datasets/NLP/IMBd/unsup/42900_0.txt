There is such a wealth of creative/imaginative/outstanding films of the past century, you shouldn't waste 1 minute or 1 cent on this dreck. May I suggest you start with Hitchcock, Harold Lloyd, Fritz Lang, The Marx Brothers, "REAL" 'Walt Disney' animated films from the 30's-60's, and ten thousand more (at least a 1000 in the last 10 years). Just start by watching Ebert's 100 greatest films list, explore, expand your horizons and ENJOY!<br /><br />This is another 'family oriented' formulaic film of mindless drivel that offends anyone possessing two brain cells to rub together. Another case of marketing media products to the mindless masses. Unfortunately this apparently includes 99.9% of typical American audiences who also believe that 'Father knows best' and 'Leave it to Beaver' factually depicted typical American family units.
