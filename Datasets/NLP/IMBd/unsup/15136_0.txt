The movie was like the Godfather Part II. The truths of the triad society is shown. The loss of each person reveals that they are not heartless. Ho Nam had a heart. Chicken was capable of caring for a woman. The men's love is shown more in depth in this movie than all of the other movies.<br /><br />Ho Nam's love for Smartie had never been forgotten after her death. He changed his life after her life. What he had held most important, the triad society, changed. Losing Smartie was his awakening. While Ho Nam was in Taiwan helping Chicken with his situation, he saw a girl that looked like Smartie. But the girl was not Smartie, she only resembled Smartie and her name was Tuan Mu Rong Yu. He approached her with his situation and learned more about her. She was completely different from Smartie but Ho Nam was not the same Ho Nam before Smartie died. Ho Nam had developed into a more mature person after seeing the repercussions of his triad lifestyle. A girl like Tuan Mu Rong Yu was right for Ho Nam. Mei-Ling did not like that Ho Nam found someone that looked like Smartie but kept it a secret from her. She believed that Ho Nam would pick a person that resembled Smartie over her because she had started like Ho Nam because he resembled her ex-boyfriend that died.<br /><br />The movie has a good ending but there should have been more scenes with Ho Nam and Tuan Mu Rong Yu. The movie shows a good portrayal of the good in bad guys and the bad in bad guys that pretend to be good. All the secrets between the triad groups were exposed.
