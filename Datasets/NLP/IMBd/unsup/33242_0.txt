I'm a real fun of mythology from wherever part of the world, Grece, Italy, Norway, etc, whatever kind of movie of this genre I see and I play PC-games too, such as Age of mythology or Titans. When "Minotaur" started, the woman's words at the beginning made me feel eager for a interesting movie, but minute by minute, that excitement was going down. I waited for something better, the effects didn't like me too much, especially when the beast was running, the plot was weak. I think that this kind of movie should have a good argument, may be from the real myth, and good special effects for being a nice film where you, furthermore you enjoy the movie, learn about Mythology. Really a so so movie.
