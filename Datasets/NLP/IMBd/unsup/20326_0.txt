Boy did I get ripped off here! I get the feeling that when they were making this film they had planned to make a serious horror, and after watching it, they knew, to save face, they would have to promote it as a dark comedy.<br /><br />Its not either! Its rubbish! I felt robbed that I had spent $15 Aussie Dollars to buy it, but then I thought about how the financial backers of this film would have felt when they saw it! The only redeeming feature was that it went for 78 minutes. I feel sorry for you guys who had to sit through 91 minutes of it! Mind you Romi Koch gets naked a fair bit, thats always a good thing....
