I'm just writing here to warn people so they not get to be deceived (like I did) by the good reviews some have been giving to this crappy film. It's a disaster of a movie, and, considering it never actually gets to "move" anything, it should more be consider as a "still" than as a "movie".<br /><br />I have to say that there were a couple good ideas in it, but its really just a couple: the first one, at the very beginning of the movie, and the last one, let's say the two final minutes. The 75 minutes left were very, extremely, undeniable boring. There is no suspense whatsoever, and all we get is to see a crazy psycho boring us with his tedious blablabla theories of murders , psychology and human kind, looking directly to the camera, while he shows shorts scenes of his murders. I was so bored that I started counting the wrinkles on his face, cause he's that much of time on screen, just talking.<br /><br />I need to repeat it: What a lame movie! I really hated it. I don't remember being bored like this since I was on detention at high school. This movie really should be used as a punishment device.It was that boring. I wish I'd bought this darn film so I got to burn it. Now that would've been fun!.
