This film has proved to be a terrible disappointment. It lacks any kind of magic or atmosphere one has come to expect from recent children's films. The main characters are unsympathetic and uncharismatic, both as characters and as actors. It's beating around the bush for the first hour, and doesn't deliver much during the second. The storyline is vague and non-captivating. There is no camera-work to mention, the score seems to be copy/pasted from different public domain musical clips, and if you are expecting to see a good deal of 3D effects, forget it. Overall it gives the viewer an impression of being a mediocre TV movie from the 80s. I was looking forward to seeing this film, but completely lost interest after only a few initial shots. There's just no electricity whatsoever, and the topic of terminally ill children seems to be employed as the last resource to give this film a "social message" and depth it lacks. I suggest you don't waste your time on that film - there are so much better around.
