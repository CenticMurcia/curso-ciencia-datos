It is quite a surprise: Though his previous movies were quite bad, Otto's new movie is very nice and funny! And that's because it isn't a Otto-Film but a film with Otto, who is not the but one of the main actors. This time there is a whole lot of them, e.g. Mirco Nontschew, Ralf Schmitz, Helge Schneider, Harald Schmidt and so on. But no one of them tries to put himself in front row, it is really an ensemble movie, and that's what makes it good.<br /><br />Maybe it is because the movie has a very good director: Sven Unterwaldt, who has worked for many important TV-comedies and has a nice feeling for timing and a believable look. <br /><br />"Sieben Zwerge" is actually a lovable dwarfs movie! It isn't a joke-joke-joke-movie, but actually a nice comedy for families. It probably will attract the "old" Otto-Fans and the new young ones. As could be seen at the premiere: Kids love him and his cast.
