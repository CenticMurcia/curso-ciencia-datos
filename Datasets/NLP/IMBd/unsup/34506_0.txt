No kidding. Except for Stan Getz and jazz organist Jimmy Smith, this is one awful excuse for a movie. It's sexist, not sexy, it's base and insulting and ... well ... one of the great, if negative, cultural documents of the turbulent 1960s. <br /><br />It manages to encapsulate in a short series of badly staged, and nearly-meaningless scenes, almost everything that the '60s were really about, including the obnoxious political leaders then in power, the rampant dissatisfaction of young women with their exclusive, but all-female educational institutions, the commercialization of pop music, and the proclivity of certain Hollywood types to place beautiful young women in static combinations on a set, where they can actively leer at them with their film cameras rolling.<br /><br />It stinks. It makes a mockery of the soulfulness of the music of the era. It annoys most horribly when it could have entertained us at least a little bit.<br /><br />And worst yet, the basic story concept, of the internal conflict felt by a bright young woman who can write winning popular music, in an era still as stuffy as Mamie Eisenhower's tea parties ... was a most intriguing concept. And they got a young Nancy Sinatra to join the cast, too !! Why oh why did they not make the movie the real story of the heroine's dilemma ? Instead, it looks like a very long commercial for Decca Records and for the idea of skiing at Sun Valley.<br /><br />Yes, I watched this on Turner Classic Movies while waiting for the plumbers to come and fix a badly broken set of pipes. A big ol' tip of the cowboy hat to TCM for having the "chutzpah" to show this dog of a musical movie at all. Gotta love them for it. I wanna do lunch with their film archivists, truly .... But what a stinker of a film.<br /><br />My eyes still hurt.
