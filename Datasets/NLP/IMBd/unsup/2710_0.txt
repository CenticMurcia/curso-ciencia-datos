I love the book, Master and Margarita by Michail Bulgakov, and I was pleased to see that this series did not spoil the spirit of the book. The actors are brilliant. Anna Kovalchuk performed very well. The part of Margarita is a very difficult to play. Vladimir Bortko again showed himself as a very talented director. Everybody expected a lot from him after his last brilliant work on the Idiot by Dostoevsky (his previous miniseries). What I did not particularly like was the cat, Begemot. I wish they could do better. The same could be said about some of the special effects which looked very primitive. But, in general, very good job!
