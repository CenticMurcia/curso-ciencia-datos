A very weak and way below any kind of budget. Drive-in movie fare. While drive-in moviegoers are hugging, smooching and backseat bouncing, a lunatic is randomly picking victims to slash, dismember and kill. The drive-in is built on the former grounds of a circus and is being managed by former circus knife handler(Newton Naushaus)and his grounds keeper is the former sword swollower (Douglas Gudbye). Two dim-witted detectives(Jake Barnes and Adam Lawrence)are assigned to investigate and realize the weapon of choice seems to be an antique sword. <br /><br />Hard to find anything redeemable. Nothing frightening or scary. Some of the situations end up being comical. Also listed as players: Verkina Flowers, Marty Gatsby, Patrica James and Norman Sherlock.
