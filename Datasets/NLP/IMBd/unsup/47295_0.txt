A sarcophagus containing the remains of a Hatian voodoo priest is taken aboard a cruise ship and guess what? That's a bad thing. For the voodoo priest isn't dead, and he wreaks havoc. Most of the reason for wreaking havoc seems to be that his long-lost lover, Kenya, seems to be on board, but Kenya is played by a different actress than the woman that this man now has his sights set on, Sylvia. Not to mention that one seems to be black and one seems to be white. I say "seems" because it also seems that it's hard to tell what race people are supposed to be in this because they keep changing. ?? Now, Sylvia is the secretary and love object of Dr. Kessling, who is the man who is responsible for transporting the sarcophagus to a museum, and he also seems to have discovered the secret of its occupant, who manages to change places with an incoming professor and take his place, that is, after that particular poor soul is run over by a steam roller, egad. I really don't know how to better describe this but it's like "Love Boat goes horror" flick in the hands of some of the most incompetent film makers you could imagine. Incredibly cheesy special effects, like a severed head that looks either plastic or plaster. One cool thing though is the ring, worn by the priest, it's like a snake with a hypo on the end that dispenses curare, the better to make zombies with. This is incredibly cheap and incoherent, but worth seeing once for a few laughs and to realize that it's obscure for a good reason. 3 out of 10.
