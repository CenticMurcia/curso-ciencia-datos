When you have a good script, you can rise over the limitations of a small budget. That's not the case with this piece of junk. They could not afford good actors, the bad make-up effects are hidden by the poor image quality (intentionally poor image quality, but still...) and the script does a 360 at the end, branching to a cringe inducing subplot about a couple of serial killers that does nothing to move the so-called script forward.<br /><br />It's hard to believe that this movie is praised by some horror website when there's so much good stuff around, like the brilliant "REC".<br /><br />I can't believe I wasted my time on this piece of junk !
