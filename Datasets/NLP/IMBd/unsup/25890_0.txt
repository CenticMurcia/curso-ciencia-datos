I turned on the TV expecting to see a silly little MTV comedy, kind of like an extended SNL sketch...I didn't plan on watching the whole thing, and I didn't expect it to be more than mildly entertaining. I was shocked to find that the producers had actually made a really taut, interesting, claustrophobic thriller...much more interesting than most of what you see in the theatres. The initial 20 minutes introduce us to the seven members of "the Vancouver cast"...It's a dead-on imitation of the real show. Very believable, could have been funnier. After this initial set-up, the kids are soon kidnapped and held hostage by a rich, crazed lunatic (rejected for the show each and every year) who wants to have a Real World of his own. Cheezy premise, yes!! But what they did with it was really clever! He begins by killing the most boring housemate "There's only supposed to be SEVEN strangers...And you have no personality!!" and forcing the others to go through the usual Real World paces (confessionals, hot tubs, Truth or Dare. I was riveting to the screen, (except in the boring segments in between which feature former Real World alumni in a silly, annoying subplot). Add in a healthy dose of sex, nudity (blurred out for TV), homoeroticism and violence and you have a cool escapist thriller...Again, not at all what you would expect from a REAL WORLD movie... The Blair-Witch-esque chase at the end is cool, the camerawork excellent, and the acting and the writing is not HALF as bad as what other commenters are saying it is....They did a decent job. Very surprised to see the negative reviews. American viewers do not often seem to like genre-bending movies. I've heard complaints that the movie couldn't figure out whether or not it was a comedy, or a horror movie or a thriller or soap opera....Well, it was all of them! (although primarily a thriller). Ending is a TINY BIT of a copout, but I still enjoyed it nonetheless. Very good work, MTV. Very impressed.
