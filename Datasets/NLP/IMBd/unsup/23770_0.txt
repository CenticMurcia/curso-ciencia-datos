...Not that I think it should have ever been banned, it is just that shorts that were less disturbing and more worth watching this were banned and because of this are not very well known nowadays. The two things that could have made this Looney Tunes episode be banned is the showing of Yosemite Sam being hanged (he does not die and the fact that there even was a hanging joke is creepier still) and the fact that prisoners picking at rocks had "banning potential". <br /><br />Anyhow, in this episode you briefly see Bugs Bunny being hunted (as usual) and escaping in a surprisingly tropical scene. He digs underground and when he comes up into the air he thinks he has landed in a perfectly normal safe place. It is then that he realizes he has landed in a jail - and a policeman thinks he is one of the prisoners. A huge amount of typical farce, slapstick and Friz Freleng type jokes follow...<br /><br />I thought this episode was particularly average - there are many more worth watching instead. Some people will like it due to the league of slapstick and farce jokes, but they did not really do it for me. I laughed at a few of them, but there was only one joke in the whole episode (that was not farce, slapstick or Friz F) that I thought was particularly funny or clever (I do not want to give away any spoilers). I did not think this short was particularly bad, but it is not one that I will be watching again.<br /><br />I recommend this to people who like the farce and slapstick in Looney Tunes. Enjoy "Big House Bunny"! :-)<br /><br />P.S There was also something about Bugs Bunny here that made him lack his usual charm - he was too predictable.<br /><br />7 and a half out of ten.
