I have watched very few silent movies over the years, but was very pleasantly surprised by this one. Harold Lloyd plays - as the title suggests - a shy tailor who is deathly afraid of girls (to the point at which he stutters every time he talks to one - interestingly done in a "silent" movie) and yet writes a book to teach young men how to understand and win girls. The book captures the attention of a well-to-do young lady, and we wonder if the two of them will ever manage to get together.<br /><br />The story was delightful, and although entirely predictable, was fun to watch. The chase scene at the end of the movie as Lloyd attempts to "get the girl" before her marriage was quite well filmed, and the humour throughout, while not outrageous, was amusing. My only criticism is the message that a "poor boy" can't win a "rich girl" unless he has the money (although in fairness this seemed to be a problem for Lloyd's character and not for the girl.) All in all, this was a very pleasant way to spend an hour and a half on a lazy Saturday morning.
