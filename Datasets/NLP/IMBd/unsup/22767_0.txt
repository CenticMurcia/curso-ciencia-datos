I'd heard good things going into this one, but it exceeded my expectations to say the least.<br /><br />The movie just works. A great cast, for starters. Andy Lau steals the show, and is easily one of the most charismatic characters in cinema in recent years period. Kelly Lin is quietly beautiful and adds a lot to this movie, a down to earth aspect that many similar flicks are missing. Sorimachi is strong throughout, and Yam is used to great effect, more so as the movie rolls on.<br /><br />It all looks great to boot, a little too good at times. The movie gets a little bit too glamorous for it's own good, too... Hollywood would be a good way to put it. A few unneeded CGI sequences marred it all just a little bit. I don't think the mask parts were needed either. Plenty of other ways to highlight Tok's love for pop culture, the Metal Slug reference for example... All it was was a few second verbal reference and it had me smiling.<br /><br />Very cohesive as well. It's got direction and it maintains it the entire 100 plus minutes of the film, which is a nice departure from the disjointed mess I've seen so many films become.<br /><br />The guns almost completely sound like they're being fired underwater as well. Quite dull. Just a little quibble.<br /><br />An amazing movie on the whole though, it had me enthralled every step of the way, and I'd be content for the rest of my move going days if I could simply see a few films like this a year. Can't recommend it enough.<br /><br />An extremely strong 8.5. Maybe even a 9. Go and see it now!
