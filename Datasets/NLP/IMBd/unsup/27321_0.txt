Father and son take a trip to Salem's Lot, Maine where they discover that the locals are all vampires - who want the two travelers to write a bible for them.<br /><br />This disappointing theatrical sequel to the excellent 1979 mini-series Salem's Lot has pretty much nothing to do with the original or the novel that it was based on. This film is shamefully flat on scares and the vampires aren't even remotely frightening. For the most part we just get old people running around with plastic fangs in their mouths. Story-wise we get little suspense to sustain the audience.<br /><br />Yet despite these obvious flaws our leading stars do OK performances and there's a fine music score.<br /><br />Even still, this doesn't save this sequel from being poor.<br /><br />* 1/2 out of ****
