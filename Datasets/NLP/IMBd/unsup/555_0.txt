i cant get enough of this movie! i have watched it countless times and it just keeps getting better and better. i guess if you're an older person, then you wont like it as much. but its great for teenagers and young adults.<br /><br />the cast is hot and two of them are from gossip girl! (mackenzie and van) and one is from heroes (fischer_ so whoever says they cant act has some problems. well, okay, some of the cast cant act. like the mom when she tries to cry. hah thats pretty funny<br /><br />oh and the music is fantastic. its not music that is "in". rather, its music that is really hardcore and i just love it. it really sets the mood for those high-energy scenes. :)<br /><br />i definitely recommend that you watch this movie!
