Yet another long forgotten and unpretentious film of superior quality which seems to have slipped through the net (judging by the lack of comments !). <br /><br />I can remember seeing this excellent thriller only once many years ago but it certainly made a lasting impression on me. The interplay between Steiger and his highly intelligent canine co - star was quite riveting .<br /><br />This shamefully overlooked movie provides even more proof that you CAN, occasionally, find buried treasure if you're prepared to wander off the beaten track from time to time.
