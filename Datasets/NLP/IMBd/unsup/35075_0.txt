How many chances do you need? It seemed like Jimmy got so many possibilities, but he did not take any. I always thought/still think that true love is much stronger. <br /><br />Overall the film was pretty disappointing. The aging process was like a bad comedy, no themes we have not seen before and the acting of most of them not catching. And why is a Rumanian girl pretending to speak czech, for Eastern countries this film is a joke! Only Jan Triska, the only real czech, shows how to speak the language. Was it so difficult to find native czech speakers, who was casting? But if you still decide to watch this film, the scenery is beautiful and Jason Robards sr. always a pleasure to watch.
