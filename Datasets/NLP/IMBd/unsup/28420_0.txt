so these leeches get in you and turn you into a sex crazed zombie. that's the plot. this flick has exactly what makes a horror movie good: despair and hopelessness. it leaves you wondering, "how this boy gonna get out of this situation?!" and the hero of this flick, roger, he catches on to what's going' down right away, and acts like a true boy from the word go. what's he do when some hottie tries to get all up on him during the mayhem? knocks her out without a second thought, of course.<br /><br />cronenberg always delivers. horror fans, watch this, and take some notes.
