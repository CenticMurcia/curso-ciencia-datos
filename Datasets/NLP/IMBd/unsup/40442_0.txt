OK. Let's just say that this movie was a waste of time. If you have the opportunity to NOT WATCH IT, please don't! The humor is, well, not really humor. In fact, some of the jokes are rather disgusting (as in bird and human feces in the face a number of times). It's a total waste of a movie. The plot is OK, with the race and all, but the way they put it together? Please, can you try a less embarrassing way for the main character. As for the PG rating; what's with that? There's many mentioned and physical "love" scenes that should raise this movie to at least PG-13; even 14A if they're smart. But hey, the people who do the ratings obviously don't think kissing, sleeping together, and other such scenes deserve a high rating. Yikes. What is this world coming to? Bad movies and bad ratings... a waste of a movie.
