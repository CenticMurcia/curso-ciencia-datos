Greetings again from the darkness. And this time I mean darkness in the literal sense. What an excellent glimpse into the real process of transitioning a country from socialism to capitalism. Make no mistake, this process is tedious and painful for everyone involved. Some get rich, most suffer tremendously. This documentary is centered on the world of electricity in the former Soviet Republic of Georgia. The politics and power struggles cause nothing but frustration, confusion and darkness for the citizens. One of the citizens speaks of the feeling of oppression from living helplessly without electricity because the electric bill is more than a months pay. As a viewer we feel this oppression and frustration from the comfort of a heated theatre with plush seats. This movie reminds me of how lucky I am to live in the U.S. and how so many struggle with the basics of everyday life - things I take for granted. My only complaint is how the film glosses over the real (alleged) ties to Enron with the management of AES. No matter, the points are made and in contrast to most documentaries, Mr. Devlin does not attempt to force his views on us. He presents the picture and allows our minds to experience the frustration of not providing a solution. Tough issues that at times border on a lack of humanity. Powerful stuff.
