I actually found this DVD in supermarket basket full of discount products. 3,50 is not much, especially when it's says: The most funniest comedy since "There's something about Mary" starring: Ben Stiller, Janeane Garofalo, Mike Meyers, Alanna Ubach and many others... Alanna Ubach is the hot number from "Meet the Fockers" and Janeane Garofalo (which i personally like as well) known for her work with Ben Stiller on "Reality Bites", "Mystery Men" and lot's of other projects. So i rushed to the counter to make this disc (full of visual moments of adventure) all mine. <br /><br />I honestly did expected much more from the storyline, i couldn't watch it in one time, it's getting so boring so i took couple of days of interval before i finished the movie. Sorry, but in such cases i rather read something in between. But at the same time if they had more money on this project. They probably did much better job than the final result. Sound and visual shout for improvement. Crap movies like "The whole 9 yards" for example, had much, much more financial backup so they get more attention and credit. <br /><br />I would say, nice try, they did it because they have guts, less afraid to fail. Bruce Willis started with "The Moonlightning" as well. Look at him, he managed to survive that and he's big boy now. But retail price 3,50 is exact wright amount to ask for, no one deserve to get reach on this movie. This is kind of a student-introduction movie and not like: Hey, give me your wallet!
