I'm not going to talk about the plot or the script, no no...that things are really good in this movie but the acting...oh, the actors are incredible. Federico Luppi as always, perfect, Eusebio Poncela, really great, Cecilia Roth, better than in All about my mother (won a spanish award goya by this movie) and the boy, Juan Diego Botto, one actor i don't like too much, is perfect too. The dialogues are terrible, and the actors perfect, what you can expect is a movie where you going to believe every word of the script. Really good. I rated 9/10.
