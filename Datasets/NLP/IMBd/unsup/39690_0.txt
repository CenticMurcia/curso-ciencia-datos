Don Bluth has always been a good movie maker. His Disney movies and his ow hits like NIHM and Anastasia are sone of the best animated films of their times. I have lately decided to recap on all of my childhood movies and one I found online. I might have watched 1/3 of the movie before I couldn't take it anymore.<br /><br />First the opening scene is BEYOND AWFUL. the sparrow character is poosibly the most ugly, worst designed characters ever. He is also a bad singer. flying over a horribly CGI's environment. And then... "Ooh I love the sound of my voice!" Did they think that was funny? Anyway to the actual story. Bluth's 90's movies are well animated, but it makes some of the characters look bad. ALL of the animals and critters look like they're out of a 1940's Disney cartoon. The "Thumbelina" song was hard to listen to, the mexcan frogs were stereotypical. WHO HIRES CHARO TO PLAY ANY ROLE.on second thought, she might have been one of the only good actor on the movie. "Marry The Mole" was the WORST SONG i've ever heard ever. I would rather listen to a cheezy song from a Disney direct-to.<br /><br />Goods: Barry Manilow sang good, animation nice. THAT'S IT!!!
