`Legion of the Dead' was my first movie directed by Olaf Ittenbach and I can't say I'll immediately purchase his other achievements now. Ittenbach is supposed to be a funky, amateur gorehound who stuffs his films with grotesque violence and cheerfully absurd characters. Well, it is gory all right, but even more stupid and pointless. Legion of the Dead seems to handle about all sort of things, but nothing in particular. And in the end, it'll just feel like you've wasted yet another 90 minutes of your precious life. Two main storylines are presented during the first hour of the film. A couple of retarded siblings recruit soldiers for the `Legion' by killing, and literally blow them back to life. In the other storyline, a madman suffering from rabies hijacks two lowlife-friends. Both stories are cut off abruptly and the characters come together in a setting that looks an awful lot like the bar in `From Dusk Till Dawn'Â… Ittenbach even hired an exact Salma Hayek look-alike for this! The totally ridiculous last half hour is painfully bad and you can consider it an achievement if you sit it through. Every now and then, Ittenbach shows slight signs of ingeniousness through black humor, but the wholesome really stinks. Avoid at all costs!<br /><br />
