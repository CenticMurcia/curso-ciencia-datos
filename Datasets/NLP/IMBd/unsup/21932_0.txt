A former Apache hunter, who has lost his taste for violence, becomes embroiled in a running duel across a scorched, rugged terrain with a gang of gunrunners...all over a lousy 100 bucks...and honor...and a woman. This film reminded me somewhat of Charles Bronson's first big box office hit, "Chato's Land". The band of thugs, unlike the group chasing Chato, were up to the job of killing Valdez, but found their quarry to be more elusive than they had bargained for. Very good western, right up there with Lancaster's film of the same year, "Lawman". I still can't feature Burt as a Mexican, though.
