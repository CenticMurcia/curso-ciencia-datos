This film was bad - nowhere near as good as the first.<br /><br />The first opening sequence was good, the song, the dance everything was good until they took it out of the high school and that was when it all went downhill.<br /><br />The film took on a different purpose. Instead of it being about people following their dreams, finding out who they are and stuff like that, it became about Sharpay's (Ashley Tisdale) awful obsession with Troy (Zac Efron.) The character of Gabriella (Vanessa Hudgens) was i thought not even in half of the movie - and the only good bit was when she stripped and got into her bikini (although I've pretty much seen it all if ya know what i mean!) As its Disney - it robbed us of several moments including a fist fight and a gay kiss. The acting was sketchy at parts and became very cheesy. The songs weren't as good as the first - instead of fun showtunes they became sloppy balads which were just plain awful.<br /><br />The only thing in this film that was better than the first was the choreography, it was brilliant. The dance moves were complex and great to watch.<br /><br />I hated it that Miley Cirus was in it as well, im just glad Disney didn't give her a speaking party, if they would've then i think id have to jump under a bus.<br /><br />Overall - not good.
