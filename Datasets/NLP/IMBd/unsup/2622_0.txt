It is so refreshing to watch a comedy with no slap-stick humor, only clever, funny dialogue. It was a joy to see from the beginning to end. The scriptwriter does not manipulate the audience, he draws them in with a great plot and many twists and turns. The scene in the library was a big surprise, and the ending is totally unexpected. I don't think anyone knew what would be in that suitcase. Bill Murray makes a wonderful appearance as Maurice in the party scene. I had a big chuckle watching him take home all that food! This movie takes you into the private world of struggling actors desperate enough to risk friendships in order to get that big break in their careers. Although it's all tongue in cheek I am willing to surmise the writing is based on true life experience. See it, you won't regret it!
