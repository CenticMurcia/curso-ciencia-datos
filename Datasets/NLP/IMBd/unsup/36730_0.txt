I saw this film on the International FilmFestival Rotterdam. Perhaps it was due to all the great films I already saw, but i did not like this film one bit. It was full of clich√©s and I didn't see anything original. This story has been told a thousand times and can - in Holland - be seen every week in the "true stories" movie-series. Furthermore I thought that the acting by Maggie Cheung was - to say the least - not very convincing. Especially as a sensitive rock 'n roll junkie. Assayas has tried to show how well he can combine the feeling of a rock 'n roll movie with a humane drama in three languages and an international setting. I wish he had focused more on the plot and less on the so-called cosmopolitan setting and hadn't cast his ex-wife in this film. She's better at roles as a 'femme fatale' ("Irma Vep") or stunning 'girl next door' ("In the Mood for Love")
