"Nola" is certainly not a masterpiece. On the other hand, it's not a bad movie.<br /><br />I watched "Nola" because I am a HUGE Emmy Rossum fan. I think she's brilliant, beautiful and has an outstanding singing voice. In "Nola", Emmy plays an eighteen-year-old named Nola (shocker, right?). Nola moves from an abusive Kansas home to New York City in search of her father and meets some very interesting characters along the way, turning her search for her father into an "adventure".<br /><br />The first 45 minutes of "Nola" are almost pure romantic comedy. After those first 45 minutes, though, a strange subplot is put into action. The subplot is fairly cheesy and not near as entertaining as I think it was meant to be. But Emmy Rossum's acting saved it. The highlights of the movie were Emmy Rossum's songs. The first was "Street of Dreams" which she sang at the very beginning, and the second was "Don't Break My Heart" which Emmy sang at the end. Her singing voice was amazing and the songs had depth.<br /><br />On the whole, "Nola" is funny, sweet, and sometimes very much outlandish. I would watch again.
