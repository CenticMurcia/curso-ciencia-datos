If you like terror, blood and sex, then here's a shocker to sink your teeth into. Cruel World kicked ass. I recently purchased this DVD at Best Buy and i loved every minute of it. It had a killer cast to die for. Im a huge fan of Edward Furlong and he was at his menacing best. Picture hot college students including Susan Ward (The In Crowd), Laura Ramsey (Venom and The Covenant) and Sanoe Lake (Blue Crush) and six other gorgeous co-eds, pitted against the diabolical Edward Furlong in one of the most gruesome slasher films today. This movie really rocked! It's like Saw meets Fear Factor. I strongly urge anyone who comes across this film to check it out. Its definitely a party movie and reality TV at its best!
