Why in the world would anyone want to watch a remake of Dawn of the Dead, when you can watch the original? Not only is this a bad remake with Black and Latino gang members in Los Angeles locked in a warehouse to escape the zombies, it is racist to boot.<br /><br />It has been a while since I have see Mantan Moreland yelling "Feets don't fail me now," but I certainly expected it to come out of the mouth of Dayana Jamine, who played the sister of one of the Black gang members like Moreland.<br /><br />Noel Gugliemi played Caesar, the leader of the Latin gang in a obnoxious stereotype of all ultra macho Hispanic. It was pure racism.<br /><br />The zombie action was good when you saw it, but that was sparse as most of the action took place in the warehouse.<br /><br />Janine Foster was the best character in the movie, and I look for more of her in the future.<br /><br />Neat ending, though.
