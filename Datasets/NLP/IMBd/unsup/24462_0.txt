Doris Roberts and Judy Reyes are believable in this movie, and give us hope that perhaps naive goodness can and will help those who are less fortunate.<br /><br />Their lives are opposite, or are they? Ruth (Doris) is alone, elderly, and all her days basically the same after she lost her husband. Her two grown children have independent lives of their own. Lonely, a post-cancer patient, and desperate, Ruth impulsively attempts to swallow a bottle of sleeping pills then confused, stumbles outside her home in Beverly Hills, collapsing onto the sidewalk. At the same time, Billie (Judy) walks by and stops, kneels by her to save her life. The police drive by and think Billie attacked poor Ruth, and with the help of Ruth's grown daughter, has Billie arrested. When Ruth feels better, she gets Billie released from jail, and goes on a quest to thank her for stopping to help her. However, Billie has had traumatic losses in her own life, which causes her to lose her home and family, as well as lose her trust in the establishment. Living on the streets with other unfortunate people, Billie is a survivor who doesn't think she needs anyone's help. That is, until Ruth 'makes' her realize she could use some help.<br /><br />Ruth's loneliness and overwhelming gratitude causes her to keep trying to reach Billie's heart - and she does. They not only live together, but Billie is encouraged to bring some of her homeless friends along. That's when the trouble starts between the Beverly Hills neighbors and Ruth's own grown, wealthy, attorney daughter.<br /><br />The challenges they face will draw you into the movie, and the ending will be surprising and make you cry. It is well worth watching, again and again (maybe have some of your own grown, selfish kids watch it if you are unfortunate to have at least one, as a sting to his/her conscious).<br /><br />Aloha
