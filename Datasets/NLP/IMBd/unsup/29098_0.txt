"Long Time Dead" represents one of the best horror movies to come out of England in recent years. Joe Absolom of "Eastenders" fame is outstanding in his role throughout, proving that he can act!<br /><br />The direction I believe is of a high standard and features some truely scary scenes along the way as we are taken along a journey watching some teens foolishly tamper with the undead. It is a clever and unique narrative, which does the acting great justice. It truely is a really under rated teen movie, that if it was produced in America would be hailed as a classic and would rest alongside the likes of "Scream", to name just one of the overused american teen horror genre.<br /><br />The film deserves a watch, I rate it 8/10.
