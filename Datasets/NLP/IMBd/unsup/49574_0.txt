Excuse me for asking, but ask I will: Are we supposed to believe that a senior citizen is able to neatly sneak into a heavily protected house, break into the owner's sanctum-sanctorum, and then witness the President of the United States having a fist fight with a woman, who is then assassinated by government employees? Are we REALLY supposed to believe that? Isn't that stretching things a bit too far - even for a movie? And then after, we're supposed to believe that the thief is really a good guy who really cares? And that he's merely a retiree who happens to steal things - but has a sense of integrity? Or that the President of the United States is screwing his benefactors wife - in the benefactor's home? C'mon now ... this can't be a serious drama. Maybe it was meant to be a science fiction story about a retiree with some kind of special power to perform acts of magic that defy any sense of logic, because this movie defies logic.
