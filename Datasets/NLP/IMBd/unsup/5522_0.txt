I have seen this movie many times over and I can assure you that it has yet to get old for me. The movie does a great job of allowing the audience to witness first hand and laugh about how difficult it is for a very average-looking middle aged man with no career to juggle his well-off wife and his ambitious mistress. Of course the fact that both main characters are married (George and his mistress), albeit to other people, is the main reason why this heavily vaudeville influenced comedy works so well. Poor Maurice, all he meant to do the day he met Georges was collect knick-knacks to help the poor Instead he ends up being forced  (after a little convincing) to pretend he is George's wife in order to help him hide the affair that his mistress is about to reveal and, in the end, discovers the feminine side he was never aware off.<br /><br />Despite the fact that the two main male characters pretend to be married to each other, there is no gay theme going per se but the comedy clearly arises from the fact that everyone is fooled by Maurice's act as he pretends to be George's homely wife (unlike in The Birdcage, which, although the latter is a very good comedy on its own, I find to have nothing in common with this one. Indeed, the fact that both contain a transvestite is pretty much the only similarity between the two movies since the reasons behind the cross dressing serve very different purposes!).<br /><br />For those of us who grew up in Europe, the whole side story about the Audi lover and the father and son cameos at the dealership made for some most welcome additional insider chuckles! If you are looking for a good laugh, watch this little gem, it is a great way to spend a couple of hours!
