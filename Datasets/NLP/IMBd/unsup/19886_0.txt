I walked in "For Your Consideration" with a broad grin, eagerly anticipating the next ingenious Christopher Guest film. What I got was an unbelievably awful pile of odds and ends tied clumsily together by a script that allows little room for Guest's actors to do their trademark improv work. Guest has always been able to transform everyday topics into absurdist slices of hilarity, but here, he fails miserably. His great cast (Fred Willard, Ricky Gervais, Eugene Levy) struggles to squeeze some pizzaz out of a mirthless screenplay, but bomb doing so. This is simply, the year's unfunniest movie. For a film about Oscar hooplah, "Consideration" sure won't be seeing the little golden man this year.
