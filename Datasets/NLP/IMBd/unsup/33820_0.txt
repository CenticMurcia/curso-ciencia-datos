Probably the most famous of Troma's back-breakingly self-conscious attempts to create a cult classic by deliberately making a bad film, 'The Toxic Avenger' is a porno-grade comedy horror in which a goofy pool attendant falls into a barrel of chemical waste and mutates into the scourge of the city's criminals. This is the kind of incompetent garbage that would be made bearable only by either good-natured silliness or barking mad humour; but since the tone here is rather nasty, and laughs are pretty much absent (funniest line: 'What the sh*t?'), we're left with zero comic timing, a cast of gurners, plenty of tiresome sound effects, public domain music and unbelievably amateurish editing. Pretty much worthless.
