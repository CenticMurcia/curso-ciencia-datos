It would be difficult to imagine another performer on the planet capable of accomplishing what Liza Minnelli achieved in her riveting hour-long performance of "Liza with a Z." In its beautifully restored version, this stunning television showcase, originally broadcast on May 31, 1972, is now available for a new generation of viewers. <br /><br />The expression "triple threat" is used in the theatre for those gifted performers with skills in singing, acting, and dancing. Liza Minnelli is at the top of her game in all three areas in this knockout performance. With the brilliant choreography of Bob Fosse and the electric feeling of a live audience at New York's Lyceum Theatre, this was a spellbinding and virtuoso performance. While not listed in the credits, the dancing ensemble also deserves kudos for their supporting contributions to this singular and indeed historic concert.<br /><br />Among all of the dazzling numbers, including "Bye, Bye, Blackbird" and Liza's "Cabaret" medley, my favorite selection was the most personal and introspective, a quiet love monologue adapted by Liza from one of Charles Aznavour's songs, "You've Let Yourself Go." The song is a confession of a wife to her husband about the rather mundane and unexciting state of their relationship. Liza's interpretation, including her raw emotions and the coloring of the words, was unforgettable in its honesty and simplicity. This song and the other dynamic numbers reveal the range of Liza's performing abilities in a show for the ages!
