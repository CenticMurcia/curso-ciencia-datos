Excellent movie. Just not to be confused with the 1937 Hollywood epic! The title itself is quite interesting, in that the film is about the girl, yet the title is about the "guy". What's more interesting is that, 'that' very the lead actor doesn't say a single word for at least 90mins if I recall correctly, and when he does, he sounds like a six year old boy. Seo Won (female lead), has given an excellent performance, and really shows the viewers what it's like being a Korean prostitute.<br /><br />This film is about voyeurism without a shadow of a doubt. The two-way mirror isn't just some sort of tangible metaphor or anything of the sort. However, it has to be said, if there is anything which comes close to describing the topic of the film, it will be the blossoming of a disturbing relationship, and love, between two personalities that would have had no chance of being together if it weren't for the girl's financial situation.<br /><br />On the whole, another brilliant Korean flick, of which there are many coming into mainstream cinemas in the UK now.
