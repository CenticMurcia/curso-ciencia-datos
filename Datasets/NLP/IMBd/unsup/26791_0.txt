Peter Billingsly in trademark appearance and Burt Young were shamefully cast in this mess about a kid who decides to pretend to be kidnapped in order to get his snobby family to pay attention to him. This, unfortunately, produces little humor when compared to other kidnapping comedies like "Rutless People," "The Crazy Sitter," or "The Ref," for example. And worse, gets far more sentimental than it ought to be at the end.<br /><br />This movie has been forgotten over the years for a good reason. It fails to offer little more than the story of a whiny kid and his obnoxious parents and an idiotic plot to help them all sort out their problems. I don't think its worth the time, even for a dumb 80s movie.
