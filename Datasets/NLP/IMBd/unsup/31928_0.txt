Now, watching this movie is like tasting a bottle of fine wine (or beer :)). You may not be satisfied at the beginning, but later... If it weren't for 'Midnight Cowboy' who knows..., then maybe 1969 would be the year of 'The Royal Hunt of the Sun'. Sensational film which depicts brutality, hypocrisy, greed. This awesome picture shows how one peaceful (in comparison with the spanish) world falls apart, shows how reality strikes and hits You real hard (e.g. - Young Martin). Robert Shaw and Christopher Plummer... well... They're absolutely fabulous!!! Christopher Plummer with his attitude and ... c'mon watch Him walking, dancing..., even asking about 'art of writing' ! His unbelievable way of acting goes strictly together as one with the way of thinking, moving, ranting... pointing His finger. Robert Shaw - angry, coping with His injured leg, unbeatable, bursting with force. One world dies, as the other one devours Its essence. In the name of god none gives a damn about that. Well maybe some of them do..., but when They have to choose...<br /><br />WARNING: It's strongly recommended to watch this Movie.
