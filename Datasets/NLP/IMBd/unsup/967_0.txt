Shooting Fish was something I got out on a risk, you know.....no other film in video store, take a chance.<br /><br />It proved to be a wise decision as the film was very funny, two great opposites for the main male characters and the stunning kate beckinsale acted the part wonderfully.<br /><br />The film has no slow points, but does not rush things, the accompanying music is very good and acting first class.<br /><br />I would recommend this film to anyone
