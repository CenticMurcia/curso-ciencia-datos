I usually do not make comments on movies but this one is so bad that I felt I had to. This movie's plot was poor and very unbelievable. There is no way that anything like this could happen in the "real world" which is what makes it such a poor movie. To add insult to injury, the writing was horrible and the lines poorly written. The only reason I watched this movie to its conclusion was to see just how bad it could get. This one is definitely a turkey so don't waste your time with it.
