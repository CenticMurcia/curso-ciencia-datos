the story was real good and the acting made it very interesting<br /><br />for Adam Brody's first big role he was awesome as was the young Vietnamese girl.I don"t know if it was a true story or not but i found it very entertaining as I always wondered how they did these sort of searches.i watched it with my teenage son who also liked it.especially the snake scene with Adam Brody.i think it also gave him an idea of what was going on with all the Vietnam issues of the 1960s/70s.i have an older brother who is a Vietnam vet and i have recommended to him and his family.i like that it was both serious and funny as it was a very emotional movie especially with the music.
