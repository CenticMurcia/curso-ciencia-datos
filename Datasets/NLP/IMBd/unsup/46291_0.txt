My friend and I went to go see this movie and it was so bad it was funny. The effects are good and the baby dragon was cute but beside that, everything stunk! The outline of this movie was really bad. Good for a book but bad for a movie. I really hope the makers of this movie do not make a squeal. I was kind of looking forward to this movie because the book was pretty good but the movie just killed it. It was like a Harry Potter movie but worse. I don't really recommend this movie but if you're really into movies that have to do with fantasy then you might like it. But the effects were good I have to admit that. It was bad and the actors were scary. Sorry.
