I only saw this from half way through but it was easy to pick the storyline up. Also, this was the first movie I saw Barbara Stanwyck in and she's an amazing actress. Humphrey Bogart gives an amazing performance as a bizarre killer. Bogart plays a artist who's wife dies a mysterious death after he painted her as the Angel Of Death. He marries Sally (Barbara Stanwyck) and as the same strange urge to paint her the angel of death. As bizarre and strange as it may sound, it's very entertaining and most definitely held my attention while I was watching. Even my mother, who doesn't really like Mr. Bogart, sat down and watched it. Although at times you feel Barbara Stanwyck's character is completely hopeless (she doesn't put up any fight, quite weak), that doesn't mean that you don't care about what happens to her. You really do, and you feel a sense of triumph as she grabs the gun. I think the ending would have been much better if she actually put up a fight (how I would love to see Stanwyck kicking Bogart in the groin!! Then punching him before saying a witty line). Just my opinion. I would pay to see that!<br /><br />Anyway, I think The Two Mrs. Carrolls is a very much underrated film. I liked it, it's quite exciting at times. Nice to see Mr. Bogart playing a different role - the villain. I'm getting this on DVD!
