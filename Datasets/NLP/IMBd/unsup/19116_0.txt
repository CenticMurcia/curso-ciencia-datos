Possible light spoilers, but nothing specific. Yes, you too can see Darth Vader running the white house! "The force is strong in this one!" Really, I'm a big fan of the "West Wing" and this movie brings forth the same feeling of the hair on the back of my neck going up. Mr. Jones does a fantastic job of being uncomfortable with his new role as the first African-American president of the United States. In the opening scenes we find out that the President and Speaker of the house have both been killed, and the Vice President has been an invalid for awhile, so the next person in line is James Earl Jones' character - he believes that he has been given his position as a token gesture. He can't believe that anyone would want him as a President. Some hate him some think he is an "Uncle Tom." The movie follows his slow morph into a charismatic leader that wants to run for president. All the supporting players do a great job, I would buy this on DVD if it was available. If you like "An American President," or "West Wing" then I guarantee you will enjoy this film. It goes a little slow in the middle, but really picks up steam in the end. A great political film. Unfortunately, the color of the Whitehouse 30 years later is still...well mostly white.
