There have been five films released with the title RIDING HIGH. This 1943 effort is a very slight attempt at a musical. It has seven numbers (Whistling in the Light of Day, Secretary of the Sultan, Injun Gal, Till the All Clear Came, You're The Rainbow, Get Your Man, Willie, the Wolf of the West) - all completely forgettable, as is the dull plot re a young man (Powell) trying to raise money to work a mine, the daughter of the man he has hoodwinked (Lamour) and a counterfeiter (Moore) who proposes not to pass bad currency but to simply flourish it in the belief that those who believe someone has money will be willing to invest in projects. Cass Daley's broad and tiresome humor nearly sinks the enterprise and there is an excruciatingly long and very unfunny sequence involving Gil Lamb and an orchestra run amok. The Academy did give it a nom for Sound, which was deserved (crisp and resonant and sound effects included in a climactic wagon chase sequence), but for the general public this piece of fluff is not worth bothering to see.
