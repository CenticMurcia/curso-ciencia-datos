Saw "The Curious Case of Benjamin Button" last night. I can't resist a new David Fincher film. It deviates wildly from the F. Scott Fitzgerald story (which could be why I liked it so much). The performances, make up, and directing are all amazing. The screenplay is a little slow and meticulous (Eric Roth also wrote the screenplays for Forrest Gump, The Horse Whisperer, Munich, The Good Shepherd) but the directing made it work perfectly (give me Fincher over Mann, DeNiro, Redford, Spielberg or Zemeckis any day). It really doesn't feel like a two and a half hour film.<br /><br />I could easily envision Oscar wins for Fincher, Taraji Henson, Brat Pitt and Cate Blanchett.<br /><br />Be warned - it is a bit of a tear jerker. It deals with mortality quite a bit, as well as the usual heady subjects of love, loss, war, and redemption... with just the right touches of passion and joy.<br /><br />10 out of 10
