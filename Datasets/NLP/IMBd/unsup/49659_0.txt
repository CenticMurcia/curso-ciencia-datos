Six former reality-TV stars (three female & three male) from 'Castaway Island' are whisked away to a seemingly deserted island for a reunion show. Once there, they're hunted and killed one by one. Could it be this Wesley guy that everyone thinks is crazy or someone else entirely? The better question is will you even care to find out one way or the other?<br /><br />Proving that America doesn't have a monopoly of unoriginal, hideously contrived, badly acted and scare free B-horror films, this Australian travesty rears it's ugly head to further trivialize and dumb down fans of the horror genre. This relatively blood-free, heavily clich√©d mockery is deathly boring on top of all that and to add insult to injury, the ending doesn't make a lick of sense<br /><br />My Grade: F+
