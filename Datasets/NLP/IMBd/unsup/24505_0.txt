First I like to say that this was the worst movie I've ever seen, even for an Austria film! So don't waste your time and watch it.<br /><br />As I mentioned above the story is nearly the as in "I know what you did last summer" only without tension.I can not understand the high user rating, here on IMDb, it seems that these people never have seen good movies. If you don't believe me watch this crappy movie yourself, if you can stand it till the end. Nearly half of the people left the cinema when I watched this film at a sneak preview in Germany!<br /><br />Honestly I have to admit that the cinematography was well done and has some nice pictures.
