Millions of dollars for charity, a spot on Jay Leno, all over the news, and I never heard of the Knapely W.I. calendar girls. Just as well. The story of what the women went through (a seminar on broccoli?!?), has the right brand of lighthearted humor to make 'Calendar Girls' a hit.<br /><br />A dear husband dies of leukemia and the perfect way to honor him, in the eyes of the ladies, is to pose nude for a calendar to raise money for the hospital.<br /><br />True story of the calendar girls is well told and the casting, in my eyes, is right on the money. The movie feels a little bit longer than it should be, and when they arrive in Hollywood, some parts are unnecessary (the washing powder scene). Overall, 'Calendar Girls' is a good movie to watch.
