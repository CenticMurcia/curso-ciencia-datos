There's something wrong about dropping an American con-artist into London, but somehow here it works. There are lots of potential reasons not to like this film, but most of them don't seem to really matter. It just works, anyway.<br /><br />Maybe it's because this was the first time I ever saw Kate Beckinsale, and I was just stunned.<br /><br />Anyway, I was hugely amused when I heard that there was a boycott organized against this film by some people who thought it was going to be about someone shooting at fish (bang, bang). Poor fishies. No, of course, it's no such thing.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this, then I can pretty much guarantee that you will not waste your time if the opportunity comes up.
