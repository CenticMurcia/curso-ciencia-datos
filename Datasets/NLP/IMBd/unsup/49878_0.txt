From director Paul Bales (who is known for absolutely nothing) comes this typical mummy thriller involving a major archaeological find. As it turns out, the Egyptian's had a secret trans-Atlantic trade route which surprised diggers when a burial tomb was discovered in America. They find the mummified remains of a 4000 year old High-queen who is unintentionally summoned back to life by a professor's student. The (incredibly hot) queen goes about stealing souls from those who run into her and she ends up taking control of the professor (played by Mr. Rhett "my career is damned to go straight to video forever" Giles), whom she uses to help resurrect the Six - a gang of warriors to assist her in conquering the world. The end seems to re-cap every other movie dealing with resurrected mummies (The Fallen Ones comes right to mind) in which a virgin is about to be sacrificed and is saved at the last minute... Very boring and unoriginal movie.
