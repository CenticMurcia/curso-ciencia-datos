This film is so bad that it actually is worth watching to see what they ripped off from other films.<br /><br />The last half of this film is what you really need to tune in for. When out hero Yor, played by B movie golden boy Reb Brown and his friends are transported to a futuristic city. Why do B- Movie cities of the future always look like the basement of a water treatment plant? Yor has to battle the evil emperor, who looks strangely close to the evil emperor in the star wars films and his evil robots, who also strangely look like Darth Vader. <br /><br />To be fair the evil emperor has been working on new robots. These new more intelligent robots look like they have been chewing there stitches and had plastic collars put on them to make them stop. Best of all when Yor is fighting we are treated to a kicking rock soundtrack that sounds like a bad rip-off of Queens Flash Gordon soundtrack. You expect to hear "Yor, leader of the universe, Ah-ah, he'll save every one of us." <br /><br />If you can stop laughing during the fight scenes notice how everyone has to stay in the same place during the laser battle to make it easy for the special effects people to draw in the laser shots. Also notice the high tech control room the rebel city dwellers are in, it also bears a strange resemblance to the control room of a water treatment plant. Yes, they have mastered gravity but they still have large analog dials. <br /><br />If you liked Star Wars, He Man and the Masters of the Universe or Queens Flash Gordon soundtrack then catch this movie on cable because they ripped them all off and did a very bad job of it. Don't spend money to rent it. This movie is so bad it may make you smile!
