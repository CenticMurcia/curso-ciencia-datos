In Bagdad, Douglas Fairbanks (as "The Thief") is a carefree crook, proclaiming, "What I want - I take. My reward is here. Paradise is a fool's dream and Allah is a myth." All that is thrown asunder when Mr. Fairbanks lays his eyes on veiled, but pretty Julanne Johnson (as "The Princess"). In order to win her hand in holy marriage, Fairbanks must successfully maneuver increasingly dangerous and incredible feats.<br /><br />Unnecessarily slow-paced, but very much worth the time, "super-production" from Fairbanks and company. The sets and photography are extraordinary; and, the overview shots of Bagdad not only are, but also look - futuristic. Director Raoul Walsh, photographer Arthur Edeson, and designer William Cameron Menzies create a wonderful "Arabian Nights Fantasy World" for the ever-exuberant Fairbanks to inhabit. Anna May Wong (as The Mongol Slave) steals the acting honors; otherwise, the arm-flailing acting of the cast is outrageous, but... it fits the mood of the film. Hang in for Fairbanks' magic carpet ride near the film's end. Like John Kay sang, "Fantasy will set you free." <br /><br />********* The Thief of Bagdad (3/18/24) Raoul Walsh ~ Douglas Fairbanks, Julanne Johnston, Sojin, Anna May Wong
