Christian Slater stars as Riley Hale, an air force pilot who finds himself the only able to take back a nuclear weapon from Vic Deakins (A shamelessly hammy John Travolta). Seems that Deakins is out to launch it due to him being passed up for promotions and the like. Of course aiding our hero is Samantha Mathis who is a park ranger. The problem with Broken Arrow is that it is too hollywoodized for John Woo to really work with. The premise has been done so many times that even John Woo's approach seems mundane. Sure there are some moments that excite and Woo crafts some decent suspense among the action sequences but generally you get the feeling you have seen it before and basically it is all half hearted. Worst of all is that it has Howie Long who is quite simply terrible in the role as head mercenary. The characters themselves never engage and really the movie never builds enough momentum. Certainly in comparison to Woo's HK work and even his work in Hard Target, Broken Arrow is nothing but a gigantic disappointment.<br /><br />* * out of 4-(Fair)
