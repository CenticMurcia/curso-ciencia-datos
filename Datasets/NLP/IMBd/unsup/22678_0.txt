Working as an Alpine hotel maid, a SWISS MISS prima donna tries to capture her composer husband's attention - with a little help from Stan Laurel & Oliver Hardy.<br /><br />Although given good production values by the Hal Roach Studios, Stan & Ollie are the only real reason to watch this minor comedy. While on screen, they never fail to amuse and entertain. (Watch Laurel try to steal brandy from a sturdy St. Bernard - and Hardy sing `Let Me Call You Sweetheart,' accompanied by Stan on a tuba.) The trouble arises from the long stretches when they are missing, while the romantic subplot threatens to swamp the boat. Why couldn't Mr. Roach understand that the Boys' fans wanted to see the Boys, not a pair of vacuous lovers work out their marital difficulties?<br /><br /> Walter Woolf King & Della Lind are in good voice as the composer & his wife, and their songs are pleasant, if unremarkable. But we care not a whit for them, and regret every moment they filch from L & H. Even the usually humorous Eric Blore, as the composer's manager, has to deliver lines that are rather forced & flat.<br /><br />But the Boys come through hilariously with what time they are allotted. Whether trying to sell mousetraps to suspicious Swiss, or attempting to move a heavy piano across a most vertiginous swinging bridge (while being hampered by a gorilla), they are never anything less than magnificent - the sweetly innocent visitors from a zany parallel universe all their own.
