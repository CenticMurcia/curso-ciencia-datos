Wow, I don't know where to begin with describing this laborious and completely unfunny travesty. First you have to completely suspend all disbelief and buy the offensive post-Will & Grace premise that a straight girl only digs gay guys. Then a "straight" guy who digs the girl pretends to be a gay guy to get the girl and complications ensue. Like the guy letting a gay guy perform oral sex on him. I'm not making this up. As if this plot wasn't insane and insulting, and is you can overlook the lowbudget production, wait till you hear what passes as "dialogue." None of the actors have any chemistry with one another. I'm told the director is the nephew of the man who made the commendable Midnight Dancer. Rent it instead of watching this. Talent doesn't run in the Brocka family. Everyone involved in this should have their union cards revoked. On metacritic.com, this received a 27 percent recommendation out of a possible 100. Some critics were being generous.
