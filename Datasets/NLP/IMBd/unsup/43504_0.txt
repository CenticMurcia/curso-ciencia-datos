Boring Boring Boring.<br /><br />Sometimes I go into a film not wanting to be there or with negative pre-conceptions only to be blown away with it's originality and entertainment values. This was not one of these films.<br /><br />In an age of free to air TV programming mainly consisting of shows depicting death, killing and women using their sexuality to put men down, Suburban Mayhem has both for $15.<br /><br />During the Q&A after film writer (Alice Bell) could not answer the question asking her whether she liked her main character or not. Considering the films content I wonder what did her father did to her ?<br /><br />I cannot believe that the writer and the director would think that this was an interesting time for a movie like this. I cannot see anything new about it. <br /><br />If you really want to see killing just turn on the TV, people are doing it for real !!!!!<br /><br />The worst thing about it ? Its not entertaining !!!!!<br /><br />Save your hard earned money.
