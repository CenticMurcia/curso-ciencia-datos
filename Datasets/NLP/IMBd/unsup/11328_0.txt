From what I had heard about the first film, I was better off skipping it and watching the second. When the opportunity arose to do that, I decided to seize it since I had a couple of hours that I could waste. I can't compare it to the first in the series, but as a Dungeons and Dragons player since the 80s and a great fan of fantasy, I can analyse it on its own merits.<br /><br />The first thing and the main thing that impressed me was the inclusion of several aspects from the actual game. I really liked the little touches of detail. Spells, items, monsters and more were all here. It was really wonderful to see all these brought to life.<br /><br />The second was that it really did have a very distinctly Dungeons and Dragons feel to it, rather than just any fantasy film. There was an eye to things that fans and players would know, and that made it distinctly identifiable, which was nice; so often filmmakers, especially Hollywood, are notorious for tacking on an inapplicable brand name to a barely identifiable film tie-in.<br /><br />Unfortunately, despite all these things, making it Dungeons and Dragons doesn't necessarily make it good Dungeons and Dragons. The film was a rather bitter and unhappy affair, and I found myself often really brought down by its miserable tone throughout. It is comparable to taking your character to a session run by a stranger, who has bought a module at a rummage sale somewhere and wants to inflict it upon you; he doesn't really know very well how to run the game and tries as hard as he can to destroy you all, to give himself some sort of sadistic pleasure. Afterwards, unhappy with the experience, you take your character and file him away, to be brought around for another campaign run, instead, by someone you know and trust. Which may not happen for years. And at that point you conveniently omit that one odd session out, because it was that unenjoyable.<br /><br />And that's essentially what this film is: a bad module run by a nasty, childish sadist of a dungeonmaster. The story is relentlessly depressing and poorly-handled in every such aspect, and it additionally functions to make virtually all of the characters difficult to sympathise with or even care about. The leader is completely bland, although his love Melora was the high point of the film (and, predictably, the most tormented). The Elf mage was interesting but underused, the female barbarian was there solely for eye candy (though she did a pretty good job with her lacking part), and the cleric was there because someone apparently thought clerics were useless. All of us who know otherwise sent up a collective groan at the treatment of this one.<br /><br />The rogue was a good actor, but his part was similarly inane and the character completely unlikable. He also ended up underused in the parts that could've shown his strengths, and overused in parts where he was completely superfluous. The villain was utterly forgettable unfortunately, although the monster effects were quite memorable indeed. I really did enjoy the dragons and so forth, especially the ultimate confrontation. Really exciting and really well done.<br /><br />It's just a pity that the rest had to be endured to get there. This is the kind of story that you hear from people who decided to try the game once, got some garbage like this thrown at them, and ended up quitting and never again going near a tabletop game. It's sad, but it's amazing what an inept dungeonmaster can do for someone's enthusiasm. That's essentially what happened here.<br /><br />And while the details were nice for a while, there were times when they were just useless and frustrating. We had a Drow throwaway joke, but where were any actual Drow? We had a 'necropolis' (cleverly masquerading as a sylvan glen) complete with a lich, but what real purpose did it serve? And so on.<br /><br />If there had been more of a heroic, pleasant fantasy tone rather than a by-the-numbers destroy-em-all gauntlet tone, it would've been much more satisfying. As it was, it gave the impression of enduring the film, rather than enjoying it. There were some pleasant parts and some nice aspects, some talented people trying to do their best with lacking parts and ludicrous circumstances, but the tale itself was all too unpleasant. And as any player of Dungeons and Dragons knows, the story is everything.<br /><br />It wasn't a complete loss. It's not totally a horror. But it is by no means a fantastic film, unfortunately for those who put so much energy into it. Hopefully if they do a third one, they will go for a better situation and different villain, as well as a less depressing, unhappy, and just plain unpleasant story.<br /><br />And for pity's sake, somebody tell the DM that nobody likes to play games with someone trying hard to get them killed!
