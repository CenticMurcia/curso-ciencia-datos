One of the first films produced (but not directed) by Roger Corman is marginally okay tale of convict (John Ireland, who directed) who escapes from prison and then kidnaps Dorothy Malone and uses her and her sports car as a cover for entry into a race that will get him across the border and to freedom. Its an over ripe tale with lots of footage of race cars and a soapy romance between the two principles. I had always wanted to see the film because a picture of Ireland and Malone that appeared in a biography of Corman that has been on my self for years. Little did I know that the film was, outside of the race footage, little more than exciting than the still. Its not a bad film if you don't pay 100% attention to it, but as background noise, which is what it became, but as something to actually sit and watch from first frame to the last it's a bit of a trial. For Corman complete-ists only.
