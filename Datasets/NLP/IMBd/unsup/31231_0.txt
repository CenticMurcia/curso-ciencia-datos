One of the talking heads featured in the film pretty much sum it up when he says: "The film really scared me....it was obvious that the people in the film were not trained actors." Amen to that, brother.<br /><br />I really don't like to rain on other people's parades, and if you enjoyed this movie then Go With God; I am sure that there will films I like that you might find rubbish. However, I truly cannot understand how some can term this film the 'scariest' film that they have ever seen. It's interesting how many reviewers and posters here state that they saw the film at a very young age and it scared the bayjeesus out of them. I remember films I saw at that age that really made an impression; watch them 20 years later and they're pretty poor. I ask anyone who saw the film as a youngster and thinks it's the Citizen Kane of the faux-documentary school, please take another look - I fear you might have an unpleasant surprise.
