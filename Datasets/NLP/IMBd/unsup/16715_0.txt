That's right. Who is Katt Williams. My girl told me to watch him. Wasn't sure about getting a DVD and then it was on Comedy Central. He wore this goofy coat and baseball hat and I thought who is this dude. Then he started talking. He made me laugh as soon as he opened his mouth. The dude is hysterical. Haven't seen anyone like him. He's full of himself. Let's speak plain. He's real arrogant, but he's a player.Especially because of what he says. Anyone who can make you laugh about the weather and walking around a shopping maul is OK, but anyone who can make fatherhood, relationships funny the way he does is great by me.
