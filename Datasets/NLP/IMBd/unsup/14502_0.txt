This show almost makes you embarrassed for the cast members involved with it. The jokes are horrible, the audience is usually silent apart from a few chuckles here and there, and of course theirs always this one guy who you can here laughing his head off at every god damn horrible joke its kind of funny cause most of the time the rest of the audience is relatively quite and this moron can be heard cracking up to these pathetic jokes Elvira keeps spitting out in her unique awkward way, I have come to the conclusion that this guy is either paid by the show to laugh, or is some homeless dude who's drunk or stoned off his ass and comes in to watch the shows to get off the street for an hour or so, and they only let him in if he promises to laugh.<br /><br />Anyways, this show is a complete waste of time, I don't like people who compare this show to the daily show, because that would be a huge insult to the Daily show and Jon Stewart, even though its obvious the stupid correspondents on pop cultured are trying to emulate the correspondents on the Daily Show, but they promptly fall flat on their face every time they try. I'm Boycotting this show in protest of the comedy network assuming Canadians are dumb enough to enjoy this piece of crap, and because the Canadian government has given this show close to 1 million dollars in funding of the Canadian tax payers dollars, Screw Pop Cultured and Screw the Comedy Network.
