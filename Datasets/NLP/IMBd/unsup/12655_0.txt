First off Ron Perlman needs to get plastic sugary. When I wasn't trying to throw up every time he was on the camera I was throwing up over the story plot. This movie is supposed to play with the idea that we are ruining the world. Good job every one the United States oil consumption has brought demons up from the under ground. This movie was so boring and borderline retarded. I hope the directors are happy because I understood exactly what the movie was trying to say and its saying "Burn this DVD, and go rent a some thing good. The DVD jacket said on the front that "bob Strauss from the L.A Daily News" Said it was the scariest movie of the year" There was nothing scary about it. Just boring.
