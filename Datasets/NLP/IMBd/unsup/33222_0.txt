This movie isn't a complete failure. People shouldn't bin it without understanding the message this movie is trying to communicate. Sure, the action isn't that spectacular, the relationships between characters is obvious and boring, but look at Mewtwo.<br /><br />Mewtwo is the star, not Ash. The movie shows the suffering Mewtwo faced, and what he did after escaping from it. Ash and co. are just a tool for the movie. It is Mewtwo that makes the movie what it is. This movie portrays Mewtwo's encounter with humans for the first time, its reaction when its being controlled and its actions after it escapes.<br /><br />Sure, Ash, Misty and Brock appear, but they are not that important in the movie. I think this movie would have been worth it if Ash and his friends were replaced with characters that didn't just stand there like a 3-year old. I would give this 4/10 because of Mewtwo, nothing else.
