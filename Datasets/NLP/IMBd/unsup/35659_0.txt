I've seen Prince of Darkness only twice in my life. The first time I saw it I was about 10 years old, and it scared the snot out of me. About 10 years later or so, I saw it again, and it wasn't very frightening at all. It may be that Prince of Darkness suffers from the same fate as Exorcist and Jaws -- it's dated. 12 years ago it may well have been a scary movie, but today it's fairly tame, and I expect to see it on the Family Channel's Halloween Film Fest one of these years.
