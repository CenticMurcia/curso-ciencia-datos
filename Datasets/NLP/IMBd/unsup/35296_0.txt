This film starts out promisingly as you're treated to what seems to be a Disco Inferno, with wildly dancing devil-like creatures and a repeated "no sweat no sweat" chorus, which turns out to be a deodorant commercial produced by this particular agency that Lee Majors works for. Now, there's a new man that's in charge of this agency (Mitchum)and he's up to something, which may be somewhat devious, given that several people have quit and some have more than quit, they died or killed themselves. So Majors pokes around and finds something to do with subliminal advertising and also finds that Mitchum's background is not in advertising but with the government. Overall this film has a very scatter-shot feel to it and just seems thrown together, and given the subject matter it could have been a lot more sinister and creepy in the right hands, but alas, it comes off as no better than a TV movie of the week, which was fine back in the day of no VHS/DVD & nothing else to do. But not now. Performances were adequate but nothing more than they had to be, and Mitchum was far past his days as a actor that could give the viewer goosebumps. Mediocre at best, which is unfortunate. Could have used a few subliminal messages of its own, perhaps. 4 out of 10.
