I really don't understand what's so good about this movie or the book. The guy travels through time. What for? why? Does it add anything to his character? Does he do anything special while traveling? He spoils the surprise of miracles in life to his wife and his daughter. He lives absolutely worthless life. I would understand if he was some sort of hero. He never works, never helps anyone, cheats in the lottery... And he dies as a jerk, by mistake. All his life is just a huge mistake.<br /><br />I think an author endows a protagonist with some special abilities for a reason. There's no reason behind Henry's ability to travel through time. He could as well have an elephant ears and we'd have a story about Man with elephant ears' wife. Why not? Very bad movie
