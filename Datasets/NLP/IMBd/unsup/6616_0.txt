Seriously,where in the world did they get her and who ever thought it was a good idea to hire her!She made the movie dreadful and she looked SO FAKE!Nothing like Julia,she was so down to earth and gave the character such a great presence.Maybe the movie would had been a little better if they had Julia there.The Prince didn't even seem interested in the new girl,sorry if i hadn't mentioned her name,i seriously don't even care to know it!LOL i sound like a hater,but i'm just warning you. I recommend to just not waste your time with this movie because it will ruined the magic and awesomeness of the first one.O and no wonder it went straight to DVD!They knew how horrendous that would had been for them!
