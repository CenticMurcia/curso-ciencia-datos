This film starts out good and pretty much stays that way, reaching its high point with the Oedipus  joke. After that it's straight down. It just loses appeal to fast and it especially does so after the first wedding. Then there are some shoot outs and a betrayal subplot and somehow the comedy gets lost and you just have a Mafia movie that is not really that good. Also I found the performance of Lisa Kudrow too Friends  like and I though that DeNiro could not cry that convincingly, but that latter doesn't really matter to me that much, for this is a comedy. Up until the Oedipus - joke I probably would have given this one an 8 but now seeing the whole film its this:<br /><br />A verrrrrry small (like 6,5) 7 out of 10
