The engineer Richard Thornton (Timothy Busfield), his wife Laura (Jennifer Dale) and his son Michael (Dan Petronijevic) come to live and test a house designed by him and fully controlled by the computer Helen. He invested all the family savings in this project, and expects to have some Japanese investors supporting it. Meanwhile, his absent daughter Jenny (Lisa Jakub), the black sheep of the family, returns home with the intention of robbing the family with her boyfriend Ray (Brennan Elliot). However, Helen finds out the truth, eliminates Ray and jeopardizes the whole family. "Dream House" is a very silly, predictable and stupid movie. I do not understand how can a producer approve a budget for such a TV movie. I lost my Sunday morning watching this crap, and of course I do not recommend it to any viewer. The users who recommended this garbage through good reviews are insane or maybe collaborators of the producers. My vote is three.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "A Casa Assassina" ("The Killer House")
