David Manners and Julie Bishop (billed as Jacqueline Wells) play two newlyweds on vacation in Hungary who make the acquaintance of genial doctor Vitus Verdegast (Bela Lugosi). After an accident on the road, they end up accompanying Dr. Verdegast to the mansion of Hjalmar Poelzig (Boris Karloff), an architect with more than one secret to hide.<br /><br />"The Black Cat" is apparently based none too closely on the Edgar Allan Poe poem, but has its own story, just using the poem for inspiration. The plot isn't much to speak of, with many of the revelations spoken by Verdegast. In fact, it's such an economical, light-on-story little movie, directed capably by B-movie veteran Edgar G. Ulmer, that it flies by and is over in just over an hour.<br /><br />It's quite a departure from the Gothic nightmares that were a number of the classic Universal chillers. Set in the present, a palpable feeling of what-the-heck-is-going-on mystery hangs over the proceedings, underscored by a nicely melodramatic music score. Interesting sets are also a bonus, as well as a climax involving a Satanic mass and a torturous comeuppance for Karloff.<br /><br />However, this is really all about seeing Karloff and Lugosi act together. Karloff is a marvel of cagey, subtle villainy, and Lugosi pretty likable in a rare "good guy" part. The other actors pretty much hold their own against the two leads, but it's really Karloffs' and Lugosis' show.<br /><br />I was struck by the great character faces of supporting actors Egon Brecher and Harry Cording, and the beauty of Lucille Lund, all of which enhanced my enjoyment of the film.<br /><br />It's a fun little picture and good for a nights' viewing.<br /><br />8/10
