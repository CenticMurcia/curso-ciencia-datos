Those loveable Muppets, including Kermit, Fozzie, Miss Piggy and all the other favourites, come together to produce send-up's and parodies of some of the greatest movies of yesteryear.<br /><br />'The Muppets Go to the Movies' plays out as an episode from 'The Muppet Show' but the typical zany sketches are replaced with equally zany movie parodies, including riotous send-up's of 'The Wizard of Oz', 'Casablanca', 'Frankenstein' and 'Wild Strawberries'. Fans of the movies that are parodied may occasionally find the Muppets take on the films as somewhat insulting to the source material; however, the whole show is all in good fun and is targeted at children and light-hearted adults. There is no real way that one could seriously condemn the way that these classic films are portrayed as the whole show is all in good fun. 'The Muppets Go to the Movies' even features short, amusing and enjoyable appearances from Dudley Moore and Lily Tomlin.<br /><br />There is not much that one can say about this little piece of Muppet history. If you are a fan of the Muppets and appreciate their humour then this is worth watching should you ever come across it. Similarly, I believe that children may love this and it may even work as a possible introduction to the classic films that are parodied throughout the show. 'The Muppets Go to the Movies' is not up to the standard of the majority of Muppet films, but is nonetheless an enjoyable and entertaining watch. My rating for 'The Muppets Go to the Movies' - 7/10.
