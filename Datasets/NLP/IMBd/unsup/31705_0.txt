Although this film wasn't a career high for either of these great performers it did demonstrate that there was majic between them. If you check Kerr's biography, this film isn't list on her film chronology. In fact, it is hardly mention on any other site other than IMDb's. I think it was because she appeared nude. She was 48 when this film was released. I think she is one of the greatest beauties that ever graced the screen.
