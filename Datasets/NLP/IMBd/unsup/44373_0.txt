This movie had some good moments and a great start. I had forgotten that Penny Marshall directed it and when it ended and her name was up there I was surprised and even more disappointed.<br /><br />The script was too thin, trite and predictable. There were far to many moments in it that seemed hollow. Loved Mika Boorem at the beginning. Her performance in Hearts in Atlantis was part of my impetus to see it. Hearts in Atlantis had an esp element in its plot and still managed to seem more true to life than this cartoon. Oh well.
