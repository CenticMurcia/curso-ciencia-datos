Freaks and Geeks is a great TV Show Freaks and Geeks is one of my favorite TV Shows of All Time along with Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, South Park, 7th heaven, One Tree Hill, Malcolm in the middle, Dark Angel, Friends and Doug Funny . The Show is really funny. My favorite character is Daniel because he is really cool. But I also like Lindsay, Sam, Bill, Neal, Nick and Ken and the other Geeks. I think the Show was canceled to early, only 18 episodes. But the Least Episode: Discos and Dragons was very great. <br /><br />Please vote on my Freaks and Geeks poll on www.misterpoll.com/polls/340570 <br /><br />Thank you
