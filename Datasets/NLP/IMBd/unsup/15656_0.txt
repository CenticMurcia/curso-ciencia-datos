I read the first review (on IMDb) for this movie and its really bad. I then realised that this movie will go down all wrong for conservatives.<br /><br />Its all about 'scoring weed'. A lot of people can relate to this movie in many ways and thats what makes it absolutely hilarious.<br /><br />If your 'square' you'll think this movie is absolute rubbish. So move on now.<br /><br />Too all others i highly recommend this movie. Its up there with the first Friday movie. the low budget thing adds to the realism of whats going on. Don't let it turn you off in the first few mins or you'll miss out.<br /><br />Have fun.
