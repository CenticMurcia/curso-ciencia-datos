Unrelieved stuffiness, written by Julian Mitchell from his play, chronicling the true-life account of homosexual prep-school lad Guy Bennett in 1930s London who later became a spy for the Russians. Director Marek Kanievska chooses to sequence the film colorlessly in flashback, with aloof Rupert Everett posturing and pursing his modulated lips in continual pensiveness (he has one expression to express every emotion). The British play was very popular, for reasons which are not evident here. The burnished cinematography by Peter Biziou and fine supporting performances from Colin Firth (in his debut) and Cary Elwes do help, yet I found this picture extremely cold and rather indifferently-made. * from ****
