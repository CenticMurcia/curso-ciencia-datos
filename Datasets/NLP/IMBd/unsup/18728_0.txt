Yor is the hunter from the future. He's a simple tribesman/He-man warrior who leads a village of displaced tribes people to the promise land. Along the way Yor slays a dinosaur,fights evil Morlocks, glides on a Giant bat, fights some alien goons who get in his way and matches wits with Darth Vader's brother. Bad film that none of the actors take seriously (except Yor). Will Yor lead the people to the promise land and find out the meaning behind that funky gold medallion that he wears around his neck? Go out and Get Yor!! I wish I could see the original eight hour version shot for European television. When will this Drive-In gem ever be released on video? Who knows.<br /><br />Recommended for lovers of bad movies.
