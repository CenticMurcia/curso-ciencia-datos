Being in Australia (so far from most things of good taste), I was overjoyed and shocked to see the Strangers movie at the local DVD store. I didn't even think it was going to be released here.<br /><br />I hired it immediately, although with some trepidation.<br /><br />Rightly so. There were a couple of laughs but sadly the team had no idea who they were making the film for. I would argue that it WASN'T made for the fans since there were several recycled jokes that die-hard fans would have spotted and cringed at immediately.<br /><br />"I'm not pushing you away, I am pulling me closer to myself"... you just can't re-use lines like that. Gold the first time, old the second.<br /><br />So in short, great cast with lacklustre plot and terrible writing. A disappointment for a SWC obsessive like myself.
