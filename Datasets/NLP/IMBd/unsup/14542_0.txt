As a kid,I watched "Snoopy,Come Home" on CBS every time it was on. Each year that it was on,I understood a little more about the storyline than the last time before. <br /><br />To very briefly summarize,Charlie Brown has gotten fed up with Snoopy's ongoing shenanigans and Snoopy feels rejected by his owner (whom he refers to in the comic strips as "that round -headed kid".)<br /><br />This sets him off on a quest to find his previous owner Lila,which comes about after Lila writes to Snoopy from the hospital,asking him to visit her.<br /><br />I'm guessing also Snoopy's thinking she will appreciate him more than Charlie. I wouldn't have admitted it when I was younger but the scenes between Lila & Snoopy plus Charlie & The kids saying good-bye at Snoopy's farewell party did make me sad. <br /><br />I never forgot the songs from this,"Smoopy,Come Home","No Dogs Allowed","It Changes" and of course "Me and You (A Two Man Crew"). I occasionally find myself whistling the latter song from time to time. Which just shows how strong and wonderful this animated film was.<br /><br />As for the ending,I think that not only are the kids glad Snoopy (and Woodstock) returned,I think Snoopy's glad too. ....but maybe he appreciates the friends he has in the Peanuts gang a lot more now. As for his askng for his things back,well,that's the way Snoopy "always" is! He's kinda smug sometimes,I give you that.<br /><br />10 stars,for this and all Charles Schulz brought to us through these characters. I really miss the Peanuts strip on Sundays. (END)
