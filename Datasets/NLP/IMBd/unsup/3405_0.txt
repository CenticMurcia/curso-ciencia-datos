I enjoyed watching this movie. It is well made with an interesting script and good acting performances. Kiera Knightly, especially, is wonderful to watch.<br /><br />Scriptwise it is fairly formulaic. Basic themes are: teenage coming of age, taking responsibility and the danger of the misuse of power.<br /><br />The thing that really grated was the scriptwriters wilful lack of knowledge of the powers of English kings.<br /><br />Watch it, it's amusing entertainment but of little enduring value.
