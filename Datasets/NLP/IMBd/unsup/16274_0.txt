I'll admit, I wasn't expecting too much when this appeared on CBC earlier tonight, but I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Rupert Everett, while no Jeremy Brett, is a very good Sherlock. The rest of the cast doesn't draw too much attention, but they are very passable.<br /><br />"Sherlock Holmes and the Case of the Silk Stocking" could have benefited slightly from being shortened to 1 and 1/2 hour instead of the apx. 1 hour 40 minutes.<br /><br />It would have tightened up the loose ends, and helped quite a bit.<br /><br />The BBC is best at the Holmes stories, and I would love to see another production starring Rupert Everett, who is certainly the best since Jeremy Brett.
