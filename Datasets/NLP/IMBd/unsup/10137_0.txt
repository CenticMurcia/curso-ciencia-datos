i thought this movie was an excellent representation of the misconceptions of other people and other cultures. throughout the movie we see that even though the Jesuits could communicate with the Natives and vice versa there was still a great amount of misunderstanding. though this movie may not be an exact historical time-line of events it was refreshing to see a story that wasn't so one sided, at least in my opinion. it showed how the Jesuits convinced the Hurons in the end to be baptized by convincing them that they would be healed of their sickness if they accepted God and also it showed how the Jesuits did not claim the responsibility of the foreign diseases brought over from the Old World but blamed it on the Native's lack of Christianity. this film also showed how both sides thought the other was stupid, the Native's believed the Jesuits God was the clock and didn't understand the whole concept or for instance when the Black robe was lost and the Native's were directing him- they didn't understand how or why these foreign people didn't know anything about working with the land. all in all i did enjoy this movie and i do recommend it. it has a lot of interesting and thought provoking concepts. being of partially Native decent i have encourage many of my friends to watch it and all them have been enlightened.
