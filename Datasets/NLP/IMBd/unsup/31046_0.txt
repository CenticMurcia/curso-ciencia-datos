This movie is a quotation after quotation of James Cameron's Aliens (1986)... or better said copy, rip off, stealing. Or, how do they call it now... "remake", "homage". Yes, if you like some movie and its (virtual) reality, you'd like to spend more of your time "in it", but you can do it creatively (invent your own sci-fi world, or your own story, or your own extrapolation of the story), but you don't copy everything word by word, scene by scene. Scene of the spaceship approaching planet (repeated more than three times of course), tough soldiers, colony on the planet, Ripley character, Hicks character, Newt-like character, Burke character, elevator scene, what more do we miss...? An alien! <br /><br />Roland Emmerich is good at copying movies, but I prefer cocktails like Indepenedence Day - where more famous movies and their features are blended into one VFX spectacle. This small movie is not even a B-category. I developed a category of his own, for Mr. Director. <br /><br />Regarding the "gay interest"... what do you mean? The wannabe-homoerotic electricity between Felix and Jake character? Yes, we all do dream :) Or the rape scene in the showers? Homosexuality = rape? Sexuality = violence? I might call it a hidden not-slightly homophobic remark...
