As a ex-Brit who is of a similar age and born in the same place as Norrington, but I am wondering what went wrong with him. I had never heard of this film until I saw it advertised on STARZ movie channel. I thought "oh good, fellow Brit, sounds like a good movie". Oh dear was I wrong....Parts I liked (no spoilers)...the camera work, Max Beesley's character, comic touches....Parts I didn't like....Tom Bell's character (totally unbelievable) as to was Jason Issacs, the end, the middle and about 90% of the story. Some of the scenes with Jason Issacs (Percy) actually were so gross and unbelievable that two of the people I was watching this with asked me to turn it off. I did not and watched the whole lot. I wished I had not bothered at all.<br /><br />Norrington is a genius, no doubt. But "The Last Minute" is for true UK fans only, Americans beware.
