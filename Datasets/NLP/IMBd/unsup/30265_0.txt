It's almost impossible to imagine that less than 100 years ago, our country's government did not allow its female citizens to vote, and what's sadder is, the men in charge at that time would NOT have amended the Constitution to include women if it hadn't been for relentlessly driven, fiercely intelligent and humblingly courageous people like Alice Paul, who was depicted in this show as being deeply conflicted about how far she knew she would have to go to push the envelope, but she did it anyway because it simply had to be done. In this day and age, all young girls (who take so much for granted) should be made to watch this film as a brutal lesson in history. Kudos to all concerned, particularly Hilary Swank who couldn't have been any more compelling as the heroic Alice Paul.
