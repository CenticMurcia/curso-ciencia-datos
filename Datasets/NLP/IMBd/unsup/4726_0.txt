My girlfriend dragged me to this movie because it was her turn to pick. I was definitely not looking forward to going to a chick flick. But to my surprise it was a pretty hilarious movie. I wouldn't say though that the acting was superb, but it was descent. I'm not used to seeing Mathew McMonaughey in a romantic comedy. The last movie I saw with him in it was `A Time to Kill'. And in that movie he was co starring beside Samuel L. Jackson, who hasn't been in too many chick flicks if you know what I'm saying. I was surprised in what a good job he did in this romantic comedy, he held his own nicely beside Kate Hudson who is an excellent actor who can obviously play many different roles (Almost Famous). I'm glad they made this movie more into a comedy than into a sappy chick flick, I know I would have fallen asleep in the theater if it was unbearably sappy. I thought the movie had many comedic parts and which had girlfriend and I laughing hysterically in our seats. All in all, it was a good pick by my significant other and I gave the movie a 7/10. That's a good rating in my books, considering it was a romantic comedy.
