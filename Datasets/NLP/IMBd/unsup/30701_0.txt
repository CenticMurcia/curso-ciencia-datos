You have read all about the plot, so here is something a little deeper. I just wanted to clear up a few things, I have read a lot of comments on this film and read it was filmed in New Jersey. This is incorrect. This movie was shot in my neighborhood of Port Richmond on Staten Island, New York. Google it, its not NJ, guys. I work a block away from the rail yard that is shown very often in the film, and actually hung out down there in my teens. Because of this, the movie really hit home and stayed with me for a while. I just watched Combat Shock for the first time in 2008 at 28yrs old. And Port Richmond sure did look bleak back in 86, apocalyptic is more the word. I recognized most of the streets and it was depressing, and nostalgic for me to see my neighborhood in such ruins. Port Richmond ave has now populated much more, 90% by illegal immigrants. Most of the businesses that are run down in the film are now active with furniture shops, Mexican food joints and 99 cent stores. But the rail yard remains the same, though non functional for the last 20 years. A total run down abandon hole in the ground ravished with graffiti, bums and littered with empty drug baggies. I thought the film was great, and was even better being a sort of time capsule for me. I can't get this movie out of my head. It was like a window into the darkest crevices of my town, the places I would think about and fear growing up.
