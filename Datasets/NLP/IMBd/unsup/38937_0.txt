I always try to support or fight for low budget or independent film and from what I understand this is a low budget one, and for that it should be commended. To be fair it's not overly obvious that money was tight. However that's not the reason I didn't like this film.<br /><br />The plot in a nutshell is troubled teenager fresh out of rehab rejoins family in a new town. Cue an urban legend about a school bus stopping on the railroad tracks and a train smashing into it and killing all involved. Legend has it that if you put your car in neutral on the tracks the ghosts of the dead children will move your car off leaving behind fingerprints that you can see if you cover your car with talc beforehand.......yawn! Then there's a twist that's so blatant you want to shout at the scriptwriter, and a dark figure killing people all of a sudden. So there's nothing original in the story, it's clich√© ridden, but acted okay...so far so average.<br /><br />The problem I had with the film was there wasn't a nice person in it, I couldn't have cared less about any of them including the heroine. I found myself refusing to give up on the film in case some good came of it, but desperately clock watching and wishing it would finish. It drags, it treats you like you're stupid, and you want them all to die.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend it but it's not bad enough to say avoid like the plague.
