When I began watching this movie I believed that it was supposed to be a parody movie, such as Scary Movie. But after a few moments I came to the realization it wasn't. The acting is terrible, the script is worse than the acting, and the plot was worse than the script.<br /><br />What really got me was the back cover description, which had in one part:<br /><br />Who is the killer? Is he cute? Will they ever make it to the dance on time?<br /><br />That was the worst.<br /><br />...Wait, no. The worst was their reaction to the killings of their best friends. They give out a really fake, bad scream with little facial expression, then make some witty remark. Like when The cute virgin is pulled apart by whatever, the two friends find her and says "now that's just stretching it." What the hell! Wouldn't you be freaking out that A) your friend was stretched that far and B) is still talking and C) her arms haven't ripped off.<br /><br />Oh, and the kid and teacher having relations is just disturbing. "Something's leaking." "That's supposed to happen." ... "I'm on fire." "Me too, I'm so hot." "No, I'm really on fire!" *camera moves to her foot, which is on fire*<br /><br />If you are bored and want to laugh at such a terrible piece of work, rent this movie and watch it with some friends.
