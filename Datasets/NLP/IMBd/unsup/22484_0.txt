but this film ticks all my boxes. I have never seen anything quite like it. <br /><br />I saw this well before Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and the comparison was painful to my eyes. CTHD was a beautiful film in its own way but it was far too westernised (e.g. it had an eye on the lowest common denominator, concentration on high production values rather than telling a story).<br /><br />A Touch of Zen was mercifully made in a time before such depressing trends in films. It does not patronise the viewer with overly sentimental gushing that is needlessly inserted in order to generate a love interest. Or with OTT 'mood music' to prompt you how to feel because the script isn't up to the job.<br /><br />One of the main fighters is a woman, but there is no attempt to portray her as some 'chick with attitude'.<br /><br />The pacing of the film is also perfect, allowing the wonderful characterisation of the main player to develop fully.<br /><br />At just under 3 hours, and with the unusual mix of pure action with an intelligent and sensible story, this film is not going to be to everyones tastes. But its well worth a look because if you like it, you are liable to love it.
