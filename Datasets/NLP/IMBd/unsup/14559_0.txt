It's so many years since i saw this film, but i'll never forget it. I have been looking for it everywhere, but couldn't find it. It was me and my sister watching with no expectation. When it was finished, we wanted more. Some years ago i was in a DVD-shop in my hometown, looking for another movie, i was listening to another costumer asking for this movie "La Belle Historie". He told the owner of the shop exactly the same story as mine about the experience watching this film. He said that his class from school saw the film at the movie, and they all had the same reaction. He never forgot it too. Well thats my story.. One day i will be lucky to see it again..(sorry for my bad English):o)
