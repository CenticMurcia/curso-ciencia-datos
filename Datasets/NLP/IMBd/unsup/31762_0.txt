This film is graphic and in some cases extreme. This movie will please Lindsay Lohan haters in that we get to see the drug abusing girl get tortured to the greatest extent. This film is very good in it's genre and offers many facets of horror and thriller/drama genre. The film was not the best film in the world and definitely not Oscar worthy. I gave it a 7 because even though it lacks in some departments some of the torture scenes were new and ones i've never seen presented on film before. The plot of the film was a good premise but may have been executed a little below average. Although it is a good film the acting is standard and decent while the dialoque is sort of wooden and flat it does feel real and almost accurate.
