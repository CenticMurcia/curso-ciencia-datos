Midwest married couple, George and Gwen Kellerman, chronicle their Big Apple nightmares when George races to make a job interview, and everything seems to go as wrong as possible.<br /><br />If you like Neil Simon's comedic plays and films, then this is the one to place on your 'must see' list. Actors Lemmon and Dennis each do an impeccably hilarious job. Lemmon, again, is the epitome of 'perfect timing' and has the material down pat, and Dennis is great at looking jet-lagged and harried. Neither of these actors goes too much over the top as to seem unbelievable, and (personally) their is enough credible 'couple' chemistry to support this.<br /><br />On the Remake: Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn reprised the Kellerman roles in a recent remake of the untouchable Simon original script. <br /><br />There was promise in adding to Lemmon's original 'George' portrayal, but Martin does nothing to improve on the other actors previous comedic timings, and overall portrayal of a neurotic businessman bent on getting every Manhattanite's name down so that he can later sue them for whatever inconvenience he (or his wife) has been subjected to. <br /><br />Hawn only has one notable seen in the remake (as wife 'Gwen'), when she throws her scene of furor at the police station.
