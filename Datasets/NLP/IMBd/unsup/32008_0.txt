Though some would beg to differ, Desert Bloom is one of the most powerful movies and stories of our time. It's a tale of a dysfunctional family in the 1950's when it was uncommon for the public to see the truth behind closed doors. An amazing script and creative camera angles and lighting makes this movie worth seeing a few times before you can fully understand it's beauty.<br /><br />Annabeth Gish in her breakout/breakthrough roll deserved a supporting actress nomination. Unfortunately, in 1986 it was uncommon for a young actor to receive such a nomination. Ms. Gish is an under rated actress who is worthy of powerful rolls and casting in present day.<br /><br />The chemistry between Ellen Barkin and Annabeth Gish's is amazing as well as JoBeth William's portrayal of a truth-blind housewife. Jon Voight, is well -- Jon Voight -- consistant and erie.
