Iraq was in a terrible way LONG before the American came. Saddam was the modern day Stalin and Hitler. Gasing people with different political and religious views and torturing his own people. In the film they show many actual evidence of these acts. They even go back with recored audio of John Kerry agreeing with the invasion of Iraq along with Senetor Clinton and Kennedy.<br /><br />I however like the comparison with the Saddam era Abu Gharib and the American Abu Gharaib. Neither are acceptable but Saddams was MUCH WORSE! We ALL need to see this. <br /><br />10 out of 10. Two thumbs WAY UP!
