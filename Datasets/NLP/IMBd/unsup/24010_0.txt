The movie fails to transcend the screen, and stays simply as a piece of film, a point in history.<br /><br />The movie focuses on a group of people attempting to change the outcome of Ohio in the 2004 Presidential Election. The film presents, in the beginning, the views of exclusively democrats, but gradually things open up.<br /><br />The movie's true fault lies in the fact the only take aways one has from the film are factual and concrete, no ideas to be applied to other situations. But in documenting the lives of these individuals during the 2004 race the movie succeeds.<br /><br />So Goes the Nation is movie for the truly politically motivated or those interested in the 2004 Pres. Election. 7/10
