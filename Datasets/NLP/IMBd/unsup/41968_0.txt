The beginning is OK, the end is OK. But the remaining 100 minutes are boring. The story is pretty slow and talkative. There are characters who are supposed to be funny and who are just dull.(Except Jean-Pierre Marielle as the gay detective who was great. Not interesting. It was time for Argento to leave thriller for fantastic. 4/10 (and i feel like a nice person)
