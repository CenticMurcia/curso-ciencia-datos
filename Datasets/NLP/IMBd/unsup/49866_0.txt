I didn't care for the music, which looked as if it were going to be a dominant component of this movie. I stuck with it a little, though, and I'm really glad: Pat O'Brien is very funny as a variation on Oscar Jaffe from "Twentieth Century." He's demanding and devious. When crossed, he faux-accidentally breaks a watch he tearfully says was given him by his late mother. Toward the end of the movie, thought we already know it is a ruse, he does this and his secretary -- Penny Singleton in mousy costuming -- says his mother is on the phone. And she wants a tip on the next race at Saratoga.<br /><br />John Payne as the bandleader is OK. The rest of the cast is OK. Jimmie Fiddler plays himself, in a sizable role and that's a nice touch.<br /><br />The writing is the star here, though. And it is a great role for O'Brien.
