Actually it wasn't too bad for a made for TV horror and post-Scream outing. "I've Been Waiting For You" (another eye grabbing title) is a feebly light-weight teenage aimed story mixing elements of witchcraft (leading girl interested in the occult / the town living in fear of a curse) / slasher staples (killer with metal claws, black cloak and a hokey looking mask) that when it came to the crunch it's rather diluted, but doesn't hurt. Fashionable, but formulaic we've seen it all before. The story (taken off the novel of Lois Duncan --- Gallows Hill --- who was also behind "Stranger in Our House" and "I know What You Did Last Summer") might consist of messy plot details (trying to be too clever at times, than letting it flow), an terribly incoherent staged climax (which is risible for all the wrong reasons and so are the flimsy attacks sequences) and bestowing a heavy-handed script, but in all it keeps you wrapped within the shallow mystery thanks to largely the agreeable performances (of mainly not particularly likable characters). Sarah Chalke is exceptionally good in the lead, giving her character spunk with her smart-lipped lines. The rest of the cast get your basic teenage sketching. Director Christopher Leitch (''Teen Wolf too'' (1987), oh yeah!) offers no real surprises by doing a pedestrian job, creating a decent image or two, but suspense and atmosphere is weakly conceived. Even though it begins to lose its puff towards the end, gladly the time still breezes by if transparently.
