This was a fun movie. It's not to be taken seriously, and anyone who does will be disappointed. It's supposed to be a humorous take on the Trabbi and East/West Germany. Lighten up, folks. If you really know what's going on, you'll appreciate the subtle jokes more.<br /><br />I'd MUCH rather watch this again than Eurotrip, which was just a blatant take on American's view of Europe. Driving Me Crazy was refreshing and silly with mild historical undertones.<br /><br />Please, give this film a chance. I really enjoyed it and the people I showed it to did as well. This is a good movie to show a German class for a fun movie day or something.
