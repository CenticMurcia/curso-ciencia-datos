This film is one of the worst book to movie adaptations of all time. In fact, all of Michael Crichton's books since Jurassic Park was a smash hit have been sub par to downright awful and this is no exception. First of all, the book is not one of his best, although the plot actually makes sense in the book. In less than five minutes, the entire "explanation" for how this time travel is possible is explained. However, the scientific explanation which takes several pages in the book to describe, and is reasonable if not far-fetched isn't used at all. The acting is also dreadful with one very notable exception. Gerrard Butler is fantastic (or as fantastic as he can be with this script). Even though the film itself deserves a 1 (or negative 7, but I can't seem to put that in). His attempt to save the film by actually acting forced me to give it a two. Don't bother seeing the film, but look for Butler in other things that have such crutial elements as a plot, acting and a script.
