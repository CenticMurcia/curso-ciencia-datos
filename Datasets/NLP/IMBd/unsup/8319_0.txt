This is the type of film that some might say only becomes clear in the final minutes. I'd partially agree with that. A young man wakes from a 4 year long coma to discover that he murdered his fianc√© and has been locked in a mental institution. His doctor, seeking to treat him, sends him to The House of Love for therapy. Once there he meets the other patients and is troubled by half realized memories and strange deja vu ... not to mention the murder of some of the other patients. I won't say any more than that plotwise. Andras Jones plays the lead, and I enjoyed his performance. I would have to admit that his acting is inconsistent throughout the film, but somehow, this makes his performance all the more endearing. The inconsistency seems to suit the storyline in a positive manner. Seth Green, who I strongly disliked before this film, has made me a fan. Beth Bates is, to be quite honest, pretty bad performance wise (though gorgeous in my humble opinion). In her defense, much of the little dialog she has, would be tough for even the most talented actress. All of the other actors do a good job. The score is wonderful, the type you'll remember after one viewing. The sets are nice, especially considering the budget, and the film is very well shot. You can probably find the DVD for 10 bucks. A real bargain in my opinion. This is the kind of film that you'll either love or hate. If you love it, you'll likely be left to ponder it for days. I said earlier that I would only partially agree with someone if they said that it only becomes clear in the end. It may become clear, but it raises more questions than an answer should. Bravo!
