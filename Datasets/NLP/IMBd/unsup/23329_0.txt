I saw this on a date back when this first came out. Afterwards I figured out what Hell must be like, constantly showing movies starring Britney Spears, Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan, Hillary Duff, Hannah Montana, and the Olson twins.<br /><br />I couldn't have expected anything from a movie that starred 16 year old millionaires who had a successful TV show ("Full House") and a couple of videotapes for nine year old girls. In this stinker, the Olson twins play two twin sisters (Wow! what a surprise!) who are completely different and get to explore New York for a day and come into some kind of run in with Chinese criminals and truant officers.<br /><br />All I have to say like idk, omg! this film is like so annoying! What on God's green Earth did I do to deserve to be shown this film. It had without a doubt, the single worst plot in the history of mankind. The acting was shoddy, half of the dialog was stuff you would hear on instant messenger.<br /><br />I certainly hope that al-Qaeda doesn't get a hold of this movie, because it's New York and it's a bomb. With every NEW YORK MINUTE that passed, I could feel by IQ drop quickly.
