The concept for the film sounded like an alright nights viewing; two dudes have party and take lots of drugs. But straight from the beginning i knew this was not the case. This film looks as though it was funded by money found on the floor and filmed with a camera found in the bin, but that didn't stop me watching it, i needed to know the point to the film, and by the end did i find one, let me think, no. It does present an image of Hollywood that is not portrayed in many films today, the seedy dirty side where the normal people exist. And its good to see that there are bum stoner's in the land of peroxide and silicone.<br /><br />The director/actor/writer of the film clearly sees himself as some kind smooth new hotshot, but the fact of the matter is, his acting couldn't be any worse. he walks around mumbling and over acting his lines, trying to act super cool. Oh and Shannon Elizabeth, the tits from American pie, is in it for about as long as it take to say, pointless.<br /><br />Watch this film at your own risk. Just make sure your not sober and you didn't pay.
