As I watched this film for the first time, I couldn't help but feel that I had seen it before. The Nanny Diaries is a high-quality knock-off of The Devil Wears Prada. If you have never seen the Devil Wears Prada, then you will most likely enjoy this film. If you have seen the Devil Wears Prada, then this film may look good to you on the rental shelf, but ultimately feel cheep once you get it home, as most knock-off's do.<br /><br />The main character in The Devil Wears Prada is a personal assistant. In this film, the main character is a nanny. In the Devil Wears Prada, the climax takes place in Paris. In this film, the climax is in Nantucket. That is pretty much where the differences between the two movies stop. Both positions described in these movies are those of the "hired help." Both characters discover their self-worth. Both characters discover that their mean bosses were forced to be that way in order to survive their respective lots in society. Both movies state that a life of luxury has a hidden price. Both characters elect to be happy with the middle-class. Both characters have the opportunity to marry rich. Both stories take place in New York. Both characters have unique cell phones. Both have jobs that essentially dictate that they carry a cell, and so on, and so on, and so on, ad nauseam.
