Yes, I think he did with his television show "Lost" on ABC. The similarities are endless and obvious. The only differences are the characters names and the monsters. But, the storyline is almost identical. People crash on an island after their planes explodes into two pieces. There are only a few survivors who are focused on. These characters eventually die one by one. The island is also inhabited by some other group of people whose ship crashes on the island. They are immediately seen as the enemy to our main characters too. It just goes to show nothing in Hollywood is new. An idea is recycled again,again and again. This movie sucked,"Lost" sucks and so did Sir Athur ConenDoyle's book. THE END!
