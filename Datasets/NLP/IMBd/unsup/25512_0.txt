Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte is one of my all time favorite books in all the English Literature. It was a required reading in my college in Taiwan where I grew up. I have read the book at least 10 times and have memorized many of the written conversations between Jane Eyre and Mr. Rochester. When I saw the TV series by Sorcha Cusack and Michael Jayston, I was immediately impressed how true the entire series was to the book, even the conversations were taken directly from the book. The performance of both Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester by Ms Cusack and Mr Jayston was astounding. I have seen several versions of Jane Eyre over the years, including the one by Timothy Dalton, but none was nearly as good as this one. I believe if the series was done in the U S it would have won a number of Emmy Awards, certainly Michael Jayston would have won the best actor in the drama role . It was the best adaptation of the book I've ever watched.
