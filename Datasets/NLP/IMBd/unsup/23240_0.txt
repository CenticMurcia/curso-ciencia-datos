This movie by Robert Duvall was fantastic, and moved me to actually sign up for tango lessons! The film bears two or three viewings to really get the "feel" of the whole storyline, and the "heart" of the personalities... at first I did not like it as I was expected another "preacher" story (Duvall's first fantastic film he wrote as well). However, subsequent watchings served greater and greater understanding, which can be the mark of many a great work of art.<br /><br />The DVD has great deleted scenes and commentaries which helped make sense of the complicated story line unfolding before our eyes. I wish I could have been there, speaking Spanish with Duvall, walking the tree lined boulevards and sitting on the old stone benches; feeling the warm breeze all around. What a taste treat all around. Hope there are many sequels to this one. The first one was "just a taste."<br /><br />"The Tango is Life" in all its travails, majesty and glory ~ hardships, suffering, love, hate, goodness and evil... I would like to know more. I truly hope Duvall brings this character back to life and shows us "what comes next." Fascinating!
