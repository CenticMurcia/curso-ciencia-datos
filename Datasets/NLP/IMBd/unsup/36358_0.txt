Admittedly I've seen a lot of bad films in my time but this has to be one of the worst films I've ever seen. First of all the plot is really ridiculous and there is no apparent beginning and the ending isn't all that great either. The fact that there is no beginning proves that the director obviously thought it would be a good idea to push the viewer into the middle of the action to get the instant involvement but it only serves to confuse and annoy. Secondly the plot is way too complicated for its own good. The story has a lot of twists and turns and they are obviously there to keep the audience guessing as to what might happen next. However, again I must say that it only succeeds in confusing and annoying the viewer. People really aren't looking for a really deep, complicated storyline in a TV-action movie. Now as for the actors they are generally really bad. Teri Hatcher is completely uninteresting and sucks as a mother. I'd be really sad to have her as my mother. Rob Lowe who is actually a decent actor but he does some of the worst acting throughout his entire career. Trevor Blumas... well Trevor Blumas sucks. Not at a single time is he believable. He sucks throughout the entire movie.<br /><br />All in all a really poor effort 2 out of 10
