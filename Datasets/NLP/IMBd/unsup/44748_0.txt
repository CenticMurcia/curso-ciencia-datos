One of the worst films I've ever seen. Great cast, including, Gary Sinise, Anna Paquin, Giovanni Ribisi, Joan Allen, Jeff Daniels, is totally wasted. However, a great role was also wasted, David Schwimmer could have done so much with his role as a gun crazed homosexual, but instead he was boring and useless. Why does this guy act out of "Friends", or at all?<br /><br />I don't want to talk about this movie to much, it's just wasting my time. This film totally sucked and DO NOT SEE IT!
