Like other reviewers, I've acquired the remastered DVD version of 'Buck Privates'. Bud and Lou fit into the story pretty well, far better than their stint in 'One Night in the Tropics'. The story rolls along at a breakneck pace and I especially enjoyed the steam loco shots as the train transported the boys to boot camp. The Andrews Sisters as usual are fabulous with some great songs.<br /><br />What really impressed me was the photography, perhaps not something people would normally comment on in an A & C movie. Previous copies I've viewed have been grainy and washed out whereas this new print is visually great to look at. It was interesting for the first time to be able examine characters in the background, see facial expressions more clearly and especially, watch Lou 'working' both Bud and the crew off screen.<br /><br />Clearly, Lou, like Stan Laurel and Buster Keaton, was a genius of comedy timing, the likes of which we may never see again.
