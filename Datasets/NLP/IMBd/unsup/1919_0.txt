Let's talk about 'Polarization' here a minute! This is one of those you either love it or hate it. I don't believe that there are too many in the middle. It's a tough spot to be in, when you are not a teen, to successfully understand the current teen crazes and fads, let alone the mindset! So it's trouble enough trying to capture this successfully when you are a big Hollywood mucky-muck like Altman . There is nothing wrong with writing a teenage comedy/ drama as an older writer, only thing that you will probably experience is the 'oldisms' in that writer's speech. Old phrases and ideas about life and other stuff. Some will say, 'Yeah, but teens are pretty universal'. But, the generations change due to many things. There was however Cameron Crow that set the high-school genre on it's 'ear' with with the creating of "Fast Times At Ridgemont High" which for me growing up back then was straight between the eyes! He hit it dead on, no doubt. Teenaged angst, the thought-line and logic that they use, etc. <br /><br />In "O.C. & Stiggs" this carries a cast of great personalities from the past. A few of them, are gone now, but that is one of the reasons that I loved this now but not when I saw it then....how strange, but funny. It just did it's job over time and grew on me. These two are some what organized in their life and pursue ts, but bored with some things and upset at others. The problems and ideas for solutions that they have are fun, and the Arizona scenery to me, is nostalgic to see then all that has changed from what was a simpler time to be alive....the eighties. Enjoy this 1984 made and 1987 released cult classic. (***)
