i only rented this because Carol Alt is in it (i really like her). but even her acting is dreadful. this is one of those "christian" propaganda films that is trying to be "spooky" but it just comes across as boring and stupid. and the whole virtual reality aspect of the plot and how it is used to stop Armageddon is just ridiculous and dated. the ONLY good part about watching this is seeing Tony Nappo with his shirt off. sadly, those scenes are limited. thanks to this film (my first "christian" horror film), i won't be seeing any other religious brainwashing movies aimed at the family market. my advice is to not waste your time on this dud!
