but it was still pretty good. It wasn't quite as good as 'The Life of Larry', but then again, it had to be a bit more child-friendly to be on Cartoon Network. It was worth the half hour download time (My computer is VERY slow) for the one or two laugh-out-loud moments, but any longer than that, and there's not really much point. It's not hard to see who Steve later evolved into (a more famous cartoon by Seth Macfarlane) but unlike 'The Life of Larry', none of the jokes are reused in 'Family Guy'. One of the only bad points I can make about it was the classic cartoon scream, where the characters eyes go wider than their head. When this is used on Steve, it's cringe worthy.
