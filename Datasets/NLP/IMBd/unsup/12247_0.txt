This film has action aplenty. The concept is very intriguing, especially these days. It looks fantastic. Incredible cinematography. Was it 35mm? Must have been. The music is great. Oh, by the way...interesting side note...did anyone know that Marco Beltrami, who did the score for The Incorporated, just did the score for T3 with the good ol' Governor? Yes...little known fact! Isn't this Kenneth Guertin's first feature, or at least the first one registered on IMDB? Not too shabby! Big future ahead for this guy.
