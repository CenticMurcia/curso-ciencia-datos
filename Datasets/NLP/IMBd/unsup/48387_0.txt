This movie was horrible because I had no clue what was going on at any given moment. I bought this movie strictly because Julian McMahon starred in it and he was only in the movie for like five minutes which was very disappointing. I did look forward to his scenes, though which gave me some excitement. I did not understand the plot of the movie nor the ending. Jeff Daniels played a pretty decent part considering I paid more attention to Julian McMahon's little parts. I should have rented this movie first before I bought it. If you are looking for a lot of Julian McMahon scenes, don't buy this movie. He was only in two scenes in the entire movie and you hear his voice on the telephone once. Oh, and by the way, they misspelled Julian McMahon's name on the DVD cover. They spelled it MacMahon but at the end of the movie, they spelled it McMahon.
