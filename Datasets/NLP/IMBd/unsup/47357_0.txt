Brendan Fraser is an above average actor who is made to look like a star by the wooden "acting" of Elizabeth Hurley. Whoever told her she could act wants locking in a padded cell. Each time Fraser moves into a different character you hope that the film will fulfill it's potential and then just as you are getting into it we go back to Hurley which not only brings the film back to Earth but on it's way to Hell. The original with Peter Cooke and Dudley Moore was a much better film. I realy think that films with Liz Hurley in should have a big warning on them so I don't watch them by accident. I would have given this film a 7 but Hurley has brought it down to a 4.
