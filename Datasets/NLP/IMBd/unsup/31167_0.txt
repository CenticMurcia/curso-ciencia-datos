I've never thought after From Dusk Till Dawn that someone would try to make a clone of that movie. Actually, Gulager and Project Greenlight did.<br /><br />This movie is about monsters invading a pub full of miserable losers. Well, the fountain of my problems is found in the last two words. Yes, the characters! Totally indifferent people, whose fate is totally indifferent, whom we don't care about if they survive or not. Awful dialogues and a truly miserable plot describes the whole movie - every element has been seen elsewhere, mostly in Romero's NotLD and Rodriguez's From Dusk..., but they've been put together to make a totally indifferent film, that makes you think: who cares who dies? Who cares what happens? Why didn't they just all die, it wouldn't have done anything different for you.<br /><br />The other problem beside the high level of indifference and the pathetic characters is the bad editing. During action scenes this makes the movie so quick we don't even know what happens, can't see a thing. The only good point is gore, which is not limited, that's why I give more than 1 star. But avoid this movie at all costs!
