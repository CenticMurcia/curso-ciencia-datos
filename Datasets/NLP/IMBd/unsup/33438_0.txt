This movie is so incredibly bad, it stands out on its own, it can't be categorized even into the sub-zero "Z" grade of Japanese monster flicks. (Several of them were quite good, in fact). A buddy & I dabbled in film-making on our own in the 50s, and the stuff we shot was D.W. Griffith or C.B. DeMille compared to this one! The broken airplane hanging on a string, the Lionel train, the village with the name "Plasticville" on the side,the Bernz-O-Matic torch sticking out of Godzilla's mouth, all of these things and so many more make it an absolute agony to watch, in fact, that's what makes it so good: waiting for the next scene to see if it will possibly be any worse than the last one! Its most memorable piece is the emergency convening of the Japanese Joint Chiefs of Staff, as the monsters are wholesale destroying Tokyo, nuclear bombs can't stop them, the combined military might of of all the Allied forces just make them more angry. Calling the meeting to order, the chairman blurts the stupidest line in cinema history when he says "GENTLEMEN, THE SITUATION BEFORE US IS SO BAD, IT'S WORSE THAN IT'S EVER BEEN BEFORE!" <br /><br />This one is so bad, it can't even be rated as "good" because of its badness, absolutely, positively, without par or equal, the worst film ever made (And trust me on this, I've spent 50+ years screening bad movies, and this one made me put down my beer, sit up straight in the chair, drop my jaw, and say to myself: "THIS PIECE OF S**T IS SO F(*&^%G BAD< I"VE GOT TO HAVE MY OWN COPY TODAY!!! I won't even give "benefit of doubt" to the possibly it may have been done this way on purpose!<br /><br />Now, I generally rate the Jap monster flicks by how far off the lip movement is to the sound track, this one, who cares? This is one Bad, awful, movie. Check it out! IT SUCKS! AND REALLY BAD!!!<br /><br />Oh, yeah, almost forgot: There's a cut scene that has nothing whatsoever to do with the rest of the film, a group of veterinarians watching a film of someone slicing open a huge boil on the nose of an elephant, and gallons of pus and swarms of maggots pouring out! Why is it there? I don't know! Go figure! YUUCHH!
