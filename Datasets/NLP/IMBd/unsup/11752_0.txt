"Kopps" was a really funny comedy. The way life is in a typical sleepy smalltown is portrayed perfectly, and the different characters are all funny in their own ways. The idea here is that a police station is threatened to shut down, because in this smalltown there hasn't been a serious crime for ten years. The policemen realize that something has to be done... and soon they're in deep trouble. I recommend it! 4.5/5
