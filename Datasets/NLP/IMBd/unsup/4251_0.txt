Wow, I love this short. This is about the best Tom and Jerry cartoon you can find, as it is absolutely tops in both quality of animation and laughs. In fact, I think that Tom and Jerry cartoons of the 40s are highly underrated and in many cases are superior to those of Warner Brothers--especially in regard to the quality of the animation.<br /><br />Tom is at the beach trying to woo a cute lady cat. And, to help woo her, he brings along Jerry as his slave. Jerry is throttled again and again by Tom until finally Jerry escapes and decides to get revenge. And in this case revenge includes shoving an angry crab on Tom's tail, nearly drowning Tom and finally making the moves on Tom's girl. The film is nearly non-stop action and fun.
