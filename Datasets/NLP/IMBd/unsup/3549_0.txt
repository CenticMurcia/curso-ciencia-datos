Tremendous Faith shown by a woman who was not sure of how she felt about Jesus until the communist tried to beat it out of her. She had God's divine protection when a firing squad was ordered to shoot her. True story of God's Love in Action Everyone who is not sure that God is real needs to read the book or watch the movie. You will be moved to tears to see that God is still Alive and well and watching over His own. Inspirational, courageous, suspenseful. A great film I give it a 10+
