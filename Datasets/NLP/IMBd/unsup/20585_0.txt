this direct to video horror movie has quite a low rating on this site(3.1/10).i'd have to disagree with such a low rating.while,i'll admit it' no masterpiece, i did like it.it is pretty much your typical teen horror film,but no worse.there is some nudity(yay!)and some pretty decent kills,with a good amount of gore.there are your typical teen stereotypes getting high out in the wilderness.the problem is,the movie takes too long to get to the gore and really good kills.once the blood starts flying though,it doesn't let up.the movie borrows a bit from the 1981 movie "Wolfen",giving us some shots from the creatures point of view.other than this movie and "Wolfen",i haven't seen that done in any other movie.not that it's a great effect or anything,but it is something most movies of the genre don't employ.the acting isn't that great and some of the dialogue is pretty bad,to say the least.However,i really liked Dione Updike,who plays Aimee,Johnston,one of the game wardens who hunts the creature.She was very convincing in her role and easy on the eyes too.finally,the creature itself.not quite realistic looking,but not as bad as some movies of the genre.oh,yea,the creature is basically,half man,half wolf.the difference is,it retains the intelligence of man.i guess you'd call it a werewolf,although they never actually say the word in the movie.the ending i thought was kind of odd.overall,though, the movie is entertaining and should satisfy gore hounds. though this puts me in the minority,i give "The Feeding" 7/10
