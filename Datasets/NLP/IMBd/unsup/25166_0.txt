I just wish it was longer, an hour long short would do. If that makes any sense at all. The plot drew me in like a magnetron pull. The best part though is your wonder and amazement through the adventure. Bravo I do say so myself for a well organized structure of a story. I just can't believe this isn't a big hit. I mean yes it does have some dry humor in it. That is because it fits like a skeleton key in these generic movies with extraordinary plots. I do feel a little "deja vu" in a sense. It feels like this was a in a show or was a short clip of a movie. Or maybe just a hybrid of random plots that already steam-lined through my mind. Don't take my word for it, see it. And see it anywhere you can(I just watched it on this site). Just imagine if this movie was a little stretched out. Instead of punching you in the face with an explosion of climatic cinema type. Maybe that is just me, but sometimes it feels like you need to beat around the bush to get to the bass of a situation. Still a great plot, climax, and hero.
