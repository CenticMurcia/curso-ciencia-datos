Maybe that's not quite the right description but it's the first thing that came to mind while watching it. Several stories, all comic and surreal, intertwine until the very end where something is resolved. What, who knows?<br /><br />The art direction is spectacular especially in the main protagonist's mansion. It's unexplained how this mope and his girlfriend came to live in it. The pace of the film is wonderful and the soundtrack is very well designed. <br /><br />This film is a real treat if you don't need linear story telling or a rational plot line. While there is no nudity, there is a lot of crude sex talk. The violence is very modest except for a couple of scenes but it's cartoony bloodletting. Unfortunately, the film does starts with the customary Japanese male violence against women but at least it turns into something interesting as the film progresses.<br /><br />Very recommended.
