If i could give this movie a Zero , i would.. this sequel was TOTALLY unnessasary ... <br /><br />First of all , Christopher Lambert wasnt in it as "Lord Rayden" and i dont even know who the heck the actor was that portrayed Him..<br /><br />>>>>>SPOILER AHEAD>>>>>>> then secondly, "Johnny Cage" was a different actor too, not Linden Ashby.. and i didnt know who that actor was either.. and then right near the start of the movie, "Johhny" gets killed .. im sorry i ever rented this stinker in the first place.. i was expecting it to be similar to the first one.. Oh was I ever Wrong!!<br /><br />so just pass this turkey by in the video store and rent the first "Mortal Kombat" its Way better than the second one.. i DONT recommend this trashy movie at all ...
