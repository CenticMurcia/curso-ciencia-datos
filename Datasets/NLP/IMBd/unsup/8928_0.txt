I saw this film last night at the Fantasia film festival and I really enjoyed it!! It's well written, well directed and the relatively unknown actors are doing a fine job! In fact my only complaint, but it's a major one in my book, reside in the image quality of this film. As far as I understand, this film was shot on mini-DV and, unfortunately, it shows. There's a serious lack of definition and, most of the time, the image is very noisy! Hopefully it will look better whenever it comes out on DVD but, on a giant screen in a theater, it doesn't come out very good. Take in note that I work in the industry as a quality control technician, so my opinion on this matter could be a little strong compare to most people. As a matter of fact a friend of mine was present during this showing and told me that she didn't even notice that it was shot on mini-DV so... :) Beside that factor I really enjoyed this film and I strongly recommend it!
