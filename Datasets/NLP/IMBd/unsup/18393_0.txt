I thought that maybe over the course of 30 minutes, a show billing itself as "edgy satire with political/social overtones and intense physical comedy" would elicit at least a snicker or two. Instead, I found myself increasingly angry that my tax money (throught the Canadian Film Tax Grants program) was being wasted on this garbage. Not one laugh, chuckle, tee-hee or even a smile came across my face while this was on.<br /><br />It's the worst kind of comedy - bland, poorly delivered, and totally lacking in talent. Anyone associated with this show should be ashamed of themselves. The 'humour' is so painfully forced from the performers, it's actually hard to watch.<br /><br />Also, canned laughter should have been abolished after the demise of the '80s sitcom. It only serves to prove that no one in their right mind would find the show funny.<br /><br />I recommend turning the channel and watching anything else if this happens to be on. I would have given it a zero if I could have.
