I didn't expect an awful lot from this film, I sat prepared to just go along for the ride and take whatever enjoyment I could from the experience. Which is why I'm so surprised it left me quite this disappointed.<br /><br />There were one or two moments that aroused a vague smile, but it fell far short of anything I'd consider comedy. The acting was, for the most part, painfully wooden... movements so deliberate and self-conscious that you'd think you were watching the rehearsal... constantly jolting me out of the (generous level of) suspension of disbelief I was affording it.<br /><br />The plot was uninteresting, tired and boring. I felt nothing for any of the characters, they all could have been eaten or horribly killed and I wouldn't have cared in the slightest.<br /><br />This is a bad film, plain and simple. The only recommendation I'd give it is to someone I disliked.
