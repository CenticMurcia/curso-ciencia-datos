I saw Hellbent at the San Francisco Frameline Film Festival. The Castro Theatre was packed with applauding, foot-stomping enthusiasts. And I was one of them. Hellbent is a great ride, even for people who don't ordinarily go for the horror/thriller genre. It isn't content to simply deliver our expectations of the genre. It surprises us as well. The characters (a group of young gay men celebrating Halloween in West Hollywood)are well-drawn and likable. It serves up plenty of scares, but it also has a sense of humor which keeps the tone light and fun. The guys look great, the soundtrack rocks, the pace never falters, and the climax--lame in so many horror/thrillers--is a real edge-of-your-seat thrill.
