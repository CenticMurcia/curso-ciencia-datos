I feel that this movie is terrible. None of the parts were funny at all to me. Also, if the movie was set in Idaho, then why there is no snow and why the people are wearing summer clothes? People in Idaho do not wear that stuff during Thanksgiving. Since this movie was filmed in Canada, I feel that the movie should have been filmed in January, instead of warm weather season, or they could have change the location of the movie, where people wear summer stuff during Thanksgiving (like Tennessee or Mississippi or Alabama or Texas (to be filmed in Canada, if that's the case)). Also, I feel that the movie should have been made ten years ago with Chevy Chase. I think that it would have been a good movie with Chevy in there.<br /><br />Grade: F
