Well it has the John Woo flair with the explosions and the classic dual Berettas but this mish-mash of a comedy/action really falls flat when it's trying to be silly. It's sort of like some screwed up manifestation of a Tarantino-flick. I don't know. It might have tried to parody hit man movies in general with the cheesy dialogue and out-of-the-blue romances between overly-cliched characters. However, all this really produces is an unfunny bore-inducing dribble that should have been shelved from the start.
