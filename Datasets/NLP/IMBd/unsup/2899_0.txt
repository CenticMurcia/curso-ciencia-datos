Great film.......I laughed, I cried and I've done a lot of thinking and reminiscing since seeing it. <br /><br />I think anyone can relate to this film about coming of age. It brought me back to a time in my life when people would constantly tell me "these are the best times of your life" when actually I thought they were some of the most confusing and difficult times! Yet some of the things we hated as kids we tend to spend our adult life trying to recapture.<br /><br />I recommend this film to anyone.....especially anyone who loved where they came from but couldn't wait to grow up and move on. <br /><br />Go see this film and enjoy!!!
