We had bought the DVD for this disaster of a film for our son on Christmas and we finally got around to watching it. We planned a whole family fun night around this movie thinking it would be the perfect ending to a nice dinner out. Holy cow, were we wrong!!! This has got to be the WORST animated movie to come out in the past 10 years. There was an absolutely horrible script driving the lousy computer generated animation (by the way, computer animated films are becoming very very bad lately) along with the horrible voice over work by these talentless actors. It's funny how whenever there is an animated movie in the works, the studios always seem to find one or two actors who are hot at the time: Ben Stiller and Chris Rock, and one or two actors who are basically begging for work: David Schwimmer and Jada Pinkett. Dreamworks needs to stop delving into the animated world for a while and give the movie going public something to look forward to that is actually worth their time.
