After their high-school graduation, eight friends decide to celebrate in a campground in Lake Nede with booze and sex. They get lost and stop in a bar to ask for directions. One of the boys is seduced by the slut wife of the local sheriff, while the group is chased by two bad elements from their school. Once in the lake, one by one is killed by a murderer, and the survivors guess who might be the criminal.<br /><br />"Adam & Evil" is the perfect cheesy movie: the silly and flawed screenplay seems to be written by a moron, so stupid it is with laughable dialogs and situations; the shameful direction is inexistent; the unknown ham actors and actresses show a total lack of talent at least in this movie. The story has lots of holes and clich√©s, and it is funny to see, for example, the car fully loaded with eight persons, and I guess where all of the camping stuff was transported. When the group finds that there are three dead friends, they split to facilitate the work of the killer. The twist disclosing the criminal is one of the most terrible and ridiculous that I have ever seen. I could spend the whole night writing flaws in this flick, but I believe that this sample is enough to show how bad this film is. My vote is three.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Segredos Mortais" ("Deadly Secrets")
