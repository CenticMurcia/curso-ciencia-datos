I don't want to remember "When You Remember Me," but I'm sure it will be etched into my mind for eternity. I understand that Fred Savage wasn't considered the greatest actor of the 20th century, but holy cow! A little more research and practice wouldn't have hurt.<br /><br />I've heard that people work just as hard on bad movies as they do on good ones, but I wonder if the cast and crew knew they were working on a poorly done rip-off of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest." If everybody realizes they are making something that isn't that good, maybe they don't really work "just as hard."<br /><br />I'm not saying that everyone in the cast was terrible. People such as Kevin Spacey are almost always good and Ellen Burstyn did a great "Nurse Ratched" impression.
