I flicked on the show one Saturday, and I must say, it was horrible. I found my self thinking, "Wow, are these professional actors or bums off the street? The cast was unbelievable, and it was quite obvious who the phantom was. Also, terrible plot. I mean come on people giant balloons causing havoc? Wow. <br /><br />I could not believe that stupid phantom. His laugh was obviously not by the actor, it was the laughter in a can. Really people, is it such a big deal that some guy turned on a fan in a movie? Even a maximum fan wouldn't have that effect.<br /><br />If you're looking for an hour to kill and you enjoy cheesy movies, this is the one for you. Look for bad acting by the whole cast.
