i'm 15 years old-Alright, I was a part of the test screening of "The Last Mimzy" and i thought it was dreadful! The characters seemed very inconsistent. Near the end of the movie, when the Noah character has to gather the spinners he seems to know exactly what hes talking about. then gets confused until reminded by Emma. And the science teachers wife.. My goodness. She just starts going on about how its his DESTINY to do this just because he had seen it all in dream. It sort of fit in the story but i was like "...where did THAT come from"<br /><br />My brother is twelve and he said it was rubbish as well. though he couldn't think of reason why because hes like that..<br /><br />My mother who is 40 didn't understand it and my father (born on the same day and year as my mother) though it was really really weird. And he loves science fiction. Said it reminded him of this book "diamond age" which I'm not sure if it is. <br /><br />I think the points on DNA and how the pollutants are killing our genes and mutating us was quite interesting. it really makes you think.<br /><br />Other than that i found it a wasted evening.
