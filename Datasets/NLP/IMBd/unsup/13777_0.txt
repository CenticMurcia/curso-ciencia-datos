I am viewing: Forbidden Love, now on LOGO- NYC, still NO captions!!! in 2006!!! sorry- but this is my story: <br /><br />When I first saw this ground-breaking film- truly outstanding among the early documentaries- (possibly the first depiction) of: lesbian (hidden) history & culture, I enjoyed it immensely, but I had difficulty understanding any speech in the film, because I am deaf- I rely on captions! It's hard to believe that an up-dated newer (closed caption) version is not now being shown on LOGO! At the same time, as I write, I am amazed how well "Forbidden Love" remains one of the best- if not the best- documentary on: Forbidden Love: The Unashamed Stories of Lesbian Lives.
