What starts out as a predictable film documenting the Miss World Canada pageant, quickly evolves into a dramatic and entertaining film that keeps you riveted to the screen. The final evening where the winner is crowned is one of the most beautiful and compelling moments I've scene in documentary film. Beautifully styled shots and a sparse yet rich sound design leaves you feeling emotionally drained by the end. The way the film cuts from the backstage frenzy to the silence, beauty and calm serenity of the girls on the stage is absolutely breathtaking. Attempting to do a film on a beauty pageant could very easily have been nothing more than fluff, but this is a film that doesn't try to uncover anything more than the raw emotions that happen during the pageant.
