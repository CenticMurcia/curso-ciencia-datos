I am a big Don Juan and Migel fan, I love their renaissance shows and have followed them around to several fairs. They also have great movies. Especially the one with Don Juans Daughter Esmerelda. She is beautiful and very talented. If you have not seen their movies by one, you will enjoy it. I know they just finished making a movie at Sterling Renaissance Faire. A few of my friends are in it. I can not wait to see it on the market so I can buy it. If this last movie is as good as the others then I know it will be worth the money I spend to buy it and I can add it to my collection. If you are a Don Juan and Migel fan then I know you too will enjoy these movies.
