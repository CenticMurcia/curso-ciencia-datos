The first part of Soderbergh's biopic is essentially an old fashioned war movie. We first see Che being introduced to Fidel Castro in Mexico and being invited to join the planned invasion of Cuba. Next we see him and a single companion avoiding Batista's troops in the jungle as Guevara struggles with his asthma. Gradually as the rebels gather support and manpower we see Guevara( no more asthma!) getting more senior positions until he finally leads the attack against the final government stronghold of Santa Clara. This is interspersed with excerpts from an interview Che gives while visiting the the UN after the revolution and from his speech to the UN general assembly. These clips give us a feeling for the political opinions of Guevara.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the film. It is essentially a well made war movie. There is relatively about Che the man. Del Toro was made for the role and all the dialogue being in Spanish definitely adds a feel of authenticity.
