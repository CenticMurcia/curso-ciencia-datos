I have, over the years, seen a great many god-awful flix, in pursuit of guilty pleasures and merriment. Like many reviewers here, I have also been a great fan of Mystery Science Theater 3000, being very grateful that they did the work of scouring film libraries for the dregs of the cinema, so I didn't have to. Like many reviewers, I thought that "Manos, The Hands of Fate" would stand for all time as the worst movie I've ever seen, or would be likely to. But no. Incredibly, this film makes "Manos" look well structured and edited. "Invasion from Inner Earth" has all the shortcomings of Bill Rebane's other, better known films like "Giant Spider Invasion" and "Monster a Go-Go" and more, in spades. And for anyone who is worried about a spoiler being present in my review, you needn't be. There is nothing to spoil. There is no plot. This movie is drunk. It is delirious on a bad acid trip; it is stoned out of its mind. No one watching could possibly make heads or tails out of it; I sure couldn't. The parts that didn't bore me confused the hell out of me. The thing I can't understand (apart from every bit of the film itself) is that anyone, having seen one of Bill Rebane's movies, would have given him money to make any more. But apparently he's done quite a few. In conclusion let me just say directly to Mr. Rebane, "I want back all the brain cells your wretched little epic killed in me." On the other hand, maybe it would be beneficial if as many people as possible saw this train wreck masquerading as cinema. Then a great cry would arise from the land for the resurrection of Mystery Science Theater 3000!
