This is one of the best films ever made. But it is underrated, how come "No mans land" was so successful in the world (it even got an Oscar), and this one is not? It is very realistic and tragic film, with a little dose of humor. But this humor is not funny if you know how it was and still is there.<br /><br />The last lines of Pinki, when there is no more picture, only darkness left, and he dies when he said: "A sve mi se nesto cini, da sam prosao bolje od vas" or in translation: "I still have a weird feeling, that I came through better then you." - one of the best movie endings ever. Except maybe Fight club.
