Throughout the 1970's Denmark had only one TV Channel. We had Rockford, Kojak, Columbo, and McCloud, but no Frank Cannon. Those of us who could watch West German TV, though, had a chance to enjoy the Frank Cannon series, if we could live with the fact that he spoke German. German TV dubbed (and still do)very much anything foreign into German. It was also the time before a VCR would be found in every home. Had it not been for that, I would probably had ignored the language barrier and recorded the shows for keeps. I just loved to watch him cruise around in the Lincoln Mark IV and solve crimes. Is there anyone who can help me with tapes with this series? Kind regards Mogens
