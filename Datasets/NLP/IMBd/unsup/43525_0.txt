when you base characters on prince songs you have a problem. when you throw those characters into a plot that goes nowhere, and you end up with something that is a train-wreck of Uwe Boll proportions. I seriously wanted to find some reason to keep watching, and sadly it starts mucking up the suckiness with boring. the direction, hr mm it feels like the director just REALLY wanted to get to check out a couple of chicks stripping then making out, and somehow even that looks repulsive in this movie I'm sure some high schooler somewhere is having a fit or questioning my sexuality, but REALLY I am serious when I say that this entire movie would have been better as two minutes of music video when the end comes, and I have to note this doesn't happen soon enough by any definition, you're left with absolutely nothing but the fact that you'd just wasted your time and most likely your money hell like the other guy I bought it in a bargain pack, and STILL felt ripped-off.
