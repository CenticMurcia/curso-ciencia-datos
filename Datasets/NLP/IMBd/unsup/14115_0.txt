This movie has always been a favourite of mine for as long as I can remember. I had not seen it on TV for a while, so I decided to buy the video. It was well worth purchasing this movie because I watch it on a regular basis, like once every 6 to 8 months. Everything from the opening credits with the mannequins & psychedelic background, to the storyline and the variety of characters make this a fun movie to watch. My fave part of this movie is the part when Griff & his son take pictures of the girls trying to smile like the Mona Lisa. This is classic '60s movie making at it's finest! If you like movies from the late '60s like "Yours, Mine & Ours" & "The Impossible Years", then you will really appreciate the humour and storyline of this classic '60s romance/comedy.
