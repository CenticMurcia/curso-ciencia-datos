Why do some people call this television series a disgrace to the Looney Tunes? I think this show is great and it is worth watching.<br /><br />Other than that, some comments on this site state that Lola Bunny should not be in the show as she was introduced in the movie 'Space Jam'. Some comments also state that Granny should be younger when the Looney Tunes were toddlers.<br /><br />But in my opinion, we should not think about these issues. Instead, we should consider if the plot and the quality of the show are good or not.<br /><br />Other than that, I feel this show educational and taught young children about caring and sharing.<br /><br />I had watched some episodes of the show. Well, my opinion is this: It was a great and meaningful show. I am willing to use the 30 minutes of my time to watch this show.<br /><br />Such as a good show should not be criticized!<br /><br />My Rating: 70/100
