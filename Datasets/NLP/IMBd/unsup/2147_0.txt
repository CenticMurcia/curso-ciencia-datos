Thisa has to be one of the best of the Corman films that I've ever seen. The plot is a little slow and silly, there appear to be only three sets, and th dialog is campy at best. But the things it has that other Corman films do not have - 1. Not one, but FOUR strong female leads. Corman films tend to have strong females in them, but usually only one at a time(or two at most). And while the girls do spend a bit too much time drooling over the one guy in the film, they're still smart, strong-willed, and(in the case of Beverly Garland's character) vicious, as well. 2. The color's not bad. Most Corman films are in black-and-white, but the thing is even the colorized ones tend to look gray because they're usually so drab and depressing(i.e., Gunslingers). 3. There is no stupid, ridiculous looking monster involved. True, Gunslinger doesn't have one either, but most of the rest of Corman's turds have the dumbest looking monsters ever put on screen in them. Look at It Conquered the World, which still has the worst, stupidest looking monster ever(at least in my estimation, anyway). 4. The plot's not bad, for a Corman flick. I mean it is thin, of course - the entire film is about these women wandering around a swamp while getting drunk, cutting their jeans into shorts, cat fighting, etc. But this is STILL more plot than in normal Corman fare. <br /><br />Swamp Diammonds is brilliant for a movie made by the truly untalented Roger Corman. It's actually almost worth watching - almost.
