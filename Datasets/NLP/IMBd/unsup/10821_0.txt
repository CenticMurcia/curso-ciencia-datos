In Cameron, a group of hunters is attacked by a wild animal, and Charlie Cowley (Christopher Shyer) survives but sees his brother Scott (Andrew Bowen) dying. Seven years later, his teenage nephew Derek Cowley (Trevor Duke) steals the key of his stepfather's cabin in the isolated Fire Road 13 and travels with four classmates and his friend Sam (Kimberly J. Brown) to spend the weekend having a party with booze and sex. However, they are attacked by a Beast that kills his friends in a sadistic way. Sam and Derek survive, and they suspect that his stepfather Mitchell Toblat (Richard Tyson) is a werewolf. When Charlie meets Derek and Sam, they decide to collect evidence to prove that Mitchell is the Beast and kill him, but Mitchell discovers their plot and chases the trio.<br /><br />"Big Bad Wolf" is a surprisingly good werewolf movie, with gore and black humor. The beginning with teenagers going to an isolated cabin and finding a monster is not original, but the sadistic attack of the werewolf, specially the virgin girl, is hilarious. The situation of Sam collecting DNA sample is also funny. The special effects are great for a B-movie and in the end "Big Bad Wolf" is a very entertaining movie and recommended for fans of the genre. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): Not Available
