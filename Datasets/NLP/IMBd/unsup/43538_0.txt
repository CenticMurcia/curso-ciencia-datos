Hey, I have an idea for a movie - let's take Robocop, mix it a bit with Dark Angel, and throw in some SciFi Channel B-movie directing skills. Painkiller Jane was written with every worn out tired Hollywood cliché' available. It's like they opened the cliché book and just went to town. Good looking woman gets infected with some funky biological agent and becomes nearly invincible. Throw in a military conspiracy and a foreign bad-guy and you have a recipe for true disaster. The jerky camera shots and silly jogging through the woods sequence just added to my disgust. I can't believe I spent part of an evening watching this garbage. Please. Somebody. Make it go away.
