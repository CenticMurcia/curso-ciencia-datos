Without a doubt, a very horrible movieÂ…not even a "D" grade. Had an occasional humorous one-liner but not enough to redeem extremely bad acting, bad set design (since this was filmed at a renaissance faire very little of the set was actual quality but simply slapped together), very very very very bad action/music coordination, and lastly extremely bad acting (it was so bad I figured it deserved mention twice).<br /><br />Overall, the individuals that thought this was a good idea and created it should be shaved, shot, and then exterminated with extreme prejudice as crimes against humanity!!! This must be buried in the deepest bowels of the earth, covered by feces, a layer of lead, and then a generous portion of cement.<br /><br />Now I'm going to curl up in the fetal position and cry over my lost humanity.
