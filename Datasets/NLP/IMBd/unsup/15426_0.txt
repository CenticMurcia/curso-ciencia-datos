Those people like myself who think Jennifer Jason Leigh is one of the most exciting film actresses in the world have to see this film. And what a tour de force her performance is! She dominates nearly every frame, in a totally mesmerising study of a vulnerable and neurotic girl. But despite this wonderful job of acting, the film is truly horrible and disgusting. It does have the merit of not showing directly the pornography and sexual perversions which are integral to the story, and that is a merciful release. These are strongly suggested and glimpsed, but no more. That part is subtle. But otherwise, this is a 'weirdo horror flick' with nothing to redeem it other than the fact that Leigh is in it. And this brings us to whether stars should be appearing in things like this just because the acting parts are so meaty. I take the view that Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins should never have made 'Silence of the Lambs', because by doing so they polluted an already disturbed world. Similarly, Leigh should never have made this film, which can only make a lot of weirdos weirder. Can actors and actresses please restrain themselves from making the world a worse place despite the fact that there is a career advantage in it for them? This utterly revolting tale of sexual violence and perversion has no point. We can read about that sort of thing in the newspapers. Why do we need to waste good celluloid on such things? If people want to watch horror movies, then what is wrong with ghosts? Do we really have to have psychotic perverts in so many movies? Aren't there enough of them on the streets? These films should not be made, and actors and actresses should refuse to appear in them.
