hey kids, you ever hide in a closet and watch your grandparents make creepy sex for about an hour and a half? well, thats about what this movie going experience is like. the first 15 min. are repeated again and again, and the victim has downs syndrome........... yuck<br /><br />the acting is awful, the story is retarded, and there is only one good gore gag in the whole film, which they use multiple times. don't waste your time, stop trying to pass this crap off as horror go watch saw, you'll have a much better time and not feel bad about wasting $25 and a hour and a half of your life.....<br /><br />or just go watch the fly, cuz it rules....
