After watching the REAL Crow, if you watch the "The Crow series", you just want to cry... It is freaking ridiculous! Don't watch that!! You'll want to suicide, it is really a bad remake... All the mystery, the dark side of all the story is completely destroyed! That series was a real mistake... Even the special effects in the first movie, filmed 4 years earlier, were better than these ones. Plus, the actors doesn't fit in the story, the casting director is really a clown, or he was doped when he chose the actors. The producer certainly gave the budget of the film to the casting director for buying his dope, or he really doesn't know how to manage a budget..Don't pay for this dumb TV series, don't even borrow them from someone, you'd really want to cry!
