Budget was clearly a problem with this film. For the level of production, direction, and acting, obviously the budget was too great. Otherwise this film couldn't have been made, which would be the desired result.<br /><br />Sorry, but if you simply view the trailer, it's painfully obvious that your local high school play has better actors.<br /><br />I will say that the plot, though well worn, is a good one and ripe for exploitation. Of course, that would require a level of talent missing from this production.<br /><br />I am amazed that the one positive review was, well, a bit more generous than is believable. However, I do agree that they attempted to undertake a grand vision, but they actually bit off more than they could chew.<br /><br />It's commendable to praise such efforts for those brave amateurs striving to become professionals. Unfortunately, these are amateurs POSING as professionals, and that praise is not warranted.
