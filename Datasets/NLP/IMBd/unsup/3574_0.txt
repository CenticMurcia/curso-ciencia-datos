I liked Mimi playing a woman somewhat down on her luck. She wants very much to better herself, but things don't go her way....until she writes her Christmas list. Even then she still has problems: an overbearing boss, a fruitcake mother, a totally anal boyfriend, and a bitchy co-worker. Then she falls in love. One of the better holiday films.
