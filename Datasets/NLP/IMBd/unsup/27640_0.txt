Tom the Cat is having fun with Jerry the mouse in the old West lassoing him up. Until a girl cat comes along and sets Tom's heart on fire. He waists no time in trying to woo her. Of course Jerry doesn't want Tom happy. So he, along with some help from a bull, try to put the kibosh on Tom's chance at love. The hit to miss joke ratio in this one is greatly in favor of the hits. And it's very enjoyable throughout. Of course I'm biased as i pretty much love anything by the cat & mouse duo. This hilarious classic cartoon can be found on disc two of the Spotlight collection DVD of "Tom & Jerry" <br /><br />My grade: A
