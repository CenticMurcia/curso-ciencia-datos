I watched this movie for the 1st time, today, Sep 5, 2006. As an "action movie" addict, I don't know how I missed it before.<br /><br />I knew, before watching, that it was, at best, a B MOVIE. The CAST gave it away!!! Ice-T as a Ex-Navy pilot. Get Real!! Ernie Hudson as the President!! Come on! Ya never know if he's gonna be a good guy(Everthings Jake) or a bad guy.(the Subsitute) William Sadler as a Navy Admiral- He's a BAD GUY IN EVERYTHING!! Andrew Divoff- Ya knew he was a bad guy!! Tommy "tiny" Lister. Ya never know what part he has.<br /><br />John Enos- A SOAP star in a real movie? There are others, but these were enough to tell me what I needed to know. It was going to be a B at best, but, I had to "stick it out" After all, IT"S AN ACTION movie.<br /><br />Tere a a number of "stolen scenes"-taken from other movies(previously sited) It kind of reminded me of some of the "westerns from the 50s/60s". Same scenes of stampedes, posse chases, etc.<br /><br />All in all, it real isn't "that bad", but, bad enough. Contas Mandylor reminded me of both Michael Pare and Michael Dudikoff.
