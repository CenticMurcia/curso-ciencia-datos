I watched this on TV. I was sucked in by the first third which set up a believable situation involving strong motivation for an uncivil act. A man is in need of quick cash, a woman needs to escape an abusive husband and a scheme is hatched for them to achieve both of their goals, not to mention continuing their trysts.<br /><br />However, as the movie goes along it descends into bad acting, a convoluted and unbelievable plot, and an unsatisfying ending. Plot elements are introduced that may be necessary for making this into a feature-length film, but they do not correspond to any believable human behavior. Would you take the time to write documentation for a crime you were about to commit?<br /><br />This has the feel of a low-budget made-for-TV effort.
