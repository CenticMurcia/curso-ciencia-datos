Sody pop and hot rods and teen lingo. This is definitely a movie out of the 50s.<br /><br />No snakes or dinosaurs or alligators, but a giant gila monster snaking on delicious people.<br /><br />Sheriff Jeff (Fred Graham) is at a loss and the town bigwig (Bob Thompson) is on his case. But, there is one teen (Don Sullivan) around that seems to have the knowledge and gumption to do something.<br /><br />For his first two films Ken Curtis ("Gunsmoke") calls on special effects whiz Ray Kellogg (The Green Berets, The Killer Shrews) to direct his own story.<br /><br />Not a bad tale for the time.
