I had no idea what to expect from this film, and by the 10 minute mark it won me over.<br /><br />Tilda Swinton and Amber Tamblyn both gave stellar performances.<br /><br />The script was tight, and the back and forth between the Swinton and Tamblyn was spot-on perfect.<br /><br />Tamblyn's big bathroom scene was gripping and intense - a great use of the absence of sound to really hammer a point home.<br /><br />The cinematography left a little to be desired - the HD format still looks like video at times.<br /><br />I can see why Swinton Exec. Produced this: It was a great vehicle for her and I now have a new found respect for her as an artist.<br /><br />I am looking forward to Brougher's next film - hopefully she will get a wider release this time.<br /><br />The editing of the film was eerily effective - I was never once lost or confused, yet I was constantly being moved around time and space.<br /><br />The ending was very satisfying - I don't need to be spoon fed every little thing.<br /><br />Concise, daring script + great performances = "Stephanie Daley"
