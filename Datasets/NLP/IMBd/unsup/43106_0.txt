I think Death of a President was interesting as it examined a "what might have been scenario" but i think it is disgusting someone would make a film depicting someones death. If Bush had really been assassinated then by all means make a documentary about the causes of the assassination but to make one on a president who is not dead is despicable. I hope this film gets worldwide condemnation as the producer seems to find it exciting if someone dies. I will certainly not be recommending it to anyone. Would the maker have made a film about the assassination of Tony Blair, maybe, about Mahmood Admedinejad? I don't think so, about the pope, i don't think so, about anyone of political or religious importance, i certainly hope not and i hope this film is the last of its kind as it sends out a terrible message to everyone in the free world as the leader of the most powerful nation in the world is shown as being assassinated.
