SPOILERS! BEWARE!!:I saw them in this order: UL1, UL3, UL2. Right after I saw the second one I got confused. The first UL killer is still alive and has just gotten with the UL2 killer. Now that would have made for a movie. But no, they pulled out UB: BLOODY MARY. I didn't like the supernatural twist. It was gay. I just think the movie would have been better if they continued the end of the second one. I would have had the girl from the first one and the girl from the second come back. Then both killers would try to take out their revenge. I just didn't like the fact that they lead us to believe one thing and threw us into something completely different.
