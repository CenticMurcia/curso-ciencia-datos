For me, the best part of this movie was Lauren as the assassin, as her character killed the G-man while she was having sex with him. I loved seeing that while he was dying, that she held him in his arms, showing the right combination of power, sexual excitement, strength, and even a touch of compassion.<br /><br />I seem to love this scene more than any other. No wonder I sort of have a soft, hot spot for Lauren, and this scene gave me a love for the black widow roles in the movies.<br /><br />Thank you, Lauren. You helped establish my first guilty pleasure, as the beautiful killer Kari Von Fursten. You were wonderful.<br /><br />You made your role as Kari Von Fursten, and this scene, very special, very deadly, and very sexy.
