To its credit, White Noise 2 starts in a promising fashion - displaying some genuinely unsettling statistics on screen - ones which when taken out of the context of the movie are enough to make anyone stop and take note. However this good start comes to an abrupt end as soon as our protagonist has his NDE (or near death experience), I challenge you to keep a straight face at this point! Hackneyed, predictable and tied so tightly to generic conventions, White Noise 2 is barely worth the effort, let alone the admission fee.<br /><br />Having seen the first film, I must admit that I didn't harbour much hope of this being a quality sequel. The first film is a decent, if laboured attempt at creating a ring-esquire horror film. Unfortunately, at times, White Noise 2 feels like plagiarism of not only 'The Ring', but also 'The Eye', even worse, it uses elements of both films to create inferior scares. White Noise 2 suffers from the same problem the first instalment. The final sequences of both films jar with what precedes - thus undermining the audiences suspension of disbelief, and in the case of the first film, ruining a perfectly decent set-up.<br /><br />White Noise 2 is a largely unoriginal, by the numbers popcorn muncher. It prefers flashes of grotesque figures accompanied by loud aural jolts as opposed to suspenseful moments. Furthermore, the plot is littered with unexplained happenings. The condition and symptoms with which the protagonist is suffering are never fully diagnosed or explained. The acting is 'allright' and the characters are given enough screen time to develop, yet they can do little to save the film from its script. However, If you want an easy to digest, bland and average horror flick then give White Noise 2 a try - but like myself, expect to walk away disappointed. The film itself isn't terrible, it just has nothing at all to distinguish it from everything else in the genre. Try 'The Ring' or 'The Eye' instead.
