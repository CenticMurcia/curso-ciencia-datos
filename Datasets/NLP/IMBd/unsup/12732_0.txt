I generally refrain from participating in web postings, but in this case, I felt it necessary. Room by Room is uninspired, bland and often insulting. Let me recap what you are likely to see on most any episode you watch (please, don't eat before viewing)...<br /><br />Beige, grey and white for walls, counters, tile, carpet and any place you can put it. Color is a very bad thing when used in paint, wall paper counters and flooring. <br /><br />You will not meet the home owners. I only infer that this is because they are embarrassed.<br /><br />Fake flowers, and more often, greenery. Sheri, the Stepford-Wife host will put it anywhere and everywhere there is an open space.<br /><br />Cheap, home made wood items. Matt, the even worse host (I am not sure he understands where he is), likes to build stuff - lots of stuff, and use cheap wood. Look for wall units, stools, headboards, tables, knick knack holders, and things you'd never dream of building.<br /><br />Furniture at an angle - they seem to put something in every episode at an angle - sometimes it's a couch, sometimes a bed, sometimes just whatever is handy. Sheri tells us that this becomes the center piece.<br /><br />And so it goes. Take that, sprinkle in bad taste, insultingly childish facial expressions and totally unbelievable surprise reactions to what each is doing, and you've got this mess.
