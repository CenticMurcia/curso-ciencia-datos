I loved this movie, it was so cool having a horror star like Bela Lugosi in a comedy like this. It's a little confusing, so i'll some it up. a rich dude is threatened by a serial killer called The Gorilla, so he hires three bumbling detectives (the Ritz Brothers) to serve as body gourds, but all hell breaks loose when the serial killer lets a real Gorilla loose in the house. This movie is sensational, you see a bad rating i say yeah right, a gem like this comes along once in a lifetime. The Ritz Brothers hilarious performances are show stoppers, and Bela Lugosi, couldn't be better. everyone in the world should see this movie. it's in the Horror Classics 50 movie pack, and that give you a horror library of movies for only twenty bucks. I loved this movie, it's the kind of movie i'd watch again and again. Even Lionel Atwell (Inspecter Kroppe in Son Of Frankenstein) is great. One of the best movies of the 30's
