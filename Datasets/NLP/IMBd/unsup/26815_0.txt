I saw this movie after reading about it in a magazine 4 years ago. It seems like a documentary in every way, and I think if I would not have known it was a mockumentary I would have believed it. It has a lot of funny moments.<br /><br />I must admit I am not a fan of Peter Jackson, I really hated The Frighteners and LOTR and Kong was bad in every way but the technical, but this one was quite entertaining and(fortunately) short. It looks as if it would have been a 60 minute documentary and those archive films are very realistic.<br /><br />All in all it is a great mockumentary and I can understand why people got angry.
