As a heterosexual female that is involved in protecting the rights of people, I know how hard it's really been for me to display to the other's that are not gay, the importance of how something that you may feel isn't so important and does not affect you, can really affect other people.<br /><br />This movie has also actually changed how much I value gay marriage! "A right of another human being that should not even be questioned." <br /><br />It should be viewed by everyone who believes marriage should be between a man and a woman, so please drag one person who isn't interested in seeing the movie, to the movie. It can change the attitude of someone lightly stating the gay marriage debate as, "sure, everyone should get equal rights, but I think they marriage should be between a man and a woman." This movie brings the people on the screen beyond only fighting for equality or financial rights, it really brings out true emotions. I was amazed how my friend talked about it for days after and may even accompany me to the next fund raiser event. Make sure to also see Saints and Sinners, directed by Abigail Honor, another great movie, dealing with gay marriage. Thank you directors, Mike Roth and Jay Henning for bringing this film to us and to the pride festivals!
