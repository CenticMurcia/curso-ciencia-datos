Maybe I was too young and dreamy when I watched this movie, but my friends and I could not stop talking about this through high school years. It is unfortunate that Robin Johson did not pursue her career, I did recognize her in Miami Vice (she played a hooker former-hooker or something), though. On the other hand, I did not recognize Trini at all in Paulie. No offense, but I doubt that curly hair Pepsi kid would grow up to look like her.<br /><br />in retrospect, story may have not been that great over all, but sound track is awesome. I spent too long trying to find a used record.<br /><br />The movie magazines I used to read said that Robin Johson was found out by a talent agency when she was going to Brookly Vocational School or something, but it could be wrong like many other stories like how Natalie Portman was spotted at a Pizza place on Long Island.... Does anyone know for sure how Robin was scouted??? I'm too curious, now...
