I totally believe every word in this movie. My own grandparents, who had been brought to the US by their parents, who escaped Russian revolution and Bolshevik rule in 1918, had later on become enamored of the communist propaganda and disillusioned due to the Great Depression, had them selves gone back to the Soviet Russia in 1930! Their fate was somewhat similar to the characters in this movie. Grandfather perished in 1941 in the Red Army, grandmother survived, but soon thereafter got her opened, and became a staunch dissident. She influenced me greatly in stilling a hatred of Russia and Communism. Eventually, out whole family came to the US as refugees from the USSR - in 1979 and 1985. I am so proud and happy that my 3 sons got to be born in the US.<br /><br />Great lesson in this movie.
