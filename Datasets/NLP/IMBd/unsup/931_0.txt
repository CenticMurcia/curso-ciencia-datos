This TV series was simply wonderful, for me it's the best that I've seen of Dennis Potter. I wasn't born at the time that is depicted in the series (the year 1956), but it is all very convincing.<br /><br />Never was boredom funnier than here. Rectal orifices, indeed! Waiting, waiting, waiting for Kim Philby's race forecast. Adhering to silly rituals to make the time pass and feeling that the country goes slowly downhill. Its really a relief the series has Â– under the circumstances - a happy and uplifting ending.<br /><br />There are many great characters in this series, the whole cast excel themselves. Louise Germaine is very sexy and effective as Diana Dors lookalike, a pity she didn't continue her small or big screen career. The most interesting character for me was uncle Fred. I suspect there still are quite a few people like him out there. The whole set up at the house where he lives reminded me very much of 10 Rillington Place. I wouldn't be surprised if Potter created uncle Fred with Reginald Halliday Christie in mind.<br /><br />I can highly recommend this series.
