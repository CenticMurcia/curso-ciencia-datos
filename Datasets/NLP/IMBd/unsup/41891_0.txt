I wish I could vote in the negative number range, but unfortunately, IMDb does not allow that.<br /><br />This is the worst film ever to grace a screen in the history of the world. It had absolutely NO redeeming qualities about it. From its lack of terror AND lack of interesting story, to its horrible camera work. We couldn't even get through it. Like the title says, Blockbuster video gave us a refund on the movie PLUS a free rental because they said 5 other people also complained about it. I guess it's not company policy to take movies off the shelves because sure enough, the next time we went in it was still there.<br /><br />Please save yourself the 20 minutes (that's all you'll be able to get through before turning it off) and DO NOT rent/download/buy this movie.<br /><br />-55/10 is my rating.
