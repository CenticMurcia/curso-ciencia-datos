This show is NOT the marvelous cheese fest of the 1980's movie but a more serious take on the premise. So far it is going well the cast is pretty good except I'm not real keen on Zarkov, he seems too young and is a bit MORE annoying than he should be. But I am please with Flash and Dale they are both have good chemistry and are decent actors.<br /><br />There are some connections they've added using Flash's Father that are new to the premise. And they do have some good bits of humor sprinkled throughout. We'll keep watching it for now...I'd like it if Ming was a bit more of the Merciless Emperor roll than your typical military dictator in a uniform type but the actor is doing well so we shall see.<br /><br />I also hope they will be adding in some of the classic characters like Vultan and Prince Baron. Certainly this show is a huge improvement on much of the drek that is currently on TV so I'll keep watching it as long as they don't mess it up or cancel it.
