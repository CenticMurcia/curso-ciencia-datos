Pleasantly surprised as I tuned in on a Monday mid-morning to see something as refreshingly quirky as this film. Thora Birch really played the part very well, and the movie overall had great character development. Fresh and true look into what really happens to some teens as they try to transition from high school life to the reality that is the "real world". Funny and Unique. 4 stars from me.
