I watched the first episode on On Demand last night and I have to say that I was not impressed at all.<br /><br />First off Jonathan Rhys Meyers was seriously miscast as Henry the 8th. I have seen him do a good job before in other roles so I know that he is not a bad actor, however I just couldn't buy him being the king. Henry the 8th was over six feet tall and had red hair, both of which Meyers is not. Physically he is nothing like the historical persona, so I didn't feel like I was inside the program. I felt like I was watching from the outside and that made it seem very unrealistic.<br /><br />Secondly, there were too many pretty people cast in it. It just seemed too Hollywood and artificial looks wise. If they had cast people who didn't have breast implants then maybe that aspect would have worked.<br /><br />Finally, the script was totally off. The dialogue seemed dead and no amount of good acting could save it.<br /><br />Avoid watching this series, because it really isn't that good. I gave it two stars because I felt generous. If anybody says that it is like Rome they are lying.
