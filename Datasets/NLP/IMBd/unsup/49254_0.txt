I wonder if everyone got together and thought it would be funny to make the worst movie ever. They did it somehow. I should have turned it off, but I kept watching thinking that there has to be something more...there has to be a redeeming quality. I was suspect of anything starring Frank Whaley, but I had read some favorable reviews. I wouldn't wish this movie upon my worst enemy. Please, I beg you, argue with me on this one. I want to know who got something out of this? What type of person was this made for? Maybe it is supposed to show you someone so pathetic you'll have to feel better about your own life. Listening to him complain and his whiny self-indulgence makes me want to take a shower. I know now what it must be like to be a psychiatrist. I had to sit and listen to it and I didn't even get paid.
