Recently most of my friends recommended this sitcom to me strongly. They rarely push a TV show to such high position. So I started to watch it two month ago. Now I have finished all of two seasons. I find it's better than Sex and the City from the same writer. It's more close to real life and reflects there are many factors in our real life except sex. I love Victory Ferd, who has a Asia face and good personality. She love Joe so much not for his money. Especially, when Joe was in bad condition, she proposed to him and never gave him up. That's so lovely and moving. I love this show and look forward to the next season.<br /><br />By the way, I like Joe very much, who is so gentleman and seems to handle everything. Even though, sometimes he is very strong and wanna control the life of Victory.
