Forget the other comments above. This movie is great, especially if you have ever been involved with any musical theatre in your life.<br /><br />This young troop of actors did an outstanding job, and I guarantee that at least four of them will go on to huge careers. Tiffany Taylor, Daniel Letterle especially turned out wonderful performances. <br /><br />It's been playing quite often on WAM and I find myself sitting through it every time it's on. I have yet to get tired of this movie. <br /><br />The musical numbers were fantastic!<br /><br />I get chills watching Tiffany Taylor sing "Here's Where I Stand" near the end of the film. And if you aren't moved by the drag party the campers hold for Michael, you're just dead inside. Dead I say.
