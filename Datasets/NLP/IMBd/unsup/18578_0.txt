This horrific attempted at film making makes Ed Wood look like an Oscar worthy director. I enjoy watching B movies for a good laugh, but this was so horrifically bad that it wasn't even funny. I would rather of had three root canals than be forced to watch this pathetic excuse for a film again. The acting seemed like it was from an old 80's soap. The script was unintelligent and boring. If the Director wanted to be original he did it. It was the most original boring monster movie ever. Sadly originality doesn't make up for the actors, the script, the bad effects, and the stupid plot line. If you have to chose between watching this movie and getting shot remember wounds heal.
