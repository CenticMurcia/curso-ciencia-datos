I found Goal 2 Living the Dream a wonderful sequel to Goal. A lot of people have bagged this film saying its too predictable. Hey its not an Oscar movie but hey do you want them all the time.<br /><br />Goal 2 follows Santiago Munez through the next phase of his soccer career and all the same characters are back. I loved it.<br /><br />The football scenes are awesome you really believe that the players are playing in front of huge crowds and the storyline is very engaging.<br /><br />There is a lot of drama in this movie so its not all football scenes but this to me add to the worth of this film. I enjoyed every minute of it and got goose bumps as it really immerses you in the life of a multi million dollar footballer. I cant wait to see Goal 3
