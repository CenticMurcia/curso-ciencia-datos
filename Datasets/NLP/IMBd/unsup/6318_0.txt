(spoilers)<br /><br />I thought Hot Spot sucked. Until I came upon this movie. I really like most of Jenn's movies, but this one. Besides her nice shapely figure (which was the only draw) this movie was just utterly wasted. It could have been a lot longer. I've never seen such a short film. The movie has about an hour of flab..... The last 20 some minutes is where the crooks come in. Sheesh. It was totally bizarre. Nothing fit right. The acting was okay, but the story was a complete mess. Spy Kids is better than this crap.<br /><br />3/10<br /><br />Quality: 1/10 Entertainment: 4/10 Replayable: 4/10
