I liked 'scandal sheet'(1953) and 'pickup on south street'(1953) so I took a chance on 'baron of arizona'(1950) with vincent price, whom I always enjoy.....based on a true story, this film is about one man's attempt to gain ownership of the whole state of arizona.. using forgery and deception, vincent price plays the evil slouch with great power as usual....the movie begins with his showing up unexpectedly at a stranger's door in a black cape and hat in a driving rain and thunderstorm...from there the tale unfolds with mob psychology playing a key role at the end...I enjoyed this film as much as my other vincent price favorite, 'the web'(1947)..<br /><br />
