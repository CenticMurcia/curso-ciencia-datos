I love movies that push it and show the dark side and psychology in human interaction without sugarcoating it. Precious has some really interesting premises for sure but as the story behind the main character unfolds it just gets more and more until its just too much and feels like a cartoon.<br /><br />We are talking about a grotesquely obese illiterate black teen growing up in the worst conditions. She is pregnant with her second child which she got from her own father who repeatedly raped her. Her mother is abusive, keeps depriving her of self worth and makes her eat. Could be a psychological study but they just keep layering everything until you wonder if this is a joke. Her mother seems to sexually abuse her too, she treats her first child like an animal because the girl has down syndrome. It goes on like that, spices everything up with her father dying and her finding out he was HIV positive right when she is trying to turn her life around with her second child and her learning progressing in a new school. Come on... subtlety is really lost on this movie and honestly I thing a lot of things just don't add up in the behavior of her mother who is depicted like the devil himself until a final breakdown.<br /><br />Precious sure is not a bad movie but if you touch on subjects like this and go about it like you are trying to top of the previous SAW movies with new sick inventions it just hurts the premise. Its a totally average movie and it gets down to this when you see how people her either call it "best of all time" or "worst movie ever".
