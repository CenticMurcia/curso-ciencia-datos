This movie, and every other remakes of french comedies by American directors are just awful (Father's day, Mixed Nuts, Three fugitives...). What makes "La Chèvre" an excellent french movie, is the acting of great actors like Pierre Richard and Gégard Depardieu, and the directing of great directors like "Françis Veber" which are by far more subtle than American acting or directing, especially in comedies. And as you talk about the goal of this movie, they bought an idea that was a big success elsewhere and they popularized it to make the movie accessible to a large audience. The result is a big load of tripe. I guess you have to be french to understand that, because it's just a matter of culture...
