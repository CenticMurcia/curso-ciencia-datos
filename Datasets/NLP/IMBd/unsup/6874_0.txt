This movie was a pleasant surprise. Of course, you have to at least like crosswords to get into the fun, but you don't have to be a fanatic. There's plenty of humor in the mix as well. A blend of documentary on the life and times of New York Times puzzle editor Will Shortz and on the history of the puzzle community and the puzzle itself, it makes for an entertaining hour and a half. Yes, most of these folks are total geeks, and they will make you feel a bit better about yourself. But then, the movie is sure to point out, not all puzzlers are geeks. Evidence? Bill Clinton and Jon Stewart love the Times puzzle. One of the best sequences shows the construction of a Monday Times puzzle. How the pieces fit together, the thinking that fills in the blanks. What kind of minds thrive on this stuff? That's one thing this film is sure to illuminate. So if you want to geek out with the best of them, line up for this one. But make sure you have a puzzle in reserve, because as soon as you leave the theater you'll be ready to try your hand!
