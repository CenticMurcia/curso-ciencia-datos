This is not the worst comic book adaptation as many have said. It is a dull movie with almost no special effects and a story that has no delivery whatsoever. Most of the actors sleepwalk through this film(the Red Skull's daughter for example looks particularly sleepy) and there is hardly any adventure to speak of. Matt Salinger is OK as Captain America but even he can't shake the boredom out of this movie. The only positive is the costume and shield. Too bad Captain America is in costume for so little screen time. The least said about the Captain's modern day girlfriend the better.<br /><br />Don't waste you time on this one. It makes the 1944 Captain America serial look like a masterpiece in comparison.
