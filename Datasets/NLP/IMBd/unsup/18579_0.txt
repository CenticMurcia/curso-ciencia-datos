If you have the terrible misfortune of actually renting this STUPID movie, I feel very sorry for you.<br /><br />If you are thinking of renting it---DON'T! I am here to warn you that this movie is the dumbest piece of garbage anyone has ever made--EVER. From the paper thin acting and storyline to the fake looking "monster", everything about this movie completely SUCKS!<br /><br />The "actors" are just some local people who just woke up one day and said, hey--let's get out the video cam and film an entire movie in one day, sure--it'll sell like hotcakes!!<br /><br />This stupid attempt at a movie makes "Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure" look like a cinematic masterpiece!<br /><br />PLEASE AVOID THIS MOVIE AND KEEP THESE "MOVIE MAKERS" OUT OF BUSINESS-THEY OBVIOUSLY HAVE NO TALENT!
