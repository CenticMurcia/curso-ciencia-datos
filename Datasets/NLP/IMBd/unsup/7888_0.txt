I remember David Denby in the New Yorker going on and on about how great this movie was after Sundance, and I was very curious to see it. I finally saw it a couple weeks ago at the Hamptons Film Festival (It won there, too.) and still find myself thinking about it. I'm so tired of all that gimmicky stuff that passes for indie film, but this is what it's all about -- poignant, funny and so totally worth seeing. It's beautifully written, brilliantly acted, (check out Edie Falco from the Sopranos and Madeline Kahn as a high-strung suburban housewife) gorgeously shot and subtly directed. This is a movie for grownups. Remember acting??!? Remember images? Remember three- dimensional characters? But what's really great is it has all that, but it's not pretentiously "arty," either. It's just a real charmer.
