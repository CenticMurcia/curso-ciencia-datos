I saw this with some friends at the Nantucket Film Festival in June 2004 and we all loved it. This is a romantic comedy that even guys will like. One thing that really struck me is that the script was totally unpredictable without seeming contrived. It also conveyed a feeling of raw realism that was particularly well conveyed by Margeurite Moreau and Brian F. O'Byrne. There are some fairly graphic sex scenes in the second half of the film that contribute to this realism as well that are shocking but not gratuitous.<br /><br />My only regret with this film is that it does not seem to have found a distributor for either a theatrical release or a DVD release. My fingers are still crossed!
