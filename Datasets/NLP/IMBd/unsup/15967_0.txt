even flawed ones and this film works in fulfillment of that. It's plot isn't entirely realistic and feels like a comic book story yet in some strange way it works. This film delivers what most viewers probably want from it..an action anti-hero. <br /><br />Of course there's many problems with what is put forth here such as violence being used to try and solve the problem of violence, the mugger characters getting gunned down always being almost faceless, unknown and evil.<br /><br />Still when the world seems an awful place, when it seems like justice isn't being done in the real world..at least in the movies it seems the heroes can win...and that's where this movie's charm lies..in there somewhere. This film was most likely the inspiration for the comic book character named The Punisher. Having talent like Charles Bronson and Vincent Gardenia certainly didn't hurt the film any either..I found it surprisingly engaging.
