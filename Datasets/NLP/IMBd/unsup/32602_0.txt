Don't waste your money or your time on this movie. What a terrible waste of two hours that I will never get back. This was the worst movie I have ever seen. <br /><br />Who is this stupid director and how the hell did it ever get made with such a bevy of great actresses. The amount of clich√©s and male bravado made me want to puke. It was sloppy, too long, no chemistry between the 2 lovers, I can go on and on. Do yourself a favor, avoid this stinker. The movie came off quite arrogant, almost like a amateur director/writer showing off. <br /><br />Just pathetic.
