I just want to comment on what a burst of comic genius came out of 2004. The Dean Leaner character (shows Director/writer/creator?) went on to have his own talk show called "Man to Man with Dean Leaner" , he plays Moss on the "IT Crowd",played "Dixon Bainbridge" in the Mighty Boosh (Pilot) instead plays now "Saboo".<br /><br />All of these guys (Julian Barratt) as "Padre" who stars as Howard Moon in "Mighty Boosh" now. They all play on one another's projects now.<br /><br />I really hope to find out was it "Darkplace" which all gave them a foot in the door with a network. There has to be some big movies due out from these guys. Because in America we have just given up on film. All my horror films now come from Korea or somewhere west of Hawaii. Thank god the U.K. are still putting out something original.<br /><br />I have a DVD suggestion. If you are living outside of the states check out the DVD of a show called "Sea Lab 2010", "Aqua Teen Hunger Force" just check it out they are as strange and funny.<br /><br />Good night my Rottweiler is being very passive aggressive with me so now I have to go. "Duke not the look, we agreed never the look" , and now he is pretending too ignore me. This is unbearable,if anyone of you has a 135lbs Rottweiler you know how powerful they can be emotionally."OK Iam turning off the computer, and yes I will get you a cookie" Big baby.<br /><br />Over and out, <br /><br />Cheers,<br /><br />M.D. IV<br /><br />PS I was not joking about the dog.
