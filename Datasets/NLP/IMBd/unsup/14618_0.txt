This is one episode that is definitely better on a re-watch. I found the commercial breaks to be distracting during the original airing, causing the entire episode to feel disjointed and off kilter.<br /><br />When I was able to sit down and watch the episode without interruption, I found that it worked much better for me. The plot is heavy on the "Special" kids storyline, as the summary implies, and light on much of anything else. We do find out some new information, though it remains to be seen exactly what will come of it. As a whole the episode is flawed and far from perfect, but still good.<br /><br />Jensen Ackles hits us again with his powerful acting skills, and Jared Padelecki shines as well, despite a few false moments from him in the course of the episode. Katharine Isabelle and Gabriel Tigerman are wonderful in their respective roles.<br /><br />And despite the fact that the promo for this episode gave away one of the most emotional moments, that moment is still moving and wonderfully portrayed. All in all a job well done, but one that desperately needs its second half to feel entirely correct.
