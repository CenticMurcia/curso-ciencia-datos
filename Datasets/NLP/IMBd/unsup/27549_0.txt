OK if no one will defend this show I will. First of all Flash Gordon has been dead for quite some time now, it needed to be brought back and more importantly UPDATED!! Also this is a series you can't really judge after one episode. As much as I love the 1980 movie (just bought the savior of the universe edition) camp does not sell for comic book films(series) so it needs to be on a serious level but still fun The good qualities of this show.... <br /><br />1. The portal- this is good because now Flash and the others can go back and forth between earth and Mongo. And it allows Flash's enemies to come to earth.<br /><br />2. Flash's Father- having Flash be in search of his father gives him more of a reason to stop Ming instead of just deciding to save the world randomly, and it builds the drama.<br /><br />3. Character changes- lets start with Flash Gordon, he seems a lot more like a small town hero than a pro athlete, which was a good change. Also instead of being big and ripped he looks more normal so the odds are a little against him.<br /><br />Next is Dale Arden, when I watched it she struck me as very much a Lois Lane type which I thought was awesome, and having her be engaged to some one else is brilliant.<br /><br />Finally Ming, Max Von Sydow was a phenomenal Ming no one can touch him. Although I disagree with the way Ming looks in the TV series, but having him be more of a dictator and the people of Mongo trust him was a good move on the developers.<br /><br />OK so I gave you my input on the series and it is getting a bad rep already so just watch more than one episode before you bad mouth it. Also sources tell me Sam Jones aka Flash Gordon from the movie is doing a guest spot in the 9th episode which will be awesome.<br /><br />FLASH!!!!!!!!!
