This movie is bad...really bad. At first it starts telling about how we all were doomed cause we ran out of gas. People went crazy and started loot and kill each other cause of the lack of electricity and oil. OK, interesting start, then we follow a group of people, lead by a smart professor. They are hanging out at a abandon hospital trying to create a new life. But suddenly our poor professor is missing and lunatic barbarians with blood stains and huge me lee weapons(all sorts) start showing up everywhere. A newcomer in the group knows about these lunatics and she tell stories about them from back home...they are freakin cannibals! Oh no! They always come at night(they must have night vision!) and only take one each time(if they take two one of the corpses might decay). But then they enter the hospital and start murdering...they don't just kill one anymore apparently. Here i turned off the movie and threw it out in the garbage where it belongs...i vote it 2
