Asia Argento had an introduction to this movie, saying that she hopes people will understand her better or worse. One would hope that there is more to Argento than this movie shows. Her character is flat and, to be honest, really dumb. Anna meets a rock star and after knowing him for, maybe, a few hours, sleeps with him and tells him they made love. Then, she seems surprised when he tries to sneak out in the morning. Basically, that is it. An old man tapping a documentary tries to molest her, a film director tries to rape her, and some random blonde girl gets off on top of her. Then, shock of shocks, the rock star has a wife and doesn't love her. The most honest part of the movie was the introduction, where you can see the longing in her eyes as she asks you to enjoy her movie. It's the only interesting thing in this mess.
