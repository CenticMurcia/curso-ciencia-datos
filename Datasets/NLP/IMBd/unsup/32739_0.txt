It is exactly _that_ bad. No wait, it's worse. The acting is not very good, which is of course to be expected. I wouldn't mind it, were the cast and script more appropriate. Ged as a blond blue-eyed blacksmith must be close to the exact opposite of how he must have looked in the mind of U.LeGuin, but I could live with that. Tenar as a cheery little gel, on the other hand, is just not Tenar. Call her Mindy.<br /><br />As for the adaptation itself it is horrible. I mean that literally : it bestows horror. I really do wonder what was on the mind of whoever wrote the script, to result in this kind of abomination. Whoever it was, please do try to understand the actual book before doing it again (better yet, don't do it ever again). The one with all the words on it, you know.<br /><br />It has won awards and fans all over the world for a reason.
