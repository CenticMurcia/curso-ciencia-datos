Andy Milligan receives a lot of harsh criticism as one of the least talented filmmakers ever. If I had only seen his admittedly lousy horror films, I'd definitely agree. However, after reading "The Ghastly One" (one of the best biographies ever) and seeing this, a sexploitation drama he made, I completely bite my tongue. The man made films on budgets H.G. Lewis would find unthinkable and his misanthropic world view comes through loud and clear. Any Milligan film, even at their worst, makes for a compulsive viewing, especially if you are a bit familiar with the man's background. However, "Fleshpot on 42nd Street" is a legitimately good film, in a really scuzzy kind of way. The acting is good, the characters sympathetic, and it has a really unique vibe.<br /><br />One of the core reasons for the film's success is the central performance from Laura Cannon. Shes sympathetic and comes across as a naive innocent in a depraved world. For someone as notoriously misogynistic as Milligan, its rather odd to see such a likable female character. Harry Reems (who starred in the legendary "Deep Throat" the year before) is also good as the man who offers her an escape from the street life. Milligan's direction is bland, but he makes great use out of location filming. The man's background was in plays and it shows. "Fleshpot on 42nd Street" would've made a great alternative theater production. (8/10)
