I began watching this film on Lifetime on a Sunday afternoon, with the understanding it was your standard 2 hour TV movie. 3 hours later, it became clear it was a tad bit longer. I thought the acting was terrible, the story line less than plausible, and the characters totally unlikeable.<br /><br />The ending was unsatisfying, although unexpected (or was it really?) I can't believe I got caught up in the film.
