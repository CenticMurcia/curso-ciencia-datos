i liked this movie. in it, gwyneth paltrow plays helen, who becomes pregnant and moves in with jackson, played by johnathon schaech, and his mother. everything takes off from there. im not telling what happens, but its a good movie. i give it 6 and a half stars outta ten. if you have the money, go rent it.
