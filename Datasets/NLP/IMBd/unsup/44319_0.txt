Two girls are about to enter some kind of sorority organization (which includes two other girls and their bfs.). First they undergo a little spanking , then they do some push-ups with a cream all over their bras. After 15 mins or so of that i started thinking that the title "Butchered" doesn't really fit in here. After fast-forwarding those scenes, the movie changes its direction a little bit. The third and the last test the girls have to do ,to join the club is to spend the night in an abandoned house. They didn't expect that the club members prepared another surprise for them. And the club members didn't expect a house' owner - a deformed maniac with a butcher's knife to prepare a big and bloody surprise for them all...<br /><br />For its budget, "Butchered" has good special effects (director Joe Castro is a make-up artist) , and some decent gore. Though its not as realistic as for example Olaf Ittenbach's gore in "Premutos" and "Burning Moon" , but pretty solid. The directing is not very good , and is shot with a home camera. The movie is also very dark - bad lights i guess. I don't have to talk about the acting...there is none.<br /><br />Our maniac is a female by the way ! That was sort of a fresh idea. She is deformed, has big ugly teeth and wears white mask. Oh yeah , i almost forgot about the butcher's knife. She turns out to be nearly twice stronger than those two guys from the club. Music is boring , and starts to annoy after 15-20 minutes.<br /><br />Verdict : Boring gore fest. Annoying Music , stupid acting. Even first 15 mins of the movie don't save it. Once again , they've had a good idea , and totally spoiled it.
