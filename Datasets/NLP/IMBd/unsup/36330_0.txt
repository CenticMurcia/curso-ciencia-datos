Since roughly half the voters gave this a 10, I wonder why none of them cared to comment on the film. Question to those 10ers - If this is a 10, what do you give Douglas Fairbanks' "The Iron Mask" or his "The Three Musketeers"? 20's? What gives? <br /><br />To all those not familiar with Silent Films - do NOT let this ranking fool you into believing that this is among the better Silents and lead you into dismissing this Genre! "Sunrise"(1927) has one of the most amazing tracking shot. "Der letzter Mann" aka "The Last Laugh" (1924) is an incisive glimpse into human character as is "Greed" (1924). Remember most of Chaplin's films were silent! <br /><br />Also, I noted that more than half of those commenting (me included) rated this well below the median. Take a peek at the voting breakdown and notice the "bell curve". It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see where 300 "extra" votes went.<br /><br />As a period love story, this may be worth watching. To the 10ers - you should take in "Love Story" (1970).
