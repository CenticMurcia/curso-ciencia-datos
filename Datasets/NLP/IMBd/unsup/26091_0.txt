well well well. i've got the brand new DVD release of this flick last Christmas, i've where thrilled to see that there was a giant white shark on the cover but in the movie it is a small tiger shark...duh. when i started to watch it looked kinda interesting but later on...uh, this is the most boring shark flick ever!. it contains 2 hour of 2 guys hitting of girls, and maybe 3-4 shots of the shark attacks. it was a huge disappointment - this is a warning: if you love shark movies don't watch this one it is more like a soft porn flick more than a horror flick - take on better films like Jaws or even the cult classic The Last Shark. i don't recommend this one. stay away !! 1/10
