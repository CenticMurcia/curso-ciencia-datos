Worst Henry VIII as he looks nothing like him<br /><br />Costumes, excellent,<br /><br />Sets,excellent . Many historical errors.<br /><br />We are "Tudor" fans and would prefer more accuracy over the blatant pornography.<br /><br />I know you do not like criticism, but someone has to face reality in writing We were hoping for a real good historical story with good writing , and accuracy.<br /><br />That whole episode about the sisters of Henry VIII , Margaret & Mary was pitiful
