Another stupid American comedy especially for people who want to waste their time, sitting in a couch and watching crap. The usual plot: small town, widower, son trying to set up his dad with warm-hearted prostitute, bad guys.... happy end!!! Apart from that, there's no plot, no depth, no fun, no characters, no no no... Watching it, simply created me a feeling to smash the TV. I just feel sorry for people who paid to see this bulls**t in cinema. English (legend) Mc Dowell and Harris must have been in terrible need of bucks. :P Griffith is simply awful and jokes are colder than North Pole!<br /><br />*Only for a "special" type of people :P*
