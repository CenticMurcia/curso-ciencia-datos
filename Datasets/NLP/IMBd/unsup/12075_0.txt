There were some aspects of this movie I really enjoyed. The cinematography was excellent, ranging from the clanking steam train couplngs to shimmering desert panoramas, to the moving and simple effects at Wounded Knee. Viggo Mortensen did a good job as the lead Frank Hopkins, bringing his characteristic sincerity to his role. It was nice to see Omar Sharif and his front teeth again. The horse, Hidalgo, almost outdid Viggo. And here we find one of the great catches of the movie. The man-and-animal-sidekick relationship which works really well here.<br /><br />Sadly, I found the script quite wanting. The lines attributed to the Arabs and Bedouins were banal and one-dimensional. Their characters (and the Brits) were stereotyped. I felt that the scriptwriters did well in the US, but foundered in some of their own quicksand in the Middle East. I also found myself scratching my head at historical timings. Was Iraq called Iraq back then? When _was_ then?<br /><br />If you are prepared to ignore the "based on a real..." horse dung, you will enjoy this rollicking adventure, cast much in the same genre as the ripsnorting and politically incorrect cowboy and indian movies of the 50's . To modernise, we move it to 1900's middle east and turn the Indians into Arabs. But what more to expect from Hollywood?<br /><br />Viggo and his horse make a great pair and between them and the cameras, make this film worth seeing.
