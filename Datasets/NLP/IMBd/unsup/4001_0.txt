Has been such a LOOOOOOONG time since I have seen a good Bollywood movie (Bollywood- as opposed to maybe entertaining- but uninspired unBollywood 'Hollywood-inspired' movies) that Saathiya felt like the best Bollywood I have ever seen.<br /><br />But it isn't very far from the best Bollywood movie.<br /><br />The typical vintage Bollywood should have good music, good humor, witty dialogue, and a great, great, great climax.<br /><br />A R Rahman does it again, with great, great, great music.<br /><br />And it probably has the wittiest, most-intelligent dialogue in a Bollywood movie ever.<br /><br />Great, great, great (have I overdone the repeating-adjectives-three-times yet?) comedy.<br /><br />Despite what the promoters have been claiming, the story really isn't original. For God's sake it is based on another Indian (non-Bollywood movie) Many previous movies have dealt with the romances of married couples- although not nearly so effectively.<br /><br />Also it doesn't have the overbearing, mushy-mushy, f*cked up relatives that Bollywood believes all its movies should have. Oh yeah, It also has great, great, great (have I overdone it yet?) acting. Both the protagonists have acted well- and the female protagonist wasn't just placed there to look good. And Hritik, move your shapely yet non-talented ass over. The REAL next big thing is here (although I would like to ask the real next big thing what he is doing with that biker bag slung over his shoulders throughout the movie).<br /><br />Also the movie has real honest-to-goodness characters (which is more than that can be said about some of the over-the-top characters from some of the 'good' Bollywood movies)
