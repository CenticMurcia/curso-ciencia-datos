If the word incredible didn't have such positive connotations, that is the word I would use to describe xXx: State of the Union.<br /><br />How anyone could possibly take enjoyment out of seeing a movie such as this is beyond me.<br /><br />It was like the movie was one giant gaping plot hole. The action scenes themselves were so insipidly logic-defying that I got no enjoyment whatsoever from seeing the beautiful explosions. None at all.<br /><br />While I would like to write this review without spoilers, I could not possible truly explain how bad it was without them.<br /><br />First, the stereotypical stormtrooper-type henchmen. It would be one thing if they merely missed a lot. But no. These guys barely ever even fired at Ice Cube. When they did, be it shells from one of the ugliest-looking tanks I've ever seen or bullets from a handgun at point-blank range, Ice Cube was able to dodge every last one, even when he was in an APC.<br /><br />And how did a four-star general get his hands on a little flying robot-thingy ten generations ahead of the NSA? Are they implying that the NSA uses obsolete technology or something?<br /><br />I guess I should probably address the plot. There's no way that every last one of a four-star general's soldiers could agree to kill the president, let alone without anybody knowing. And of course they couldn't just call the white house and tell them of the plan because they don't know how deep it goes. Well, unless the people higher up actually wanted to kill themselves, it couldn't go any deeper! The dialog was equally horrible. Every last line was a one-liner. From when Ice Cube and that guy on the aircraft carrier exchanged playful banter to when Ice Cube was talking to his girlfriend... I honestly can't describe it. It was really that horrible. And of course the missile from that helicopter went slow enough to give Samuel Jackson ample time to say "Now it's your turn to do the dying".<br /><br />Oh yeah, how could I forget that tank-jacking scene? There is no way that untrained civilians could sneak up behind a tank, jack it up, and open the hatch with a saw.<br /><br />Out of all the crappy, unbelievable action movies of 2005, this takes the cake. I'll see Stealth, I'll see The Transporter 2, but THIS is where I draw the line.<br /><br />In the future, if a movie involves the only hope for America being a small gang of, well, gangsters, against regiments of a general bent on killing the smart, benevolent president, I WILL NOT SEE IT.<br /><br />If you accidentally pick this one up at the video store instead of that good movie next to it, fast-forward to about an hour into it, watch as Ice Cube uses an aircraft carrier's catapault to launch an APC into a tank, and immediately turn off your TV.
