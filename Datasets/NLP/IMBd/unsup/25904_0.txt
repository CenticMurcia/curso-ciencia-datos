10 Items or Less is a wonderful and original, new improv comedy show. The cast all really plays off of each other very well, and the story lines are very creative. I think a series set in a grocery store will make for some very great comedic moments, especially with a cast as funny and talented as this one is. The star, John Lehr, is amazing as Leslie Pool. The writing and directing for this show is also very good. This show is definitely a winner, and one that everyone should see! I would highly recommend this show to anyone out there who loves a great comedy. You will be laughing until your sides hurt! I hope that TBS keeps this show around for a long, long, long time!
