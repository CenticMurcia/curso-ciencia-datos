TITANIC might have had the last laugh making the most money in 1997, but AS GOOD AS IT GETS bowed out with far more Oscars and respect. There are very little faults in this movie. With some crafty editing, flawless acting (even from a dog), and clever direction, AS GOOD AS IT GETS may probably end up being one of the greatest forgotten movies of the nineties.<br /><br />We are introduced to Melvin Udall, a romance novelist with an obsessive compulsive behavior and a rotten attitude. When his next door neighbor, Simon, gets robbed and beaten brutally, his friend Frank assigns Melvin to take care of his dog while he recovers.<br /><br />There is far much more to this movie than the causative incident. Helen Hunt 's role as Carol is just as equally well played as Greg Kinnear and Jack Nicholson 's. The acting is positively great. The screen writing is also just as superior. Some of the lines have had absolute positive effect on some of my friends throughout some troubled times ("what if this is as good as it gets?"). AS GOOD AS IT GETS relates to everybody, especially anyone who has a little Melvin in them. It is something that everyone can smile and laugh at.
