This movie was quite a profound piece of work. It involved a very unique process of film making in which the same screenplay was used to tell two different stories. This process is supposed to invoke in the viewer that the viewer shows sympathy for one character but not for another. When I watched it I consciously knew that it was the same words being spoken but then yet I did not understand why I felt sympathy for one character but not for the other speaking the same words. This is a very good movie to watch in the post 9/11 world in which the way America treats the rest of the world. Quite frankly I believe Americans(I being one of them) do not treat the rest of the world with enough respect and we disregard any of their thoughts. This movie shows the American viewer how a foreigner might see America. This movie totally blew me away. It is dumbfounding.
