I investigated this a possible movie to show to my Latin students about a strong female hero. Unfortunately, it proved completely unsuitable.<br /><br />Disturbing battle violence, a scene of full frontal male nudity, a very graphic and prolonged gang rape scene with thrusting and screaming, and an unnecessary sex scene between Boudica and her lover after battle.<br /><br />I didn't even get to the part where Nero has graphic sexual activity with his mother.<br /><br />No educational value, no entertainment value.<br /><br />Avoid for students at all costs!<br /><br />Even lovers of Alex Kingston will be disappointed.
