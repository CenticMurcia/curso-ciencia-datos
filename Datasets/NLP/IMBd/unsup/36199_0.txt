American Psycho 2 makes the predecessor, American Psycho look like an Academy Award winning film. I hated this movie. Mila Kunis should immediately fire her agent for getting her casted in this piece of trash. I found many of the murders in this "film" hard to believe. William Shatner's appearance didn't help. If Kunis wants a career after "That 70's Show" is off the air, I suggest she be more selective with her film roles.
