One of those films that's worth seeing if for no other reason than it's uniqueness.<br /><br />It's a one-joke movie, but the joke is great and it has legs. As I watched this movie, I kept thinking that it would get repetitive and boring at any minute, but it never did.<br /><br />Shades of "Purple Rose of Cairo" -but with a much better screenplay (sorry,<br /><br />Woody.)<br /><br />The only downfall is that there are too many ostentatious literary references - Shakespeare, Kafka, etc You HAVE read your Kafka, right? -and similarly,<br /><br />there seems to be a lot of homages to the movies from the 20's, but many of<br /><br />them likely don't work if you haven't seen those old movies. <br /><br />still, this is a totally enjoyable flick. i was very surprised, given the premiss. -And Cara Buono is delightful. I doubt any other actrss could have done that role quite as well.
