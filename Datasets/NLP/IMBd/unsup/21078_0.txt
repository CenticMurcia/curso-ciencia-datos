Great drama, bad horror. Although the film is lacking here and there, I still liked it. Addicted to Murder does feature some good acting by Sasha Graham, Laura McLauchlin, and Bernadette Pauley. At times I felt like I was watching a soap opera, which is one of the reasons I liked it. The film doesn't have much blood and guts, which might be a turnoff for alot of horror fans, but one thing that can't be ignored about Addicted to Murder is that it is unique.<br /><br />Love it or hate it, YOU decide!!!!!!!!
