None of this films impact has been lost since I viewed it as a 10 yr old child. Thanks to the member who told us where to get this long lost tv movie. I cried like a baby seeing it for the first time since 1969/70 The price is steep at $54.00 post paid,(VHS)no DVD available. But if you love this film its cheap at the price.<br /><br />Get it and have a good cry....TB.<br /><br />
