EXCELLENT Flick! Adam Brody is amazing! A must see movie! I wasn't sure what to expect, but being a fan his show I wanted to see Adam in this role and I was happy that I did! I give it an "A" and would recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />I can tell you that this is one of the better movies of it's kind that I have see in a very long time. The story line is so well done and I was captivated by it. I like a good dramatic story and I was hoping to be taken back into someone else's world and this movie did just that.<br /><br />It was also great to see Brody give such a different performance. I was more than impressed. Enjoyed it a lot!
