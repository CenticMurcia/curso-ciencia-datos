Last night's episode has me a bit worried that the show has started to jump the shark. I thought the episode missed badly. They could have done so much more with the Private Dancer joke, with each cast member learning the patient's name and having their own fun with it. Kelso could have been a lot funnier. It was stupid that battle lines were drawn politically and Scrubs rarely introduces hot button topics into its shows- that is what makes it timeless and classic. Like Keith and Elliot wouldn't know each other's political orientation after a year together? It was a cheap way to call Hillary Clinton a beetch, and it missed. All in all, a poor episode and I hope they turn it around.
