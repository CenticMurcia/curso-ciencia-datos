A group of teenagers on the road in Texas stop off at the wrong farm and encounter a family gone awry. Once abattoir workers, the decay of the Southern rural economy has left them unemployed, and the direction less father and sons take to using their butchering skills on passing people. One by one, the kids encounter members of the grisly family. <br /><br />I did enjoy this movie and it did make me jump a few times. it was not as gory or bloody as the remake. it still had the same impact as the remake even without the blood and gore.<br /><br />The one thing that really got mad was that guy in the wheelchair is one got to one of most annoying people on this earth, i just could not stand him.<br /><br />I did enjoy the hitchhiker part which was really good but I do prefer the remake scene as it was shocking and Leather Face was really scary in the movie, did make me jump in one scene also there were few creepy moment around dinner table.<br /><br />The remake did have spine -chlling ending but this ending was really good to, as it show how mad you can get after being in such a really bad nightmare.
