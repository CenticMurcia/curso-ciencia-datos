I absolutely love Marmalade Boy and I'm so happy they have finally released it to DVD. My anime collection will just have to make room for this MUST HAVE. The characters are unbelievable. You watch them all from young teenager grow into a young adult and better understand the way they feel about others including their parents, fellow students, and newly acquired siblings. The artwork is gorgeous and there is so much plot you'll never get bored. So much drama in one show it should be classified as a soap-opera. All the characters are lovable. If you do watch this be sure to get a box of tissues. I cried so hard! Miki and Yuu are the main characters but the supporting characters only add to it.
