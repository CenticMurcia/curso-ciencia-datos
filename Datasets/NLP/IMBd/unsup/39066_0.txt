I have a theory about "Chattanooga Choo Choo".<br /><br />This was a made-for-TV movie (look at the cast!) and somehow the cans made their way to movie theaters instead of the network and inadvertently got shown at your local theater. That's the only explanation I can offer for why such a stupid movie got released.<br /><br />Eden's first major release in a decade is certainly nothing Major Nelson would approve of. With speeding trains, laxative, purple clothes, glue in peepholes, stuttering cheerleaders and Joe Namath, there is plenty of goofiness but nothing special. When George Kennedy in his underwear doesn't make you laugh, you know there's something seriously wrong. <br /><br />This "Choo Choo" is just a time-filler between an episode of "Taxi" and your local news.<br /><br />Three stars. No go, Joe.
