I saw this movie when I was in the "game" that was played in the movie. I was with a group of men in a foreign land though, not in England with a group of women. Lord knows I would have preferred the latter. I have not seen this movie since the 70's and would love to acquire a copy of it. What does it take to get a DVD made?
