At first I believed this was a SILENT OF THE LAMBS rip혰off, and not a very bad one, and I even wondered why it wasn't more famous ,or at least somewhat famous. Then I saw why:--because it's too lousy;--because it's so ridiculous;--because it's extravagant in an over혰camped manner. Because that kid is so annoying. These are several causes.<br /><br />It's a HOWCATCHEM, so over혰the혰top and bombastic as to be ridiculous.<br /><br />It plumbs new depths of rubbish. The script is bad and stupid, the kid is annoying.<br /><br />What's ultra disgusting is Scott Glenn's cult actor prestige.
