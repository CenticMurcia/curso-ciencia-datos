I cannot believe people feel the need to write so "passionately" about how much they love this film. How on earth could anyone watch this film and then think it was anything but a steaming pile of low budget crap.<br /><br />200 American is a joke. Firstly, the storyline is nothing new and at times made me want to become bulimic.<br /><br />The actors are unbelievably bad. One of the main characters is supposed to be Australian and his accent is awful - it is not Australian at all and I'm sure many Aussies would be very offended by it. Sean Matic really should take it off his CV.<br /><br />The other actors are hammy at best. They look like they have just come from a local Church amateur dramatics group. Not one of them can make you believe that their character is real.<br /><br />What I also found annoying and a complete waste of my life was the little scenes here and there that were totally irrelevant and added nothing to the plot or character development e.g. the scene with the models.<br /><br />The budget must have been about $2. It looks like someone filmed it with a mobile phone and every now and then you see shadows of the crew. AWFUL! The best scene has to be the "elevator" scene where they're not actually in an elevator at all. When a lift comes to a sudden stop the people inside usually move a little bit.<br /><br />Overall this film is an abomination, I would only advise you watch it to laugh at the lives of these pathetic actors and their lack of skill.
