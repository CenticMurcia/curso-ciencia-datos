I saw this film on a wet day on the Gold Coast in Australia. If it wasn't for the fact that it was pouring down outside and there was absolutely nothing else to do in this tiny town we were stuck in(already had 2 lunches to waste time) we'd have left. Everything about this film is unspeakably bad, the plot, the script, the performances are risible. Whoever thought Alec Baldwin could play leading man in a comic book caper needs their head examining. Just awful!
