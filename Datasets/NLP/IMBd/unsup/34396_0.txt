Another show exploiting children. They pretend that this is to educate people, but sadly what they portray are little people parents who would rather put their kids to work than support them. Matt is constantly using his LP status as an excuse, for drunk driving, for breaking laws for construction, for whining about his alleged miserable childhood, for not having a real job. Jeremy pretends to be about tolerance but spends his myspace time making racist and homophobic comments and taking homophobic pictures. The family trashes poor Jacob because he dares to have feelings, questioning the masculinity of a child. He is also physically abused by his brothers. The "farm" is not that and it's unsafe in many ways. The family cries poverty while adding nearly a million in improvements to the home and taking expensive vacations. They do a gross disservice to LPs everywhere.
