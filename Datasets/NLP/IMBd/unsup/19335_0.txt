A commercial airliner crashes in a remote Amazon jungle. The motley group of survivors find themselves in a strange and dangerous world populated by big deadly spiders, giant scorpions, winged reptiles, killer sentient vines, a lethal native tribe, and a fearsome towering ape. Director/co-writer Leigh Scott relates the absorbing premise at a steady, snappy pace, maintains an admirably serious tone throughout, and stages the thrilling action scenes with a reasonable amount of flair. Moreover, the sturdy cast all deliver solid and spirited performances: Bruce Boxleitner as the huffy, enigmatic Lt. Challenger, Rhett Giles as the stalwart, resourceful John Roxton, Jeff Denton as the likable, sensible Ed Malone, Sarah Lieving as plucky photographer Rita Summerlee, Christina Rosenberg as fidgety, foxy California babe Dana, Chriss Anglin as nasty native tribe leader Olo, Amanda Ward as pretty stewardess Natalie, Boni Yamagisawa as feisty native girl Tianka, and Thomas Downey as the jerky Reggie. Steve Railsback contributes an especially lively turn as the deranged Larry. Steve Parker's crisp cinematography and Ralph Rieckermann's robust, rousing score are both up to speed. Plus there's a decent smidgen of gore, a dab of tasty female nudity, and a welcome absence of both pretense and cheesy oneliners. Granted, the CGI creatures are really tacky and unconvincing, but that criticism aside this flick overall sizes up as one hell of an enjoyable romp.
