I really hated this movie. I mean a lot. Maybe it was due to the fact it had alot of my favorite actors. I mean Anthony Hopkins has been great in a whole slew of movies, from Silence of the Lambs to Amistad. Matthew Broderick was kind of good in War Games, not nearly as bad as he was in this, but then he did the American Godzilla and I pretty much gave up all hope for him. And, most disappointing of all, John Cusack. He has done consistantly funny work. Better off Dead was my favorite movie that would come on Saturday after cartoons as I was growing up. I even like the movies he did after this. Go look at my review of Being John Malkovich. and even pushing tin had that moment with Angelina Jolie,But this movie was horrible.<br /><br />The acting was, as expected great, but the story. Oh lord, the story smelled like year old milk. Was this movie even trying to be funny? Its shown repeatedly on Comedy Central, so I guess it was, but it was more along the lines of a doctor leaving a scaple inside you after an operation and laughing about it while you bleed to death internally. Actually, I think that would be funnier, if done right.<br /><br />I can't even blame the director. I mean he directed the wall for god's sake. though on the other hand he did help adapt this from a novel form. Man, can you imagine how bad the book is? Really this movie is bad only for one reason, the original writer's. When a house collapses on its residents, you look to the builders. They had the materials needed to create a classic and failed masterfully. in summation, this movie is best summed up in the vernacular of a first grader as follows: crap crappity crap crap CRAP. *** out of 10<br /><br />Disclaimer: still not as bad as Hudson Hawk
