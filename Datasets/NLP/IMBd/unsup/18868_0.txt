****possible spoilers****** <br /><br />The movie spends an absurd amount of time establishing a boring and pointless backstory about some Dr Satan nonsense. You'll probably be so bored after awhile you'll be begging for the psycho hick family to start the killing already.<br /><br />The gore is so over the top, it comes across as laughable. The four main characters, a couple of kids lost in the middle of nowhere, are irritating, have no depth whatsoever, and are just there to die. There's really no one to sympathize with or care about, at all. The situations aren't believable, and there's absolutely no suspension of disbelief. For example, you'd have to be retarded to think two cops and a bunch of kids would go missing, and thousands of state police officers and possibly even national guard wouldn't have descended on the place. It's all highly predictable. And the cinematography is lousy ADHD MTV drivel. <br /><br />Something like that fishboy scene might have been disturbing...if the characters were anything more than cardboard cutouts. <br /><br />The villains from the psycho family have such horrendously bad makeup and one liners that they come across as funny more than anything. Their motivations are never established. They pretty much are insane and kill for no reason. Again, more cardboard cutout characters. <br /><br />You'd have to be high on something to think this was a good movie. <br /><br />Rob Zombie wanted to make a tribute to slasher films of 70s, but he contributed nothing to the horror genre himself. I actually found it pretty boring overall. You should never be bored during a horror film.<br /><br />I borrowed this from a friend because I was curious. Sure, I didn't spend any money to see it, but that's still a few hours of my life I will never get back.
