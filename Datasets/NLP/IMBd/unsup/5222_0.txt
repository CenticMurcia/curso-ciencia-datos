One of the most wonderful pieces of animation I have ever laid eyes on! The best attention to detail EVER! The Valkyries do not fly like they're planes on Earth(like in the series). You can see their retro-rockets firing and everything! They've thought of it all, and it adds up to a WONDERFUL experience. If you consider yourself a Macross fan, or even a Sci-Fi fan, you will LOVE this movie! The attention to detail and emotion make this story actually semi-believable, especially compared to the other Anime tripe out on the market today. A+!
