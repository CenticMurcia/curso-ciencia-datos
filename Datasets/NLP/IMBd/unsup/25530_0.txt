Bogey plays a tortured artist(!) who needs to kill every wife once she serves no artistic inspirational purpose to him anymore. It sounds far-fetched and isn't exactly the most credible motive for murder, but I've seen worse. Stanwyck plays his crooked-nosed second wife, who eventually gets bombarded by clues that Bogey's first wife was poisoned and that he has the same in store for her. Stanwyck gets about a zillion clues - enough circumstantial evidence to convict O.J. Simpson in front of a sex-starved black female jury - yet she still has doubts. Ah, love... Eventually common sense prevails and she doesn't drink that forbidding-looking glass of milk that Bogey is so keen on serving his wives. She is saved by her ex-beau in the last minute. We also have here Bogey's daughter from the first marriage; this girl is given dialog that would make a forty year-old woman sound too adult. We are supposed to believe that this girl's coolness regarding all the goings-on, as well as her articulate manners and speech, are a result of her not socializing with other kids! The girl's character is sometimes so over-the-top that it becomes unintentionally comical. Filmed in rather nice black&white. The dialog in the opening scenes is on a dime-novel level.
