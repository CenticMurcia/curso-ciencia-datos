I won't profess to be articulate writing comments about movies (in fact this is my first one on this site), but I found this film wholly unsatisfying and disappointing to watch.<br /><br />The first 20 minutes or so actually promised a lot and I was intrigued. The central protagonist had a peculiar lack of lines and the college girls venomous retort after his first unwanted advance made you wonder who was really the bad guy.<br /><br />However this all started to change in the contrived and unconvincing way in which she was coerced into prostitution. She lost her backbone, she spent more time sobbing and several inexplicable plot holes creep into the story. An unconvincing time distortion (for want of better words) works it's way into the story that I felt took away from the plot instead of adding depth to it. The writer may have been trying to be metaphorical, but in the context of the rest of the film, it was just out of place. And finally, the central characters silence I believe hamstrings the movie, unlike in a Kevin Smith movie where when Silent Bob speaks, actually has something profound to say.<br /><br />By the end of the movie, I could not care for either the girl or the main character and the ending neither seemed appropriate nor inappropriate for them. I simply didn't care for them... let alone despise them.
