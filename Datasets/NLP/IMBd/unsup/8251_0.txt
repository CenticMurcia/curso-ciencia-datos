I want to find out whether the complete 1989 TV series 'The Nutt House' is likely to be released on DVD. If anyone out there knows of any way to get this actioned PLEASE email me (or just go ahead and do it). This was one of the funniest and most under-rated TV series in the whole of the last 20 years. That good! We need to nag whoever to get this DVD. The highly-sexed, crazy housekeeper, Mrs Frick (played so perfectly by the delightful Beverly Leech) who took every opportunity to entice men into her private room. Then there was the untrustworthy hotel lift that, without warning, would stop short of the floor causing everyone to have to jump, or squeeze themselves, out of it to safety...solid gold stuff. The series featured a New York hotel which had fallen on hard times. It was run by the Nutt family and involved short sitcom style programmes about the day to day lives of the staff and (rare) guests in the Nutt House world. The opening credits came up as the viewer was taken on a rickety old wooden roller-coaster ride. For some unknown reason the series was not fully aired to its end. The series was (allegedly) not as well received in the US as it was by the crazy British audience who adored it and were distraught when it ended so abruptly. Many Brits have sought to get the series made available on DVD. As more and more old classic films and series are being released on DVDE nowadays, the huge fan club of The Nutt House sit and wait in trepidation in the hope that this will be included.
