For the 39% of Playboy Magazine subscribers (e.g.--Janet Reno, Gore Vidal, Madeleine Albright) who pay monthly for the articles rather than the pictorials, this Playboy movie will be taken primarily as a cautionary tale about the corruption of the world pharmaceutical industry. The main character Janie (the artificially enhanced Judy Thompson) works in a pharmaceutical lab. Her lover's boss, Prof. Sterling Manville (John Logan), teaches a college sex appreciation course as a front to manufacture and distribute a new hallucinogenic date-rape drug which causes users hump their pillows even if their long-time lovers have just been murdered. Meanwhile, the so-called legal medicine men turn a blind eye while working cheek by jowl with presumed deviant sex slayers. A person could pick up much the same message from the other movie I saw today (Chris Bell's excellent doc BIGGER STRONGER FASTER: THE SIDE EFFECTS OF BEING American), but who do YOU want to see with few or any clothes on: the artificially enhanced Arnold Schwarzenegger, or Ms. Thompson?
