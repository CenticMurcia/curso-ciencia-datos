Amu is definitely one of the best recent Indian films. I can't stop myself admiring the point the way the story has been told. The planning seemed to be very mature. Hats off to Sonali Bose for her outstanding maiden effort with writing, directing and producing such a film that has got voice and certain mark of difference. In short, this is called something doing courageous and different. I still can't believe that it was a director's first film. The last scene where the protagonist character Kajol walks with Kabir on rail lines and a train comes in the scene, was really hard to believe that the train was made stopped and this train scene was out of the script! It was Sonali's distinctive endeavor that made it possible. We are waiting Sonali for more of your such definite challenging works and would like to see your mark in film making. Best of wishes.
