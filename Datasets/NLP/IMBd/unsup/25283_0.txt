I liked the movie because I love the actors in it. I think this movie represents true acting. In the early days of movies they didn't have all those special effects that movies today rely upon. Given the method of filming available at the time, the movie is outstanding. Watching the characters, knowing they are using all the acting skills they have available, makes me feel that many actors today couldn't compare.
