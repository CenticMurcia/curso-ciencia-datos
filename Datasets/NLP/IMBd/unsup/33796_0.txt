I saw this film in the early 1980's as part of a triple feature at the local drive-in (so please if I error on the details, my apologies). At that time it was titled "Night of the Wolf" or "Cry of the Wolf" or some such non-related drivel. It starts with vampire attacks on women in the night (in poor lighting). Then it goes to launching a rocket into space (internal shots only). We wade through long dialogues over what the plot is about (while walking around in a cardboard set). The Ship lands on a planet inhabited by vampire cave-men (all shot in black & white through a red filter). They find, rescue, and flee with the only non-vampire cave-gal (which is never really explained). The crew escape back to Earth without a solution to the problem (luckily the red cloud dissipates freeing Earth till the next time.) The nightmares still linger in my head about this, truly the worst film that I ever saw.
