I saw the movie and I can't say that "7 Seconds" is one of my favorites, but i enjoy the scenes from Bucharest. I was amazed seeing "Palace of the Parliament" the second large building after Pentagon, and other buildings. It's a nice movie on this perspective. Specking about the script, I can't really say it's original or very fascinate, they must to improve a lit a bit the scenes. That's my opinion; I hope you can make an idea about the movie just reading my little article or maybe you will be more interest by some details about the film or the places where they turn. That's my firs comment, but I hope it's quite good.
