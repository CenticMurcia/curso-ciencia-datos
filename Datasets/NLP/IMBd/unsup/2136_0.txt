"The Prince of Egypt" is a surprisingly near perfect movie. The beautifully animated has a great story and storytelling, beautiful songs and a great voice cast.<br /><br />Animated movies has been taken to a new level with this movie. This is one of the very first animated movies made for an adult mainstream audience. Still the movie has some misplaced humor and 'Disney' like characters, to make this movie appealing for children as well but really this is more a movie for adults than for children. The movie has a serious undertone and some powerful moments, with the burning bush and the splitting of the red sea as the ultimate highlights of the movie.<br /><br />The characters in the movie are well developed, which is perhaps also thanks to the impressive voice cast that consists out of; Val Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sandra Bullock, Jeff Goldblum, Danny Glover, Patrick Stewart, Helen Mirren, Steve Martin, Martin Short, Ofra Haza. voices that stood out to me were Val Kilmer, Jeff Goldblum and Patrick Stewart. But it of course is also due to the nicely done character animation and storytelling that the characters work out really well and are highly realistic and humane. The character's movement and interacting is done really good and with eye for detail.<br /><br />Another wonderful about his movie is the music composed by Hans Zimmer and friends and songs and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz. It sounds weird, songs for a serious movie but it works extremely well for the movie and the storytelling and on top of that the songs are all from a very high level of prestige.<br /><br />With this movie DreamWorks showed for the first time that they are a worthy competitor for Disney. <br /><br />The movie and its storytelling are really powerful and impressive and help to make this movie an unforgettable watching experience.<br /><br />It's a great movie for all ages but mainly adults.<br /><br />9/10
