I just finished watching my DVD of The Immortal and it was not that bad. Like with anything Lorenzo Lamas is in.. you have to watch it with a open mind. Its no Renegade, but it was not intended that way. Goodwin and Sara really hold the show together. I have seen the Highlander series, yes Im sure they borrowed the idea, but its different in my opinion. The Pilot was good part 1 and 2 and with Brett Hart in some of the episodes was great... they should have had him in more of them. The flashbacks were great probably the best part of this series. The acting was typical for Lamas, but like I said Goodwin and Sara smoothed things out. I can now see why the show did not last, towards the end the writing was very bad and some of the episodes were long and had too many holes in the plot. I think if this show came out right after Renegade went off the air in 97 it would have gone at least 3 seasons. It had a good start, but with poor writing and a new era (year 2000)it just could not hold a audience no longer.. If you are a Lamas fan , this is a must see for you... The intro is very cool to the show...
