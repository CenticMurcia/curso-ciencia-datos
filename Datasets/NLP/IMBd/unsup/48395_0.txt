oh boy, what a bore! I mean when i go to the movie (which is quite often) and especially within the frame of a fantastic films festival i'll do my best to have a good time, i'll bury my expectations and critic sense as deep as i can. But this movie was really sooooo slow. The director fails to create an atmosphere, despite heavy use of the same gimmicks (tired look of the main character, phone or door bell ringing all the time, water dripping and medications). We did not feel concerned or interested in the story, two gory moments are out of place and seem grotesque rather than horrible, dialogs are flat, the main character is supposed to be some kind of a would-be poet but the lack of interest of his reflexions is only matched by the adolescent prose of his wife in her diary. Even the sexy scene is out of place and make us feel sorry for the actors. And then nothing happens and frankly who cares if he killed his wife or not. I suppose it won't get distributed in Europe anyway...
