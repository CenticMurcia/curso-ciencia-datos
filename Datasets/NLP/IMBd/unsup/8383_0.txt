In this movie joey Garza was very sexy. i watched the movie over and over to see him. thats how hot he is. I especially liked his role in the movie even though he was a train robber and killed nearly everyone he met. i loved his horse. It was a shame he did not like any woman on the movie. I loved his cheesy grin whenever he shot someone or teased his sister. I thought it was cruel how he tried to kill his brother and sister though. But he was the hottest guy on the movie and i loved him and his accent. I know nearly all his lines on the movie cause i have seen it nearly 50 times. He is the best train robber i have ever seen on a movie.
