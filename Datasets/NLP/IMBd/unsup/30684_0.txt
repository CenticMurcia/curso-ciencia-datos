"Wyatt Earp" was where I started to catch on, and the likes of "Waterworld" and "Message in a Bottle" have confirmed it. Kevin Costner considers himself God's gift to women, yet deep down, he has a frightening streak of sexism that affects all his work.<br /><br />I lost track of how many times in "Wyatt Earp" Costner or someone else tells a woman to "shut up." Usually, the men are upset because those stupid, non-blood-relation women are complaining about having to move and/or be shot at all the time.<br /><br />When the women aren't making unreasonable demands like that, they cling to him saying things like "I just want to be close to you." Translation: you don't have to marry me or even treat me well, just allow me to hang around and gaze at you adoringly.<br /><br />Yet "Wyatt Earp" would still be bad without this sexism. It's too long, melodramatic in the extreme.
