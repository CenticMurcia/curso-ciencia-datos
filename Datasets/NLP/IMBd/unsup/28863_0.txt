When 4 men follow a woman into redskin country to help rescue her husband they find trouble within their own ranks as well as having to face a deadly threat from the savages who claimed the land as their own. Only a fair western but it did carry a good finale as the rescuers fought their way across a ruggedly beautiful Mexican landscape.
