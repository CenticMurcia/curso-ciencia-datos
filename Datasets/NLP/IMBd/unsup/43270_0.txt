the original driver is great. this piece of sh*t is well just that a piece of sh*t. it has loads of glitches popup graphics handling of the cars is not as good as the first one it is too sensitive on the second one compared to the original. that is not the worst part of the sequel the worst part is th really annoying slow motion glitch you get when you go around corners or put the foot down when you pull away from a standing position.<br /><br />quite simply this is worse than Alterd Beast for the megadrive if that is possable. i have the first one and will probably have the third one but i will not ever have the second one.<br /><br />it all comes down to poor programming and it was probably a rushed job cos it was not long after that the playstation died and the black box (ps2) was born they would be trying to get it out quick style so as they could get it sold before the enevitable happened. (R.I.P) playstation.<br /><br />my rating for the game 1/10. my rating for the original 9/10.
