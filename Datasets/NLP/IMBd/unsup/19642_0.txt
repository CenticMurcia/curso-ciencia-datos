I give this movie 4 stars out of 10. It was entertaining now and then but overall, it was too slow and not enough plot to make it worth going to the theaters to see it. On the flipside, the ending was too unbelievable and made the whole movie not palatable.<br /><br />The movie is about two retired jewelry thieves (Brosnan and Hayek) who retire to a Caribbean Island. They are pursued by an FBI agent, Harrelson, who try to lure them back into thievery with the prospect of stealing a jewel from a cruise ship. Into this mix is a local gangster who wants Brosnan to steal the diamond for them.<br /><br />Overrall, it was an OK movie. Maybe I was too harsh in giving it a 4 instead of 5. Oh well.
