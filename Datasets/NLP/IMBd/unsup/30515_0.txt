......Eh, well at least at my household anyways. I have always preferred Square's other games than just the obnoxiously repetitive FF series.<br /><br />I would rather deal with a plot that has to do with deep spiritualism, the nature of human and human-like beings, creative magical system (the spell out your mantra system), and plenty of strange and diverse cast of characters with distinct and deep personalities of his or her own; rather than deal with the Teeny-Bopping angst of fitting in, endless cinema and very little gameplay. The only gripe is that even though the create-a-spell system was interesting concept, but the characters had no special abillities of their own. Oh well, at least outside of the gameplay, the characters are likable.<br /><br />I like how Rudra no Hihou balances out different formats as well. As serious as the game was, at least they balance out with humor, GOOD HUMOR!<br /><br />It was also good for it's morals as well. Rudra no Hihou like many classic RPGs of its time did not talk down to gamers nor underestimate their intelligence for that matter. I my honest opinion, this game should be re-relased legally.<br /><br />Now Rudra is dubbed in English online and is ready to play. <br /><br />P.S. I think Riza and Foxy are far cuter and more tolerable than Tifa or Lulu.
