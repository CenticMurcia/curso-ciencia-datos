The film may be well-made at points, but the original material, the book "Vengeance" by Georg Jonas, has been discredited.<br /><br />The POV character, a Mossad agent named Avner, is supposed to represent Jonas' source, Yuval Aviv, but Aviv never worked for Mossad. The idea that the Mossad let its agents hang high and dry is ridiculous and denied by all Israelis involved.<br /><br />The Steven Spielberg film "Munich" -- based on the same discredited book -- is an ideological statement likely to be very anti-Israel. Spielberg appears to have deliberately hired leftist writers known for anti-Israel views.<br /><br />The ultimate point of any alleged historical drama is that it is supposed to provide a useful introduction to the facts. Sometimes historical characters can be condensed, for example, but they shouldn't be created out of whole clothe, nor should the conclusion be fabricated.
