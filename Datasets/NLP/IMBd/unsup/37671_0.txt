Everytime I'd tire of this boring junk and reach for the eject button Dario's daughter would start to peel it off again. So I'd leave it on and give it another ten minutes. I'd reach for the eject button again and off came the clothes. I feel that this film was perfectly timed and for that reason alone I watched the entire thing. I can understand actors (Willem Dafoe/Christopher Walken) accepting a bad role on occasion but the fact that they were involved in the production is beyond belief. The films conclusion couldn't have been more obvious and expected even after being distracted from any possible merit pertaining to script ect by the nudity which in a perverse way made the entire thing worthwhile. I've known a few people in the past who have disfigured themselves with sewing needles and indian ink and more often than not,after inhaling model glue. The dialog in this film worked on two levels... bad and worse. All in all I'd consider this film somewhat of a classic on par with Waterworld.
