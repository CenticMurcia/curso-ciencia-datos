I try to go into dumb yet potentially funny movies like this with an open mind. Usually I can walk out having said, "that wasn't that horrible, 5/10 or 6/10."...and sometimes they turn out to be really worth it. The problem with Balls of Fury is that it just sucks. I went in with friends (most of which do not know movies beyond comedies like this) and an open mind, and all of us agreed that it was, in a simple word, bad.<br /><br />The saving grace is, of course, the man - Christopher Walken. But even his supreme awesomeness could not save this waste of a film. I laughed sometimes but those laughs were forced, and if I had not been with friends, I wouldn't be laughing at all.<br /><br />Not to mention very cliché, as you may have guessed...and sometimes for me clichés can actually be good. In this case they were just annoying.<br /><br />2/10, avoid.
