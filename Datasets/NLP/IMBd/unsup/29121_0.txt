Hav Plenty is immediately engaging and funny. Without the marketing power of a major distributor, and lacking a catchy name (Hav is short for Havolin, and Plenty is the last name of the main character)this film must be recommended through the backyard fence network.<br /><br />The dialog is smart and REAL, and the acting is superb. Lost in a sea of movies, this one is worth the search.
