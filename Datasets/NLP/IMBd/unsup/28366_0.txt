I saw a really well made documentary today Revolution OS. I really knew very little of the Open Source / Free Software history. By the time the film was done I understood it very well. J.T.S. Moore told the story so well. The music that Chris Anderson-Bazzoli composed was well used all through the film. There is a scene about a letter Gates wrote way back around 76 ranting about "free" software. The music and the voice over really sell the scene so well. Moore's cutting between the different people being interviewed is great. He did a good job of starting an idea from one guy and finishing with another or going back and forth. I had no idea how LINUX had come to be; it was fun to see how wide a range of people were involved. I found the film to be engaging and fun.
