Man, I'd really be worried for Maxine Gates if she were still alive with this "desimone_ken" character on the loose (sheesh).<br /><br />Moving on....<br /><br />MUSCLE UP... is a somewhat curious piece for me because it's the only short from the Besser era I can think of that seems to have a decent script behind it. I can only imagine that had this story been done with a 100% Curly or Shemp that it may have been a very good entry in the stooge film library. Unfortunately, Joe Besser is third stooge in this one. Nothing personal against the guy, but his dainty personality just didn't mesh at all with the brashness of Moe and Larry. <br /><br />1.5/10
