Overlong, overblown and overly-annoying. Characters weep and scream at the slightest provocation. Has slight attempt at some visual motifs, which is why it got a 2/10 instead of a 1/10. Performances were mostly grating, perhaps with the exception of Quiyi. Plot turns are explained away by a ridiculous-sounding voiceover, so what we're left with on-screen is just weepy trash. A complete waste of my two hours.
