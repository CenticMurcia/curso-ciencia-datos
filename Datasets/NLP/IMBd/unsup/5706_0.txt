With such a wonderful story or plot, this movie overcomes the bias that one might have for the believability of Robert Taylor as a boxer. You can't help but pull for Tommy McCoy to win. If you like a myriad of emotions within a movie then I would definitely recommend this one. I laughed, choked back a tear and I was on the edge of my seat during the ending. This movie has everything that makes a great movie. It has a wonderful plot, a great lead actor with a great supporting cast, a beautiful actress (Maureen O'Sullivan), good versus evil, suspense and a surprise ending. The Crowd Roars is a gem that I plan on adding to my collection. You don't have to be a sports fan to love this one, but it does help. I can't understand how this movie has gotten lost in roar of the crowd.
