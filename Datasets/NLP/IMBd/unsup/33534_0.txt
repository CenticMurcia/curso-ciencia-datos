The is one of the most boring films I've EVER seen! Its got a good premise and would probably have been mildly entertaining in a shorter format (would have made an okay episode of Urban Gothic) but as it is its just one yawn-some killing after another. Max is one of the most unlikeable characters I've ever encountered (even for a serial killer obviously). The 'twist' is heavily signposted throughout and can be figured out by about fifteen minutes in. Max's speech implying that we the viewers are as bad as him because we have watched the killings didn't really seem relevant when we had been talking through most of them they were so dull.
