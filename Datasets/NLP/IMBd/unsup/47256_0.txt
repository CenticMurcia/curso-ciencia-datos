I can't believe I paid full price to see this trash. With Rebound, the newest sports and children comedy, audiences have every right to be upset. The recipe not only hasn't been changed, it's been left in the oven far too long.<br /><br />That's the big flaw in Rebound -- you know it, all of it. The plot is an updated, lifeless version of Hoosiers, and it proceeds like a "choose your own adventure" story where the answers are given for you. As for the characters, you've seen these people a thousand times before, and as recently as a month ago. Exchange the kids in Kicking & Screaming with the kids in Rebound and you don't know the difference.<br /><br />I don't think anyone buying a ticket for Rebound is expecting the basketball equivalent of Citizen Kane, but the writers, and Lawrence could have shaken things up. There's no sass, plenty of boring characters, and no chance. Stay Away.
