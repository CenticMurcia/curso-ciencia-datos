I watched the trailers for this film, as usual thinking that it'd summarised the film. Predictions, explosions, they find a way through it.<br /><br />I was amazed to discover that the film is dark, it creates a foreboding atmosphere which it carries through the film well.<br /><br />What was not presented via the trailer, or hinted at greatly throughout the start is that the film is science fiction and this is why I feel many people think that Knowing drops 'the ball' because it's not how they expect it to turn out.<br /><br />Religious connotations, influences and science fiction brought together in a crescendo that works well and draws you in.<br /><br />If you were told the details in the trailer; it would've been ruined for you. It makes a refreshing change.
