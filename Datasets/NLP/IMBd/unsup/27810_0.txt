The first of the two Snake Plissken movies (The second is "Escape From L.A.") this is an interesting, but strange view of the future in 1997, which is now, ironically, the past. Manhattan has become a massive prison filled with inmates but no guards and the prisoners run their own lives inside. This is completely unrealistic, but an interesting scenario. The president crashes his plane accidentally into the prison island and is held hostage by "The Duke of New York". Ex-fighter pilot Snake Plissken is sent in to retrieve the President and his important tape, which will be broadcast to Russia and China about politics, which he was carrying. Snake is led on a bizarre trip through Manhattan where he is attacked, battled by gladiators, and bombarded by bricks. The movie is fascinating but downright weird and is definitely a must-see for Sci-Fi fans.
