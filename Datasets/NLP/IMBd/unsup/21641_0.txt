This is just an average John Ford film and he made a lot better movies than this one. This was made in the same year as The Grapes Of Wrath and it's hard to believe this was nominated for best picture. This movie has a great cast that stars John Wayne, Thomas Mitchell, Ward Bond and Barry Fitzgerald. This movie came out one year after Stagecoach, which made Wayne a star but he didn't become a big star until Red River eight years later. This is set in England during World War II and they are on a boat that is about to dock. Their really isn't a plot to the movie and it's just a bunch of little segments. It's just an OK Ford film but he made some better ones then this one.
