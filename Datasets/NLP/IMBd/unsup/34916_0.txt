I agree with many of the other comments here, and understand where they are coming from (I think).<br /><br />BUT - Cop Rock was a TRAIN WRECK. So many good ideas thrown all over the place. There were fantastic moments, some great innovations, and, for my money, one beautiful song (Sandman's Coming)...but COME ONE - <br /><br />The scene in the courtroom where people are throwing glowing money around and legal people are dancing on the bench, dock, etc? It's a moment that only Ed Wood could love.<br /><br />If anyone wants to disagree with me - great - maybe I missed something - it's been a long time since I've seen it. <br /><br />I must say, though, that Cop Rock was one of the biggest disasters in entertainment - well intentioned, well produced, but ultimately a disaster.
