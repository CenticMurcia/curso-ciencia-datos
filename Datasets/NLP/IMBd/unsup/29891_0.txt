For the Supernatural regulars out there, we know how marvelous this show can be. This episode goes ABOVE AND BEYOND any of the great shows we've seen so far!! Far from the comedic atmosphere of Tall Tales and Hollywood Babylon, this episode is much more somber. <br /><br />Jared and Jensen are both brilliant actors, and, especially in Jensen's case, this episode shows just how talented they are. I taped this episode and have watched it four times in the past three days. The insight into the mind and soul of Dean Winchester makes this episode a must-see. It is touching, tragic, inspiring, and simply wonderful. This episode has just become my favorite Supernatural to date. I HIGHLY recommend that long-time fans and newcomers alike see it is at all possible!!!!
