I had never heard of popples or this show when I was a kid. Thinking real hard about it I might have had one of the toys though, not knowing what it was called, but I'm not quite sure. Anyhow after recently watching a few eps I was reminded vaguely of the "care bears" cartoon. But while I really liked the DIC care bears I did not like this at all. Considering that they had the same style of animation, company - American greetings and the same aim - be cute and sell toys. Yet in the absence of a villain or any lessons to be learned for that matter it was nothing but one long bore. The live action prequel was halfway decent but even it was way too cheesy too me.
