Finally i was able to see this film. I have been trying to rent it from Blockbuster for the past few weeks and it has always been out. The manager at the local Blockbuster told me its hardly ever on the shelf, he has wanted it for himself. The martial arts in this film is better than that in huge budget productions. No flying wires or special effects, just real deal martial arts. I found it much easier to get into the story because of the credibility that Jason Yee's martial arts portfolio adds to the mix. What these guys did with their limited resources is incredible, and it works! This film is like a metaphor for what many people go through in their everyday life - just trying to get by when it seems like the whole world is against you- you can sympathize with the Derek Wu character. Jason Yee's homage to Bruce Lee shows that he is serious about his work and has respect for a legend. Jason Yee has what it takes to be a legend himself. I can't wait to see his next film. I really enjoyed this one.
