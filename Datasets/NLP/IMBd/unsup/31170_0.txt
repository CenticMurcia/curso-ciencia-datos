this movie was just violence for the sake of violence! it was boring,with an un original story line! Also.. don't bother trying to eat anything while watching this movie! u would think Hollywood would be getting tired of making movies like this! being a big movie buff myself!!...i can tell you i have seen them all. this one didn't do a thing for me and i have to wonder how it would for anyone. they could have done better if they had just thrown fake blood all over an old house and filmed it! One has to wonder if Hollywood is running out of imagination or just getting lazy! the money for this film would has served better going to a charity! there was nothing impressive with the acting,storyline,or even visual effects for me. So in all this movie gets a poor rating in my book.
