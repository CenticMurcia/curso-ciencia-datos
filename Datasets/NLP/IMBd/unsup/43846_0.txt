I don't know what Christian Slater is doing on a movie like this, his career must be as bad as it gets. The plot is old, simplistic and don't go anywhere so the director had to make this non sense scenes where nothing happens just to waste more of our time. I rented because I had a credit to get a movie free and because Christian Slater was on the cover, so I thought this could be a nice movie, nothing too good but at least a regular movie.I have to say that I'm thankful that I didn't spent money on this. The main character is the most stupid person I've ever seen and sometimes I even cheer for him to be caught. If you haven't seen this movie yet, don't lost 90 minutes of your life with it, I did and I regret it!
