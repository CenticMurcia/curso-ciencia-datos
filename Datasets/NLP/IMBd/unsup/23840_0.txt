Spoilers contained, but only in a general sense, not specific! I watched this movie expecting something about drag queens or someone who could be considered significant in some way, hence the "based on a true story" blurb in the description, yet I can't find any reason why anyone would have made a movie about the primary character. I found him to be unlikable, unsympathetic and not even a good drag queen! This man, if the story is indeed based on fact, was totally lacking in any redeeming characteristics; cruel to his "friends," unattractive physically, a thief, liar, con man, a criminal, violent, talentless and ignorant. Apparently he was notable for winning a costume contest after spending ten years in prison and that warrants a movie about him? The other characters were just sad; Lurita and Taboo. I could not get a clear sense of whether he was lovers with Lurita or Taboo or they coexisted as a "family" unit of unwanted people who found comfort in each other, yet even then the primary character was so cruel to Taboo that it sickened me. OK, I get that this time period, this neighborhood, these people were poor, ignorant and had miserable lives, but what in this movie, this story, was worthy of making a movie about? I sat through this whole movie waiting for something noteworthy to happen, to make me care about these people, to explain why their lives were being portrayed and that moment never came. It was a waste of time and money for me. No point to it at all.
