This is definitely the movie people need to see before they take "Scientology" seriously. This is the future you buy into, folks - a battle between (vaguely African descent) aliens and (mostly white) humans, for an earth that is little more than a wasteland, following a global disaster caused by poor eugenics. Oh, give us a break! The action scenes are just so-so, but everything else about this cheap imitation for a movie is just laughably bad - and that's the only charm in it - it is so bad it is laughable.<br /><br />The primary source of amusement is the (supposed) "dialog" - I especially like the aliens hissing at each other, it's so, well... meaningless.<br /><br />The explosions are cool. The prison scenes are stolen from every prison movie of the 1930s. whatever good is to be found here could be found - better - in the old Star Trek TV show. And John Travolta - ! ha ha ha ha ha! Yes, a laugh riot, if you don't take it seriously.
