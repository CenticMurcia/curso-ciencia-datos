OK I have a secret pleasure: I like Olsen twins movies. Shhhhhh! ;-) It all started when I was on a bus to NYC, they ran Mary Kate & Ashley's School Dance on the TVs. At first I groaned but then to my surprise I found myself getting caught up in it! While I thought that was a fun movie, New York Minute took it to a new level where a 27YO like myself can enjoy it on a more adult level. I think the plot was witty, original and refreshing. And the girls can really rock too! The concert scene was a lotta fun (trying to find MP3 files). People these movies are all about the fun so don't judge! It's nice to see that as the twins get older their movies adopt more of a "tween" edge. I encourage other post-tweenies ;-) to give MK & A a chance. For my money they are better than Lindsay Lohan...and that's coming from a Lindsay Lohan fan!!!
