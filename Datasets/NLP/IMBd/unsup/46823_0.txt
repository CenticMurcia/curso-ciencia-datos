This movie was appalling. I expected a better looking car than the one in it, and where on earth was Hasselhoff? What is a knight rider movie without the star? It's like making return of the Jedi without Luke sky walker or simply having the emperor as the baddie and leaving out Darth Vader - it tears a story apart. It should not have "loosley" followed the original series, it should have followed closely and been a better more advanced version, given the time of its release. Apart from some of the music, (which was slow mundane and boring); nevertheless, the movie seemed more like a mid-eighties film rather than a mid-ninety's production. Shame on whoever directed it - and the ridiculous unnecessary innuendo at the end: Hannah's hologram says to Jake in the car, referring to the virtual world. "Three minutes before you flat line in there" Then Jake Mcqueen (why try and make it better by changing the name? - what the heck happened to Michael Knight?) says "Three minutes... That should be enough!" - what is this soft core erotica or something? Last but not least, the arch villain dies of a heart attack, they don't even finish the fight. His machine pumps blood around the body and attempts to keep him alive long enough to design a heart machine that will make him live forever. He dies by his own devices - I get what the director may have been trying to convey, but could it have been any less dramatic and boring, I don't believe that is possible.
