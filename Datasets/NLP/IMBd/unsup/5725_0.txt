At first glance "I Love to Singa" looks like it will be just another cute and fuzzy animal cartoon. However, it develops into a wonderful parody of Al Jolson. The story centers on a young, jazz-singing owl who was born into a family who is less than thrilled with jazz music. The scene in which the little owl butchers the song his parents want him to sing is hilarious. Whenever his mother isn't listening, he injects part of his song, 'I Love to Singa.' This short is loads of fun, but be warned...you'll have the theme song ringing in your head for days.
