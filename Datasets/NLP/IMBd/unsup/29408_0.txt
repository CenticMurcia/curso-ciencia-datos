This is hilarious. True, I do prefer the earlier episodes, and it wasn't the same without Compo, but that doesn't deter me from putting on the television and relaxing for 45 or so minutes. The men's antics are a tad predictable, but they are still hilarious, like the episode with Compo dressing up as the ice cream man, with a duck-caller. Another priceless gem was when Seymour, Compo and Clegg try and help Howard escape, and their inflatable boat sinks, and all four men end up in the river. But for me, my favourite episode has to be Das(Welly)Boot. And of course, I love any episode with Foggy. The performances are first rate, especially Bill Owen as Compo. I noticed on the laughter track he got the most laughs. But Peter Sallis as Clegg, Brian Wilde as Foggy and Michael Aldridge as Seymour were a delight as well. I mustn't forget Kathy Staff as Nora Batty. The newer episodes are good, but it's not the same without those lovable characters, because Peter Sallis I think is the only one of them still alive, and over the years is subdued to cameo appearances. All in all, a hugely satisfying comedy series, that still looks good after 30+ years thanks to the amazing countryside scenery. 10/10 Bethany Cox
