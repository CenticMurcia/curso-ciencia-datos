The movie could have been executed better even though a novel idea. The movie was a bit of a drag for me because as an Indian I already know the stark contrast between the kind of people who travel to the US. So it maybe an eye-opener for a foreigner but nothing new for me. The ending was the worst. They should have just probably ended with the WTC coming down. Konkana Sen traveling from Boston to LA???? Wow!!! its like 8 hrs by flight!!!! By bus it will be forever!!!! And she never bothers to contact her hubby for the days she was traveling??? WT????? Also direction wise it looked sloppy and un-professional as if I was watching it as part of an amateur film festival. Not expected out of a man of the stature of Mr. Shah.
