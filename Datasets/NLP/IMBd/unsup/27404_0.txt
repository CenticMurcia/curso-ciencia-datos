Yeah - very similar film to Predator, team of army folks trekking through the jungle and encountering alien lifeforms. I loved it, some of the film quality was a bit dubious, looked like someone had been let loose with a videocamera and a couple of army surplus uniforms but the acting was adequate and the story okay. Parts of it I hid behind the sofa from, which is always a good standard to set a horror film by.<br /><br />Filmed in Australia, so it ain't up to Hollywood standards but it doesn't pretend to be, it's just a very watchable film.<br /><br />
