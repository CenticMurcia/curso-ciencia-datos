I watched this movie and was disappointed in the end when Vic was seen as a bad cop and Colleen went off in the sunset with the guy who really is not a good person in all.<br /><br />It should have been that Vic was undercover and he was the one who went off with the girl not the other way around.<br /><br />The ending was not what I expected in this movie especially with Rob Stewart and Hilary Swank.<br /><br />It could have been written better and the ending also should have been different.<br /><br />Rob Stewart has a fan following and I'm sure they were not happy with the role he picked.<br /><br />I know some of his future roles are much better hopefully he gets a lead part again in a TV series.
