I have always been a sucker for classic comedy and this movie is great fun.<br /><br />I understand that the O'Toole character was based on Errol Flynn, even though he had died before this movie supposedly is set. O'Toole is great in the role.<br /><br />I was born in1952, so it is nice to see what fashions, cars and other things looked like in the New York of that era.<br /><br />The King Kayser character has echoes of Sid Caesar when you hear him.<br /><br />This movie is one to watch if you want something to watch on a night when there's nothing else on.<br /><br />George Senda Concord, Ca
