I believe this movie could incite in me the same symptoms veterans of the Vietnam War experience. This movie was so vile, and it is only good now for a good campy laugh. This was my brother's favorite movie, so I was tortured with it until he discovered "Gymkata", and let's not even go there! I can still hear the voice of the Academy Award-caliber actress Monique Gabrielle, in her "if you can call it that" costume, plaintively calling, "Stalker? Stalker?" I seem to remember the lame plot that she was a seer with a "secret" double life she didn't remember. SORTA SPOILER: Whoever thought they could take a porn star and make her a princess MUST have been smoking something! Man, what a dog movie!!!!
