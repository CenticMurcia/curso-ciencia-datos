as usual, being a big hellraiser fan i was looking forward to the next episode; after seeing hellworld, there is only one conclusion: this time the really f... up!!!! i cannot understand how the makers of this movie did their job; the movie is really bad, weak plot, bad cast... pinhead does not deserve to be mistreated that way; the end of a legend? i hope not, but this sequel must be forgotten asap. I have seen a lot of B-horror movies that were much better. the story is really awful!!! according to hellraiser standards this is the worse that has ever been made, and a slap in the face of every pinhead fan. I wonder why Doug Bradley even accepted to play that part after reading the script! a first class shame
