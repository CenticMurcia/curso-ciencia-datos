If you are looking for a funny, touching, insightful, feel-good movie then Ten Inch Hero is for you. It's a story about four young friends and their older, hippie dude boss at a sub shop searching for love and learning to see past outer appearances and let go of preconceived notions.<br /><br />It's a deceptively simple movie. After all, we all learned in grade school not to judge a book by its cover, but maybe the simplest lessons need to be revisited every once in a while. Who among us can say we've never assumed something about a person from their outer appearance? Who hasn't felt like they didn't belong in a certain group or situation because they didn't fit the profile? <br /><br />It's no wonder many of Hollywood's young actors wanted roles in this movie. Hollywood can be one of the more superficial zip codes on the planet. A handsome actor gets a role because he is handsome, but is another role denied him because he is too good looking? Good looks are a two sided sword; they may get you in the door, but will your talent be recognized? Will you be relegated to the hunky hero roles or will you be allowed to create unique characters? <br /><br />That brings us to Priestly. Ah yes, Priestly! Priestly is unique, riotously funny, individualistic, sweet, witty and charismatic. Priestly rocks! He grabs the audience from his dynamic entrance and never lets go. He immediately starts spouting his sage opinions with witty humor and biting sarcasm and the audience is putty in his hands. Considering his look, with piercings, tattoos and multi-colored Mohawks, it must be the writing and Jensen Ackles' acting that sells this character. It certainly can't be Ackles' leading man looks; especially since most of the audience had no clue who he was.<br /><br />Halleluiah! Maybe now the PTB will recognize what a gifted and talented actor Ackles is. Jensen Ackles always puts underlying subtext in his roles. He is a very subtle actor who becomes his characters and Priestly is no exception. His fans appreciate him most from his portrayals of Alec on Dark Angel and his current role as Dean Winchester on the CW's Supernatural. He has the ability to take a seemingly straight forward character and find the depth in them and expose their fears and inner workings with a stark realism that blows you away.<br /><br />Priestly is a nice change of pace because he is allowed to embrace his comedic talent while portraying his most normal and well-adjusted character yet, despite the character's outward appearance. He takes a character most of the audience would avoid in real life and makes them care! Most of the audience would invite Priestly over to Sunday dinner by the end of the film. They loved him that much. It is refreshing to see a character whose looks appear so outside the norm be so content and happy.<br /><br />While Ackles may be the obvious standout, the entire cast is superb. This is an ensemble piece with every actor bringing a fresh outlook to their character and making us care about them. We laugh with them, we cry with them and, in the end we rejoice with them. You believe in this sandwich shop and the diverse people that inhabit it and you become involved in their lives.<br /><br />If you have ever attempted love or been to High School and lived within the confines of cliques, you can enjoy and empathize with these characters. The concept of outer appearances is examined in several different manners with every character discovering something new about themselves and the world around them. We all know not to judge others by looks, but how many of us realize our view of ourselves may not mesh with how the world perceives us? We may hold ourselves back just as much as we confine others.<br /><br />Ten Inch Hero is downright entertaining. First and foremost it is funny. Priestly is the comedic voice and the tampon scene will go down as a classic. The movie is beautifully photographed with peaceful scenes of the beach interspersed with the lives of the friends. The director, David Mackay, keeps the movie flowing at a comfortable pace, shifting back and forth between the characters' stories, but always holding your attention. There is no clock watching or restlessness, just an engrossing, satisfying movie.<br /><br />The script by first time screenwriter Betsy Morris is refreshingly realistic; it is not overly dramatic or contrived. Everything does not turn out as expected and there are three or four nice twists to offer a few surprises.<br /><br />Yes, it has a happy ending although everything does not turn out perfect. Living in these times with war and fear rampant, maybe we need a pleasant respite from daily life. Isn't that what the movies are supposed to do? Take us away from our lives? The funny thing about this movie is it stays with you. Once you are reminded of that grade school lesson, you start viewing the stranger you pass on the street a little differently. You look in the mirror and wonder if you are fulfilling your potential or if you are just staying in the preconceived box? <br /><br />This is a movie you will enjoy. I liked these characters and would love to hang out with them. I can't think of a better recommendation then that. If you get the chance, go see it. And if you are one of the PTB, get this movie into theaters and don't assume the target audience is under the age of thirty. All ages can feel a connection to these characters and everyone enjoys a great comedy. This movie delivers in all areas. If given the chance, with the young, talented cast of up and comers this could be a sleeper hit. It just needs a little help getting noticed. Once you get them in the theater, they'll leave happy.
