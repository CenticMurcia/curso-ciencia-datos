Being a huge fan of M Night's previous films such as Sixth Sense, Signs and the Village, (unbreakable was god awful), i was very excited for my viewing of this film. I hate saying it, but this movie was really terrible. It was written terribly, the characters were extremely unreal, it was shot very poorly and the acting was terrible. There was no plot progression, and Bryce Dallas Howard plays EXACTLY the same person she did in the village, except being blind she was wet and nymph-y. The screenplay was just pathetic at times ("This is the scene were the character gets killed off by the monster...etc.) awful. I wish the toilet paper in the restrooms had ads on it for this film, because metaphorically and literally, this movie deserves to be kissing my ass.
