Extremely well directed film with superb performances by the three lead women that fails miserably. The film has no dramatic tension due to a lackluster male lead that generates no interest: He is neither intellectual enough nor sexy enough. He projects no angst or even a healthy dash of true grit for the role he is required to play (young Antonio Banderas sorely missed here). It is difficult to see why three stunning women with great personalities are/were involved with him. The middle lags considerably, in particular the relationship between Lucia and Lorenzo that marches straight to a dead end, going nowhere other than circles. Towards the grand finale, a clever plot carries the day as the three stories converge. Sex is gorgeously photographed but plain, perhaps too caste in feeling, in fact most of it is boring, possibly because of the lack in dramatic tension (very far from the heat accomplished by masters like Nicholas Roeg). The ending is perhaps one of the most thoroughly disappointing ones in Spanish cinema, a complete cop-out, turning a could-be classic mood piece into cheap melodrama that can be forgotten in a few hours. Wait for the video release if you must see it.<br /><br />
