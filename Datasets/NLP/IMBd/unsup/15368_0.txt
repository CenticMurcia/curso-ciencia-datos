well i live in the the area that parts of this show was filmed and i have seen how the drug world works....For some reason people think that this is bad.... wel the styriotypeing is not ,wel to me, styriotyping.... if seen people deal drugs and i have seen how thing go when something goes wrong..... and if some people that are hispanic and take offence with it then don't watch it. i don't see any itallien people getting upset because they are being steriotyped by the sopranos... i thought that this show was very accurate, but a little to graphic. but you know life is a little to graphic. you will see things in life that you wish you could have never scene.... but hey thats life.... but i hope that this shows comes back for another sesion...if thier are any mistakes then sorry but im only 17 and suck at spelling.
