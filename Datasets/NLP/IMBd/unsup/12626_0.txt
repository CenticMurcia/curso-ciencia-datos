This was like a train wreck in that I felt compelled to watch it to the end... That being said your best bet is to not even start. The movie made very little sense even after the explanation which was at the very end. The gore part was not. The horror part was not and I could go on. The only positive thing I might say is that the actress Sophia Dawny did a pretty good job and was convincing as a woman who was terrified yet started to grow strength as the movie progressed. The woman supposedly had their memories wiped but she had flash backs but they were confusing. They could have handled them the flash backs in a different way although not sure what. There were so many unanswered questions that my head spun.Don't waste your money buying it or your time if it ever comes onto TV.
