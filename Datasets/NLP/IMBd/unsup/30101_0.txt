When 24 first premiered, I was quite skeptical that it would last an entire season, let alone 6. I saw the first few episodes and didn't think much of it. I stopped watching it because Tuesday nights became bad for me, but later on in the season I saw the episode when Bauer and Palmer finally met. From then on I finished out the season and was amazed. I bought the first season DVD over the summer and watched it all. After I finished, I could hardly wait for the next season. The first half of the season was solid, but then the second half got predictable. Nonetheless, I was still on the edge of my seat and by the end of the year I was left wanting more. Even though the fourth season was the worst, I was and remain convinced that a bad season of 24 is still better than a good season of any other show. Originally I was simply amazed by the constant cliffhangers that are drawn up week after week by the amazing writing crew. I'm now hooked on the soundtrack by Sean Callery and the performances by the characters, most notably Kiefer Sutherland as the great Jack Bauer. I was particularly impressed with his acting this season. Season 6 was the most emotionally traumatic season for Jack Bauer and Kiefer's acting was more than top notch! I don't understand how this last finale only has a 5.8. This finale was pure 24. The action sequences as well as the intensity of the acting by Kiefer in the last 12 minutes left me on the edge of my seat, more than ever! This show is the best on television because the writing is impeccable as well as the acting and the music. The character's performances among these other elements make this seem like more than a TV show or a movie for that matter. I'm impatiently waiting for the next season because this show is truly one in a million. No...one in 24 million!
