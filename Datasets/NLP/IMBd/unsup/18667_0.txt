What a surprising gem! This movie could have been a mainstream hit, but the 'historical theatrical' flavour probably made it difficult to sell to the mass market. Shame, because it's just great!! <br /><br />It's a very unique production, and entertaining on so many levels: The storyline is quirky and edifying, the characters are rich and humorous, the cinematography/set/costuming have life and colour, and both Billy Crudup and Claire Danes put in high quality performances. <br /><br />Crudup, in particular, has an extremely challenging role - two characters in one - and handles it most impressively. I was also struck by how Danes is developing into a fine young actress; she sweeps the audience right into her emotional world. And those scenes between the two of them...well!!..(jealous anyone?)...is it any wonder that they ended up together in real life after rehearsals and several takes of that?! (Watch it and you'll see what I mean!) <br /><br />All of the above, of course, is also a strong reflection of the obviously considerable skills of the director.<br /><br />In my video store this movie is listed under 'chick flicks'! Yes, the romance is firey and Crudup is primally appealing as the handsome feminine-masculine lead, but it's so much more. The climactic ending left me very energised and uplifted ... so I did what many seem to have done - played it again!
