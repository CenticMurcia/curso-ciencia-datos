After about 10 minutes you get tired of hearing about James Dean, and I like that line Richard Thomas said to his mother "I'm really upset right now momma someone I know died last night" His Mother: You don't mean that movie star Jimmy whats his name?" This is just another film trying to be like American Graffiti or Rebel Without a Cause, where the film examines rebellious youth characters and their UN-interested parents. In the film Richard Thomas also states that he and James Dean were a lot alike and some of the lines make you want to laugh.<br /><br />I enjoyed James Deans three films and other performances, but I make it a point to not get personally involved when actors die.<br /><br />From 1961 through 2006 I can't say that I personally was overcome by the death of non family members and certainly not actors or actresses, especially since a majority of them suffer through the excesses of drug and alcohol abuse This film is mostly a curiosity for all the up and coming stars (*1/2 Out Of ****)
