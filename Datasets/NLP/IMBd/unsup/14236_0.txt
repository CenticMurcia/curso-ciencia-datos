This movie surprised me in every way a movie can.<br /><br />First: I can't believe Russians made such an awesome movie (i surely can call it a Masterpiece). I would never expect something like that from Russian directors.<br /><br />Second: acting was perfect. Yegor Beroyev was the best Erast Fandorin of all Erast Fandorin's there ever were ("Statskii sovetnik",..).<br /><br />Third: the plot. Film is based on a Russian - Turkish war, and that war is not based on strength and power of two armies, it is also based on smart tricks, (like assassinating the general by pretending that Turks are giving up). Directors show that very well (a lot of movies based on wars are all about power, greatness etc. etc., that's not really true.<br /><br />Fourth: special effects. When i first heard that this film is similar to "Nocnoj dozor" i was disappointed (when i finished watching "Nocnoj dozor" i was really very mad, because i didn't like it), but when i watched "Tureckii gambit" i understood that only thing similar in these two films is special effects (sure special effect were nice in "Nocnoj dozor" but surely not the plot").<br /><br />So this is it. This movie will surely go in into my list of all time favorites. And i strongly recommend you to watch this movie.
