If you are a fan of Zombie-movies, this one will disappoint you: This is a movie without any good ideas, there are no thrills and shock-effects. The make-up is lousy, too and there was no money for special effects. The whole thing looks like a bad joke, a home video from a few crazy kids.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the actors who appear here you will be disappointed, too because their appearances are much too short.<br /><br />Zombiegeddon is a bad movie: very boring, no story, no, absolutely no action and a real waste of a few good B-movie-legends: Scream-Queen Brinke Stevens, she was about 50 when she made this one - real beauty never fades -, has a few good moments, Tom Savini, the legendary Sex-Machine in Tarantino/Rodriguez "From Dusk Till Dawn", is wasted here, too. His scene is not worth to mention and he isn't as cool here as we remember him from other movies.<br /><br />"Maniac Cop" Robert Z'Dar appears almost at the end of the movie and he hasn't much to do in here. Julie Strain appeared also in the credits and you wait for her appearance than you recognize disappointed that they only dubbed her voice as one of the callers.<br /><br />Conrad Brooks, the young Cop from Ed Woods "Plan 9 from outer Space", appears also here but why??? A few famous B-movie legends can't even save this garbage.<br /><br />Joe Estevez seems to be the only actor who really enjoyed his work. His appearances are really funny. William Smith as Lord Zombie in his terrible costume with his terrible helmet looks like he would say: Oh my God, what am I doing here? When will I ever get a part in a real movie? Most of the scenes look like they were shot in 1 or 2 hours. Another funny thing is that the makers talk in the Making-Of about Kung-fu fighting Zombies, but what they are doing is Kickboxing. Hey, Guys, wake up! There is a difference between Kung-Fu and Kickboxing.<br /><br />This DVD includes also one of the worst and most boring Making-Ofs I've ever seen. It looks like even the guys who mad this movie were completely desinterrested in their "work".<br /><br />All in all: Zombiegeddon is a waste of time and a waste of money!
