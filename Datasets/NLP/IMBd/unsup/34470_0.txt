Oh man...talk about a stinker of an awful atrocity of an excuse for entertainment. You know, this movie epitomizes everything that is wrong in the movie industry today -- just stick together a bunch of good looking big name celebrities with tons of web sites devoted to them together with a hip soundtrack and see what they can pull off. This entire story seems like it was written by a fifteen year old. Worse yet, a moronic fifteen year old. Honestly. And all there is to blame for this absolute mess of a terrible film is MTV. It seems to me that the only people this movie would appeal to are those absolutely void of any semblance of a brain, because this movie is kind of like a slow-growing fungus. It starts off seemingly harmless, a bit annoying, but tolerable. But it keeps growing and growing and there is never any hope in sight except to mercifully kill it or yourself.<br /><br />In the movie's feeble defense, all of the performances are very good, particularly Christina Ricci (good as always, I suppose) and the girl from wings. But nobody can save this junker. Save yourself two hours and seven bucks and just go stare at a wall for two hours. At least your mind will wander and your brain will be somewhat stimulated.
