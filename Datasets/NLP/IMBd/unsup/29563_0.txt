BLUE SUNSHINE is one of those films that I've been meaning to get to for a while and just never got around to. Well, having now seen it, I can say that I'm pretty glad I did. It's a pretty cool (but strange) film that even with the poor acting was still entertaining.<br /><br />A bunch of Stanford University students ate a batch of bad acid and 10 years later are like freakin'-out, man....They start losing their hair and gain super-human strength and go all psycho on anyone around them. Jerry Zipkin is on the run from the fuzz after one of his main-men freaks out and kills a couple of chicks at a swingin' party, and Zipkin is inadvertently thought to be the bad-guy. Rather than turn himself in, Zipkin decides to investigate the matter on his own, which all ties in with this batch of bad "Blue Sunshine" doses, those that ate 'em, and a local politician who had somethin' to do with it too...it's just all way too far out and groovy, man....<br /><br />...But seriously - BLUE SUNSHINE is a pretty cool slice of 70's weirdo cinema. Some of the scenes with the bald head freaks are actually kinda creepy, and in some cases just flat out comical. Not a great film by any stretch, but worth at least a one time view to the "cult" fans out there...The Synapse disc also has a short-film called THE RINGER that is another strange bit of 70's weirdness that deals with consumerism, drugs, music, the naivet√© of youth, and "THE MAN" - and is pretty interesting too. Give this a look too. 7/10 for BLUE SUNSHINE
