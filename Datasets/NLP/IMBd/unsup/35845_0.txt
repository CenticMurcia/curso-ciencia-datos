This film is exploitive and really raunchy at times. Many of the story lines don't make sense and the characters act in unbelievable ways. It really is bad storytelling at a low budget - the worst of both worlds. I suppose a couple of moments work in the film, but I am guessing that is by accident when compared to so much else that didn't work.<br /><br />On a good note, the cinematography was decent. The city looks awful which, I guess, is what the makers were going for with this film. Yes, Detroit is a tough town with its share of problems, but do we need a Detroit cast to get together to make the city look even worse? (thanks guys).<br /><br />The exploitive scenes of drug use, rape, and prostitution don't help much. Just more nudity and sexual situations added in for kicks - which will only appeal to those with the most puerile of interests.<br /><br />I could give a litany of problems with this film, but heed my warning and stay away.
