I watched this movie on TCM yesterday for the first time. I have seen other movies starring Edward G. Robinson and have always liked his work. Without Robinson this movie would flop. Yes, Burt Lancaster stars in it too but he does not add much. Others could have played the role of the son and in fact Lancaster seems miscast as Robinson's son. <br /><br />When watching a new release I don't have the luxury to weed out the biases one acquires from watching something filmed in one's own date and time. One distinctive mark of a good movie is how it appeals over time. This movie was made more than 60 years ago yet it transcends time. The styles and fashions of the 1940s fail to get in the way of the story which seems just as real today as it was back then. This is the hallmark of a great movie.<br /><br />Edward G. Robinson plays his role perfectly. One would think that the character and actor are one in the same but this was not the case. Robinson's character lives in classic denial. He is convinced of his lie. When confronted by Lancaster you can see the pain in Robinson's eyes. I enjoyed this movie and the wonderful performance by Edward G. Robinson. It's a joy to unearth such a treasure as this movie turned out to be. <br /><br />Also fun was watching a young Arlene Francis and Henry Morgan. They strike me as such nice people. I enjoy watching old clips of "What's my Line." Also, growing up I always liked the comforting presence of Henry Morgan who is still alive today!
