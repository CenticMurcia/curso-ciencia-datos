Where is the guy who directed Trading Places or (to a lesser degree) Spies Like Us? You failed me here pal! First things first, Sly Stallone is NOT funny. Not even close. (see Stop or my Mom Will Shoot! Actually, don't see that.) He never even said anything witty when he killed people in his action movies. Well, not like Arnie! He would toss a guy off in front of a subway and say "Get on the right track" OK, with that out of the way, this movie also is not funny. You would have to be from Bulgaria to think was funny. Its like a VERY BAD Three's Company episode. I'm talking late Three's Company when Jack worked for that guy with the beard. So many misunderstandings! Marisa Tomeii is terrible, Sly is unwatchable, the funniest people in this movie have the least screen time. Poor Harry Shearer.... OK It might be easier to tell you what is GOOD about this movie: Red Forman plays a cop. That is all.
