There really is not a whole lot to say about Bring it On. My thoughts can be summed up quite quickly: lame and predictable. Bring it On is supposedly a comedy, but I simply did not find it very amusing. The only scene I found the least bit amusing was the try-out scene. I will not tell you how the movie ends, but it is extremely predictable. I have seen episodes of The Brady Bunch with more plot twists than this movie. I only recommend Bring it On if you are either a high school cheerleader or have some time to kill.
