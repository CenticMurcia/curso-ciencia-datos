Lots of people say that this show is getting really old. I have to disagree. I just love the concept of the show. Vote people out until there's only one person standing. I love it! I want to go on it, but I don't think it'll be around anymore by the time I turn 21. Still, it's a great show. Great competition, likable people (most of the time), and a 1 million dollar prize. This last season (Fiji) was really boring, but I know the show can still stay fresh. It's always really fun to watch, and I always get upset if I miss an episode.<br /><br />Two of the best things that ever happened to the show were Stephenie LaGrossa and Rupert Boneham. Steph, was easily one of the most competitive people ever on the show, she was likable, and everyone was rooting for her to win in her first season. She also played a great game in her second season. She deserved a million dollars, even though she didn't win. Rupert, easily the most popular contestant the show has ever had, also played a great game both time, and everyone loved him.<br /><br />Seasons from best to worst (I haven't seen seasons 3-6)<br /><br />Guatemala- It was really great after the merge, had great players, and Steph and Danni were the best Final 2 ever (I wish they still did the Final 2).<br /><br />Vanuatu- I don't know why everyone hated this one. It was really good. The whole Chris, Twila, Eliza, and Scout thing was really good. Once Chad got voted out it got a lot better. Although the whole "Twila swore on her son" crap was too much. I couldn't stand how they wouldn't stop talking about that. But I thought that it was really good once they switched up the tribes.<br /><br />Exile Island- This would probably be ranked higher if Terry (barf) didn't do so well. I hate it when people say that if you win all the challenges then you should win. Survivor is not a physical game. I really liked Aras, Danielle (Red Sox fan!), Cirie, and Sally. Courtney and Shane were annoying, but entertaining. <br /><br />Pearl Islands- Unpredictables with a capital U. I hated Jonny Fairplay, and Rupert was a little irritating (he was better in All-Stars), but Sandra was great, and Jonny Fairplay still put a great spin on the game.<br /><br />All-Stars- I thought that the return of all the characters was really good and I hope they do that again. Although there were 2 pointless episodes when Jenna and Sue quit. Rob C should've been around longer. And the whole Boston Rob/Amber thing was really annoying. Raise your hand if you're NOT sick of them.<br /><br />Cook Islands- from the time where Cao Boi and Cristina got out to where Jonathan got out was great! everything else was just boring. Come on, Ozzy winning everything! lame! Yul was the more deserving one cuz he played a better game. I wish Parvati stayed around longer.<br /><br />Palau- Steph was awesome and she deserved better. Tom was annoying and so was Ian, and Caryn, and Gregg, and Jenn, and everyone else who wasn't Steph, so but since Tom won everything, it was boring.<br /><br />Australia- Overrated. I liked Elisabeth, and Alicia looked like a man she was so buff. (not really). Colby was annoying and they had too much crap about "discovering your inner self." But the later seasons were better than the earlier ones.<br /><br />Fiji- This season never really entranced me like the other ones did. And the Dreamz/Yau Man thing was annoying. After the merge was okay, but this season was really boring.<br /><br />Borneo- BORING! BORING! BORING! nothing else to say<br /><br />I LOVE this show, and I could write about it for hours. Every week I can't wait to watch it. I think it only has 2 seasons left, but I still love the show, and enjoy it while it lasts.
