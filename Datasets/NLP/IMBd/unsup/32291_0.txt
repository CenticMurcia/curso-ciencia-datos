It was as sequels usually are...<br /><br />Bambi was a such a huge movie when I was a kid. I must have cried 5 liters... And it left me with such an impact that I still remember the feeling that I had.... I had my mum but was without a father so I could relate... And now I am a step-mom for two children who have lost their mom, so I can now relate in otherwise as well.....<br /><br />Original is Original, this is a nice movie but no masterpiece and should have been left without the name Bambi II as it is so far from the Original, especially since the Original showed Bambi as an adult already.....
