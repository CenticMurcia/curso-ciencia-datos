Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck reunite after "Double Indemnity" and "Remember the Night" to star in this great unknown film, which is another Ross Hunter-produced and Douglas Sirk-directed picture.<br /><br />Joan Bennett is Fred's wife and mother of his three children. But he is missing something, because her children are her world and they are in their own world, always taking. So when old friend Babs shows up, he spends time with her, only to fall in too deep. Unbeknownst to them, his oldest son joins him on a business trip. But, his client cancelled, leaving only Babs there to entertain Fred (who, yes, just happens to be there). The son sees them together laughing and jumps to conclusions. He promptly leaves not telling his father what he's seen. But, nothing ever happened! But the son, played by an actor I don't know, goes ballistic.<br /><br />The only problem I have is that the actor seems to get a little over-the-top. But, then again it is his strong reaction which is the catapult of all that happens later in the film.<br /><br />What makes this exceptional is a well-written and intelligent script and Fred and Babs' credible acting and chemistry. Man, that Stanwyck could act! She could act the arms off a chair! The scene where she chews the children out and the scene where she tells Fred that they could never be, are highlights. This film makes me want to watch nothing but Stanwyck's movies for a month!<br /><br />The title is a little misleading, though. It's obvious they mean that in "another time, another place" it could have happened and he and Babs could have been together. But with Fred a family man, the viewer is expecting him not only to stay with his family, but to really want to and not feel miserable doing for them.<br /><br />That notwithstanding, if you've never heard of this movie, you need to find it immediately, which may be a feat. But, you won't regret it. We always have Stanwyck.<br /><br />(This is coming out on a Stanwyck DVD collection in late April of 2010! But, this is the best of the lot, others being average or formulaic. But then again with Stanwyck anything is good!)
