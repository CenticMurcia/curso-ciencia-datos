I understand that this is a 'merely for the fans' movie...the tomb stone of the 'Trinity' series.<br /><br />However, the result is pretty embarrassing. First, while Hill aged rather well, Spencer looks significantly older than he actually was, much as if he was sick or something. Second, they don't know what kind of movie they want...is it a Trinity movie...a parody of a Trinity movie...a western-styled Piedone movie with lots of kids around...? Beans, belching and a (very moderate) amount of fist-fights do not automatically make a good Spencer/Hill movie. They push the envelope but I am not sure about what.<br /><br />Who knows... Maybe it's that the atmosphere of 1960-70s Trinity movies, or late 1970s-early 1980s Spencer/Hill is gone.<br /><br />I find the final scene in which they come to get them but loose their guns listening to children singing the corniest and lowest moment in all S&H movies, including Banana Joe & similar.<br /><br />Ruth Buzzi as their mother is ugly as puke...you can see she's wearing a wig and that jaw...that horrible jaw...<br /><br />Intentions behind this were noble, but I maintain it shouldn't have been filmed.
