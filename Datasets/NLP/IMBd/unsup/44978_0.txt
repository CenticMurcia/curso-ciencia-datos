I was really surprised just how bad this movie was. I find Abhishek Bachchan rather charming and Aishwarya is obviously divine, so I expected quite an entertainment. Unfortunately I only got bored. The story is rather regular but lacks of charm and character. <br /><br />The only sensible moment is when Raj fells for Namrata, cause who would not fell for Ash? Her beauty covers for her lack of acting skills (or at least an idea of how to make Namrata interesting) perfectly, unfortunately Abhishek is not that successful. There are a few rather embarrassingly long close-ups of him making some ridiculously 'serious' face. And was it only me or did he put on some weight? <br /><br />The actions of characters make no sense. When she says she's not going to be with him, it comes out of nowhere. When she says she loves him - it's even more out of place. <br /><br />The worst part of the film is the relationship between Namrata and her husband. She knows she hates the guy, she knows she is a modern woman not caring about tradition yet she lets him treat herself as if she's his belonging for an entire day. And when the guy finally agrees to leave her alone - well the ending is just horribly stupid. Why did he do this then? Nothing has changed between the moment he's sure to stay and when he decides to leave. It seems to be some bizarre BollyDeusExMachina... ;) <br /><br />The comedy parts (the other family, the teacher and the bird guy) are too bad to comment on them. They just come out of nowhere and do not add any qualities to the film. <br /><br />Aishwarya wears some rather ugly clothes all the time which is even worse considering the fact that she plays a designer... <br /><br />And what's up with the synopsis in the middle? I'd get it if it was of the entire relationship between Namrata and Raj but it's like showing be the same 15 minutes of the movie twice. Rather irritating.<br /><br />The only good things are two songs: 'Mujhe tum chupke chupke' and 'Kuch naa kaho'. Unfortunately they are ruined by truly stupid choreography. So if you decide to watch this movie do not look at the screen during those two songs - only this'll allow you to appreciate them.<br /><br />oh! And do not take me wrong: I gave the movie 3 not 1 just because Ash is there.
