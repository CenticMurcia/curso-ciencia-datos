In this movie we meet Kristen (Kathy Ireland) who is the daughter of Santa Claus. And when Kristen, her father, and other magical creatures begin the Christmas season with the reading of the naughty and nice list things don't go well. After seeing that there are more people on the naughty list than on the nice list Santa loses hope in mankind, so he decides to quit. Kristen makes a deal that if she can get one of the families back on the nice list then it will prove that there is hope for mankind and Santa won't quit, but she has to do this before midnight on Christmas Eve so she has to work fast. She soon comes into the lives of the Morgans. As the father is a workaholic, his son is always in trouble, his passed-wife's brother has no job so hes staying with them, while his daughter is more like an adult than a kid. So now Kristen's got her work cut out for her. As she starts getting closer to success her older sister Rudolfa (Mary Donnelly-Haskell) is trying to stop her so she can take control of Christmas and ruin it forever. Soon Kristen starts to realize that everything isn't as easy as she thought it was in the beginning and will soon learn the one part of the Christmas Spirit that she never knew.<br /><br />This is a fun movie to watch with your family especially on Christmas. It can truly get you into the Christmas Spirit.
