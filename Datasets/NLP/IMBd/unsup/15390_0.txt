Let's face it, there really isn't much to this movie. It's a movie directed by Robert J. Flaherty, who was best known for his documentaries and his most famous and first movie "Nanook of the North", which wasn't even a real documentary. This movie also ain't no documentary and its something that is somewhat between a full length movie and a fake-documentary, like "Nanook of the North".<br /><br />In all honesty because of its style and approach, the whole movie and its story was far from an interesting one. It's not really a movie in which a lot is happening and there is no drama to the story in terms of having something awful or shocking happen in it. It just tells the story of a little Cajun boy who enjoys living in the swampy Louisiana area, when suddenly an oil company shows up and starts building an oil derrick. You think that after this point his whole life will change and he'll do anything to prevent the oil company from drilling and destroying the territory he loves to play and hunt in. This movie however got actually produced by an oil company, so there is no such happening in this movie at all. Instead he makes friends with the oil people and just go on about his life as if nothing has drastically changed. This is why "Louisiana Story" just isn't that interesting or strong as movie, story-wise.<br /><br />It's however still a very well directed one. Every shot got set up nicely and Robert J. Flaherty obviously had an eye for the environments and for creating some beautiful set up shots. The movie is also supported by a really nice musical score by Virgil Thomson. The editing at times is however really off and at times ruins some of the movie its pacing.<br /><br />Not really a that interesting movie to watch but still perfectly watchable because of how fine it's all made.<br /><br />7/10
