Andy Colby's Incredible Adventure or Andy and the Airwave Rangers is a very unusual film. The acting by all of the actors is very good especially by Bo Svenson and Chuck Kovacic. The action and stuff is good. The movie is filmed very good but yet very unusual.The music is good. The film is very interesting and it is exciting. This is a good and different film. In My opinion I UI think that this film doesn't deserve the bad comments and the low rating. Why? This is a very unique 80s film and I think of this film as a rare gem of the era and not a bad flick at all. If you like Bo Svenson and the rest of the cast in the film, Adventure, Fantasy, Sci-Fi, and interesting films from the 1980s then I recommend this one!
