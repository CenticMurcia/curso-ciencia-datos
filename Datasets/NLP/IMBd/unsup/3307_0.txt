Despite my big surprise when I saw that this film got a low IMDb score (only 6/10) I decided to see the film because the preview looked promising. I was not wrong. I found it to be one of the very best of its kind. Fascinating in every aspect. Very well written scenario, real life story, exciting camera, strong acting, very talented direction without anything superfluous, and very real and interesting scenes of the life and people in the Philipinnes. The images will remain in my mind for a long time.<br /><br />Some reviewers complain about the continuous hand held camera, but although it makes you a little dizzy I think that it has its purpose. It wouldn't be as convincing otherwise. <br /><br />Some Philipinno reviewers got offended because they consider that the film misrepresents the Philipinnes because it shows the miserable aspect of the country. However, having lived in various third world countries it seems to me that what is portrayed is a very real part of the Philipinnes, Also it does not matter because in a film we should be looking for art rather than for advertising a country. <br /><br />Other reviewers seem to consider it an amateur/experimental film but I found it to be a very complete film. The directors managed with limited means, not only money but also cinematic, i.e. with one actor, with a minimal plot, etc. managed to make a very full film second by second, image by image, word by word.<br /><br />Congratulations to the directors, the main actor and the cameraman. I strongly recommend this film to all the non-Hollywood film lovers, and all the Philipinnos.
