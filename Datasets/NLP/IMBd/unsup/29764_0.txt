People have sex for many reasons, one reason being that for however fleeting sex can give us a sense of unboundedness, without time. That fleeting chase to orgasm which we take again again takes us to God and we feel whole--for so terribly a brief time, but whole. People masturbate for many reasons, some people masturbate a lot because it is the best they know of to the truly transcendent moment from which we come and to which we go. An orgasm, any orgasm, is a "petit mort" and only in death do we get to hold the Divine Presence in fullness. The human soul is sadly unattended to in our contemporary culture because of the moral bankruptcy of the conventional religious institutions. People have no where to turn, they have no tutors, no credible religious mentors, so they undertake the journey on their own and end up with loveless sex and the inevitable next step, a slow, but certain, death. When the young man masturbates on his dead fathers porn he does the only thing he can do in his state of spiritual abandonment. The adults in his life live in a world without sin and hence no salvation. The desperate and painful masturbation is his recognition that his father could not love anything or anyone.
