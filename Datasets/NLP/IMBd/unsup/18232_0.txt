From what I remember about what was said in the press about this show, Larson, et. al., had high minded ambitions about this show-He wanted to be fun and interesting for both children *and* adults. Cassiopeia was a "socialator(prostitute?)", remember.<br /><br />However, it was reported that the network was adamant that it be a kiddy show. This lead to increasingly inane plots and cartoon like characters which ultimately resulted in "Galactica '80".<br /><br />I still think the premiere episode and some of the subsequent ones were some of the best work ever done in science fiction.<br /><br />I still sometimes think in terms of "centons", and "microns", and praise the lords of Kobol.<br /><br />I cant wait for the theatrical remake!
