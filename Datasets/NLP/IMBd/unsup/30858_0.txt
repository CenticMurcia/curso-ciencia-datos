I usually enjoy a good cheesy comedy, I enjoyed some of Adam Sandler's previous films. But this was missing a key component, it wasn't funny! It was simply terrible.<br /><br />It's not worth going into much detail, suffice to say none of the jokes (if you can call them jokes) were not funny, the storyline was almost nonexistent the characters were irritating and unlikeable.<br /><br />It was painful to watch, by the end I was contemplating suicide. What was Sandler thinking? I hope he returns to the form of films such as Happy Gilmore, but after this stinker it's highly unlikely.<br /><br />It reminded me a lot of the love guru, I can't decide which film was worse. They both had lame characters with awful accents and unintelligible story lines.<br /><br />This could have been a funny film if they had dropped the PG rating and given it the crudeness that it only hinted at. If you want to have a laugh you'd be better off watching Harold and Kumar Escape Guantanamo Bay, or Semi-Pro. Which are both stupid and cheesy, but deliver on laughs where this film totally misses.
