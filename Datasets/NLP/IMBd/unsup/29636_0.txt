Watching this show is like watching a very nasty train wreck - you want to look away yet you can't help but stare at the horror... I think I've seen four episodes, and I hated every single one of them... I TRIED to like it! I kept hoping the stupid piece of you-know-what would get better... I didn't expect it to be that 70s show rehashed, but damn! There's a REASON they have a laugh track on this show, you know - no live studio audience would stick around. What gets me the most is the way they're trying REALLY REALLY FREAKING HARD to force a love plot with the main character and his overdone-punk co-worker. You realize Corey and Tuesday are going to get together, and when they finally passionately kiss that laugh track is going to give a big "WOOOOO!" and I think I'm going to go to my basement and hang myself. And while we're on the topic of Tuesday, I'm sorry, but I remember the 80s fairly well, and while mohawks were in, whatever the hell she's attempting to do with it was not (to be honest, I think that actress refused to shave the sides of her head in the name of her part so they had to think of something else). I hate this show... I hate myself for having wasted two hours of my life watching it. The only people who could possibly like this show are the hopeless pre-teens who have nothing better to with with their time and don't really know the meaning of quality yet (we're all victims at that age; I remember Saved by the Bell all too well). I'd rather sit and watch a loogie dry than to watch that 80s show ever again.
