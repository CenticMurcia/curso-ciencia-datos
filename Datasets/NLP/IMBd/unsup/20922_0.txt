Ace Ventura is Jim's best movie.If you haven't seen any of Carrey's movies rent this one first.The other movies he did are good but they don't compare to this one.<br /><br />You know, i can't understand why some people didn't liked this movie.What's wrong with it, the faces he does the things he says is so funny.<br /><br />People who didn't like ace ventura are people who probably liked "The waterboy".Boooring....!!
