WARNING: SPOILERS!!!!!<br /><br />This movie is awful. Any Canadian who watches it and likes it should have their heads examined. Don't give me that "it's just goofy political satire" crap. The fact is, they start insulting Canada before they consider a cold war with Canada (i.e. the hockey game: "What's with the flag, is that some kind of weed?") Aside from the meaningless anti-Canadian jokes, the jokes are pretty dumb. The only part which cracked a smile from me was when they were (trying) to sing "Born in the USA."<br /><br />Bottom line, don't waste your time with this highly offensive claptrap. This should have never been marketed as John Candy's final movie. By the way, he was Canadian.
