I'd like to give this film one star, but I couldn't do that to such a hilarious film. Anyway, on with the review. This film was a student film made for about $1500, so I'd like to say we shouldn't judge it too harshly, but the direction is so poor, it's really impossible not to say it stunk. And it did stink. One of the main problems I had with the film was it's lack of any female characters. Sure, it has Troy's grandma for one scene, and you could hear the voice of a female operator in one scene, but what I mean is, this film had absolutely no romance(unless you want to count Zap Rowsdower and Troy scampering through the woods romantic...ugh...)I think there really should have been a spunky female protagonist alongside Zap and Troy, fighting masked goons and uncovering clues to the lost city. But alas, there is none. What I will say about this film is that it has some of the most unforgettable characters in B movie history. Who could forget whiny, prepubescent Troy Mcgregor? Or Hocky Hair-ridden, alcoholic, uber Canadian Rowsdower? Or Pipper, the man who sounds like he had a bottle brush shoved down his throat? Nobody, that's who. Nobody who saw the film, that is.
