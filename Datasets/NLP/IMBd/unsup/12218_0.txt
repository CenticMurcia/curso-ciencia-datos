I am Sam is the best movie since "The Other Sister". Mental capacity does not dictate the ability to love. This is a realistic movie, showing the incredible range of acting ability of Sean Penn. The movie made me laugh, cry, angry at those who think people with disAbilities cannot function... not true! 'Sam' has a heart of gold. This is Sean Penn at his best... a must see!
