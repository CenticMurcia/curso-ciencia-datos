Without comparing this to any other zombie film out there, this was one of the worst movies I've ever watched. The acting was bad, and that could be attributed to this being the actors first film ever. The lighting was very very bad, it appears throughout the movie that they are trying to use natural lighting, if that's the case, why shoot the film in shady areas or late in the day? Most of the time you can't see the actors expressions or faces because of the shadows. The special effects are horrible in most places, sometimes the blood is red, sometimes it's black. You see a lot of blood that looks black and congealed running out of one wound while there's fresh red blood running out of another wound (This being on the same body at the same time). The story doesn't run very smoothly at all with dialog being forced to move the plot along. One or two of these things in an independent movie isn't enough to kill it, IF the remaining factors are strong enough to carry the weak points of the film. When you have all negative points in one movie, the movie sucks.<br /><br />If you do compare this to other low budget zombie movies out there (Braindead or Dead And Breakfast to name two), it doesn't even begin to compare and ends up looking like a High School students weekend project that is paid for with his allowance.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Don't Rent, Don't Buy, If it's on cable late at night watch an infomercial instead.
