I could only bring myself to sit through half of this movie, then I couldn't take the pain any longer. I would rather watch my limbs on fire than this movie. IT SUCKS ASS, IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY. If you watch this movie, you will want to die. The acting was terrible, right from the start. The camera-work is completely horrible and lame. Everything about this movie sucks. Everything. The music in unatmospheric and sounds like it was made in someones mom's basement. I just stopped watching it when I saw the "zombie" that was a fat dude with black lipstick on. Really, that was it. Save yourself some time, don't watch this drivel.
