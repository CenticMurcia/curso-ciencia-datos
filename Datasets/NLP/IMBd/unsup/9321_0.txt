I recently picked up this thing at my local supplier (Video to Go in Lansing) hoping to get my fix with a really bad movie. In this undertaking, there was some degree of success, but not extremely so.<br /><br />The plot is that an oil tycoon is building a huge platform near one of the poles to exploit an oil pocket that was previously unreachable. He invited a TV reporter and her camera guy along to make a documentary about his new rig. During the drilling process, they open up an underground cavern where prehistoric fish have survived for millenia (presumably). This releases the Megalodon (the ancestor of the great white shark) and the thing proceeds to try and make the crew of the rig its lunch.<br /><br />The acting is OK and the plot has been recycled so many times you can predict who will live and who will die. The whole thing looks like a producer and his friends got together and decided to play around with some new CGI technology they got for Christmas. On top of this, the damn Megalodon doesn't even appear until the movie is half way over. They tried to throw some environmentalist views into this thing, but it just seemed to add to an already lack-luster film.
