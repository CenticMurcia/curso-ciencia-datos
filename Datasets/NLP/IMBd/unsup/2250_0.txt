Julio Medem could be to work at a doctor, if it's possible he could be better professional, because as a filmmaker is very poor. I can't understand this people who vote this film as a good movie. The actresses have had a bad job, they like amateurs players, not the professionals.<br /><br />The sound is horrible, there are some dialogs, that I couldn't understand anything. I think, that this film, abuse the sex scenes to attract the spectators and there are almost always unnecessary. An other abuses are the burned photography in the scenes at the island. Why they meaning?, it is abusive at all. When I read the summary, of that film, in the DVD, it explain that this film is about Lucia discovery of her own past, and that it isn't true, in any case it would be about her boyfriend. In fact, I don't like this film, it is boring and bad make.
