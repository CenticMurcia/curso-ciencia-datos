The movie has excellent star casting. first time ever i have liked an Indian movie and i am confused to decide whether which character in the movie was played well. its not that there is no other Indian movie that has been created well, but watching Eklavya was just a different experience. while you are watching " Eklavya" , you feel no matter how many other movie this actors have done for v.v.c. before, they act completely different. in other words all of the character reminds you that they have a new and better ways of expressing the dialogues of the script. the is not too lengthy. and yet it wont seem like there is any cut off.<br /><br />Every actor in EKLAVYA  THE ROYAL GUARD stands out for terrific portrayal. Sanjay Dutt has a brief role, but he's fantastic all through.Vidya Balan is superb yet again. There's no stopping this actress! Boman Irani is first-rate in a negative role. Watch him interact with Sharmila Tagore in the very first scene and with Jackie subsequently to know the range of this gifted actor. Jimmy Shergill introduces you to a hitherto unknown facet of his talent. He excels in a negative role. Jackie Shroff gets a meaty role yet again in a Vidhu Vinod Chopra film. He's wonderful. Raima Sen leaves a mark in a significant role. Sharmila Tagore exudes class in a cameo. Parikshit Sahni is efficient.<br /><br />EKLAVYA  THE ROYAL GUARD is an opulent film, with a gargantuan cast, gripping story seeped in Indian emotions and values, striking visuals and topnotch making as its trump cards. Without a shred of doubt, it's one of the finest products to come out of the Hindi film industry.
