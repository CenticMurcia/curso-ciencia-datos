I'm giving this movie a 3 only because some of the acting was good. Aside from that, this movie is crap. The plot is predictable, the main characters extremely unlikable, the situations uncomfortable and depressing and it has a totally unbelievable ending. Also, the movie has a vaguely homophobic feel to it and the grainy film stock really got on my nerves. This is one of those overpraised independent films that everybody will have forgotten in a year or two. Don't see it--unless you like being totally depressed.
