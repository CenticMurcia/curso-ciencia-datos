Awful acting from everyone, the actors seemed very uninspired (perhaps with the exception of Susan Sullivan as Mom, with an on-screen time of maybe 5 minutes).<br /><br />The 'effects' were even worse: If you as a want to depict a storm on film, you will have to make sure that the boat involved rocks way more than it would in a small lake with a light breeze, if it is to be at all believable. Which it wasn't.<br /><br />The soundtrack sounded like bad 80's muzak and was annoyingly present throughout the movie.<br /><br />The 'plot' was very straightforward, no surprises there - apart from the fact that some of the characters surprised me by being totally out of character.<br /><br />Steer clear away from this crap.
