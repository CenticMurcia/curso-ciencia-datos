OK, hmmm, well lets see... I question how many dogs died in the making of this movie, seeing as a breaking of the nose during some "crazy dawg action" trying to score with the basketball. Also, I've heard that pudding isn't good for dogs...ya. And also, this is basically dissing American basketball. A team of kids who haven't won a single game...And along comes a dog, which appears to be a better teacher than any of the boys, as well as better than the whole team. (Even though it has no idea what it's doing.) Oh ya! I just remembered. Golden retrievers don't have thumbs. So, the writer's brilliant plan? Airbud hits the the basketball with his nose basically the whole movie! One problem. I've tried that before. Make that two problems. It breaks the dog's nose, as well as YOU CAN"T AIM! This is crushing all of the kid's egos! They must be thinking "Hey, a dog, with no thumbs, using only his nose is better than me." You'd think some kid would want revenge for all of the humiliation. Although I had tons of fun making fun (fun squared!) of this movie with my good pals, unless you are into all types of cheese possible, watch grass grow. It is more exciting, and has a better plot.
