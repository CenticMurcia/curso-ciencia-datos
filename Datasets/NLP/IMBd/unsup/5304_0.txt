You know, I've seen alot of excellent films in my life, but All Or Nothing is a perfect film. The story was so wonderfully moving and touching, the direction flawless, but the collected performances in this movie are the best I've ever seen....and I mean from every single member of the cast. I was completely and totally awestruck by the quality of the acting. Thirty minutes into this film, I felt the strongest identity with each of the characters and my heart actually ached for them. There is so much truth and honesty, so much clarity, that I feel gifted just to have seen this movie and I will remember it the rest of my life. Absolutely fantastic!!! If this is the only drama you will ever see, do yourself a favor and let it be All Or Nothing.
