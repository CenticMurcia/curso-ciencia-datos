This film is full of great characters, who are rounded out into real people,and despite any flaws in them, they were all still likable. It was nice to see all of the cast interact with each other as if they haven't seen each other for years. It's a just a great movie, and its replay value is above a lot of other movies out right now. Malcolm Lee has done a fine job with this film. Go ahead and see it! Now!
