Wow... what a dark, enthralling tale! The plot is so tight, story arc so suspenseful, acting so affecting, and the scenes so horrifying and heart-wrenching at the same time, I'm completely captivated just 3 episodes into the show and ready to buy the entire series.<br /><br />The cover art does no justice at all - Skeet Ulrich with his goatee shaved off (trying to shake off the Johnny Depp curse?) looks so much like his "Scream" character, that I thought this was going to be another teen drama.<br /><br />Gothic horrors it deliverers, but not jut for teens. If "Buffy the Vampire" is high school, then this is Post Graduate. It's intelligent as "The X-files", only cuter, warmer, and more soulful.<br /><br />Yet, this great TV series was doomed and forgotten due to bad timing, while elementary level suspense and fantasy like "Heroes" and "Lost" got many seasons and followers... How incomprehensible and depressing, really, "GOD IS NOWHERE", or shall I quote Paul Callan "...why is God doing this?"
