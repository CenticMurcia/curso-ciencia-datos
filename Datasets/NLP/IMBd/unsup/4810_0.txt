A wonderful book and the film captures much of the beauty and culture, although some side-stories are given short-shrift (Portia and her father). This is my favorite film of '68 and Alan Arkin should have Won gold. His John Singer, a thoughtful and attentive man who realizes the plight of humanity's basic selfishness too far down the road is a complete character. Sondra Locke's debut was marvellous and Chuck McCann was also brilliant.<br /><br />A 9 out of 10. Best performance = A. Arkin. Stacy Keach's film debut. I wish Cicely Tyson had more scenes to play with Percy Rodriguez as we are left in the cold about much of their situation. Highly recommended film!
