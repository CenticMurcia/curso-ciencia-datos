Within two minutes you can see this is going to be bad. It's appallingly acted. I have seen better performances at a school nativity play. The music and photography immediately shouts soft porn film. There is absolutely no need for the three pairs of breasts to be shown in the film or for Gail to spend most of her time in her underwear. You didn't need to be possessed to know that some show of breasts was coming later on. The make up was incredibly bad. There was a large pink drip clinging to Gail's cheek whilst she wrestled with the her yellow contact lenses, had she been possessed by a demonic blancmange? I need to plead to the people who appeared in this film. GET ANOTHER JOB. You will never be going to the Oscars......unless you can drive a limo or know something about stage lighting. I am sorry to be so mean but I am being cruel to be funny. At least stick to doing commercials ONLY.........that require no speech (a commercial containing a finger pointing at a product would be ideal).<br /><br />It's bad horror, it's poor porno, it's laughably bad. If you like good looking women showing their breasts then this film is still not for you.
