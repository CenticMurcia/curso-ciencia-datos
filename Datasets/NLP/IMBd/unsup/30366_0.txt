A talented and pretty little Tereska learns how to live. She does not know how to dream, she was never told that her life belonged to her. All she knows is that she must be nice, praise God by singing in a church choir, don't talk too much, don't fight for her rights, and keep most of her thoughts secret. Nobody cares what she feels and thinks anyway. She is desperately looking for love. But where can she find it if her parents, her teachers, her friends do not know it either?<br /><br />In a very well designed way this film shows what steps are taken to make a little young angel into a vicious devil. It happens slowly and it is hard to tell who is to blame. An excellent story to start thinking about values, how they are born and why we need them. The film also shows how different we all are and that the only way to be able to live together is to communicate openly and honestly. It seems so simple, yet so difficult. The only time Tereska gets the courage to talk about her dreams she gets scared to death in a self destructive outburst of anger.<br /><br />I give this movie a 10 because it touches so deeply on the most important life issues: how we think, make decisions, and how narrow minded we are when taking care of our daily problems. It for sure is not a comedy, but I laughed quite a few times. All in all it is a very stimulating movie.
