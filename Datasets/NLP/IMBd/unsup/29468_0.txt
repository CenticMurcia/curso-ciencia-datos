This is awful, awful , awful. A really bad film. I bought the soundtrack as I litsened to it on the radio it I thought the soundtrack was good and thus went out to see the movie, but i deeply regret that move. The acting in this was worse than Asoka, no screenplay, songs were OK but almost no context in the film!There was only one thing i liked about this movie. The shots of the Kashmir Landscape the got. It was truly Breathtaking, but that has nothing to do with the movie, i would give it zero if i could. They just put in some random Gymnast as a dancer and than bad acting by Vivek, topped with a stupid plot topped with no sense and than at the end Subash Ghai standing in the foreground staring out at the beautiful valley like he has made an Oscar Winning movie. I expected way more out of this. This was a letdown .A grotesque, lousy, motion picture.
