I am a fan of Prince. Don't get me wrong. But this movie was as bad as most people thought it to be. If you notice in most of the positive reviews here, the author will often say something like, "Of all of Prince's movies..." Look, if you have seen more than 2 of Prince's movies, you are a Prince groupie and thus can not be counted on to give an unbiased review. Personally, after this train wreck, I refrained from seeing any more of his theatrical releases and stuck to just enjoying his music. So, if Graffiti Bridge was a good movie...I can't tell you. I loved Purple Rain, though. But sometimes you catch lightning in a bottle and you just can't reproduce it. Can't blame him for trying though.
