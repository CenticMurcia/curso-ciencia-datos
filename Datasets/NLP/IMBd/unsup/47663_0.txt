This movie blows like no other 80s teen slasher flick. The plot is unoriginal, the acting is poor, and all the "teen" counselors are like 30 years old! The only surprise in the film is when the "hero" suddenly gets hung out to dry in the first half of the film. The special effects suck and the whole movie has a feeling that it was written and shot in the same day. Definitely not a movie I would recommend to anyone interested in the teen slasher genre; rent Sleepaway Camp, Happy Birthday to Me, Friday the 13th, or a Nightmare on Elm Street instead. Oh, well, at least I saw it on cable and didn't rent this piece of crap.
