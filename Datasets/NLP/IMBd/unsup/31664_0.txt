This film is a comedy about how the writer Hrabal was born. The movie takes<br /><br />place in a small town where Hrabal's father is in charge of a brewery.<br /><br />The blessing and at the same time the bane of his life is his wonderful wife.<br /><br />Blessing, because she is not only beautiful but she is resourceful and<br /><br />intelligent and lively, bane all other man in the little town man would like to get<br /><br />to know her better. The story is a kind of nostalgia, but is still<br /><br />amusing tale, with not much tension and thriller, but still worth to watch<br /><br />(If you have a good copy of it...) <br /><br />At a time  I think  in the eighties the film won a some prize in a Film Festival, in Europe
