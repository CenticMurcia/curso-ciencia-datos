The locations, hairstyles, costumes were superb. The top talents of all entertainment trades were used in this treasured piece . You can imagine how prized those vintage gowns are today, especially since so many were ruined in the filming of Titanic. I especially loved my mothers black drop shoulder New Years Eve gown. The best hair stylists were used, she said, and she has stills with all the major actors from that location which was filmed at the historic Ambassador hotel downtown Los Angeles. Her almost platinum blond hair was in the soft roll of the times, longer than most of the players, but she was the most glamorous of the New years revelers. She so enjoyed all the actors even though Polly Bergen tore a tiara off her head in the wardrobe trailer, citing that "she is supposed to be a floozie, not a princess!!!" It was nice that they addressed her by her real name, Susan. She said that they used lots of smoke machines and quite a few of the actors smoked on top of the machines, which made for very dry eyes and throats. She was the date of Hack Peters. It is a great mini series to curl up to and own for the actors are the best!!
