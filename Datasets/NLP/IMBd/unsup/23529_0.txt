It was very refreshing to view this Dracula film without the sexy women and the two(2) marks on their neck, like the Bela Lugosi classic films. I could write two-hundred words about this film and even tell you the ending. However, if you are a fan of Jane March (Lidia)"Amdnt,L" 91 you will love her performance as the wife of Rudolf Martin (Vlad the Impaler)"Swordfish" '01. Lidia plays a young sweet and innocent virgin who plans to become a Nun and is charmed by Vlad and the sparks fly immediately and the baby soon arrives. Peter Weller (Father Stefan) "Styx" '01 tries to prevent Dracula from spreading his evil in the world, unfortunately, Dracula movies must continue to be produced from one generation to another. If you like History of Dracula, this is the film for you!!
