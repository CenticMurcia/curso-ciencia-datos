If you are gay, lesbian, or simply sympathetic to the lives and struggles of gays and lesbians, you must watch this film.<br /><br />It is the story of gays and although briefly, lesbians, during the early Pre-WWII years and also during the war.<br /><br />Although I had heard of the "pink triangle" used by the Nazi's during the war, I had never heard any information about victims of Nazi persecution against homosexuals. Ever. Until now I was in the dark.<br /><br />I shall forever be grateful to the producers, director, and survivors who shared their deeply personal stories, each unique, yet all with a common thread; one of having survived as homosexuals and lesbians during the Nazi era in Germany.<br /><br />The stories are real, the people are real, and the emotions which are displayed and which will be brought forth in you, are real. It is impossible to be a human being, and not be struck deep inside by the faces and stories of these people.<br /><br />Remarkably, even some of the survivors eventually became members of the German Army during the war themselves, so in no means is this a whitewashed film nor is it seen only through rose colored glasses.<br /><br />This is documentary cinema at its very finest. Emotional, insightful, raw, and human in every sense of the word.<br /><br />Do not miss this film!
