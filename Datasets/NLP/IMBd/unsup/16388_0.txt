Having never seen a silent film before, I wasn't sure what to expect going into it. Buster Keaton's "The General" is set in 1861, the year the American civil war broke out. Like all young men at the time, the film's main protagonist John Gray (Keaton), a railroad engineer tries to enlist in the army but is denied entry as he is deemed more valuable to the southern cause as an engineer. Subsequently, he is dismissed as a coward by his girlfriend, Annabelle. It so happens that one day soon after, the northern union spies steal his train.....with Annabele on board and it's up to Johnnie to go deep into the enemy territory to recapture the engine and the girl.<br /><br />Buster Keaton who also co-wrote and co-directed the film is utter perfection as the title character. Not only are his facial expressions when he realises that something has gone wrong on the train hilarious but one must also give him credit for doing most of his own stunt work! Also deserving of praise are the film's three composers whose score is memorable and never feels repetitive.<br /><br />Overall: 8/10 and a great first film for anyone who wants to broaden their horizons by watching films made in the "pre-talkies" era.
