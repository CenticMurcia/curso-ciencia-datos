I was looking forward to seeing this, particularly as it features Sean Penn and marks the only film ever to have been allowed access to the inner sanctum of the United Nations in New York. Whilst Sean Penn delivers a typically solid performance (reminding me a little of Robert Di Niro in this), Nicole Kidman is totally unconvincing as a translator at the UN specializing in the language of her (fictional) African homeland. If we accept the plot as plausible (which is already a bit of a leap), you can't help but wonder at the ineptitude of the CIA, FBI, NYPD and other agencies of law and order in dealing with the threat to a visiting African dictator. One man (who had earlier been injured in an explosion) is tasked with tracking down Nicole Kidman alone. He apparently manages, in the space of a couple of hours, to check every airport in the New York area, and call all of her friends and acquaintances. As for the haunting African music which turns out to be coming from Ms. Kidman's flute, well I couldn't help laughing. If you want a movie about international politics and the problems faced in Africa, watch Hotel Rwanda. If you want to hear Nicole Kidman delivering her lines in an endlessly changing accent, this is the one for you.
