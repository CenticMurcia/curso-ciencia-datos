When I watched ''Mio min Mio'' for the first time, I was a kid with 7 years old. It was one of my childhood's favorite movies, and until the present days I found it magical in a certain way. Reading here in IMDb I discovered that it was based in a book, but sadly I never read it, and I also discovered that the famous music played in the movie that get stuck in your head ,is called "Mio, Min Mio". I didn't remembered that Christian Bale worked in this movie, so it was a real pleasure to see him in the screens.( I like him a lot). I was very afraid as a child about Kato and all that dark atmosphere near his castle, not to mention the kids who were kidnapped and transformed into a bird; the last scene where Kato dies was terrifying, and at the same time very satisfying.<br /><br />It's a pity that this movie isn't very well know. I guess many people would love to have watched this movie as a kid.<br /><br />Ps: Don't forget that this movie was made in a time where Harry Potter didn't exist. But it is funny, since you can see some references to HP's books. The invisible cap that Mio uses, Kato, that always remembers me Voldemort, magic, an orfan who is hated by the people who takes care of him...well..I guess you got the point! :)
