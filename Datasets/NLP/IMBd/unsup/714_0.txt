As a person who has experienced the relationship between client and therapist for several years now, I found this movie to hit on the "sensitive" areas of that relationship in one of the most comical ways I have seen to date. Anybody who has ever been in therapy or who is in the profession should especially see this movie. I laughed all the way through it.
