This thing is really funny. There's some gross bits, like with Hellcop, but Patrick Bergin as the devil is very suave and funny. Ben Stiller pops up as about four different supporting characters, and his dad Jerry is in there too somewhere. I should track this down at my local video store! I haven't seen it in a while. Good fun.
