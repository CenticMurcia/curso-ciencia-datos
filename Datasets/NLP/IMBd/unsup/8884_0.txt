A pressman (Dennis O'Keefe) hires a leopard for a publicity stunt for his client (Jean Brooks) in New Mexico. The leopard accidentally escapes and a rash of gruesome murders happen that look like the work of the leopard...or are they?<br /><br />Not really a horror film as many believe. It's a murder mystery with horrific touches. It contains two very frightening sequences--one in which a young girl is locked out of her house while the leopard is after her; the other is one of the scariest locked in a cemetary after closing sequences I've ever seen.<br /><br />The movie is short (59 minutes) and interesting and one character (Raoul) has some of the most beautiful face shots at the end--hard to explain, you have to see it. The dialogue is intelligent and the characters have depth and you're kept guessing up to the very end what is going on. Well worth catching.
