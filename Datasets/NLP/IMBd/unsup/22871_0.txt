I cant believe I am not the only one who remembers this awesome movie. I have told others about it over the years and now one else remembers it. I was only 8 years old and cried harder than I had ever cried before when I saw this movie. I have been searching like the rest of you. I wish we could find it on DVD. I loved this movie and obviously it had an impact on so many of us if after all these years we all still remember it and are still searching for it. Could there be a way to locate which studio made this movie and beg for release on DVD? Wasn't the woman played by Kay Lenz??? I think but am not sure..I was only eight years old after all.
