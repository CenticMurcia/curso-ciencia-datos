Best TV movie ever? Hardly... anybody seen a little movie called DUEL? Hmmm, I guess not. A 6.0 out of 10? And all this positive feedback? Methinks the producers of this little opus are hiking up the score... Don't you guys have anything better to do, like actually reading the scripts of a movie you're producing? If so, then maybe this disaster might not have been dumped on us.<br /><br />The plot isn't worth mentioning, Doug ("I'm not gay...") Savant and Hemingway are suitably awful, and one of the films producers is the guy who played the midget jerk brother on "The Wonder Years". 'nuff said. Avoid.
