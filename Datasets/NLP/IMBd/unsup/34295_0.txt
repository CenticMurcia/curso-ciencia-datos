I can not believe they called this boogeyman '2', did the director even bother to watch the first Boogeyman? This film has absolutely nothing to do with the first one, its a different reality entirely. <br /><br />The first one was deep and twisted and really made you think about the world and colliding realities, it was such an inspiring film and it still gives me a cold shiver thinking about that little girl saying 'you can't save me, you can only save yourself'..<br /><br />But this one is just cheap and boring, a steaming pile of wannabe 'slasher' movie with no plot that makes any sense, no surprises, just really dull. what a magnificent waste of time, can I have my money back now?
