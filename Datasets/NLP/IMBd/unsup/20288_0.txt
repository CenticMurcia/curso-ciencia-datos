I finally brought myself to watch all of the Big Store, the movie on the flip side of Go West DVD. I recall seeing Store (in the late 60's/early 70's I deliberately saw any Marx movie whether on TV or in a revival in a theatre until I had seen them all) years before and being bored out of my skull.<br /><br />I had tried to watch it a few weeks earlier, but gave up after the scene where the beds can be hidden in the wall or floors.<br /><br />This time, biting the bullet, I watched Groucho sing while he sold and the final chase scene with sound effects added that made it seem like a Hanna-Barbera cartoon.<br /><br />And the end, I had to admit, The Big Store was passable--provided it had starred someone else.<br /><br />If you can erase the fact you're watching the Marx Brothers from your mind, The Big Store seems exactly like any overblown 1940's comedy. It well meets the standard for a Red Skelton film or perhaps something with Danny Kaye or early Jerry Lewis.<br /><br />If you can perform the mental feat that Groucho is Red Skelton, Chico is Danny Kaye and Harpo is Jerry Lewis (uggghhh!), the Big Store does not seem like the abysmal thing it is.<br /><br />Seeing this film makes you understand just how high the bar the Marx Brothers set for their movies, much higher than virtually any other comic working with a film studio, instead of independently as Chaplin did.<br /><br />Things happened in a Marx Brother film that just never happened in one with Red Skelton: Margaret Dumont being deviled by Groucho, Groucho being deviled by Chico, and the rest of the Universe bedeviled by Harpo. Out of the gate in the Cocoanuts, the Brothers' first film in 1929, we already have the "Why A Duck?" routine between Groucho and Chico. We already have Groucho's "Won't you lie down?" to Margaret Dumont, and Harpo giving Basil Ruysdael his leg while whistling a tune from the arcane musical, "Floradora." Even as we move to the later films, there is also the Marx's brilliant sense of surrealism and absurdity, far beyond the capabilities of anyone else. Their penultimate film, A Night in Casablanca, an almost last hurrah which they financed themselves and had more say over, can be arguably ranked with the lesser Paramount or best MGM films.<br /><br />But Store provides a disconnect which the brothers never are able to overcome. This was never something impossible for them. The plot was generally something they made their way around, jumped over, or totally jettisoned. Here, there are trapped in it, and it's not pretty.<br /><br />There are still some marvelous moments--how can there not be in a Marx Brothers movie? Groucho's last film appearance with Margaret Dumont is as always wonderful. Harpo has a magnificent harp solo where he turns into Mozart and his mirror reflections spring to life far more than any ever did in Duck Soup. The opening sequence where Dumont visits Groucho's fly-by-night detective agency (where Harpo is the given the Quasi-Zeppoesque role as Groucho's Assistant) is wonderful.<br /><br />But the lengthy Groucho musical number (three DVD chapters!) is pretty much a straight one. There's no tattooed lady, African explorer, or pre-war hysteria to be found. The juvenile's musical number, The Tenement Symphony, is nowhere as mercifully brief as When My Dreams Come True is in the Cocoanuts. Harpo and Chico even participate in it.<br /><br />Worst of all, however, are the moments where the brothers are made into just any old comedy team, pushing wrong buttons to create chaos, riding on roller skates and unicycles to escape the villain, and serving up a wienie with some Puccini (Or is it Rossini? My mind has blocked it out like a car accident).<br /><br />You don't gotta sing while you sell. Please don't.<br /><br />It's sad that the Marx's valedictory with MGM had to be this generic bore. Through no fault of their own, they became personae non grata at the studio and seemed to be given a script pulled at random from a file drawer.<br /><br />So, if you're a Red Skelton fan, and can ignore the fact you're watching Groucho, Harpo and Chico, by all means, watch The Big Store. If you're a Marx Brothers worshipper (they don't merely have fans), please show their memories respect and keep the DVD on the side that has Go West.
