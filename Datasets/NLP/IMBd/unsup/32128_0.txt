VIVA is so good that most will likely mistake it for an actual example of the stereotypical 70's genre sexploitation flick it so perfectly mimics. Nothing could be further from the truth. The real thing never looked so beautiful, or was so meticulously composed, or lovingly rendered. Daring, quirky, personal, utterly unique, the film transcends and surpasses the works it pretends to send up. Anna Biller's new and original voice, and incredible artistry make this an unforgettable feature length debut. If you can look past the blue eye shadow and filmy vintage negligees, you may discern a genuine aesthetic master. An amazing technical achievement, like watching a feminine Guy Madden photographing herself for a vintage centerfold pictorial. Neither period exploitation nor modern commercial multiplex filler, this film will no doubt baffle many, possibly most casual viewers.
