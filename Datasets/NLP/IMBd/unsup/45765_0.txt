Watched this thriller Untraceable last night.Plot is like this in short.A total sicko killing people live on internet and each time the killer does it in different ways.If much people log in to the site the victim reach heaven quicker.Movie is not my cup of tea,i found it just plain boring.I barely watched the film to the end,felt like I all time did now what will happen.If you want to watch a movie with similar plot but better done go rent Italian director Dario Argentos Card Player(not masterpiece but a bit more inspiring film).On the + side is Diane Lane as agent Jennifer Marsh and let me think...hhm..sorry nothing more.Not a thriller for me and I do not recommend it.I give Untraceable only 2/10.
