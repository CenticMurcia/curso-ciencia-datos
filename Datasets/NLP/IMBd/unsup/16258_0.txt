Kate and Sayid are captured while trying to rescue Jack, but John Locke escapes and finds Ben Linus trapped on his bed. John asks Alex to bring Sayid's backpack with the explosives, and then he goes to the submarine to destroy it. Meanwhile John recalls how he became paraplegic.<br /><br />"The Man From Tallahassee" is a great episode centered in John Locke, disclosing how he ended in a wheelchair and his innermost fears and feelings. On the other side, the personality and Machiavellian character of Ben Linus reveal his unusual intelligence and power of manipulating people. Ben's attitude, strategies and actions recalled me the contents of the books "The Prince" and "Art of War", using the adverse situation to overcome and defeat his opponents. The last scene increases the mystery of the island and leaves us, fans of this magnificent series, anxiously expecting for the next episode. My vote is nine.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): Not Available
