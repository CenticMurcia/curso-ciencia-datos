this game is the worst of the command and conquer series<br /><br />they have removed certain featuers of the game that makes it command and conquer.<br /><br />there is no longer a toolbar, so in the result of that there is workers/buldozers.<br /><br />it has nothing to do with the tiberian series or the red alert series. I think the gameplay is awful, the graphics isn't good either, it looks to much of an animation rather than a realistic game. take my advice if you are a command and conquer fan, don't get this game.<br /><br />THe only good thing I could say about generals is that it is in 3D
