"TRIBBLES" is by far, the silliest, stupidest, un-Star Trek episode of any of them! I can't understand why so many people list this one as their favorite, it's a comedy ala Abbott & Costello, just plain DUMB! The dialog is lame, the acting pedestrian, and the story itself lends nothing at all to the credence of ST, but unfortunately, does giver to the stereotype the show's detractors will point to. The tribble problem aboard the ship is but a vehicle meant to get in the way of Kirk's job of putting out all the "little fires" engulfing them, the Attack by the Klingons, for one, and Nilz Barris continually, acting the self-important bureaucrat, getting in the way. There's nothing humorous or funny about it, it's boring, almost painful to watch, and keep in mind that this is Star Trek! BUT: There IS one saving scene that makes it memorable: The confrontation between Barris & Kirk, where Barris tells him "I don't think you take this mission seriously", and Kirk responds with "The mission I take seriously, it's YOU I take lightly, now get out of my way, or I'll have you locked up!" A good line, in a very bad episode! I can only think this one may have been done as a comedy relief, to break the seriousness of the series as a whole, but no, I won't give it credit even for that. It's just BAD!
