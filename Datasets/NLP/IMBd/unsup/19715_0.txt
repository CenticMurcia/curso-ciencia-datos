I really wanted to love this movie. It had a great cast and John Landis<br /><br />! But This is not a Landis movie, just some sub-par Tarantino-like<br /><br />story, lazily executed, where annoying nightmares takes up the role of<br /><br />the disjointed-time sequences you find in any Tarantino wanabee (And<br /><br />there are already too many of 'em). It seems that the cast and Landis<br /><br />were so happy to work together that they didn't care about the end<br /><br />product. Unfortunately, that's what we viewers have to endure. It's not<br /><br />THAt bad and the acting is really energetic, but it all seems wasted.<br /><br />Now, if Mr Joe Dante would just give us another of his zany, wonderful<br /><br />movies, I'd be a happy P
