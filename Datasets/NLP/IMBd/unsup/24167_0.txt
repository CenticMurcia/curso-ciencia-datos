Yesterday I bought this film on DVD, and I must say it a terrific family film.The acting is extraordinarily great, and the special effects are amazingly beautiful. The characters are very interesting. They will have you wanting to care for them. The water horse, itself, is extremely cute. There were times where characters would add some humor. However, what really drew me in was wondering what would happen next. The relationship between Angus and the water horse made me very curious.Over all it is a fantastic film for kids and adults alike. I give it two big thumbs up.So, if you have enough time go out and pick this movie up.I strongly encourage you to do so.Trust me, it is worth your time.
