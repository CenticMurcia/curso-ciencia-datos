I saw this film when I was 12 and it changed my life. I formed my first band the very next morning... I've just seen it for the second time. After 20 years of waiting to see it again it is every bit as great as I remember it. For me, this is absolutely the greatest punk movie of them all. Trini Alvarado's performance is staggeringly mature, and Tim Curry gives a career best turn as a rebel-rousing DJ. The music (Patti Smith, Ramones, if you love it it's probably here) is to die for, and Alan Moyle's direction paints an masterly picture of urban street life in the late 1970s (it's New York, but everyone will see echoes of their city in this film). However, it is Robin Johnson's performance that really hits home. This wonderful, moving, dark, witty movie belongs to her. No wonder it had such an effect on me. "Times Square" is a masterpiece!!! It'll brain your blows out...<br /><br />Thank you Alan Moyle, words can hardly express how I feel about this film!
