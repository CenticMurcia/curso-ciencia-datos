A friend and I made a horrible mistake once, we rented Mortal Kombat Annihilation. This movie is by far one of the worst pieces of crap ever to have been produced for the screen. I'd rather sit through an entire season of "Days of our lives" than even touching MKA again.<br /><br />The first movie was quite fun to watch. The action sequences and the special effects were OK for it's time, Christopher Lambert starred (that's right, I DO like Lambert!), and it had a killer soundtrack. Annihilation on the other hand is set place in the worst digitally made world possible, ALL the time! Lambert is replaced by some stupid looking guy who thinks he's cool but looks like my grandfather. The plot is, besides non-existing, stupid stupid and stupid, and the fighting scenes were already made in the first movie (except when the only two female characters of any significance fight in a pool of mud). On top of all this, the actors could easily be replaced by monkeys, no one would know.<br /><br />You can sum Mortal Kombat Annihilation up with only two letters: N O !
