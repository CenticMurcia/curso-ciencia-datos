For a great bunch of writers and actors, who gave us Spinal Tap and Best of Show they have "Jumped the Shark" with this film. It had no plot so I can't spoil it for you. I did fall asleep in the theater so maybe I missed the good part. However, a friend did awaken me to be tortured by the rest of the show. I have always noted that good acting will not make up for a bad story and so it is with this "script". And now I have to write more lines to fulfill the 10 line minimum. Ten lines is way too much to spend on this film, maybe if it had ten lines of plot, I wouldn't have to ramble on this way. Now I still do not have enough lines, so once again I have to pad this awful review with more words.
