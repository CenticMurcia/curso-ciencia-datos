Gina Chiarelli, as Grace McKinley, gives one of the most stunning performances you are likely to see. John Griffen, the critic from the Montreal Gazette, said that her performance was "the reason awards were invented". I wholeheartedly agree. It's an excellent film all around. Kudos to the first time director, Pete McCormack, and to the supporting cast. Although I understand the film was made on an extremely low budget, apparently around $100,000 Canadian, and was shot with a digital camera, it looks polished and well thought out. Even so, it all comes down to the script, which treats the terrible malady we call schizophrenia with an authenticity beyond what I have seen in other films ( I do include A Beautiful Mind in that assessment) and Gina Chiarelli's tour de force performance.
