I found this at a Newbury Comics in the used section for under $10. I regret spending this. The only thing this movie has going for it is the creepy music. Plot holes and random behavior in this movie destroy the film. For instance, Rebecca Simmons (that's Simmons, not Falls) is never mentioned throughout the rest of the film, nor is she even credited. Also the kill scenes are also very sub-par and not scary, and the acting and editing was horrendous and haphazard. Worst of all is that many questions are left unanswered. No wonder none of the actors never acted in many films after. The saving grace of this film is the Silver mask the Conscience Killer wears. The best thing this film is for is either a coaster or a cheesy movie night with a couple of friends.
