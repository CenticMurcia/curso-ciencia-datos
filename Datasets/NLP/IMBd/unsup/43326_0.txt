It is a shame that a generation will think that this is what an operatic tenor should sound like. Jussi Bjorling must be rolling over in his grave. Had he stayed within his vocal range, Bocelli could have been a good light tenor. Maybe he could sign Mozart well. But hearing him butcher Verdi and Pucccini is painful. I just hope that those who champion Bocelli will move on to current great tenors like Juan Diego Florez, Ramon Vargas, and Rolando Villazon.<br /><br />Bocelli's influence is even worse than his singing. I understand that he is not actually an opera singer, and that he brings a pop sensibility to classical music. I understand that he just wants to evoke the sound of opera for pop fans who would not otherwise care about classical singing. This would be fine, had his fans been so moved by his singing that they went on to explore the world of opera. Instead, sales of pop-classical-crossover like Il Divo have surged, and great artists like Villazon remain unappreciated. It's sad.
