Yikes. What a mess this is; it's a lot easier now to understand why this was unreleased on video for so many years. As someone who enjoyed "Head," I was willing to give this a shot, but there is way too much Brian Auger & Julie Driscoll, short shrift given to some rock and roll legends (Little Richard, Fats Domino, and Jerry Lee Lewis) and some awful Monkees music numbers (excepting a nice "Listen to the Band" at the end). Pointless and dull, this is for Monkee completists only.
