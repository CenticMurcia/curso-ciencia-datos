I got to see ? Movie at a special sneak preview not too long ago, and I was absolutely blown away about how funny, edgy and flat-out different this film is from anything I have ever seen before.<br /><br />The real-life scenes, which were "true" hidden camera shots, were amazing and brilliantly sculpted into the storyline of the film. Ironically, these scenes were not only unique, but seemed to actually validate the points that this controversial, in-your-face movie makes.<br /><br />For those of you who want to experience something completely one-of-a-kind, edgy, and down-right hilarious, I would recommend you buy, rent, go see, whatever, this film as soon as you get a chance.
