This is a passing of the torch in Hip Hop.. The so-called "King" of New York vs. The King of L.A.. U can tell that Game put a lot of energy into the making of this DVD, and is setting his mark in the Hip Hop world for being the one who destroyed G-Unit. With the flop of Yayo's album, the destruction of the little street credibility that 50 cent had left, and exposing Olivia and Lloyd Banks as being true homosexuals, this DVD is a perfect recipe for the ending of a super group! This reminds me of Ice Cube vs. NWA.. Anyways, the humor is on point, the facts are 90% authentic, and the exclusive scenes are very entertaining, this has to be my favorite Hip Hop DVD of this decade!! Highly recommended, 10/10..
