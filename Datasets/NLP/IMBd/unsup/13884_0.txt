Can anybody tell me what happened with Jody Ann Shaffell's case (or the true life story that this was based on anyway)? <br /><br />I think that the US should just grow up!! <br /><br />(No offense meant to the sane people living there).<br /><br />Children are raised in worse situations than that poor boy and the courts do nothing!! How about some compassion?!?! <br /><br />I'd like to know, for my own peace of mind, that the boy has found his way to his mother.<br /><br />Any feedback would be nice.<br /><br />I would like to think that these people came to their senses.
