I wish I could give this awful film a zero. It deserves it. Reading the box: it looked like an interesting and good movie. About 40 minutes into the movie I just couldn't take it anymore... skipping a few things, seeing all the gore. It is really a bad, bad, bad movie. I wish I could get the time and money I wasted on it back. There really are no words to describe just how much I disliked the movie. My boyfriend will sit through nearly anything... he gave up after 20 minutes. I'm jealous, I should have been smart enough to. I don't really know what else to say about the film. I'm into depressing drama, like the English patient, American beauty, even maria full of grace for crying out loud! Really, Enduring Love does nothing to keep a person interested. It's boring... boring... boring!!!
