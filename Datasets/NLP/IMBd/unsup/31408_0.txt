Aside from not having any plot, the dialogue was painful, and the characters were annoying. There was certainly no message contained in this movie, either. It seems as if Greg Araki couldn't come up with an entire movie, but had a "great idea" for about 3 scenes worth of material, and just repeated them for 2 hours. That recurring 666 gag was great, too. This movie isn't even worth renting as a laugh. There aren't any redeeming qualities about this movie to make it worth tolerating. Avoid this movie at all costs, you'll just end up turning it off halfway through. I know I wanted to.
