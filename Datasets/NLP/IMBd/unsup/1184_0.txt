This movie is from Roger Cormen(night of the living dead) only this time he is executive producer!!The plot of what there is of one, is aliens kidnapp several humans including Adam Baldwin(Wyatt Earp) . The humans meet some people on board a spaceship. They are in reality aliens disguised as humans. The aliesn leader is played by Robert Englund(Wishmaster,Urban Legend,Nightmare on Elm Street 1-8). Even though it rated "R" it has a pleanty of nudity almost make a "NC-17". The set are pathetic, the acting very wooden and it moves too slowly!!This movie is almost as bad as "Supernova" , but at least the public was spared seeing this lame B grade movie from the big screen!!
