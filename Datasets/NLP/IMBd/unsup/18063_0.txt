Dumb and Dumber is the Farrelly Brothers and Jim Carrey at their best. Even the new 'Me, Myself, and Irene' doesn't even come close to generating as many on-the-floor-laughings as I experienced with Dumb and Dumber. I think the main reason is because since the main characters acted so stupid yet nice, you could kind of relate with them and feel closer to them, which means more laughs. I am awaiting a funnier movie from Jim Carrey or the Farrelly Brothers. But maybe, this movie was one of those flukes where everything just worked perfectly and it will never happen again, let's hope not.
