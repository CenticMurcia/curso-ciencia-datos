An elder Native-American man recounts his life for the young ones.<br /><br />Slow-moving and somewhat tedious drama-adventure film that seems to take forever to tell its story. After the first half-hour, you'll be looking at the clock, fidgeting on the couch, and wondering if there's anything good in the refrigerator.<br /><br />Trevor Howard plays the old chief ready to move on to the next life, but the Great Creator seems to have other plans for him before that event takes place. Movie has an attractive cast and the many subtitles are not too much of a hindrance in continuity, but the pacing is that of a snail which makes the 104-minute running time seem a lot longer.<br /><br />Film tries too hard to be 'beautiful', slowing things down even more.
