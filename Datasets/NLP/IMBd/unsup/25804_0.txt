I'm one of those who actually liked this film and after reading the reviews here I'm glad most rated this film above average. Some say the characters are stupid and they will frustrate you but I don't remember this, all I remember is that it was a pretty suspenseful "what if the russians nuke the us" film. Compare it to "Deep Impact" without the effects but better. I hope it gets released on DVD soon. I love the ending.
