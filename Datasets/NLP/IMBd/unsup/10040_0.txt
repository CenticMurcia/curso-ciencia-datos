It looks like this movie has had quite mixed reviews, but personally<br /><br />I love it! It's outrageous, irreverent and absolutely hilarious. The<br /><br />special effects are amazing and the gags just keep coming.<br /><br />There are so many witty lines that it's hard to remember them all.<br /><br />One of my favourites is when Bruce Willis and Goldie Hawn plan<br /><br />to murder Meryl Streep (who plays Willis' wife). They concoct an<br /><br />elaborate plot to push her car off Mulholland Drive, but Willis ends<br /><br />up pushing her down the stairs instead. After the deed is done he<br /><br />phones Goldie Hawn and breathlessly exclaims, "Helen? I did it!<br /><br />She's dead, she started shouting at me and I couldn't take it any<br /><br />more and I pushed her down the stairs and she's dead!" There is<br /><br />a long pause on the other end of the phone, then Hawn slowly<br /><br />asks , ". . . which part of the plan didn't you understand?".<br /><br />Meanwhile, Streep is not dead, but is slowly standing up at the foot<br /><br />of the stairs with her head on backwards!<br /><br />Isabella Rosselini is good as the mysterious Lisle von Rhuman<br /><br />and, at times, looks and sounds uncannily like her mother, Ingrid<br /><br />Bergman. The film is not everyone's cup of tea, I know, but it's a scream!
