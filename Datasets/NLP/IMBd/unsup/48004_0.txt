Just hated this movie, I'm not sure why I watched til the end, probably because my 12 year old wanted to. I thought the little girls acting was just horrible. Like when crying about a Christmas tree and then the cop wannabe STEALS one! The guy treats the pair (lady and daughter) like stealing wallets is no big deal. I didn't see any chemistry between Mark and Mary. What store manager is going to let some security guard take them home to babysit them? Just so crazy and we really like watching Christmas movies. Surviving Christmas was a good one. As for the movie again, he quits his job, doesn't have another but wants to make it as a singer, just a totally stupid movie.
