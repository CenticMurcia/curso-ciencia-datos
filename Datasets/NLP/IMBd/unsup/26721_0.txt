This is a visually alive romantic and mysterious ski film that you might want to watch twice to really get all the sub stories and relationship nuance. The film was shot in High Definition and looks like you could step right into it with your skis. I was interested in the eclectic music in the film and discovered after listening to the commentary that the music was composed by Doug Robinson and individual songs were written by the writer/directors as well as the lead actor who played the role of Easy. Easy is portrayed by musician composer Mark Collie and he is "Easy". He is so natural in the role that I am looking forward to seeing him in more films. The story portrays a gathering of a group of skiers who all end up in the same lodge. The lead character Kat, begins to have flashes of an unclear past that seems to come to the foreground as her fog lifts. They are all involved in a sudden event that is life changing for them all. Here is where it is important to view the alternate ending and take a look at a most unusual look into the transition that these characters go through. There is animation in the alternate ending in which the characters piece together all the unanswered questions that they have had and find themselves in a wonderfully colorful mystic place where all their quests are put into perspective. This film viewed in it's fullest with the alternate ending could gain a cult following of people looking to explore the vale of what lies beyond. It's fun, great music, attractive cast.
