This is possibly the worst movie since Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton graced the screen in "The Sandpiper." What a mess! It has a politically correct roundup masquerading as Passover celebrants. You have your lesbian and her Afro-American lover; you have your Hasid; you have your flighty mother; you have your wayward daughter; you have your handicapped child; you have your Holocaust survivor; and you have your bellowing businessman...You get the idea.<br /><br />Jack Klugman is the best thing in this movie but even he can't elevate the maudlin, pointless, 'stoopid' script. Funny to see Klugman in this piece of crap because I recall him in "Goodbye Columbus," the movie version of Philip Roth's novel, in which Klugman played father to a luminous Ali McGraw. That movie made me uncomfortable, because it rang true. This is anything but true. "When Do We Eat" just made me cringe with embarrassment.<br /><br />The worst thing about this movie is that the filmmakers (and I use that term very loosely in this case) actually go "art-y" at various times; attempting to equate 40 years in the desert and the Passover saga with the journey of these execrable people. They should live so long!
