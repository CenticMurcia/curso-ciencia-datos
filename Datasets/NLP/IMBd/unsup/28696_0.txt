I have to say that after watching this movie the first time, I totally enjoyed it. Second viewing was somewhat bored but still liked it. By the third viewing, I noticed it was too long, some scenes were boring and pointless and I"m sick of the male lead being 30 years older than the female lead. Nonetheless:good acting, good dialouge(for the most part), good direction, but after repeat viewing the movie doesnt hold its strength.
