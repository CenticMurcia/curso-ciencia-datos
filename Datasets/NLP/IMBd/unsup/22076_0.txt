Fellini's SATYRICON is one of the true art-movies of the late 60ties European cinema, it's extravagance of color, religious undertones, philosophical questioning and eroticism is captivating. Fellini takes us on a bawdy odyssey of episodic nature where Encolpio (Martin Potter) in center, together with Ascilto (Hiram Keller), faces the incredible but impossible, world of ancient Rome; the sultry society of Romans who lives luxurious lives in self-indulgence where the nature of moral traditions is constantly pushed to the limit. Both handsome youths Encolpio and Ascilto battles for the sexual pleasures of a mysterious slave boy (Max Born) who unites and divides them as both enters bewildering adventures of often homosexual significance. The film jumps back and forth in time, and jags its narration with no sorts of explanation, the viewer just has to go along for the ride without never really understanding the plot - Fellini throws a fascinating travelogue who structurally follows the actual work of Petronius.<br /><br />Grotesquely painted, the film doesn't punctuated the everyday life of citizens of the Roman empire as Petronius' actual script, Fellini mainly makes it come to life by its visual opulence and outrageous connotations. I personally love Fellini's absurdity and artful touch, and though this is often viewed as a mostly problematic film, I always find it quite unique and influential for the many following film directors of world cinema.
