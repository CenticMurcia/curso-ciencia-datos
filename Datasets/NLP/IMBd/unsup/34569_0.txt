I bought this film from a local pound shop so I cant say I'm surprised at how bad it was,but I have had some enjoyment out of this film. But it has to be the most stupidly bad comedy film ever made, while watching the film you cant help but think that if the story was put in the right hands it probably would have been a good movie (with Jim Carrey in the lead and maybe David Zucker directing) but it is one of those films that is so dumb SO badly acted and directed that you actually cant help but laugh all the way through it, so does this make it a good comedy because its funny for all the wrong reasons?, NO! its absolute crap. You can definitely see why raimi took his name off the film.
