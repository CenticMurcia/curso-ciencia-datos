Well I don't know how to put it exactly, I had a very high expectation on this movie before it came out, mostly because all those excellent ones made by Chen Kaige before. To be frankly, I used to think that he was the no.1 guy in Chinese film production, I can still recall those tear-shedding moments that he gave me through his unique and humane perspectives and works. Nevertheless, I do not know exactly what went wrong with him this time, it turns out this movie is such a joke, there is hardly any fresh ideas, floppy plot, childish lines and totally irrelated actings, not mention the lame KungFu action part and hillbilly costumes...all in all it is more than just a big disappointment, and the last thing you wanna see is the whole Chinese film industry would follow his footsteps backwards. Although as a Chinese it has been very hard for me to criticize Chinese movies, I can not hold what I truly wanna say it is a big failure and setback!
