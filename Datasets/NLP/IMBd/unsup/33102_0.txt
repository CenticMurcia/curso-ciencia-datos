Aside from a couple of low budget genre films, this has to be about the worst movie I have ever seen. Here is the breakdown:<br /><br />Directing = F Prince does not know what to do with a camera. Possibly George Lucas might have been able to do a worse job directing this.<br /><br />Cinematography= B There are a number of sweet shots in this film.<br /><br />Costumes = A I want to own every outfit I saw Prince wearing this film!<br /><br />Script = F Dumb, dumb dumb. Wrecka Stow? I wouldn't have laughed at that when i was in grade school (and yes, I get it. Who could not get it?). I am just absolutely baffled by that scene. The rest is not much better. The script kills the film's ability to be funny, and its ability to draw you into the romance. <br /><br />Chemistry = B & F Prince and his sidekick have a chemistry that really works well. Given funny material, they could have really made some movie magic. A bad script pretty much sinks them, however. The chemistry between Prince and the women in the movie is nearly non-existent. The phone conversation scene was good, but that is just about it. Other than that, the romantic connection seemed awkward and forced. so B for Prince's chemistry with the male co-star, and an F for his chemistry with the 2 females.<br /><br />Acting = B Not bad acting really. All the main characters (except the older woman prince wants for her money at the beginning) do a good job. <br /><br />conclusion: Atrocious script and terrible directing sink this flick. Good acting, chemistry, and soundtrack cannot save it.
