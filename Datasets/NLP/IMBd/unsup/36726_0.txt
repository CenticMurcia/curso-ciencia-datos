Why does it seem like the Hellraiser films are slowly becoming morality tales? I am starting to think that. Inferno was mostly morality and i could deal with it because it was something different but in hellseeker, we have "Lets make a deal" Kirsty and a cheating spouse and also a tale of greed. Cmon now. This movie basically said in only a few words, if you cheat or your greedy you will go to hell. To top it off, not enough of Pinhead. Ugh. Definitley wouldn't suggest this.
