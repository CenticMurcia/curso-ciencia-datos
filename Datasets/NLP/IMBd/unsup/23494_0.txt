When I heard that the Sci-Fi Channel was doing a Lake Placid 2 with John Schneider, I was looking forward to it.<br /><br />But after 20 minutes, I couldn't believe how bad it was.<br /><br />The acting is the worst acting I have ever seen/heard. It sounds like this movie was shot in a foreign country and dubbed in English. Except that all of these actors are Americans who speak English and this was filmed for Television, which means they didn't have to dub the bad language.<br /><br />I actually enjoy many of Sci-Fi's B movies. But this is one of the worst I've ever seen. The special effects are awful, which is surprising since I've seen Sci-Fi do better with other movies.<br /><br />I'd recommend watching the original Lake Placid instead of wasting the two hours watching this sequel. You will certainly enjoy it more.
