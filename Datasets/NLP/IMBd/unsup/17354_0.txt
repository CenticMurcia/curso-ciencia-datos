Sea of love is the film that crawls under your skin and stays there. It's simple but distorted love story is the centerpiece of a synopsis that tries to show how desperate and dangerous can loneliness be. Al Pacino as Frank Keller is in one of his best performances there, and his character is a middle-aged man caught between a broken marriage and a dangerous job that leaves a little time for personal life. Ellen Barkin is perfect in her role and she and Al Pacino light up the screen in several ways. John Goodman is fantastic and his performance helps a great deal, to the solid, good acted and plausible life story. That's why it deserves 9 out of 10 any day, and especially on hot summer nights.
