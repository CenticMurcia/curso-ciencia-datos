The magnetic field of Earth stopped from working! This horrible scenario faces us in this thriller. Okay, it sounds a little awkward, but hey, maybe we get a well-enough crafted explanation to make it feel believable for the sake of entertainment. Alas, we don't. This movie was a huge waste of money. The writing is so horrible, i was cursing myself for not having any beer left to ease the pain. The characters were obnoxiously superficial and clich√©-loaded, i could perfectly understand the actors to not be interested in bringing their characters to life.<br /><br />But nothing can beat these ridiculous ideas! Stupid actions of the protagonists take turns with the movie presenting hilarious effects of mother earth going bonkers (mostly by ignoring all laws of physics). I don't expect everything in a movie to be completely correct, after all it is entertainment, but at least once in a while something should work in theory in the real world! Research...!! Is that really too much to ask?! Oh, and the writer sees Europeans only as making nice victims in movies. At least this time it is not again the Eiffel Tower, that explodes. But again, when Mr. Scientist explains what is going on in the first part of the movie, he makes it really, really easy (not to say primitive) to understand the basic physics behind the idea of the film. And if the target audience doesn't come from Europe, who is this kinder-garden-lecture aimed for then...? But whom am i to assume... At least now i know we live on a peach which will be burned by a flamethrower.<br /><br />In short: Spare yourself or expect major rubbish.
