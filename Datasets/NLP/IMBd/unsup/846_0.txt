Warning to guys - you will probably hate this movie. But I think most women, judging from the user comments, will love it. This is a quintessential chick flick. It shouldn't be taken too seriously as it is a fantasy piece. You will have to suspend your sense of reality to enjoy this. But that's the point.<br /><br />At the heart of this story is the idea that we all have one true love we are destined to be with. Call it Fate, Destiny, or even God-ordained - but it's the notion that forces will conspire to put us in touch with our one and only soul-mate.<br /><br />This movie reminds me of another one of my favorite contemporary movies, Serendipity(2001), in the sense of being destined to find our soul-mate (although it is not a fantasy piece). I think guys probably find the fantasy, imaginary friend notion of IHTBY a little too corny for their tastes. But if you like a good, cheesy romance story, then you should like this picture.<br /><br />I've notice several reviewers criticize Rogers for her little girl, squeaky voice. But I think in this role, it enhances the story. If you look at it from the idea that she is like a little girl who has never really grown up - but is somewhat frozen in time to back when she was 6 years old, when she first meets her "soul-mate". I know this is a stretch, but that is how I interpreted it and it worked for me.<br /><br />I love the sets and costumes in this movie. It makes for a visual feast. Rogers' gowns are unbelievably gorgeous, especially the wedding gown at the very end. But even her dressing gowns were quite elaborate, adding to the notion of just how wealthy her family is. I find it hard to believe women actually wore these - they look incredibly uncomfortable! If the beautiful mansion set with the incredible staircase looks familiar, you may recognize it from Holiday (1938), the George Cukor film starring Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant. That staircase is just amazing - the most beautiful I have ever seen.<br /><br />There is one thing I did find hard to swallow, and I didn't notice it until Rogers and Wilde are in the car and he finally decides to marry her. How did he not notice the huge, honking diamond engagement ring on her finger and not know she was already engaged? Also, look closely at Wilde's left ring finger in this scene as well. He looks like he is wearing a ring on that finger that is being disguised so as to not be noticeable. What is that about?
