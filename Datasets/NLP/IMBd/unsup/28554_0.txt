The great Enzo G. Castellari made (in 1977) a war movie in the style of The Dirty Dozen or The Longest Day. Of course, Castellari had to add his usual tons of slapdash violence and action. This is the kind of war movie they stopped making after Vietnam, so it really has a distinct nostalgic feeling to it. QUEL MALEDETTO TRENO BLINDATO makes war out to seem really fun and exiting, contrary to other war flicks of that period such as THE DEER HUNTER or APOCALYPSE NOW. Instead, it is a harmless, exciting, even ludicrous action film. I challenge anyone to count the number of deaths in this film and send me a rough estimate! The cast was great, the acting pretty good, the action scenes well done (as usual for my man Enzo), and the music was appropriately nostalgic as well. The only thing this film doesn't have working for it, is the fact that many scenes featured the same actors dying over and over again. I found it kinda funny but some of you critics out there might just find it cheesy.
