When I first saw this movie, I was around 9 or 10 years old. This is William Castle's first "official" horror movie. There are no monsters in it and no killers, at least no "graphic" killings, but for some reason, this has always been one of my favorite William Castle movies. I remember watching it real late at night. I think the intro and the end credits were somehow "scary" to me. At the end, as the credits are rolling, there is a cartoon of a "macabre" parade walking by. I still remember that to this day. One of the cartoon characters is carrying his own head. I'm 50 years old now and it's funny how a person can remember insignificant stuff like that over the years. I sure wish this movie would be released on DVD. I would love to see it in crystal clarity like the other William Castle movies that have been released on DVD.
