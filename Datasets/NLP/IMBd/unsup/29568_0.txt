First, I'd like to mention this in defence of the movie. I found the whole science-fiction idea of blue-blooded aliens interesting but the movie was let down by it's poor execution. It could've been much much much much better than this.<br /><br />Scriptwriting is horribly bad, and the fact that Western actors hired to represent government officials does not even help the movie a single bit. This movie flops like a fish out of the water despite its star-studded cast. If you would like to watch a quality flick that has a quirky storyline, I'd recommend the paranormal thriller Double Vision which was released in the same year.<br /><br />I'd still recommend this movie for its train wreck factor, just don't put your hopes up high before you watch it. The humour in the movie can be painful to listen, and the sci-fi effects hardly raised an eyebrow. Although one exception was the very short battle scene involving some alien monsters. I was hoping to see more of that.<br /><br />In short, there's no need for me to berate over the fact that The Wesley's Mysterious File (sic) is a lousy sci-fi movie. I'm still left scratching my head wondering why was there such a huge typo in the English movie title.
