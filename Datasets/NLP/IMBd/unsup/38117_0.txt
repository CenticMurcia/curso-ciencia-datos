This movie is so bad its almost funny. I don't regret watching this movie, in fact, where it not for the nudity and language, it would be worthy of MST3K. There are a couple paradoxes that make it slightly amusing. Although, the majority is total trash, sometimes so bad you can shove a pencil into you're ear canal just to stop the pain. It bordered on annoying as there where recurrent stupid things like the whole susceptibility to being, "ensnared within the agile grasp" of the zombies after being tapped. And script writing is seemingly nonexistent, did the director just give up half way through the movie? And the Derick character is the most annoying thing since "The Jersey Shore" <br /><br />STAY AWAY FROM THIS MOVIE!!!
