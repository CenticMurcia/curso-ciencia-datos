STAY AWAY FROM THIS FILM!!! I bought this film for a very very very cheap price in the hope that it would be funny. It is not. It is not remotely funny or even remotely watchable. It is actually torture to sit through. There is no redeeming feature about the film whatsoever. The trailer is the only good thing on the DVD but even that's in the wrong place. It plays before the films as opposed to when you select 'trailer' on the menu. There is next to no dialogue in this film, no sex and rarely any decent violence. The special effects are dismal but sometimes slightly amusing and at the same time confusing. Like is the man with the rubber face actually deformed or is it a mask? The ending is the final insult. Do not buy or watch or rent this film. Ever! Period.<br /><br />Get Nightmare at Noon instead. Or Omega Cop. Or Eastenders......
