In this day of fake movies, films dripping with 'Hollywood sauce', violence, etc., I found this film to be quite refreshing. Creators of heart-felt films tend to make them extra-sappy, which also seems to defeat the purpose (at least for me). This movie avoided all these 'traditional' pitfalls. "The Last Dance" felt real to me...not far-fetched. It was simple and to the point. It reflected on things that really mean something on this planet; there was no wasting time on silliness. To top it off, the ending had a nice metaphysical touch (always scoring big points with me). Yes, you really can see good films without having to pay for cable TV. They may not come around all that often, yet the occasional meaningful movie will stick with you. Sometimes less is more.
