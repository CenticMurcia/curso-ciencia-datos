The movie has almost nothing in common with Jules Verne's novel. For example, for some strange reason the script writer depicted Pencroff as a foolish b***ard. Also leaving behind a wounded Blake (Tom Mison) destroys the spirit of Verne's novel. A lot of charming details from the novel lost in the movie, being replaced with giant bugs and other crap. Actor's play is very bad including Patrick Stewart. His character (Captain Nemo) looks absolutely unconvincing and pitiful. Looks like this time Patrick only wished to visit Thailand and he was not really interested in quality. Maybe, he could do it in a cheaper way - just purchase a tour. So the viewers would not be mislead by his name in the cast.
