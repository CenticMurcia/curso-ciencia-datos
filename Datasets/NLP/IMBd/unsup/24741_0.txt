When I went to the première of Carandiru, last movie of Hector Babenco (see "Pixote"), I have got great expectations. I have read the Drausio Varella's book "Estação Carandiru" (Carandiru Station) and, of course, I knew the ado caused by the real event portrayed in book and movie. Carandiru is the biggest penitentiary in South America, a complex with more than 7,000 inmates. Friday, October 2nd, 1992 was a dog day in the cells. In a facility known as "Pavilhão 9" took place a manslaughter where 111 cons lost their lives. Very close to a documentary, this movie shows what we desperately try to hide, the problem of torture and violence which stains our penal system.
