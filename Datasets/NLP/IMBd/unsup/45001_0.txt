This time around high school angst hands us a lad whose additional teen burden is indeed a heavy one, severe stuttering. So, of course a school yummy convinces him that he's a PERFECT candidate to join the school's debating team. Rip off on another film I viewed about an illiterate teen who entered the national spelling bee. But that's another story.<br /><br />It has been said the film departs, does not thereafter go where one expects. My take finds it a sadly predictable film that proceeded to take me on a lack luster, unwelcome and irritating journey. Acting? Yes, fine, so fine I found myself screaming at the screen in vain attempts to help our hero render to verbal completion.<br /><br />Yes, our hero yearns for love and strives gallantly to find it. While many see it quite differently I saw it as: Strive, crash and burn, strive, crash and burn, strive, crash....HI DAD...THE END...(the antidote: I'm off to see Juno again).
