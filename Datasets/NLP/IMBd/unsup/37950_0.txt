This isn't great film-making, but when you're a horror fan, you can take anything and usually find the good in it. The concept and the overall presentation though, is entertaining. The 'good guys' are really stupid at times. Their plane is giving them trouble when on a trip so they land it near an island. They just barge into an obviously occupied home on an island to ask for help but when they see no ones home they play a record and start dancing around like losers. Thankfully there are some people we can pull for, and that's the family who live in the house. It's lacking somewhat in the gore department but there are some kills that are a laugh riot. Especially one that takes place on a swing. It's really a lot of fun to see 50 year-olds act like little children. I really did laugh my head off at times. So drop that pitch fork, put down the Bible for a bit and go out and rent this piece of 80's schlock.
