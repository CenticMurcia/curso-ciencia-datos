One of the best British mini-series ever. I've been trying to buy this series on VHS or DVD for the longest time. It's not available. I'm hoping someone from the BBC will read this and get the ball rolling. The Glittering Prizes is not to be missed. Tom Conti is terrific, but then again, so is the entire cast. It's a wonderful ensemble piece. The screenplay was written by the incredibly witty Frederic Raphael, who adapted it from his novel. Raphael is known for "Darling" and a few other British films from the 60s and 70s. He also wrote most of "Eyes Wide Shut" before Kubrick re-wrote sections of it. The most recent film I've seen written by Raphael is "Coast To Coast" directed by Paul Mazursky and starring Judy Davis and Richard Dreyfuss. "Coast To Coast" was not released in theaters, only on cable. It's available on DVD and is very funny. The Glittering Prizes deserves its chance on DVD, too.
