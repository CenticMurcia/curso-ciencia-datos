I really enjoyed the first Mortal Kombat movie, I like action flicks that aspire to be more. This movie does not fit that bill. There are a legion of things wrong with this movie, beginning with the death of Johnny Cage, and going downhill from there. Women wrestling other women in mud. Terrible film. I felt like I wasted more money on this movie than any I've ever seen before.
