This film merges the embarrassed meeting the in-laws thread of comedy with the black vs white culture shock school of thought, and does a decent job of blending them.<br /><br />There are a lot of laughs together with a subtext about colour not mattering, while at the same time trading on those differences, thus enabling the film to have its cake and eat it.<br /><br />It's not a classic film and never will be, but the principals all do very well in delivering characters who are believable and convey touchingly the emotional consequences of some of the problems which occur.<br /><br />Well worth watching.
