I am not known as a big reader and I never thought that I am able to finish a 1200 page long tome. But Steven King's "It" handcuffed me and after two weeks I completed the book. The most important thing in a book are the characters; I loved the characters, the story was frightening and it was consequential for me that I have to see the movie.<br /><br />The film-version of King's "It" was exactly the opposite of the book. A total disappointment. The performance of the actors (adults as well as the kids) was poor and there was no scene which attracted my attention. I totally missed suspense, tension and horror. Tim Currry as "Pennywise the Dancing Clown" was OK but the rest of the cast was just bad. <br /><br />Sure it is a TV- production and no big cinema but anyways this film is no dishonorable representative for the book. I had to laugh when i saw the rating: 6.5! .. I mean what the hell is wrong with you guys?
