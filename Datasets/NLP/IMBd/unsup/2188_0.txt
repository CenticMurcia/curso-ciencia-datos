When I read the title and saw the cover of the video box for this horror film I did not expect a sophisticated shocker. After taking the movie home I was however pleasantly surprised by it's humor and cheesy camp-factor. Those elements, along with the schlocky gore made the film entertaining. A family reunion hosted by two elderly, maiden sisters turns into a blood-fest. The hostesses are possessed by demons unleashed on them by an evil, vindictive and absent relative who sent them the evil spirits in the guise of a birthday gift. Upon opening their unassuming present at the dinner table in the company of their guests (family, friends and associates), the spinsters are transformed into flesh-eating fiends. Here's where the movie takes off and takes off it does! After the first victim is killed while seated at the table the rest of the guests flee for their lives in a spontaneous and morbid game of hide-and-seek. They scatter in all directions hiding from the blood-thirsty matrons while searching for escape from the locked-down manor they're trapped in. Here is where the film provides suspense as we feel the victims' claustrophobic tension. The deaths, which are grisly and at times humorous are still effective. While the plot is predictable the film does hold some surprises. For example the movie contains some typical characters found in horror films but the twist is the fact that some of these "typical" characters who are usually spared in most horror films (simply for moral reasons) are killed here. If you're a fan of the horror genre you will appreciate this mixture of (unintentional?)humor, gore and scares.
