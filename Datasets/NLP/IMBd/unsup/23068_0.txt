Saw Sleepy Time Gal last night at the Cleveland Film Festival.<br /><br />In short, I found the film very powerful and surprisingly well done. Jacqueline Bisset is just wonderful.<br /><br />Although a bit predictable in places, the plot has a few twists...definitely not a big studio release.<br /><br />I cannot understand why this film isn't in wider distribution.<br /><br />Although the movie has nothing in common with the Oscar-nominated "You Can Count On Me" other than the fact that both movies are small, intimate portraits of families, I have to say that Sleepy Time Gal is a much more nuanced, ambitious film with a lot more depth than YCCOM.<br /><br />I'm very sorry more filmgoers won't get a chance to see Sleepy Time Gal.
