Please stay away from this piece of garbage. It is likely to induce drowsiness and should only be watched by those without a sense of humour, looking to waste 1hr 36 mins of their lives or anyone else who enjoys totally uncreative and mind numbingly boring garbage. It is rather unfortunate that anyone with a camera, free time on their hands and spare change in their wallet can make movies these days. This movie could very likely have been ripped off a failing fourth graders essay paper.Trust me, it was that bad and I am being as polite and considerate as I possibly can. My rating: 1.25 (Mostly for the costume :-) )
