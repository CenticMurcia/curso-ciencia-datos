Malibu's Most Wanted stars Jamie Kennedy as Bradley "B-Rad" Gluckman, prominently featured in his hidden camera show on the WB. B-Rad is a Jewish-American living the high life in Malibu, yet him and his white friends all act black and embrace hip-hop culture. B- Rad's unwanted rap performances causes problems for his father's governor campaign, so the campaign team hires two black actors to stage a kidnapping on B-Rad and attempt to "scare him black" by taking him through the SoCal hood.<br /><br />Kennedy performs his role very well and makes a hilarious character (He could use more work like this, not crap such as Son of the Mask), reflecting the "white suburban adolescent hiphop fan" demographic of America to a T. Anderson and Diggs play PJ and Sean, the two black Julliard actors that learn how to be "hood" in order to make their scam on B-Rad authentic. Joining them is Shandra (Hall) who actually lives in Compton (I think, w/e, some LA hood), who lets them stay in her house for the weekend.<br /><br />One of the funniest things in the film is the stark contrast between B-Rad and Sean & PJ, as B-Rad thinks he's black despite being white, whereas Sean and PJ are black but act very "white", i.e. proper grammar, nice clothes, expensive schooling, etc. Watching Sean and PJ perfect their gangsta personas is quite funny.<br /><br />I won't go any deeper into the characters and their actors, I will say that they all did a good job though. One thing that bothered me though was why Shandra got with B-Rad, it makes hardly any sense...it was bad romance on the writer's part. Other than that it flows decently plot-wise. This isn't a drama though, it's a comedy, so humor is where it matters. This movie was very funny, I was laughing out loud the entire first half. It's got a bunch of great scenes, and one-liners ("Heads or tails?" "Tizizails! .......I want tails, please.") I didn't feel the second half was too strong, as they spent too much time trying to wrap the plot up, not enough time on humor, but all in all it was still pretty funny. The only thing I thought was really stupid was the talking rat? What the hey? Were they just trying to get a part for Snoop Dogg to play?<br /><br />All in all, it's worth watching, and I'd watch it again. To appreciate the humor, one has to be familiar with white kids posing as blacks and some hip-hop culture, which might account for some of the lower ratings I've seen on here.
