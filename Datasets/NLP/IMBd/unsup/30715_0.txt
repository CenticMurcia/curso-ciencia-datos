It makes me laugh to think of people who are used to watching normal Hollywood style movies renting this movie with popcorn at hand, ready to see a movie about a Vietnam vet! If you're not used to seeing gritty, no budget 16mm depraved amateur student film sickness disguised as a movie then you shouldn't watch it. If you're a fan of low budget horror films with a very sick ending then you should definitely watch it. Personally I like this rare and sick film...maybe I need to go see my doctor...
