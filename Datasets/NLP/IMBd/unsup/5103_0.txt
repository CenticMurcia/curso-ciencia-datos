Manmohan Desai was known for larger then life entertaining and illogical films AAA is one of them <br /><br />The film marked one of Bachchan- MD most famous films and also a blockbuster<br /><br />The plot is the similar long lost brothers theme but it's well handled and entertaining<br /><br />The plot is revealed in the initial 20 mins itself which is damn serious but then the film gets funny and entertaining Amitabh's character is one of the best parts, Anthony Gonsalves became a big rage and is remembered even today The scenes between Amitabh- Vinod, the fight and the jail scenes are well handled(in PARVARISH surprisingly both played opposite roles of cop and thief) though the long lost theme isn't taken much further like other films(meaning the searching of the siblings.etc) but the film is more on entertainment then story<br /><br />The film then focuses on love stories between Amitabh- Parveen, Rishi- Neetu.etc There are several entertaining scenes like Bachchan carrying Mukri to the hospital, Amitabh's long drunken monologue, Amitabh- Pran scene and many more There are too many songs though, like after the famous MY NAME IS ANTHONY GONSALVES in few minutes there is HUMKO TUMSE HO GAYA and PYAAR KE DUSHMAN <br /><br />The film ends too in a slapstick manner with the disguises which also got famous and the long fight scene<br /><br />Direction by MD is fabulous Music is good too<br /><br />Amongst actors Though an esemble cast Amitabh towers above all and no doubt his character of Anthony became a rage and won him best actor award too He excelled in his character which is completely different from what Bachchan did mostly Vinod Khanna plays the cop role with elan and his last funny act is hilarious Rishi is a natural in his role and he is at his best towards the end Amongst the girls Neetu is alright, Shabana irritates, Parveen is very good Pran excels, Jeevan is as usual Hercules is okay
