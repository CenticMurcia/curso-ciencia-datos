A must see for all Americans! This film must be brought to America's theaters as soon as possible. If we don't learn from our mistakes in the past we are bound to repeat them. This movie has today's stars playing the "true" characters of November 1963. If this film doesn't make you mad, check your pulse because you are not alive. I am asking the producers to please find a way to get this gem in front of men and women, boys and girls, the young and the not so young. The Commission message to me is not pro conspiracy per si. The message to me is the Warren Commission failed in almost all ways to investigate the murder of President Kennedy. As a result of this film and this film alone the viewer can follow the lack of investigation and now demand that any and all Kennedy related material be opened NOW.
