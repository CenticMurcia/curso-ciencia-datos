I saw this when it first came out and it had everything going for it. Action, Comedy, a neat Sci-Fi premise,a great script and cast but it did horrible at the Box Office. Other than marketing, I have no idea why this never found it's audience and its a shame because it would have been nice to see a sequel that it was set up for at the end. It's kinda sad now that Dennis Quaid and Meg Ryan have broken up because their paring made it all the more special. If you haven't seen this one, check it out.<br /><br />Why is this not on DVD??????
