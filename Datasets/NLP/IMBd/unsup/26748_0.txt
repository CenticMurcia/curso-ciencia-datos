I have seen this film but it was many years ago, when myself and a friend used to rent videos from the local store and there were certain ones we would rent again and again.<br /><br />This film (Along with "Trick or Treat" & "Killer Clowns from Outer Space") was one of the few that we could watch umpteen times without getting sick of it.<br /><br />It may have been the "implied" vampirism, as we were big horror fans, or just that at the time we were into war films ("Platoon", "Jacob's Ladder", "Full Metal Jacket", that sort of thing)<br /><br />I have been wondering if I could get a copy of it from somewhere. I loved it, and would love to know if it has ever been released on DVD.<br /><br />Would anyone with information about it being released on DVD please contact me. Thanks.
