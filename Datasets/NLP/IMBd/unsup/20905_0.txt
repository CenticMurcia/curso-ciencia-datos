Let me just say one thing, before I comment on this film: Jack Nicholson is a star. I've heard bad things about his personality, lifestyle, bla bla bla, but, the fact of the matter is (no matter what kind of selfish bean he may be) he is a remarkably good actor. The way he can put so much life into his character, how he can make you believe this was an actual event, is amazing. He made the terrible "About Schmidt" a watchable (barely) film. And in his earlier effort, "Anger Managemenet", he plays the most annoying man ever to be put on screen (including that utterly stupid Gilligan) but, this time (thankfully!) to a brain-bustingly hilarious effect. <br /><br />Dave Buznick is played by Adam Sandler, a calm, relaxed, cool man (despite his "troublesome" childhood) who is, after a roll-on-aisles hilarious scene, given "Anger Managemnt" therapy for 20 hours, with none other than "the" Buddy Rydell. It turns out this two had a past meeting...<br /><br />One great thing about this film, which is rare (sort-of) in comedies, is the acting. John Tutorro plays the hilarious "Chuck" anger pal to Dave; Allen Covert (star in basically all of Adam Sandler's movies) plays mr."big-weener" Andrew; Jack Nicholson is the unbelievably annoying Buddy, and John Mackenroe even gets off the Tennis courts to make an appearance as a hilarious client to the "therapy". Some of the most standout funny scenes include a bizarre male-prostitute car-scene, the gut-burstingly funny scene in the plane, and when Buddy and Dave go on a terrible, morally unethical (yet damn funny) scene in which they kick the crap out of a bunch of Monks. All in all, "Anger Management" is a hilarious, annoying, feel good film that deserves to be watched by all. <br /><br />Overall: **** out of ***** (4 out of 5)
