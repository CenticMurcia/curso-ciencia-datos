one of my favorite cheese flicks. if ya dig cheese u will dig this flick. i would love to give the movie a 10, but to rate the movie up there with the likes of citizan cane and gone with the wind would be insane. the only the i think would have made the movie better would be if kevin smith had written the screenplay.
