outsourced is for me an unexpected gems of this year. after screening this wonderful up-to-date movie, i wish the filmmakers the best for the release all over the world. This movie has great sense of humor and it shows how you can work out your superficial priorities to down to earth human stuff. i enjoyed this amazing film cause it showed that every culture can learn from other culture. Awesome music- this director knows a lot of about world music. he combines Indian volk music with modern rock and pop. a real fusion fun. There are some moments where one or other actors does not feel awkward but this movie has wonderful drive and you will get bored even for one second. A real cinema goers blockbuster! hey folks, unite and spread this amazing movie link to all over the World.
