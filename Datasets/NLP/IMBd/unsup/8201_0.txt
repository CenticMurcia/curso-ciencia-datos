Well, this film is great, it's one of the few decent american comedy films of the 90s,Jason Lee i feel puts in a great performance. Everytime i see the film it still cracks me up, even after a few years have passed (nearly a decade....does time go that fast!!!) There's no real "serious" acting, but comedy films are rarely powerfully acted dramas! i rate this an 8.<br /><br />Comments are welcome to me via my email.
