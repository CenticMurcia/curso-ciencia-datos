Basically, the movie is about a family (parents and three daughters) in the 1960's as they deal with issues from the past and the present. There is also a secret that is eventually revealed, and sort of explains why things are the way they are.<br /><br />The casting was good, everyone played their character well (mostly), except I sort of agree with the other reviewer when they said that you really don't 'dislike' the father, even though his acts can sometimes be inappropriate.<br /><br />There are some scenes I liked with some of the individual characters, and the cinematography is nice. I especially liked the opening and the closing scenes.<br /><br />Overall, I didn't like some of the story. But if you like any of the actors or are just somewhat interested, it is probably worth seeing.
