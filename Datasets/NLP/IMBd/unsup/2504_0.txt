What are accomplished actors like Ellen Burstyn, Peter Boyle, James McDaniel and Deirdre O'Connell doing in this piece of dreck? This is one of the worst-written things I've ever seen - it barely even rises to the level of cookie-cutter formula in its laziness (in the credits, the serial killer character is just called "The Killer" - the writer couldn't even be bothered to give him a name, never mind any background). The plot developments are laughable and absurd, the police are made to look completely incompetent, the psychic-ability angle is gratuitous and poorly used, and there is virtually no suspense to speak of. Kristin Davis and Matthew Settle are very attractive-looking leads, but their characters are boring ciphers. Avoid at all costs, especially if you are a fan of any of these actors.
