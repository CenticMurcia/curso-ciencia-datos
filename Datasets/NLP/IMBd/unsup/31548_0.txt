This is a dull and badly choreographed and performed dance film. There is a group of women in white dresses with permanent smiles on their faces walking around on a blue field. When seen from above, they form shapes. There are two airships above them, with stewardesses sitting around a table with a large pile of grapes on it. Under the table, another woman is stealing the grapes through a small hole. Other reviewers here have called the film beautiful and symbolic, but I saw neither any beauty nor symbols. The only thing this proves is that it's not as easy to make an "artsy" film as some people might think. There may or may not be some meaning behind this film, but meaning is far less important than making a film that's interesting to watch.
