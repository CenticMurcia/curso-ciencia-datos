you probably know the story by now: two girls (marie and alex) go to marie's parent's country house to study. a "deranged" french redneck killer appears and starts killing them for no reason, with alex escaping and fighting him. in the end, it turns out ("fight club"-style) that alex is in fact the killer, and that there was no redneck to begin with. whoopieee!!!<br /><br />if alex is the killer, then 90% of the movie involving alex fighting/running from the redneck didn't happen. makes for a truly satisfying aftertaste.<br /><br />and how come alex goes out of the blue so completely freakin' insane that she kills 4 people in gruesome ways, yet has been friends with the unsuspecting marie at college for a long time (and, apparently, displayed no symptoms whatsoever)? turns out she's a dyke with a secret crush on marie, which drove her insane. ...and made her cut her mother's fists and kill her little brother with a rifle. ...or something.<br /><br />anyways, the alter-ego-"fight club" (and X other movies)-like twist in the end serves only to justify the completely unlikely plot and over-the-top bloodshed before and, inadvertently (unlike in "fight club"), makes 90% of what we've seen totally illogical and impossible to have happened. "fight club" works because the protagonist and his alter ego always occupy the same physical space. this does not. here we eg. see alex trying to untie marie, as they both watch the "killer" outside kill marie's younger brother in the cornfield. etc, etc. dear director, the person and its persona cannot occupy two different spaces, performing two different actions at the same time. this only shows that the twist is a poor gimmick that's easy to fall for at first, but when you rewind the movie in your head in light of it, you find it just doesn't work and the whole movie just doesn't make sense.<br /><br />and if alex killed her killer alter ego in the end (i.e. "cured" herself of "evil"), why does he appear again? cheap.<br /><br />plus, you've got muse's "newborn" as a score (appears twice). imagine combining the plot above with muse.<br /><br />self-aware, stylish and cheaply manipulative. for those easily shocked and reluctant to give a second thought about anything.
