This is irresponsible film-making. Get a highly sensational subject like sex or violence, travel to a third world or developing country, roll the camera like its a home video and tape then edit against the will and intentions of the participants.<br /><br />Viewers be aware that Pla, the girl in the film, was KILLED after the film was made. It is believed she was murdered by mafia controlling prostitution (yes most likely Thai and not Farang). Someone lost face and she paid the price - something anyone familiar with Thai culture should know. Whatever good intentions were conceived with this film have quickly faded and her family is in more dire straits without her support.<br /><br />A couple questions for the filmmaker. Did all subjects in this film knowingly participate? Are you investigating her death and pressuring for answers from the Thai embassy? Are you doing anything to support her family? How much of Canadian taxpayer dollars indirectly contributed to her death through CBC funding?
