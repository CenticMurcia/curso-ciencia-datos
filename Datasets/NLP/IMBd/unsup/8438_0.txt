This movie did have cheesy acting and special effects, but at least it wasn't filled with the fear, anxiety and hopelessness of the movie '' The Day After''. In order to enjoy ''Damnation Alley'', you really do have to turn off your brain and turn on your imagination. Unlike most, i actually liked the ending of this movie, it did at least offer hope that humanity wasn't completely wiped out in the nuclear holocaust. ''The Day After'' seemed to imply that all living things would eventually die in the aftermath of nuclear war.<br /><br />''Damnation Alley'' is not my favorite movie by no means, but i watch it every time it happens to be shown on one of the cable channels.
