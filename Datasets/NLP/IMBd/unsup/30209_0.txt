Here is a movie that someone gave me that i thought might be funny based on the title. this movie turned out to be one of the worst movies that i witnessed. The only reason that i painfully set through this movie was i hoped to get a glimpse at maybe a fine woman or something. That wouldn't of even helped. i haven't even seen a home movie that was this bad. the movie looked like it was shot on the first take and it seemed like much of the audio of the movie was re-done in the studio with the editor forgetting to put back subtle audio effects like background sound effects for the environments etc. It may not sound like much but you would be surprised how much it makes a difference with the movie in missing it. None of the actors looked convincing at all and the scenes often did not make any scene. Some of the scenes were drawn out with no direction. Very low budget  but that is not what made it bad. It was a shame to see Reynaldo Rey and the other actress from the Wayne Brother's sit com in this movie. Not that they are top actors but just the fact of having this movie tied to their names is bad enough for 2 actors who actually are recognized. Some of the sound effects were the worst. This movie had no comedy, drama, suspense, horror, special effects or action. It is hard to categorize this movie. It should be a training video to show film makers what not to do. This movie is one my OPEN WATER list which is another awful movie. This movie made me become a member of this site just to warn everyone how bad it was. If you ever want to get rid of company or torture someone please get this movie and watch it. Other wise don't waist the hour ½ of your life trying to wait for it to get better like I did.
