I was pleasantly surprised to hear Lamb of God playing over the intro to this long awaited documentary. I feared another 'hard rock' metal synopsis. <br /><br />The content range is wide enough to give newcomers a pretty good appreciation of the whole metal family and includes both glam and shock rock '70s/ '80s bands as well as some heavier stuff from Slipnot, Slayer for example. <br /><br />Having said that, as a more hardcore metalhead I personally have less connection with bands such as Venom or Alice Cooper than the enquiring outsider who may be watching this film out of curiosity. As a result I was a little frustrated at points in the lack of discussion over hallmark acts (Pantera aren't even mentioned(!?!)) <br /><br />Subsequently I think that if this film is intended for people to show to their parents or mates to illustrate metal in general, then it scores highly (although the old story about Satanism and Black Metal is a little over done - we've heard all that before).<br /><br />If you DO know your metal, the film does little more than make you feel warm inside (the final voice over is quoted excellently!) Personally I watched this film mainly just to make sure that metal was not being defaced on screen as has happened many times before - I have no complaints.
