I must say, this film accurately portrays the brass band world- in that it's a pile of sh*te.<br /><br />If you want to hang round with a group of drunk, middle aged, social retards; then I suggest you watch this film and find your nearest brass band recruitment officer and jump on board the road to hell (aka the continuously fruitless pursuit of winning any competition which comes even mildly close to worthwhile). Once you do that, you'll be considerably more than just brassed off.<br /><br />Thanks for listening, You've been a wonderful audience, Good day!<br /><br />P.S. This film's c**p (just in case you didn't get the gist of my rant)!
