Wow read some reviews and saw the trailer and seemed interesting. The beginning i did enjoy. Towards the middle then to the end just got weirder and weirder.<br /><br />Spoilers Once the whole thing with the priest and the kid being the devil started the movie started to unravel for me. The acting with the mother and father was just so odd. I would stay away from this movie unless you want to be disappointed in the end. After showing good promise in the beginning this movie took a turn towards unforgettable. The acting was OK but the story just went so far out there. The end leans towards a sequel. At least would know what to expect with that and could stay away.
