This is a great movie fit for adults and kids. It is space exploration with a twist. Kids band together and make a space ship of their own, and you'll enjoy their trip through space and the comedy involved in meeting a new, alien culture. It's a must see for anyone who likes comedy or sci-fi. Enjoy!!
