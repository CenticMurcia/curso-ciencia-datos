Robert Blake is a boxer who is framed for a murder and has to try and clear himself.My notes said "Dull Barely watchable film this stinks". Which I think sums it all up. The problem aside from a plot thats too obvious for words and direction, which gets points for trying something different but which fails in execution, is that this is Blake in one of his more "interesting" performances. He's clearly got some kind of a performance on his mind, the problem is that it comes off rather bizarre and not really watchable. Even his attempt at channeling Jack Nicholson in a diner ala Five Easy Pieces doesn't work. The cut of the film I saw ran about 65 minutes which means that a chunk of time is missing (IMDB lists a run time of 85 minutes), but given whats here I wouldn't ever try a revisit.
