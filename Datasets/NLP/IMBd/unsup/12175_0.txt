This movie was so cool.<br /><br />If you're a disillusioned left leaning youth, you will love this film. If you're an aging hippy wondering where the new generation of left thinking kids are, see this movie. Parents do you wonder why your college age child won't get a haircut and a real job, this is the answer. And if you're a former hippy who grew up and joined the main stream rat race, this one's for you.<br /><br />Three, 20-something Berliners stage a protest against the exploitations of capitalism, but in their own way. They break into homes of the uber rich to rearrange furniture, leaving funny notes yet never stealing a thing. I wished I was 20 again when I saw this film. Why oh why did I join the main stream? There are a few holes in the plot (the ending and a little throughout) but the overall coolness of the movie made up for it. And a good soundtrack too.
