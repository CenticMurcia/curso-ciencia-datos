I had avoided this film for some reason - maybe it was the plot details, but when I viewed it I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Thora Birch's English accent is very good, and she makes us believe her performance - which is vital in this film. The story more or less revolves around her version of events, and after the first 30 minutes, you get the feeling that everything is not what it appears to be.<br /><br />I won't give anything away, but this film isn't essential viewing, but I'd recommend that you do at some time watch it.<br /><br />The main cast of five do well, in what could have been a disaster, but they all hold their roles well. But the shining star in this film is Birch herself - it's her film to be honest, and she carries it well enough.<br /><br />I felt at times though that the actors were generalising. 1 dimensional acting - "Oh, I'm 'playing' irritating now". You'll get the picture.<br /><br />So, all in all, a decent film, with a nice kinda storyline to it, and as we're in 'thriller' territory, expect a twist that was sooooooo obvious right at the end!!!! Oh well.....<br /><br />8/10<br /><br />Enjoy!
