This movie was billed to be EARTH IN DANGER. After this team embarks on their mission, there's two minor tremors (where I don't see so much as a street lamp keel over), very scary scene in a tunnel and other than that not a hint of additional disastersanywhere. For the last hr fifteen minutes of film. The plate shift moves ever closer to that 44 centimeters mark were were informed mankind's doomed, at the end stops at 35and until the bombs are set off all stays as quiet as a emptied parking lot.<br /><br />I started watching this after seeing footage of devastation in the film's first 25 minutes thinking there's going to more, even it if was CGI or old archive stuff there would be more chaos--BUT I got instead was boring by the numbers human dramaHey this is not the Hallmark Channel; I was baited and then the emphasis of the movie switched--and I am still livid over it! The (young) daughter subplot was good because both characters were somewhat likable while the scientists father daughter subplot reeked--I hated the scientist daughter. But neither one didn't need to be in this storyline cause they pull away from the supposed terror of the Earth on verge of disaster. Instead the Earth gets final billing. And testing was the cause of this why lob another bomb into Earth's precarious undergroundand why Earthquake prone California in all places. And nukesWhat about planting food, the radiation spreading to other statesEven ID4 had a higher degree of reality in terms of nukes there were someone protested using them and the President hedged.<br /><br />I rate it 1 for the 2 prayer scenes, John Rhys-Davies and Mark Dacascos
