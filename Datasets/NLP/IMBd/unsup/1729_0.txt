Remember the movie "Sixth Sense " well "Birth" is a bit like it, trough the plot is different of course- and so are the actors. In Six Sense we have two stars Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment, while in "Birth "we have Nicole Kidman and Cameron Bright ( who is actually a pretty good actor judging by his filmography ) . The acting was fine  and the only think that I didn't like was the scene at the theater, when for like 30 seconds or more I was watching the face of Nicole Kidman  I got what the director was trying to emphasize in that scene , but 10 seconds or so would have been just enough. Birth is a good Mystery film, because it really keeps you interested in the story. It is full of symbolic of life and dead and has a lot of meaningful scenes. I was surprised to see that is has an R rating for sexuality  as there is just one sex scene, fairly short and honestly the movie would have been even better if it wasn't in it. The soundtrack was good  made of classic music and suspense  typical for this genre  trough I felt that some scenes could use some more music on the background.
