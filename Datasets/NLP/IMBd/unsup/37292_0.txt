I had seen all the "faces of death" films ,i wasn't shocked or anything at all with these films and as said before they had some documentary feeling However... watching this film (partly)i had the same feeling.... until the incredible evil torture against animals,this is so sickening violent that i had to to something,if only to warn people not to spread this filth,(as a torrent,(OR ANY OTHER WAY)To my amazement i saw that this movie is widely sold and advertised. Why anybody would wanna see this as entertainment is totally beyond my (and any sane person IMO)comprehension,so if the people who are making these films get a commercial success out of it, they are gonna repeat it! So the viewer will be responsible (to a certain extend) of what he sees. Think about that when u see this! i would say ignore it,also there are certain people like myself who would (and will!!!!!) pay a small fortune to get my hands on any of the persons involved in making the animal clips in this film,or providing someone else with the means necessary to make it for them!<br /><br />(ADMIN,IF YA WANNA DELETE MY POST WATCH THE FILM AND YOU WONT!!)<br /><br />"BARBARICFELLOW"
