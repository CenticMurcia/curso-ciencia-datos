The acting performances were all-around excellent! Brody & Tierney's relationship is sexy, suspenseful, and compelling. These two actors communicated with their raw instinct, making this film interesting and worth watching.<br /><br />The plot does have its typical Hollywood predictability at times but that is easily forgiven in light of the great performances.
