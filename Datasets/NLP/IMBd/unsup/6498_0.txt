As a rule, I am not a baseball fan. I don't loathe the sport, I just don't seek it out. I was interested enough to watch 61* based on the promos that HBO has been running.<br /><br />I'm glad I did.<br /><br />The story of the great M&M boys touches a nerve, whether you are a baseball fan or not. It's about the underdog, the little guy, the one that's easy to forget when blinded by the limelight. Mickey Mantle was the hero. Roger Maris was humanity. And that's exactly what this film displays. Rooting for the little guy, and that common thread that links humanity together.<br /><br />Suddenly, Mark Mcguire's record breaking season took on a whole new meaning to me, and I understood the poignancy of the Maris children giving Mr. McGuire the bat.<br /><br />Watch 61*. It might surprise you just as it did me.
