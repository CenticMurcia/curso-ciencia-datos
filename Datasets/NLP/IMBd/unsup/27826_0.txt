'Escape From New York'is a movie that never loses it's charm no matter how many times you see.The movie is another great result of Carpenter and Russell collaboration and even twenty five years after it's release many people(including me)consider this movie as a milestone both in action and science fiction genres and it definitely deserves it's reputation as a cult classic.The movie has a dynamic direction,a unique atmosphere,a very well written screenplay with great dialogues and characters,a fascinating score and a great cast led by Kurt Russell as Snake Plissken.Russell is outstanding as ex special forces officer turned criminal S.D.Plissken and with the help of some of the best written one liners,he makes the character unforgettable for the audience like nobody can.What a magnificent actor he is!Besides Russell,Carpenter built a top notch supporting cast including Lee Van Cleef,Ernest Borgnine,Isaac Hayes,Harry Dean Stanton,Adrienne Barbeau,Donald Pleasence with some Carpenter regulars like underrated Tom Atkins and Charles Cyphers.<br /><br />'Escape From New York'is a terrific movie from a master filmmaker.<br /><br />Once you see it,you'll never be the same!
