OK at parts. but just too crappy at some other parts...<br /><br />i mean i know the camera he is using pretty well... and the whole picture has been propably shot with that... but why put some cheezy TV-effect or reshoot through a monitor... i looks disgusting? this is a dv-movie. it is OK at being such... so there the three points. other than that nothing really astonishing here.<br /><br />it really isn't great movie, but it's not a bad one. if you are starting to make movies then this is good to watch, what can be done with 30 000 Euros (40k $).<br /><br />those dvcams are just so light that getting good hand held picture doesn't really work... looks kinda crappy. i think that they should have gotten a some steadyshot get better picture.<br /><br />not that horrendous though... some interesting dialogue.<br /><br />you could rent this if interested in dv-work... other than that maybe pass.
