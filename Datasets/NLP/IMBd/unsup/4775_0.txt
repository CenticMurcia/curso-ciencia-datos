This story is of a young woman sent to a mysterious boarding school in the middle of nowhere. She is driven there by her parents, her mom being the one eager to see her daughter off, while her father is less than thrilled with the idea. Of course, once she is at this school she has to deal with the typical problems of learning to adjust, dealing with the teachers and bully's, and dealing with the horrific visions and dreams afflicting her sleep. Well that last one is not so typical, but it is what makes this a horror movie. Yes, at this school you have the teachers and students, both seem a bit out there, so you are left wondering who is responsible for the terror that lurks in the woods. Though it is not to hard to figure out thanks to a story told by one of the students. The movie works rather well and has a rather good cast too, Bruce Campbell is in it too and that is always a plus as he adds a spark near the end of the movie. I also enjoyed seeing him take on something he is actually known for taking on in an earlier set of films. The ending itself could have used more work in explaining what was going on. I was not sure of the motivation, though I was sure of the who was responsible and the identity. Still, nothing like a mystery in an all girls boarding school as the setting for an interesting movie experience.
