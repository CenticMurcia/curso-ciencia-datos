I really used to look forward to watching Midsomer Murders, but some of them are getting so far fetched its pathetic.<br /><br />People getting murdered because of different type of camera ? Flashing the camera again and again in someones face, in a kind of duel, forcing the other person to retreat as a kind of argument gets out of hand ?<br /><br />There are some good actors in Midsomer Murders and its good to see some old faces. I can't understand why they sign up to do it. They either haven't read the totally stupid script or are simply desperate to get back on the telly.<br /><br />I know some stupid things happen in life but for gods sake, is this really the best the script writers can do ? Awful, terrible, dire, etc etc........<br /><br />Don't know if I'll be watching again. Sad.
