This Connery suspense/action comedy is like a large toy, a very exquisite and eminently likable one.I was charmed. As comedy, it's direct and nice and sometimes also grim; as an action outing, it's straightforward and suspenseful. The cast is one of the finest ever in this league of films. In a word, it is eminently classical. It is complete: funny, thrilling, fastpaced, well developed. The quality of the roles is as good as can be wished. Moreover, it is funny in a way that doesn't undermine what the film sets itself up to.<br /><br />The First Great Train Robbery (1979) is atmospheric without resorting to mocksets. It's a comedy, and it's concomitantly grim and atmospheric. The whole segment about the fugitiveinformer is a fine example of such a thing.<br /><br />The right term for The First Great Train Robbery (1979) is,I think, beautiful. A very exquisitely crafted toy. There is much skill at work here. Such movies do not appear by chance; they take a very sure instinct for amusement, and that powerful quality named gusto. <br /><br />Now I remember this conversation I had with a dolt; he was telling me that Connery didn't do other important roles others that the Bond franchise. <br /><br />There is a delicious scene when Connery has a brief talk with the quite young wife of a much older banker. The rather unsubtle innuendos of their exchange ,that indicate a very willing woman, about screwing, etc., are extremely funny. Connery is, in fact, a 1855 picaresque rogue. The whole story has a goodnatured picaresque air.<br /><br />Lesley-Anne Down was the owner of the sexiest thighs that could be admired in the '70s cinema. She looks again absolutely arousing in The First Great Train Robbery (1979).She had all the potential and quality of a comedy actressthough she was lately underused in all those stupid soap operas that spoiled and ruined her career. Anywaywatch her beautiful thighs in the bed scene where she undresses!<br /><br />Two more things: I've noticed, in my experience with other viewers, that  is suited irrespective of age or sex of the viewers;it is fun in an universal way, regardless of such things like the sex or age of the audience. Then, it has an enjoyable varietyseveral forms of comedy (from sexcomedy to social satire), action, suspense, charming performances from the central group of actors (i.e., Connery, Sutherland and Mme Lesley-Anne Downso that it skillfully avoids all monotony. Happily, Mme Lesley-Anne Down really is important in the film's development. She was, in a way, my dearest reason for watching The First Great Train Robbery (1979).<br /><br />She really invests a huge amount of charm in her picaresque role.<br /><br />In a modest and unpretentious way, the director manages competently the several registers of the moviethe comical, the adventurous, the satirical, the grim one. I've found the cinematography of FGTR to be delightful.<br /><br />As for Sutherland's secretit is that, being so ugly and dis-likable and sordid and nastyhe's nonetheless irreplaceable. I wouldn't have liked anyone else in his role. And I think that this part is a nice achievement in Sutherland's unfortunately chance uneven career.
