Gross and ugly does not begin to describe the wretched FEED. If it took itself at all seriously, or had decided to play it "camp," or simply attempted to provide decent thrills and chills, we might forgive it its nastiness and vomit-inducing swill. I rented it because it supposedly starred Australian actor Jack Thompson, a long-time favorite of mine who, it turns out, has almost no role in the movie. (His son Patrick plays the co-lead, along with Alex O'Loughlin, who, as a blond, looks an awfully lot like Owen Wilson, without the noticeable nose.) <br /><br />The movie begins as though it might hold together, but slowly comes apart until, toward the end, director Brett Leonard ("Lawnmower Man," "Virtuosity") leaves logic adrift entirely and has his hero (and us) lamely rolling around in body parts and fluids. For sheer stupidity, nothing equals the moments (several of them) when hero and villain could easily kill or at least maim each other, but simply don't. So, of course, the movie can continue on its vile way for another half hour. The questions supposedly raised here about our consumer culture and over-eating are red herrings, plot-wise, and neither pertinent nor intelligent enough to qualify as "intellect." <br /><br />Yes, unhealthily fat women (and the men who go for them) exist in life and online, but this film--which equals "Hostel" and "Wolf Creek" in sheer ugliness while possessing about one-tenth the movie-making smarts of both put together--has no reason to be.
