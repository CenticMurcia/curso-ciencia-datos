Why is it that a film, no matter how fun or cute, can't be bothered to take science seriously? I'm referring to the main character in "Bee Movie," Barry. If the producers had taken the time to do a bit of homework, they would have realized that bee hive workers are ALL female; the only purpose of the males is to reproduce with the queen. Having Barry wanting to be a "pollen jock" is nothing more than pure fantasy, and, for me, it destroyed any credibility the film might otherwise have.<br /><br />That said, the animation was certainly up to standards, and there were a number of amusing events sprinkled throughout the movie. However, when a producer can't be bothered to get the details right, it's hard to go away feeling anything less than cheated.
