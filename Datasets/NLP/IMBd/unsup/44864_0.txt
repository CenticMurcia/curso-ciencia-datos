Being on an epic movie kick lately, I decided to check out again this "lost" debut of Arnold Schwarzenegger's where not only is his then unpronounceable surname changed to the unimaginative Strong (in the manner of the stars of Italian peplums) but his voice was also dubbed by an American actor for U.S. theatrical release (which is unsurprising as his original vocal track - which is how I watched the movie myself - is virtually unintelligible at times)! Anyway, the "Greek god in modern NYC" plot had comic potential to be sure but, despite the scarce felicities (Hercules is insulted on seeing an impostor posing as himself in a fictional sword-and-sandal flick playing in a movie theater), it is generally hopelessly squandered by the sheer amateurishness of it all. At least, despite its blandness and derivativeness, the Greek-style musical score alleviates one's pain from time to time...
