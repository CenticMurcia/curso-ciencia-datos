If you are Italian and old enough to have lived there in the 70s/80s, then you will probably get the point of this movie: Moretti's conflictual relationship with the (then) Italian Communist Party. But that doesn't change the fact that the film is weird and delirious.<br /><br />If your clique is the intellectual/radical/snobbish kind, you'll have to say that the movie is superb.<br /><br />If none of the above applies, then pick another film.
