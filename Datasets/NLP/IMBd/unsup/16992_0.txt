This movie is a about two stealth fighters who go head to over stolen missiles . It a very fast movie with a great score by Hans Zimmer(The lion king) . At least the movie gives one a idea on what the government do to get the missles back. Some of the action sequences are little over the top and so is the corny dialogue. Overall, it still my favorite one from the movie's two main stars!!!Plus you get great views of Utah in the movie!!Maybe even Zion national Park?Great fun if you like fast action movies !!!
