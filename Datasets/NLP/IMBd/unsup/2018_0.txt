HK has always been able to produce quality movies. Chicks kicking the ass out of guys is just always a great ride. You see these 3 hot girls, who are smooth and graceful.The action is unbelievable. It's what you expect from HK, but it still bothers me that the glass cgi are visible fake. The acting is solid, but after all u don't need Oscar type of acting in these kind of film. I found Shu Qi to be the most sexy and captured the best performance. The others where great too.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD<br /><br />There are only 2 things i didn't like: 1. Shu Qi death 2. Some bad CGI and simple plot<br /><br />END SPOILERS<br /><br />Otherwise this is a great film to watch. It's sometimes funny, it has some h'wood type of drama, and of course it has HK action. So it's very very very Sexy, Action-packed, and entertaining.<br /><br />8/10 Because of the 2 things i disliked
