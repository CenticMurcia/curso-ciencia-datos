I saw the movie on TV and liked it a lot. TO be honest, I am a huge Clint fan, no matter if actor or director, or both at the same time. Given this, I found the photography great (with the use of a rather dark and "dusty" light) and the first battle scene rivals "Private Ryan" (does it have anything to do with the fact that Steven Spielberg is one of the producers?). The non-rhetoric tone chosen for the story is Eastwood's true landmark (see also "A perfect world") and I found extremely touchy and delicate the scene where "Doc" finds the corpse of his mate Iggy brutally tortured, he lights up an electric torch but all we see is his own face looking at the dead man, not the corpse. I bet that 99% of other directors would have shot a close-up of the dead. The scene as it is stresses even more the sense of brutality and sadness of the circumstance, whilst respecting the audience and avoiding to spectacularize death. Unfortunately, I found it rather difficult to follow the script with so many flashbacks and, to some extent, I found the movie development a bit chaotic. Nevertheless, another big hit from my actual favorite director. 8/10.
