Words cannot express how absolutely horrible this movie was. Not only was it overly sentimental pablum, but considering the huge role that music plays in the movie, you might assume that the writer could write believable dialogue about music... but you would be wrong. Now, I don't expect them to know the intricacies of music theory or the ins and outs of the world of classical music, and I understand the dramatic concept of "willful suspension of disbelief," but when a character says (and this is pretty much a verbatim quote), "The New York Philharmonic wants you to play again. I got the invite today," it pretty much ruins any sort of illusion that this bears any resemblance to the real world.<br /><br />The only redeeming quality is the fact that the guy playing Jonathan Rhys Meyers's brother looks like an Irish version of Jermey Piven. On second thought... that's not a good thing.
