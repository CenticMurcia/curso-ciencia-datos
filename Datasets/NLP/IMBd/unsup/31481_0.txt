Straight to business... Movie is not bad... The movie looks very Rich, music is outstanding.. 3 songs nicely picturised... But at the end you wont carry anything with u other than the song 'Jashn Bahar'. <br /><br />The background voice by AB was repetitive and boring... War scenes were below average. When we can expect the War scenes like TROY or Gladiator in Indian cinema ? <br /><br />Many characters in the movie did not made any sense.. it was out-casted .. Rithik has improved a lot...but his voice modulation was poor. Aish as usual stunning but acts like a statue. <br /><br />I could not make out what went wrong in the movie ..may b it was poor editing / cinematography.. Not at all Ashutosh's masterpiece ...
