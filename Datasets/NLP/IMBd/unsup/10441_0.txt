The Brits have crafted a story that is compelling, interesting to look at, complete with the supernatural, and, with a shoe string of a budget, something quite believable. Hex, is a show of which I have seen three episodes on BBC America. Cassie, a startlingly unpopular girl at an English (either college or Prep School) has had some very strange dreams since she discovered a little piece of pottery hidden away in her room. It turns out, she's a witch, being pursued by an Angel named Azazeal, who wants to make beautiful music. Her best and only friend is her roommate Thelma, a dark-haired lesbian who is infatuated with her. The plot moves along at a moderate pace, with enough twists and turns and subtle effects that the very atmosphere of the show is compelling. Unlike the American Buffy the Vampire Slayer, character development is the most important piece of the show. I'm sorry to hear that the actress playing Cassie does not continue with the show in season two, and will be sad to see her go. Thelma, you will find out, is probably the most interesting character, after she is killed in the first episode by Azazeal. She becomes a ghost, who eats constantly, snoops about the castle, and even wanders into her classmates dreams for midnight rendezvous. The implications are delicious, as is this gem of a show.
