*** may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />In my opinion this was the worst Italian movie I ever saw in my life. The actors were not that good besides Nanni Moretti himself, the worst was Jasmine Trinca, not emotional at all and she have probably some speech disorder too. The stories about Berlusconi, maybe true or not, were in the end the main content of the movie and the main purpose of Nanni Moretti was to scratch the image of this personage. I guess to do effectively so, it's better to make a documentary about him but not a movie. The plot was boring, cursory and sometimes really dumb. I would like to see the movie of Nanni Moretti in the old style and with a better cast, there are plenty of good actors in Italy and everywhere so it is not a problem to find the right one. I saw some low budget movie too and there were by far not that bad as "Caimano" so please Nanni...you can do better...please do better.
