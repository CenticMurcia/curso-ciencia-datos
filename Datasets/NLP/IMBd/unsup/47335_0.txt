If you are a B movie fan, this is worth a watch...maybe. I would not recommend running out and buying this. 90% bad acting, but I did like the music throughout it :P. Neat idea, but not put together well. If you're bored, and there is nothing else to watch, you might make it through it. Like everyone says, last 10 minutes are little gory, not really anything else 'bloody' in the movie (unless you count those nasty boils on his back :P)I too have seen the original Freaks, and I would not even compare them because...well...you just can't...the original was a cult classic, this one is no where near that. Glad I sat through it, just to say I have watched it :P
