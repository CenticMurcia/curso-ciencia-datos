I always found the movie vague, as you can read in an earlier comment on the movie, although this has changed recently because I decided to watch it again for a report I had to make for religion class (I recommend you to also watch this movie if you need to make a similar report).<br /><br />To agree with me on this one, you must've seen this movie several times. "Trance" is, as a matter of fact, a perfect Celtic labyrinth. It does not only provide much information about what we know of the Celtic religion; it also shows the practical side of the Celtic forces. The movie has been built up as a perfect information-providing movie and could undoubtfully be called a labyrinth. A real good source if you want to know more about the Celtic religion. Believe me, once you've discovered the labyrinth structure hidden in the movie, you'll find the movie a lot less vague.
