Ten Wanted Men (the title hints at something far more dramatic than is actually in the picture} is a serviceable, but instantly forgettable, Western from the Scott-Brown production company. Directed by jobber H. Bruce Humberstone, with a screenplay by Kenneth Gamet {from a story by Irving Ravetch} and filmed in Technicolor out in Old Tuscon, it feels {and is} lifeless and poor on structure and execution. With some misplaced humour and a cobbled together plot, this ultimately ends up as a time filler for Randy Scott completists only. There's some enjoyment to be had from watching our Randy lob dynamite around, and Leo Gordon steals the movie as menacing villain Frank Scavo. But it never comes together to make a worthy mark. And when a cast list contains Randolph Scott, Richard Boone, Lee Van Cleef, Skip Homeier and Dennis Weaver-that's a crime as much as it is a shame. 4/10
