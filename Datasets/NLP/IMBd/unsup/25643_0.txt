As someone who has recently begun delving into the genre of exploitation movies of the 70's and 80's I must say this ranks as one of the best I've seen. The sleaziness in this movie is excellent! Three gorgeous babes that bare it all! A erotic masturbation scene that is more arousing than 99.9% of the porn seen today! A truly exotic death sequence! A sexy catfight! A sexy babe in love with dogs! Hilariously funny dialogue (see Patrick's fathers' explanation of the first death) and scenes (see Mr. Lewis' death by hook). All this makes up for a truly outrageous and entertaining movie for any fan of the sleazy exploitation genre. The filmmakers here fully achieve what they set out to do and deserve congratulations.
