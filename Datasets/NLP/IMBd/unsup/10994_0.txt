Despite having a hard time understanding the accents during first few minutes of the movie, I really liked this film. It gives you a glimpse of what is like growing up gay, going to school being bullied, and having to hide your relationship. Every scene in the movie is perfect. The scene during the dance where Carter's and Dixon's eyes meet gives me goosebumps, and the scene where Dixon was beating the crap out of Carter to prove he wasn't gay was just disheartening.<br /><br />Overall, I like this film.
