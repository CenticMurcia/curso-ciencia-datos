I own the R3 DVD of this movie, and my overwhelming feeling is that the storyline is rather weak, however it's not all bad. The movie starts off quite slow in my opinion, and as in so many such Asian films, the background music is obtrusive. In it's defence though, things definitely improved, until towards the ending it moves at a furious pace with wonderful fight scenes.<br /><br />One thing though which makes this film are the attractive hot chicks kicking ass, with a sense of sexual undercurrent. What more can any bloke want for a night in with a few beers and some friends. For this eye candy, the weak script can be forgiven.
