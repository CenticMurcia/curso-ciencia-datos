The best sequence in "Butchered" occurs early on, when two girls are spanked with paddles by two other girls and then are forced to do "squishy" push-ups (you'll see what that means), as part of a sorority initiation. I must admit I found all of this quite a turn-on. But when the action moves on to the "haunted" house, the film offers nothing but derivative plotting, overacting, screaming, wandering around, watery blood and fake/exaggerated gore. I will give it * out of 4 for the effort; it's obvious that the people who made it do love horror flicks (they even included a double homage to "Halloween" and "Psycho" at the start). That doesn't mean they had enough talent to make one though!
