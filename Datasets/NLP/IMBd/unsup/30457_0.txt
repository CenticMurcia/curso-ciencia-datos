If u watch it and replay it a few times, they add things into there slapstick comity that takes a lot of intellect to decipher. When there car cut in half, when he was about to hit the mound of TNT, yes very "kid" slapstick, he turns around and says " isn't this a bit contrite." funny to most adults, no kid would pick that up. like when the Peter predecessor asked the Brian Predecessor, if he was OK after thrown into the wall, he brought tragedy which i do not know how to spell or even get a hold of how to spell it. although it was Child based it given a lot of adult humor. Summarizing, although it was made for kids, i find the dry and hidden humor quite funny. it is probably more comedic than family guy its successor in the fact that Family Guy is more, Here is the joke every one will understand it, while this is more, lets be discrete.
