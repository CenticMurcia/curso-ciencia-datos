"I'm sick of Symmetry" a character says in this film, and here we have one of the last works of Luis Bunuel's surrealistic fantasies that brings a story after another with a never ending that mocks the ignorance in which societies live in; It's just amazing how Bunuel exposures the conventionalism to which we are so accustomed and makes of any place a more decadent and irrational angle of the world. Comedy is just the perfect condiment that guides you and distracts you through a series of events that never have sense for the first time. Bunuel's humor is always taken to the profane as many judge, but indeed is just another evidence of how reality often times makes us uncomfortable even in our own privacy. A must see film without a doubt, it mirrors your emotions, it drives you mad, drives you sad, and challenges your morality.
