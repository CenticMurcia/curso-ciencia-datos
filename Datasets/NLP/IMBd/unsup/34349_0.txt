What a waste. I was hoping for this film to recreate the kind of claustrophobic terror that was the only reason to watch the first film, but instead, the entire film is an excuse for Jennifer Love Hewitt to show off her body. The plot is so pathetic it's not even worth mentionning; ditto for the script, characters, settings, acting, directing, production values... Brandy Norwood's "performance" here wasn't even worth the money it cost to the producers to fly her to L.A. for a meeting to ask her to star. Her dialogue doesn't make her character seem very stupid, but since she is, she makes everytihng and everyone around her look and act dumb, but once she's gone, they all seem smart. Only Matthew Settle brings any minimal charm to his character, but he does have a lot of the script's worst lines. The mentionned third entry in this series, once again featuring Ben Willis, will confirm this series the 1990s equivalent to "Friday the 13th"... People will be going to see these movies to see who gets mangled, and how badly, not for plot, suspense, character, etc... Grade: F
