In a flashback story, Roy Rogers relates how he obtained "My Pal Trigger". Mr. Rogers was, some time ago, a traveling peddler (and breeder) of horses. He rode a horse named "Lady". The Lady and the Gentleman go to George "Gabby" Hayes' ranch, where Rogers meets Bob Nolan and the "Sons of the Pioneers". Rogers next meets Gabby's lovely daughter Dale Evans (as Susan); she is atop the stallion "Golden Sovereign'. Rogers wants to breed "Lady" and "Golden Sovereign", but Mr. Hayes refuses. Jack Holt (as Brett Scoville) is an even badder dude.<br /><br />It's easy to see why this film is a sentimental favorite; and, it is an interesting change-of-pace. The part with Rogers, Ms. Evans, and the two horses meeting is clever - there is a parallel attraction between the two horses AND between Rogers and Evans. Having the horses get together and mate, on their own ,was quite nice. The mating of "Golden Sovereign" and "Lady" is confirmed (in case there was any doubt) by the birth of "Trigger". Along the way, the adults, especially Rogers, help give the Horses great characterization and appeal. There are some sweet, and sad, scenes Rogers plays out with the horses.<br /><br />The weaknesses in the story are going to be very obvious as you watch - you're barely able to accept the premise of the story when Rogers is suddenly accused of a crime. He's found "red-handed" by Gabby Hayes, Dale Evans and the "Sons of the Pioneers" - Evans points her gun at the accused Rogers, the man with whom she'd just been singing a happy song. The quickness to believe Rogers guilty is ridiculous. Later, Evans reverses her position. By then, the plot contrivances have multiplied faster than the horses. Though some of the scenes with the horses are nice, they are simply not adequate for what is attempted. <br /><br />*** My Pal Trigger (1946) Frank McDonald ~ Roy Rogers, George 'Gabby' Hayes, Dale Evans
