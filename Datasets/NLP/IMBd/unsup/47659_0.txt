It is best to look at Madman as a movie with two halves. The first half of the movie is pretty slow. It does have some suspense but isn't able to sustain a level of interest as it goes from being creepy to scenes of inane chatter by the camp counselors. The second half of the movie is pretty good. Lots of suspense to keep the viewers eyes glued to the screen. Unfortunately a quick and vague ending spoils the atmosphere that was created. I imagine the film makers were hoping to make a sequel. Also, while the ending is vague the film makers don't follow the guidelines of a typical horror movie ending. You may be surprised at who survives and who dies.<br /><br />On a whole Madman suffers from problems that plague most horror movies. Lack of story, unanswered questions, strange character motivations (would you go into a house which you just saw a Madman exit?) and stupid characters. Stupid characters are common for horror movies but in the case of Madman the characters aren't just stupid but several of them look like they don't even have a brain in their heads. A couple of them even seemed to have trouble speaking. What strengthens the movie is the suspense and numerous good reveals of Madman Marz. I was very impressed at the ability of the director and his timing for having Marz show himself.<br /><br />Overall Madman is an uneven film but for it's genre it is surprisingly well filmed, if not well acted, and very suspenseful. However, the first half of the movie hinders Madman from getting a better rating. Madman receives a 4 out of 10.
