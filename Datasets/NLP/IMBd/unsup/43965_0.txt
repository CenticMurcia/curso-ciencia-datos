This movie wasn't horrible. I read the reviews before buying it and decided to get it anyway because it's Jim Carrey.<br /><br />The main character in this movie is a high school girl named Janet who puts on an act in front of the other girls at school to make them laugh...when really she's dieing inside. For a class assignment, she must write a paper on "Why people ____?". She chose "Why people laugh". I'm telling you this for a reason.<br /><br />Jim Carrey doesn't appear until about 15 minutes into this 48 minute movie, but stays in it for the remainder. He plays a man named Tony Moroni, who works and performs at a comedy club. Needless to say, his material sucks. Janet goes to the club to do research for her paper when she meets Tony (I told you what I said had a purpose). From there, Janet helps Tony create better material for his bit. The storyline of the movie is how Tony gets Janet to come out of her shell.<br /><br />It's not a really bad movie, especially for a low budget, independent Canadian film. You still get to see Jim Carrey do his quirky and funny impressions, so that's a plus. Also, the title 'Rubberface' makes no sense. At no point in the movie does anyone talk about making or having a funny looking face. 'Introducing... Janet' makes more sense because of what the story is about and the ending.<br /><br />Hope you like it! -italyboy
