It probably is. I don't know what you cinema fans think, but I think this remake is even better than George Romero's original movie from 1968. When the original Night Of The Living dead came out, it was very scary, and also original... Even though nowadays zombie movies aren't the most original things ever, this one is probably the best one out there.<br /><br />The story is the same from the 1968 movie. Seven people are trapped in a house, and out there, just zombies, lots of them. It looks like some radioactive disaster has happened, so all the dead are now back to life, and they are looking for food - human brains.<br /><br />Tom Savini has always done an excellent job by doing make-ups in horror movies, and now he shows himself as a very good director (make-up is another important aspect in zombie movies, and it was done well in this one). The movie isn't very original, and it doesn't have anything that makes it so good, but when you watch it, you'll agree with me... It's a fun movie to watch, and being this way, I consider it the best zombie movie ever made.
