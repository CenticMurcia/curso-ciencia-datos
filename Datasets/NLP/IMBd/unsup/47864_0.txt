Well I managed it! Second time round I managed to get through the whole film, albeit in 3 chunks. But I managed to endure it all!<br /><br />Now I just wished I'd listened to my own review and saved myself the bother. Although the technocobblers did get dulled down the second half it was still rife with it. Whats more in it's place was a morose 'heist' and a meagre attempt at injecting some mob intrigue.<br /><br />I just can't imagine not only what they were trying to do with this film or how anyone else here can actually think it's a good film. It's not even watchable.<br /><br />If it's a heist film where's the heist, where's the cunning break in, the cunning break out, out witting the police and the surveillance people? Basically they just turn up at a building and run around like a group of masked removal men. <br /><br />Why were half of them wearing any masks anyway? One of them lived in the building, and two of them had already been seen by the people in the building. I mean how could any of the tenants not recognise the gay character since he'd visited each and every one of them?!<br /><br />They leave the paraplegic kid, who's surrounded by gadgets and don't even bother to check and see if any of the gadgets lying about is a radio? Are these the dumbest robbers of all time?<br /><br />Not only does this film not make sense in small ways, not only are the main issues of the film poorly handled but on top of all of that it's deeply dull from start to finish.<br /><br />As for the acting, I'm sure they were, but not great or bad, but why bother, the film isn't worth the thought or effort.<br /><br />The only reason I can see people thinking this film is great I can guess is their respect for Christopher Walken and Sean Connery. Well newsflash guys, Connery has always been overrated and finally after a decade of godawful films people are finally noticing. Funny how the only academy award he ever got was a film he recently got voted worst accent of all time for. As for Walken, he's a funny guy, but he's been spitting out more ham over the last two decades than any other actor I can think of. At least he stopped himself from dancing a jig in this one.<br /><br />I think maybe you should judge a film on it's own merits [or lack of] rather than seeing big names and expecting greatness.<br /><br />This isn't great, it isn't even good, it isn't even watchable.
