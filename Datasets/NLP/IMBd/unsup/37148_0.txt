While watching this I began to think that "Il diavolo a sette facce" might be Italian for "women in goofy wigs" when it became more apparent that it probably meant "waste of 90 minutes". To call "Devil with Seven Faces" a giallo would be akin to calling "The Garbage Pail Kids Movie" a drama. There is nothing in this movie that is even remotely close to the genre as this is standard television movie of the week fare. Playboy lawyer Dave Barton takes the case of Julie Harrison who is concerned about her twin sister. Turns out her sister Mary was involved in a diamond theft and double-crossed her husband who was also her partner. While under Barton's representation Julie falls for Dave's sidekick Tony who likes to bag multiple women like his boss. Can't say I disagree boys. Things move pretty slow as the various car racing scenes and mindless backstabbing provide little thrills and even less enjoyment. For some inexplicable reason Julie's hair keeps changing lengths as in one scene she'll sport the Mrs. Brady look and in the next her flowing locks are down her back. She even wears a ridiculous blue wig on the beach. The woman that Dave philanders with does likewise. At one point in the film Julie's landlady is found dead yet nothing ever comes from this. What the hell happened? Don't let the sexy cover fool you as this is a sex free flick. One naked backside and a sideshot of the curveless Carroll Baker are all the skin in this film. Let's see, convoluted plot, dull characters, no gore, no nudity, why did I give this a four? Oh yeah, Stephen Boyd does a decent job as the ladies' man lawyer. Where did they get the awful idea to name this "Devil with Seven Faces" to begin with? Skip this boring diamond caper and steal yourself a better movie.
