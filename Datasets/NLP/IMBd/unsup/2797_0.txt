OK so It looked like it was shot with a camcorder. No worries mate! The raw violence will have you on you seat edge. Taking violence and revenge to a level that the PUNISHER producers were afraid to go. Bikers will like this too. The guy rides a sweet A$$ sled with apes. I would put the acting on the level of OLD BOY. And the filming on the level of CLOVERFIELD. The story line is very twisted and I'm surprised that it hasn't reached cult status yet. I wont spoil the movie. But if you know the storyline from PUNISHER you know this film. But then they take it to the next level. Similar to SEVEN or SAW mixed with Mel Gibson's PAYBACK. It makes you think....would I do the same thing?
