I had seen the 19-episode TV series on DVD, and I had been awaiting the movie since it was filmed in 2006.<br /><br />I received the movie on DVD on July 1. I really liked the movie because it stayed true to the TV show ( mostly ) and also because it finally touched on a subject that many whom are familiar with the TV series had been wondering about: the estranged fathers of the boys. In fact, much of the movie is centered specifically around this topic.<br /><br />There's not much I can say here without spoiling it. But rest assured that this movie ( preceded by watching the TV series ) is something that you will want to see.
