This was not one of their best movie for puppet master and why was it called Curse of the Puppet Master if the curse didn't even happened but at the end. And why was this movie rated R, because only one person did in a not so bloody way and not so much cursing in this movie. And what bothered me the most was two things, one was why was their a doll under that girl, it was a useless scene that needed to be deleted. And why was that old guy trying to get his worker in a toy, up to know I don't understand both of those things. Al I'm saying is don't make more Puppet Master movies because after part 4 if was boring, stupid, and pointless.
