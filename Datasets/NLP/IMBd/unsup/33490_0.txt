This movie should be required viewing for all students of film making. It proves one thing beyond a shadow of a doubt. If you make a movie about two incredibly boring people, you're going to end up with an incredibly boring movie. Somehow this didn't occur to those who chose to inflict this turkey on the viewing public.<br /><br />The movie revolves around the ups and downs in the romantic relationship between Danny (Rob Lowe) and Debbie (Demi Moore). Demi spends a lot of her time crying and looking wounded. So does Lowe, except that he also does a fine job of looking bored while he's making this dud. (At least he's honest!) James Belushi and Elizabeth Perkins seem to have been added to the cast to provide some comedy relief. That would have been welcome, except that neither one of them was very funny. Their performances as the best friends of Danny and Debbie who get consumed by jealousy starts to grate after about 15 minutes. However, in fairness, it was them who kept me watching. Two or three times there were hints that these two polar opposite characters might have a romance of their own beginning to bud, and I really wanted to see if it happened. That was the only thing that raised this movie from a 2 to a 4. Watching Demi and Rob was about as exciting as watching ice cubes melt.
