I would like two say just some things about this movie. OK, the story isn't its strength, well it could be although it is taken out of the bible, though some of the scenes very really moving, not just because of some superb animations (especially everything covering the presentation of H2O).<br /><br />And then there I want to add why I really liked POE: No talking animals. Thank you.
