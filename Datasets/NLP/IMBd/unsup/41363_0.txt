So we decided to watch this film, as a laugh. It was Very far from a laugh, it was terrifying and traumatising, The shrieking awful actresses with their squeaky voices running amok screaming 'BFF' and 'IT'S ALL ABOUT ME' sent traumatic shudders up my spine. This piece of tripe is not a CHICK FLICK, nor is it a kids film, it's a horror movie, that resides in your brain and destroys it after watching it. I can honestly say that, my brain is still in the process of recovering.<br /><br />The deaf boy wasn't really deaf, I don't think i reluctant deaf boy would have learnt to lip read in such a quick time, nor speak properly. Furthermore, the final performance 'bratitude' is the WORST WORST WORST performance ever. No she cannot sing, and they cannot dance. =_=.
