When I saw this movie, it struck me as more of a comedy with a horror ending hence the reason why I rated it a 4. If rated from the perspective of a horror, I give it a really generous 3. Most of the movie will make you laugh if you watch it without the expectation of it being a horror. The acting seems to be spitefully lame which adds to it's comedic effect. You need to be naive or really young to enjoy this as a horror. If you're looking for a good scare, THIS IS NOT THE MOVIE FOR YOU!!! If you're into cheesy horror films because you're bored and you need a good laugh, this would give Troll 2 serious competition. You'll laugh at the fact that someone made this movie and labeled it a horror.
