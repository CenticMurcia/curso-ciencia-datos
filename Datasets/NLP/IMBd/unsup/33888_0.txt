If there's one thing Spanish and Italian filmmakers in the seventies loved, it was making their own versions of popular American classics. Rip-offs of films such as Jaws, Dirty Harry and The Exorcist almost became genres in their own rights as so many films were made. Perhaps a less obvious to rip-off is Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece 'A Clockwork Orange', but director Eloy de la Iglesia obviously thought it was a good idea. It wasn't though as this exploitation/sci-fi garbage has little in the way of interest and doesn't manage to create anything worthy of the great ideas brought forward in the superior Kubrick film. The film appears to be trying to make some sort of social commentary and although similar ideas worked well in the 1971 film, here they're portrayed with the use of a daft looking biker gang and it doesn't really have the same impact. I was surprised to see Jean Sorel among the cast members; as one of the better known European actors at the time, I'd have expected him to have a bit more sense. God knows what the scriptwriters were thinking; sometimes you can see glimmers of a good idea in there somewhere but clearly the film is just a load of nonsense and I wouldn't recommend anyone sees it.
