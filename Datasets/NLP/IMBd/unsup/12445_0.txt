This was the most disappointing films I have ever seen recently. And I really hardly believe that people say goods things about this very bottom film! No reason to watch, even wonder. Be away from this one and don't waste your time with bad acting and nonsense dialogue. I don't know if you have seen Bodysnatchers -another Australian film- but this one's first 20 minutes will make you forget about this country's good examples. Awful and unnecessary. What made the people who rated with high points but they must have never seen a good movie. Two guys and two girls, a beach, a nomad guy and the rest is a question mark which makes you regret to spend the time you have. Sorry to use all these words but the only good thing about the film is ocean's great color and sounds of waves. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT rent this film.
