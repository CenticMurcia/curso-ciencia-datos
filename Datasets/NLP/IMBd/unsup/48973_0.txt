Yep! "Stuuuuupid", thats what you got to be to go see this piece of junk.<br /><br />Acting -> Stinks Direction -> Stinks Jokes -> so badly setup you see them coming a mile away, some oldies might smile a couple of times thinking back... but thats it, nothing really funny the whole damn movie.<br /><br />Overall, made really cheap and it shows.<br /><br />I am willing to bet my, and my future kids testicles in saying this is going to flop SO badly because you have to be an utter moron to like a movie like this, even taking into consideration that there are many morons out there... this would be too much for a large majority of them too.
