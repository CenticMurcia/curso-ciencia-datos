Based on a Polish science fiction novel, this movie is set in 1985, when the world is at global peace. A mysterious message is discovered in Siberia, but needs to be translated. It is believed to be a warning from the planet Venus. An international team of scientists board a silver rocket and head off to make contact with Venus. The ship lands in a misty, glassy wasteland that swarms with metallic bugs and a mysterious oozing mud that causes the astronauts to return thinking they have discovered a failed plan to attack Earth.<br /><br />Reading sub-titles didn't help my enjoyment; but then again I don't speak or read German. The movie is worth watching if not just for the funky, brightly colored psychedelic photography while on Venus. The cast features: Oldrich Lukes, Yoko Tani, Kurt Rackelmann and Gunther Simon.
