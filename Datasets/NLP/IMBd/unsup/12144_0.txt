This kind of movie frustrates me. The substance of this film is watered-down pseudo-philosophical tripe that is popular among the "free thinkers" of our time. Leave it to Hollywood to misinterpret the works of great intellectuals (Heidegger, Berkeley, Foucault) and produce something incoherent and meaningless out of it. If you think this movie does a suitable job explicating the philosophical topics it pretends to discuss then you're probably an idiot.<br /><br />"... it also produces a disgusting hodgepodge of patchwork observations and half-rationalized principles, in which shallow pates revel because it is something useful for everyday chitchat, but the insightful, feeling confused and dissatisfied without being able to help themselves, avert their eyes ..." - Kant, Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (Cambridge edition, Gregor translation)
