"Imagine That" is by my humbly opinion one of the best Movies i watched this year. After all daily stress that we have in everyday's surrounding this movie truly made my evening. For the 1h and 45 minutes that it took it truly filed me with enough positive energy and relaxation.<br /><br />Yara Shahidi with Eddie Murphy done a great job in this movie. Eddie Murphy is born for movies with children. Similar to this one is Daddy Day Care and if I'm him i would act only in movies for children. And every one will be a 10 star movie.<br /><br />I recommend it to everyone. Don't miss it!!!
