Vacuous. Stupid. A crime against humanity. Take your pick, it all describes EPOCH to a "T". This isn't a movie, it's just a hodge podge of scenes strung together using the same nonsensical character motivations and stock footages that UFO (the production company) has been stringing together and re-using over and over in every film they've ever made. And yes, almost every film they've ever made HAS been quite, simply put, dreadful.<br /><br />EPOCH would only work if one were to enter the movie without a brain. Unfortunately a brain is needed to turn on the VCR, or insert the DVD into the player, hence no one will think this movie is anything other than powerfully...turd-like.<br /><br />1 out of 10 (the only movie I have given a "1" to on this board)<br /><br />(go to www.nixflix.com for a more detailed review of the film)
