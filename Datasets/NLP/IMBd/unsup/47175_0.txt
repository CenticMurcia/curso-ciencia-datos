Very sad, that people make the exact movie twice, with the same script, and that only a few years after the first one. I don't understand why they made it twice, but i guess they are having there reasons for it. It's almost miserable that they used they exact lines that John Travolta used on the first movie. I just don't understand why they made it twice, with only a few years between it, it's against all movie rules. And the second one is even worse, you see almost no emotion in the leading role called george, it's like he studied the first movie (John Travolta), and is trying to act like John Travolta, almost like a robot, because i totally mis the emotion in his words and face. If you remake a movie, than make it good.
