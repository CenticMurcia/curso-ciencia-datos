I have not been the same since viewing this film. It is disturbing to be sure. But it is also a transforming film, one that pushes the limits and boundaries of what it means to live out one's faith. War is hell. Can forgiveness and redemption be found in the bowels of war? I am convinced that this film, based on a true story, proves it can be found even there. The actors -- an international ensemble from North America, Europe and Asia -- are superb. You forget you're watching a film. It avoids the political, I think. The Japanese characters were a bit stereotyped at first, but they became real, nuanced, textured, and very believable as the story unfolded. And the actual meeting of the two former, reconciled enemies at the end is a master stroke. The makers of this film strived for greatness in this film, and I think they achieved it.
