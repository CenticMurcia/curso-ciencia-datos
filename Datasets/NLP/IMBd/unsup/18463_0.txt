Loved this movie version of Pride and Prejudice!! The characters had more life. The movie version verses the play version is more exciting and more interesting. The constant change of scenery suited me better than the play version where the scenery is pretty much the same. Elizabeth and Darcy's attraction for one another was more strongly felt than in other versions. It was also very interesting to watch Darcy struggle with his feelings for Elizabeth. I watched that part over and over again. Colin Firth made an excellent Darcy. He was arrogant and passionate at the same time, plus very handsome. I could not get enough of him. The characters that played Mr. and Mrs. Bennet were also excellent. I enjoyed the outside scenes with landscapes, horses and carriages. The home interiors were also more elaborate and fantastic and more in keeping with my imagination of what I thought they looked like after reading Jane Austens book. Have seen this movie version of the book many times over. I will never tire of this version of Pride and Prejudice.
