I tried watching this show to keep my nephew happy, but I couldn't last through one episode. Not because of the story, music, humour... No. Because of the acting.<br /><br />The acting was truly terrible. I suppose Drake Bell and Josh Peck could get away with speaking like retards in every line-if their supporting cast could act! But no-Miranda Cosgrove always uses the same facial expression and tone of voice. But what's worse is that the parents, played by Jonathon Goldstein and Nancy Sullivan were absolutely, 100% awful. In the episode I saw, something happened to Drake and they both stood there smiling, while saying lines (happily) which would suggest that they were angry. The father was slightly better in his part, although he just came across as an utter moron. But the mother...does she only have one facial expression??<br /><br />I couldn't finish watching one episode of this show.<br /><br />Oh, and the jokes were stupid, not funny.
