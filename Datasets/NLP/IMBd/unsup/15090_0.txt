One of my favorite films, Hitchock does his usual great job, and to see at last stage great TALLULAH BANKHEAD in her first and only noteworthy role how can you miss !!! Tallu's lusting after sexy hot hunk, John Hodiak, well its almost X rated, note the way she caresses his pecs!!! William Bendix is great as is Walter Sleazak, as the nazi, one of Hitchcocks best, definitely Tallulah's
