Wow! This film is the kind of movie that brings tears to your eyes and warmth to your heart. Everyone connected to "A Day" should be proud of their efforts. The emotions you feel for this childless couple are powerful reminders that love and life and family are among the best subjects for dramatic cinema. (This review is in regard to the dvd with English subtitles.) Some wonderful films are coming out of Korea, and this is one of them.
