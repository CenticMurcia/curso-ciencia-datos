Tell Me Something is slick, fast, and entirely unpredictable up to the last second. This Korean film appears to possibly be made with an international market in mind.Terrific acting and very high technical credits add up to present a shocking, relentless crime drama. The DVD provides options for the comfort of various types of viewers (choice of Korean or English, with or without subtitles.) Some scenes are disturbingly graphic. If you are a fan of Seven or Silence of the Lambs, though, Tell Me Something comes recommended.
