what's this?<br /><br />the storyline is nothing but exploitation of action scenes, even the soundtrack is just too mesmerizing. This reminds me of Final Fantasy the spirit within where most critics mention that the movie is just a show off of special effect with awful storyline.<br /><br />The usual bebop characters are just put down into some manequine-class action: FRUSTATING!<br /><br />and what's with Faye? This will be rather subjective but I like the lady a lot despite her fashion style (she never appear cheap though, so treat her with respect). And in the movie.....what the....whoever write this script and direct it must be one horny person or someone who is trying to meet the demands of the horny fans; DISGUSTING!<br /><br />The only part I enjoyed were the common bebop jokes and a tiny characterization of Faye and Spike in one part....<br /><br />Well like I've mention, if you are a true bebop fans who reach personal level of the characters, don't bother with this one. It's just AWFUL!
