I guess this is totally enjoyable entertainment if you are uneducated and uninformed. Comments by other viewers are shocking "A good theory??? "The sun catches fire???" My god I hope that is not the level of intelligence being produced by todays education system. This movie is the biggest load of BS I have ever had the misfortune to witness on a TV screen. The kind of screenplay I would expect from an 11 year old and if it was an 11 year old writing the screenplay I would understand and say; 'Not bad kid. Keep on trying.' If it wasn't for the cheap production and obvious low budget I would say that this movie reeks of global elitist scare mongering for their global warming campaign to have even more taxes implemented on an already overtaxed population. But surely they could afford a much higher budget and overall better actors (With the exception of Lou Gosset Jr and a few others - indeed the fact that they can keep a straight and serious demeanor through out the film shows that those few actors really are outstanding in their craft) but I suspect this film is aimed to appeal to the truly stupid people. The types who get robbed by Nigerians offering them millions for the low registration fee of $300 and their bank account details..... I would recommend film students (screen writers, directors & actors) watch this film as an example of what they should aspire not to create regardless of how much money they are paid. I was going to rate this film a 2 but I opted for a 1 because a 2 would really be stretching the bounds of truth, reality and justice (just like this film does from start to finish).
