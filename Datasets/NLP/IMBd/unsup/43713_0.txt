A misfit/underdog joins the med school.<br /><br />Believes in healing by humour, making personal relation with patients, which is atypical of the docs.<br /><br />Hated by professors and fellows. <br /><br />Professors try to remove him from college.<br /><br />His roomie, who is the topper (also hates him), helps him stay.<br /><br />Now tell me how Munnabhai M.B.B.S is not a copy of Patch Adams! Merely by changing a bit of preamble and postscript of a story, one cannot call it original. <br /><br />At least Robin Williams could bring in some amount of tolerance to Patch Adams, but alas in here, there is none.
