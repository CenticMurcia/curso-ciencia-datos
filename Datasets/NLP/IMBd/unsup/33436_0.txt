After an extremely bizarro pretitle initiation scene where a sorority pledge is murdered, "Sisters of Death" becomes a rather dull affair. The film has the look and feel of a made-for-TV production--its titillation is a tease at best, and the violence is almost remarkably subdued. Seven years after the pledge's murder, the five remaining sisters are invited to a reunion at an isolated mansion, presided over by an unknown host; two male escorts hang around as the girls get picked off, one by one. While "Sisters" isn't necessarily boring, its restraint and overall lack of innovation doesn't make for exciting viewing. There is some character development, and the film comes to ludicrous, multiple-twist finale, but by then it's too late. Still, it merits a "2" based solely on the gorgeous female cast, all of whom look fine in bikinis and/or negligee.
