It's 2009 and I have just watched the best television drama I have ever seen and it's called 'The Corner'. Having been a late comer to 'The Wire' series on the FX channel in Britain then when that finished they advertised 'The Corner'. I expected the standard ghetto junkie story but 'The Corner' has an emotional pull that hits you right in the guts. I watched the show with friends and everybody was glued to the screen and the room was in total silence during this drama. The acting was incredible and the characters stay with you forever. I can't remember the last time that I genuinely couldn't wait to see the next episode of a programme. In my opinion this show is a lot better than 'The Wire' because it has heart in almost every character and you are desperate to see life improve for them. The Corner deserves a DVD release & I'll be the first in line to buy it. The cast & crew should be very proud of making a modern masterpiece.
