Why do filmmakers like Subhash Ghai show Indians as good people and NY people as bad people? Was a big question in my mind now even Rishi Kapoor feels the same in AALC which is very bad<br /><br />I mean please the superficial way of showing America puts people off and in today's overseas audiences dominating times this isn't good<br /><br />The first half moves in different lanes and the love triangle is done to death<br /><br />and the second half gets better a bit Akshaye's realization is well handled and then the film ends well but the sudden change of the other son is too much<br /><br />They are many problems in the film like the first half which moves in different lanes and not proper treatment is given to most of it<br /><br />Rishi Kapoor directs some dramatic scenes well but he needs to improve his storytelling, overall a decent debut by one of the finest actors as a director Music is okay<br /><br />Akshaye Khanna shines in his role, He was always a good actor but signed bad films those days Barring his receding hairstyle he leaves a huge impact as an actor Aishwarya is plastic as ever Rajesh Khanna is okay Kader Khan and Jaspal Bhati are good Satish Kaushik is funny Paresh Rawal is good
