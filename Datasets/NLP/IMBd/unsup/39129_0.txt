Having now watched it on Belgian (French)TV it's like having watched it on a 'plane ("free" in a kind of way) but I'd never pay to see it... The only time I've enjoyed seeing celebrities playing themselves was in that ancient movie "Around The World In Eighty Days" - you know, where Marcel Marceau actually spoke a word. Nor did many others say much. Johnny was 'introduced' in the film as an unknown "60-year old" - he looked more like 72 - so the makeup department were obviously under no pressure to conform. There was no originality in Hallyday's role; who else could he be, even in some parallel universe - in France and the francophone world? Given the fact he's sold virtually no records in the UK or the USA I can't see any story/style/communication that would connect outside France etc.If, as some have said, that the same scenario could be built around Cliff Richard, it would be for the Monthy Python team to construct it. The difference is that Python probably wouldn't want Sir Cliff used in person in such a production.
