The reason I am saying this, is simply because I don't understand the thought and the planing behind this movie.<br /><br />The story is really thin! The acting is horrible! The monsters are just plain stupid! This would be, to keep it short, a really bad movie, but..., (and this is what makes me confused) the effects are not that bad! The score is also quite good and the directing is not to bad either! Maybe the negative aspects of the movie, makes the positive ones seem REALLY good and vice versa, but there was something that kept me watching this film. <br /><br />I thought that it had to be some professional and experienced people that where part of the team behind this movie, since the sound, the directing and the effects where above average, but why would these people accept such terrible acting and bad storyline? I hoped that they just had to have taken some action and made a difference sooner or later before the movie ended! Something had to come up, that would make this movie worth watching before the end credits started! The movie just kept going and finally it ended!<br /><br />Nothing, of what I thought would happen, happened! This movie SUCKED and all I can think about afterwords is how some aspects of this movie where really good and some where terrible?!? Why not pay to get better actors and a better story and rather cut the budget a little on the effects and the score? That would have made this movie at least average, instead of "rock bottom"! Or, to put it this way, how can a director that can direct and a good special effects team, settle for all this other crap that this movie contains? Did they not see it? <br /><br />If everything in this movie was bad, I would understand, that would make sense, but this mix of top and bottom, I do not understand! Let this director, this composer and this special effects -team make a movie another time and hire new people fill in the rest of the staff! Then maybe, just maybe, they can make a movie that don't waste 92 min. of my life!
