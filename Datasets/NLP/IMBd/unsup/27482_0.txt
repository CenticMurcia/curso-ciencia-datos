I actually went to the trouble of registering for this website (which I love, and look at quite frequently)... Just to say that this was the absolute worst freekin' movie I've ever seen in my life. It's been bothering me for years and I just had to get it off my chest.<br /><br />I went to see this movie in '79 when I was a poor college student, and paid good money to get into the theater. Well, it was the most overly dramatic, self-indulgent piece of tripe I've ever witnessed. (See all the other negative comments here, they go for me too... in spades). I could go on and on about how much I disliked it, but I won't. It permanently turned me off to Bette Midler, no matter what her other talents may be. (Although she did redeem herself a bit in my opinion by her excellent guest role in that one Seinfeld episode). <br /><br />Good movies are almost sacred to me. Suffice it to say that this is the only movie I can ever remember walking out on in over 40 years. Don't waste your time. Any other crappy movie you can think of is better than this one. Wheeewwwww.... I feel better.
