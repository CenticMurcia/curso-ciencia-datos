Te acting is good i have to say... But my god, it is slow, and the script is so pretentious. And too too too much of the kid's speech problem come on. It made me want to slap him like 20 times!! Anyway what sort of film is it? It's pushing too much the witty comedy genre in vogue. Tired of this kind of stuff. Please make intelligent comedies but because they are intelligent. It seems that the point of this was to prove how many fancy words they can write. It is like the characters of Dawson's creek. Mixed with the wonder years, the girl name is even Ginny like Winnie. And what about the stereotypes like the funny intrusive Asian people and the pervert Indian.
