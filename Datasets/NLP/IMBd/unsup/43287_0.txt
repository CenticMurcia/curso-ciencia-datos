I bought the Pet and I really don't think it was remotely worth the money. The acting is not very good (the actors are very stiff and seem to be reading verbatim from cue cards, the quality of filming and cinematography is pretty poor, and the plot literally does not make sense (why do they need to train women to be human animals if they just want someone's kidneys? why would someone hang around people who sell body parts from pets if you have a pet, wouldn't you be just a little concerned about your own pets safety?).<br /><br />After watching the movie, I understand exactly why it wasn't distributed; Blue Velvet was more disturbing in terms of content so I know it wasn't the excessively boring nudity and crawling in the movie that made it untouchable. It was really just the poor quality of the movie itself.<br /><br />Personally I wouldn't have bothered with the movie if I knew all this beforehand, so buyer be warned!
