This may have been an awful movie, but I honestly appreciate it. I haven't laughed this hard in a long long time. I mean, the movie is about a 400-year-old medicine man who is reincarnated into a woman's back. If you don't know, a medicine man is a mystic in an Indian village. A doctor and such. A good guy. In this movie, however the medicine man that's growing in the woman's back is part of the occult and black magic. This message is made very clear when an old lady starts yelling, floating 6 inches off the ground, and throws herself down a flight of stairs, completely taking out the railing. But it gets better. Knowing that the situation is out of his hands, our dear Harry heads over to South Dakota to get the help of a real Indian. Here he finds "John Singing Rock". John agrees to help in exchange for tobacco. The Native American stereotypes are overwhelming in this movie. Throughout the movie this bulge on Kerin's back is getting bigger and bigger. The last 45 minutes or so are unbearably funny. Kerin finally "gives birth" to the medicine man. (It tears out of her back.) It turns out to be a naked midget that pretty much just stands there looking scary and disgusting. This is where all hell breaks lose. The hospital turns into an arctic cave. My favorite part is when the nurse's head flies across the room. Good old Harry discovers that he can temporarily get rid of the medicine man by throwing a typewriter at it. In the last ten minutes the hospital room turns into a galaxy of some sort. The special effects are amazingly bad. Suddenly Kerin's shirt falls off and a fully exposed Kerin kills the Medicine Man by somehow shooting lightning bolts at him. At this point everything goes back to normal. My favorite line is when after an entire movie about this medicine man, John Singing Rock goes "He got away!" and Harry goes "Who did?"
