In a woods cabin live a mother(Tracy Scoggins), a Quaker-alike, and his little son named Jeremiah. She always warns him on dangers of exterior world.But she's brutally murdered by a rednecks in presence of Jeremiah. Thirty years later he becomes into a deranged youth . Three couples(Mario Lopez,Bentley Mitchum, Jason Oliver and Justine Priestley, twin sister of Jason Priestley) go on a weekend hiking journey in the mountains. They stop in a strange location where encounter quirky local folk(Gary Busey)and run afoul into the van . But their misfortunes actually start when they do camp in an allegedly abandoned cabin that's not so empty they think; then the terror really begins. The psycho behemoth chases down and kills scabrously young people. Meanwhile a sheriff (Bo Hopkins)is investigating creepy deaths.... This is a customary splatter plenty of grisly killing,thrills,gruesome shocks, nauseating chills and quite boring. It relies heavily on old-fashioned buckets of blood and the plot remains the same of 'Slashers genre'. In the film appear usual actors from 'B series', such as Bo Hopkins, Gary Busey and Tracy Scoggins. Special cameo in flashback as a paramedic of David Naughton, the starring of the classic 'American werewolf in London'which the hikers comment when they're walking. The motion picture is badly directed by Sean Stanek. Another films about trippers trapped into woods and chased by killers or rednecks, are much better, such as the classic 'Deliverance', 'Wrong turn and Cabin fever' among others. Rating: bottom of barrel and below average.
