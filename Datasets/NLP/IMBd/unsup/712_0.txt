It is hilarious to see Robert DeNiro do spoofs on all his previous Mob characters. To see him crying after all the tough guys he has played it is really funny. Billy Crystal is excellent as his therapist who is trying to help him through his anxiety issues. I want to see it again so I can hear all the lines I missed the first time because I was laughing so hard. Rating 10
