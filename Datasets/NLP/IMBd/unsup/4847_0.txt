Mia Farrow stars in Woody Allen's "The Purple Rose of Cairo," a 1985 film also starring Jeff Daniels, Danny Aiello, John Wood, Zoe Caldwell, Van Johnson, and Milo O'Shea.<br /><br />Farrow is Cecilia, a waitress in New Jersey during the Depression who escapes from the reality of a dull job and an abusive, cheating husband (Aiello) by going to the movies. When a character, Tom Baxter, in the film, "The Purple Rose of Cairo" that she's seen many times recognizes her as a frequent patron, he steps off of the screen. He's sick of being in the movie and wants to be in the real world, and he declares his great love for Cecilia. When word reaches Hollywood that a character has walked off the screen, the actor who plays him, Gil Shepherd, comes to New Jersey to try to convince him to continue with the film. He, too, meets and falls for Cecilia. She has to decide which one she wants, the fantasy or the reality.<br /><br />This is a funny, romantic, bittersweet film about a lonely and unhappy woman. The film "The Purple Rose of Cairo" has some great New York stage actors in it, including John Wood and Zoe Caldwell, as well as Van Johnson and Deborah Rush. It's delightful. Farrow does a wonderful job as a vulnerable and frail Cecilia, who wants adventure and yet fears it at the same time.<br /><br />Some beautiful scenes in this very lyrical Woody Allen film.
