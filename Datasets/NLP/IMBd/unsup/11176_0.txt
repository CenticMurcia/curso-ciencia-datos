I really enjoyed the film. I review 3 or 4 films per week and simply base my critiques, on the way they make me feel. I was recently at a film festival at the Palms in Vegas and watched 3 different films. I felt this film was probably somewhat based on a true story, and that the people behind the film put alot of heart into it. Great film and I recommend it for families.
