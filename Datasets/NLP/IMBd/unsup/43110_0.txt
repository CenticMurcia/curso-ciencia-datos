I just suffered through 'Death of a President'. It consists of 100 minutes of fake interviews with the fake investigators of a fictional assassination of George W Bush. Even the killing itself was a bore...just the sound of a gunshot, and W bends over slightly before being shuffled into a waiting vehicle..just like the Reagan hit in the 80's. No, you don't get to see Chimpy's brains blown out. The rest of the film is just a sob story about how the poor Muslims are always getting blamed when anything bad happens to America. Sorry, I'm not buying it. Muslims WERE to blame for 9/11, and this piece of leftist garbage that vilifies the USA for acting against Muslim terrorists deserves the box office failure it received.
