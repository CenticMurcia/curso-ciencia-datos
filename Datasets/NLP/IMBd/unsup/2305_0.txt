This is Hollywood at it's ultimate best, the 1930's. When almost everything they made turned to solid gold and that's what you get while watching the highly enjoyable The Adventures of Robin Hood. This is the film that sealed Errol Flynn's stardom and made him a well known human being all throughout the world. He's at his most dashing and humourous, and know one can play Robin Hood better than he can. Kevin Costner doesn't even come close. This film has a great supporting cast and features that I think the most beautiful woman to ever grace the screen, Olivia DeHavilland. Great action sequences, especially the duel at the end with Flynn and Basil Rathbone, magnificient sets, great costumes and shot nicely in glorious technicolor make this film enjoyable for the entire family. Memo to Warner Bros: Why hasn't this film come out on DVD yet? ***1/2 out of ****
