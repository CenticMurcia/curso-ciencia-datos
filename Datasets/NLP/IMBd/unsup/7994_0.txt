You did it!!! You changed film. You did art, comedy, and pain. Thank you, thank you so much for starting something that everyone else who comes in 2nd needs. Thank you for putting yourself second, which puts you in 1st. <br /><br />People will talk of this film for years to come and what relevance it has to the film experience and shared pain. When you allowed the guy in the wheel chair to have honor, and all of them to have honor in everything it was breathtaking. <br /><br />The mom was sweet, the idea was inspired, and everything made sense. It's about damn time someone stepped up and made a film like this. It speaks to so many people you'd be amazed. I can count a billion 2nds and not many 1st's. Bravo!<br /><br />Best in show<br /><br />Best to go!
