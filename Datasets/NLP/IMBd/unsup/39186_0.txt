The poor script is the culprit in this failed project, not only is it a mere replica of any other sci-fi catastrophic movie ever made, it's a bad one at that. Don't watch this movie unless you want to learn what to avoid in movie making.<br /><br />Acting is OK though, thankfully the movie has some good actors but it doesn't come close to compensating for this hopeless flick. Had it not been for the acceptable acting I would have given it a 2 instead of a four.<br /><br />Even most of the graphical wizardry, which today is a standard part of a lot of movies and no longer any great obstacle to create, is poor and it even seemed they re-used a lot of animated shots a couple of times. Either that or it's just repetitive, which is almost just as bad.
