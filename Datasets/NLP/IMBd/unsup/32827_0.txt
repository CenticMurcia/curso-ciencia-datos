This movie who is supposed to be about the Jewish issue, is really nothing more than an absolute waste of time, except for one or two scenes. "The Believer" is just extremely poor. The scenes with his girlfriend are perfectly superflous and should not have been there at all. The so-called fascist family are incredibly bad casted and impossible to believe that these people are fascists, or should be in a movie with this theme at all. The main character too has absolutely no credibility. I suggest you see a documentary like "Hotel Terminus: Life and Times of Klaus Barbie" or some decent fictional movie which does not exploit its audience with superflous and hard-to-watch scenes of some actor trying to appear like something from reality. <br /><br /> <br /><br />
