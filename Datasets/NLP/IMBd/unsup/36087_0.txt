A hacked off bit of goofiness. More interested in impersonations than actual acting, for all the supporting roles. No time invested in developing any parts but the immediate family, yet time wasted in mentioning each star who ever crossed Natalie's path. Hard to believe Bogdanovich directed this rather than some high school kids. Natalie Wood was an interesting actress and lived an interesting life. I look forward to someday seeing a film of that, rather than this simplistic media gossip version of what was important about it. I guess I should have expected that from the title. The mystery is why we accept stuff like this. (Yes, I DID watch it after all.)
