I saw this movie in another country as "7 days." It's pretty good and Colin Gray O'Hara is totally hot! (?Spoiler?): the violence in one scene (culminating in the bathroom): we see it all second hand on video (mostly hear it), was pretty extreme by my standards. Reminded me of Al Pacino in Scarface or Paul Bettany in Gangster No. 1. All in all, though, a good two hours on Sunday afternoon. I hope we see more of Cherie Davis in the future too.
