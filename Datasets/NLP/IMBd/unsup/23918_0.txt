I saw Anything Else (2003) by Woody Allen recently and it reminded me just what a little firecracker of a movie this is. He is a person who has nurtured his child within through his life and I think of all his films of an autobiographical nature (most of them) this is way the best. The Jewish reverence for the family and their particular humour is practically edible in this wonderful homage to playfulness. One of my favourite scenes is when grandpa harnesses grannie into her corsets. So poignant and well.... loving. He plays on the soundtrack himself and along with most great directors displays a myriad of talents. This is a magnesium flare of pure memory that makes one smile.Vintage stuff.
