I just got back from this movie and I had to let people know...this is the worst film I have seen in a long time. The "acting" (if you can call it that), especially by DeNiro and McDormand is flat. The dialog is such a joke that the audience broke into laughter at one of most "dramatic" moments (during the scene in DeNiro's apartment with his new-found grandchild), DeNiro plays his character as one who seemingly has the intelligence of cotton ball. I could go on, but this movie doesn't deserve that much time. If ever there was a case for a refund at a theater, "City by the Sea" would be on the top of the evidence list.
