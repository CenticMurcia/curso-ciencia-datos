Absolutely the worst acting I have ever seen, camerawork the kind of which you would expect of a six year old with a camcorder and downright awful sound such as the background music which gave the impression of having been taken from the menu screen of a really bad low budget computer game and was just all over the place. Truly horrible in every way to see and hear, which, frankly, doesn't make for a good movie.
