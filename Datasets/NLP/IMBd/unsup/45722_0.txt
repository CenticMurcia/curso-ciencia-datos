It is ironic that director Fred Zinnemann once directed High Noon, arguably the most perfectly-paced film ever made. For with Five Days One Summer, 74 year old Zinnemann has made a film in which the pacing is so interminable that many viewers will surely lose patience and find themselves reaching for the "OFF" switch.<br /><br /> Middle-aged married doctor Douglas (Sean Connery) arrives in 1930s Switzerland with his niece/mistress for an alpine climbing holiday. Seems that Dr. Douglas has been having an affair with his niece Kate (Betsy Brantley) for some time, but the pair of them can never openly reveal their relationship as it would cast shame on the family. Douglas begins to realise that there is no future in the relationship, but he selfishly tries to cling onto his young lover regardless. Complications arise when handsome young mountain guide Johann (Lambert Wilson) appears on the scene, and Kate is immediately smitten....<br /><br /> Five Days One Summer is very nice to look at (full marks to cinematographer Giuseppe Rotunno) and Sean Connery gives one of the most multi-layered performances of his career in a very complex role. But the film's good points end there. Betsy Brantley is completely underwhelming as Kate - perhaps intimidated by Connery's performance, or perhaps not quite up to the demands of so challenging a role. But it's the pace, as mentioned, that really kills the film. You'll look long and hard for a film as slow-moving and utterly dull as this one.
