The cast of youthful aspirants in this contrived film are all so cheerful you want to slap them. It's ROMAN HOLIDAY meets BABES IN ARMS. Jane Powell appears as herself in her first film, playing a beleagured child star, who escapes and joins a youth hostel to pick vegetables and fruits (Don't ask!!!) She is insipidly awful when she tries to act and the plot is so ridiculous that one can't take it seriously, even within the context of a musical. Thank goodness there's Charlie McCarthy and W.C. Fields (in his last film) to add some bite and spice to the works. The film inexplicably earned Oscar noms for Scoring and Song. It looks for all the world like a Deanna Durbin vehicle and Miss Powell is directed to look and sing and move and behave as if she were the inimitable Ms. Durbin, but she's all falseness where Deanna was completely natural. A world of difference. Avoid unless you're a Powell fan and can forgive her.
