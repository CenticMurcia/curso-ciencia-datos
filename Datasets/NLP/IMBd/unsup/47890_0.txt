WARNING: Full of spoilers This movie might be okay on it's own, but if you've read the book you would know that it is almost completely unrelated to the original novel by Bryce Courtenay.<br /><br />It mixes up the characters, most of which aren't even included in the movie.<br /><br />For example, half of Hoppie Groenewalds boxing advice comes from Geel Piet. Then, Hoppie, who doesn't appear on the train, appears late in the movie as a boxing coach at a gymnasium.<br /><br />Also, Geel Piet, in the book, was a coloured man, hence "geel" which in Afrikaans means "yellow". The movie, however portrays him as a black man. This is very careless seeing as they even retain the name "geel".<br /><br />The movie also tends to remove nearly all of the biggest influences of Peekay's life and mostly include all of the less important things.<br /><br />Some other difference include the name of the chicken, his mother's death, the reason for nanny's leaving, the retaliation towards the judge at the boarding school and many more errors.<br /><br />All in all, don't watch the movie if you haven't read the book and if you watch the movie first don't expect the book to be related.
