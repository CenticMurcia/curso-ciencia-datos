Great movie, some say its slow but I think it ads to the real life situations, makes the jokes stand out more (which are all original). EVERYONE has acted superbly, with many CLASSIC scenes. Preity Zinta looks FANTASTIC, the songs are ALL very very listenable, and you dont get bored with them as you do with other movie songs. Young, hip-hop movie - everything we expect from movies. I am not a big indian movie fan I admit, but WE WANT DIL CHAHTA HAI 2 !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
