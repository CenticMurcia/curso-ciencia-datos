Macross The Movie: Love Do You Remember (as it is known here) is simply the greatest animated movie (both East and West) I've ever seen in my life. There's no animated movie in this world that comes close with it's deep and enduring story, great character development, great cast, the emotion and most of all the mecha-drama concept as defined by animation's greatest maker Shoji Kawmori! Lynn Minmay is the greatest female character of all, and you'll wish she's real! You'll feel like you're really part of the Macross universe as the battles and stories go on. You'll really be touched by the intense emotion of this film. You'll feel like you really want to fly a Valkyrie, then transform it into a Gerwalk or a Battroid to do battle for your race! And best of all, you'll realize the greatness of animation with this film.<br /><br />No doubt about it, Macross The Movie:LDYR is the GREATEST ANIMATED MOVIE in the world! You're missing something great if you don't see this.
