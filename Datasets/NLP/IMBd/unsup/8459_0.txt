I was in first grade when I saw it for my birthday and I remember liking it then. I thought it was funny, scary and full of action. <br /><br />But I am grown up now and it really struck a cord in me for some reason. It felt like a whole new movie with so much emotion. Yes, it's a great kid's movie but I can't explain why it's more emotional as an adult, Spielberg got some genuine performances out of everyone and the only thing that felt familiar was the amazing John Williams score. I remembered all the melodies somehow.<br /><br />As for the story, you really feel that there's lots at stake, sure there may be plot holes or whatever but I don't care, this movie is a BRAVE new re-imagining of the legend.<br /><br />Also Dustin Hoffman is still as intimidating as I remember him. In one scene he has this hilarious dramatic plea for attention where he pretends that he's going to commit suicide. I didn't understand it 18 years ago but it sure as hell is funny now!<br /><br />This movie is so worth watching if you're looking for a family movie and have kids of your own now.
