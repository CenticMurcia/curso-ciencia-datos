I just can't sell this movie folks, I thought it was dreadful. I'm someone who is normally content with both director {Joseph Kane} and star {Sterling Hayden} but here they are mired in weak plotting, bad acting and even worse accents. It also purports to be something of a mystery, which is daft since there isn't one!. Flimsy fights come and go, as do cheese laden songs, while the dialogue is as stilted {read from auto-cue it looks like} as can be. Republic Pictures do have many a fine B movie in the locker, but this isn't worthy of Z movie status.<br /><br />The plot sees Hayden as Tim Chipman, who returns home to find his father, owner of the family logging company, has been murdered. With money owed and a shifty rival in the offering, can Tim solve the mystery, fight off the baddies and once again move logs? Adapted from a novel written by Dan Cushman, of which I haven't read, I honestly don't know if the source material was any good to begin with? But this just doesn't work, either as an interesting story or as a competently executed one. Some decent train sequences catch the eye, and the location work at Glacier National Park is pleasing, if not helped by the less than standard Trucolor print. But really it's not even a time filler of a picture. 3/10
