If you find some things to be so stupid that they're hilarious, then this movie is for you. That is the point of this movie. However, if you rented/bought this movie expecting it to be a conventional comedy, then I recommend that you never rent/buy a comedy that has Ninja or Cheerleader in the title, let alone some combination of the two. I gave the movie a 2 because awful implies that it should never be watched under any circumstance. Cheerleader Ninjas is a solid choice if you're in Blockbuster and want to find the cheesiest movie they have. Going on a rant about how bad this movie was is a waste of breath. Also, if you could not tell by the title, the humor is very immature which can be a plus or a minus depending on your taste.
