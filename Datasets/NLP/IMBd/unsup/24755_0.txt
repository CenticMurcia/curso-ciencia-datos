The keyword is "based" because this movie is a true story but has a lot of fictional drama added to it to pique the interest of the viewers. The reason I can say this is because it is based on the true story about the disappearance and murder of my 5 year old niece. SPOILER:The main element that we wanted to bring across by allowing this movie to be produced for television was that your children may not always be safe around someone you know or a prominent citizen of the community. In this case the killer was a neighbor whom we had known for several years. My niece was friends with his children. He was a former police chief from a different town and was currently employed by the university police department. My sister did not turn vigilante (even tho she would have liked to) but we did not have an arrest until 5 1/2 years later.He confessed after being arrested for the kidnapping and rape of a 9 year old neighbor girl who thankfully escaped. All money was donated for lighting, playground equipment and a memorial for my niece in our local park.<br /><br />In response to "The Outcome of David Woodward" by jamie_arkansas40 David Woodward's trial was held in the Sedgwick County Courthouse, Wichita, Kansas in January of 1992. He received a 30 year sentence, release date May 26, 2021 unless he is granted parole before that date. Needless to say my family will be at any parole hearings to try to keep that from happening. inmate search page http://165.201.143.205/kasper2/offender.asp?id=25440<br /><br />My sister, Belinda, and Kim divorced several years after Amanda was murdered. She now lives in Kansas City, Kansas and Kim lives in San Antonio, Texas. They have both remarried but remain good friends. My sister could not have any more children due to medical reasons and Kim has two children from a previous marriage.
