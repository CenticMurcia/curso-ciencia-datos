This show sucks.<br /><br />The writing is so terrible I wonder sometimes if maybe it is actually non-existent and maybe George Stromboflofoapoplfous (I won't even waste one second of my life trying to figure out how to spell that name!) just makes stuff up as he goes and he just gets away with it because, well, I don't know why.<br /><br />The jokes are unfunny and terrible and predictable and always fall flat.<br /><br />The only good part of this show is some of the interviews are interesting depending on who the guest is and as bad as the material and writing are (I hate how every story is covered in like three seconds and we learn nothing beyond the day's basic headlines) George is a decent host and seems like a decent guy.<br /><br />I hate his show though, it sucks sucks sucks.
