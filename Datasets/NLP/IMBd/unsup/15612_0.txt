This could have been a much better film. Strangely, it seems to have been made by well-meaning amateurs (that includes the talented veteran actors who performed in a stilted manner and seemed rather lost). I found the historical content and some of the dialogue pleasing, but it became ultimately pointless. The ending was ridiculous and destroyed any credibility that may have existed up to that point. Others have commented on the film's realism. I did not experience that. The characters seemed unnatural and self-conscious, except for the young girl, who was adequate. There is no artistry here. I would prefer to view someone's home movies showcasing untrained actors and unplanned situations. I did think that Irene Pappas had a lovely voice and her moving rendition of the Greek song was a nice break from the tedium. What was Oliveira thinking?
