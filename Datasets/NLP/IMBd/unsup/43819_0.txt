Oh my this movie was bad. It might have been better had Richard Gere not played the part of Sir Lancelot. Someone should have had a talk with the casting director. It is the story we have come to know for those of us who have followed the King Aurther and the Knights of the Round Table myth. Sean Connery plays the role of Arthur but brings nothing to the part that is interesting, and walks around stiff and delivers his lines like he wants to speed things up. Julia Ormond plays Guinevere and also brings no charm to the part. Ben Cross is the villain as Prince Malagant and really is the only interesting character in the film. Gere well, just hangs in the woods a lot.<br /><br />Want to see a better film about King Auther and the knights of the Round Table? See John Borman's stylish Excalibur.
