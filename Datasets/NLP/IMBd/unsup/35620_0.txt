If you wind up watching this film you're watching the *wrong* film in more than one sense. You want the other 'Double Jeopardy'. Or at the very least another 'Double Jeopardy'. That's the problem with titling a film after a specific legal clause. And the reason why calling a work 'Murder' is to be avoided.<br /><br />Shortly, 'Double Jeopardy' is the story of making out in a police car, a paternity suit, an inexplicable killing, and a unanimous guilty verdict. I was awaiting the unfathomable twist just as it failed to happen. This oddly straightforward piece of work does appear to have overlooked some essentials of the genre; intrigue, psychology, doubt etc. It is rather like playing Cluedo with one character, one room and the candlestick holder. On your own.<br /><br />That said Brittany Murphy looked lovely and Italian and I must confess I watched it through to end. Though I fear this says more about me than the film. The most frustrating thing is that it's not really concerned with Double Jeopardy at all. However the lack of respect shown for court proceedings and criminal procedure was delightful.
