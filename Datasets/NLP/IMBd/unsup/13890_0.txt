I think it sad that in this time and age there is so much homophobia.As a lesbian I can relate to the two main characters.I think lesbians and gay men should have the right to raise a child,get married and have all the equal rights as heteros do.No one should be discriminated no matter what their sexual preference should be.We are all just human beings and we should all accept each other one way or the other and stop all this hate in the world.What is so wrong in two women or two men loving each other? We are not harming anyone.It's just love no matter what sexual preference,religion,or race the person is.Is it so wrong to love one another with all the hate that goes on in the world everyday.
