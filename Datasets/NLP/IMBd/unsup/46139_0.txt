This one is among the worst Mani Ratnam movies I have seen. Not that Mani Ratnam is a great director in my opinion - he's just among the better ones in Bollywood full of third rate directors. But this movie has nothing to commend itself. The movie is supposed to be based on historical incidents, but there is no accuracy in any of the incidents depicted. I would rather read Times of India. It's a totally crap commercial movie, trying to find balance in the 1992/93 massacre, where there was no balance shown by Shiv Sena government or the police force in Mumbai. In a supposedly serious movie, there are unbelievable number of trash and irrelevant songs and dances. While the riot scenes are being shown, there is a background song on the virtues of unity and harmony. Total waste of 3 hours.
