This movie is a must see.<br /><br />I would like to say that I enjoyed reading the excellent comments of others about this movie. I was just as moved by this movie as most of you. I would like join you in my praise for this movie.<br /><br />I was awe struck throughout this movie. Watching Black Robe, was like actually being there. It was as if I had heard about this place and these people but now I was transported in time. This may sound trivial but it is the best way to express my reaction. Througout the movie I strained to see every detail in every scene. I tried to catch every nuance. It seemed so real that I expected to smell the smoke, the water, roasted meat etc.<br /><br />The cinematagraphy was incredible. It is refreshing to see a movie that does not rely 100% on special effects for its 'cinematagraphy'. The scenes from altitude showing the line of canoes paddling through the vast wilderness were awesome. The sound track was powerful. The camera was able to create sensations of fear, abandonment, helplessness that were so vivid.<br /><br />The dialog was superbly realistic. Facial expressions were used more than words to convey thoughts. What little was said was in such simple short sentences that got to the point. It is just what I would expect from the no non-sense Indians interacting with an idealistic priest.<br /><br />I am not a history or anthropology expert but I feel that the movie was highly accurate. The director portrayed both cultures bias free (a rash statement to make). The director allowed the viewer to condemn or extol either culture. In the end I felt like the young Frenchman- I could see both cultures for what they were - not good and not bad but coping with the situation at hand.<br /><br />The importance of religion (both Christain and Indian) in everyday life is very well depicted. The Catholic religion is portrayed on equal footing with Indian religion. To White man and Indian alike, both appeared mystical beyond comprehension. The dilemma of which culture, which religion to choose was well depicted with the young Frenchman. However the same dilemma existed for the Indians. Everyone had to choose and each choice took them in a different direction. It seems that in order to survive it is best to be able to switch back and forth at will.<br /><br />I feel that the movie McCabe & Mrs. Miller in some ways addresses the same sort of issues. A California gold rush mining town advances toward 'civilization' when a whore house and a church arrive at the same time. I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed Black Robe. It is one of an extremely few Hollywood movies that I could recommend.
