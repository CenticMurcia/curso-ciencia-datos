The killer in this film is the treachery of the supporting actors. I'm not one to endorse crooked cops or domestic violence, but when you see these birds in action, you understand why Cagney rules his roost the way he does.VERY underrated,very fast and colorful. Post "White Heat" and Jimmy STILL has a fresh arsenal 1 year later. A must see with a great death scene.
