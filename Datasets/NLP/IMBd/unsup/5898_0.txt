I thought this movie was incredible. It's not the book, but what movie is? I'm not actually married to a time traveler, I'm married to a soldier and this movie, Rachel McAdams feelings scream about every thought I've ever had. Even though it's in the book the quote "Long ago, men went to sea, and women waited for them, standing on the edge of the water, scanning the horizon for the tiny ship. Now I wait for Henry. He vanishes unwillingly, without warning. I wait for him. Each moment that I wait feels like a year, an eternity. Each moment is as slow and transparent as glass. Through each moment I can see infinite moments lined up, waiting. Why has he gone where I cannot follow?" Should have been in the movie cause it was so moving! I loved this movie entirely. My husband wasn't a huge fan. He felt there wasn't enough of a plot. But overall it's about being away from the one you love.
