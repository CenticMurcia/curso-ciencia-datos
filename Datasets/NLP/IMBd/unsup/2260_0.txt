This is probably the hottest film I have ever seen. It is the story of an author and three of his lovers, focusing on the great love of his life, Lucia. All of these women make permanent impressions on Lorenzo, although he only intends make make anything lasting with Lucia. He has a one-night stand with a woman at the beach, who bears a daughter. He has a one-night stand years later with his daughter's baby sitter, and simultaneously his daughter is killed.<br /><br />What's the symbolism? I don't know. What I do know is that this is a thougtful, beautiful film full of naked sizzling Spaniards getting it on. This is well worth a couple of hours of viewing time.
