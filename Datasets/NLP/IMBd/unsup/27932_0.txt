This is yet another mass-market formula-flick from the (in)famous RGV factory. Well, that should give viewers an idea of what (not) to expect.<br /><br />Its difficult to recall which movie this was copied from. The multiple stories remind you of the teen slasher flicks such as "Scream", "I Know What You Did Last Summer", "Scary Movie", et al.<br /><br />The direction is direction-less and not much can be said about the cast or their acting (!), or lack of, or whatever. Yawn. What next? Maybe they should try copying "The Blair Witch Project" ... but one wonders how they'd pull it off?!<br /><br />This is pretty bad stuff -- a 1 out of 10.
