McG and team have managed to rejuvenate my interest in the Terminator series, well done, a great movie. I just hope that you have kept enough back for the next two movies! I had some reservations about this movie after seeing the initial IMDb ratings and director McG's efforts on Charlie's Angels, admittedly an altogether different movie, but it left me with the impression McG was a bit of a goofy idiot. Maybe he just got caught up in a moment of goofy bliss while working with Cameron & Drew.<br /><br />I've heard that some people can't get into this movie, and maybe the difference in opinion is somehow linked to ties with the first three movies. Some may have only seen the third (poor) movie and the TV series (good 1st season) which wouldn't really help you here. It's not essential, but it would help to see the 1st and 2nd movies so you can appreciate the threads McG has wound into this movie.<br /><br />Knowing that Christian Bale was in the lead role certainly helped maintain my interest, serious actors help bring weight to a movie, and I have to say Sam Worthington was excellent too, he was the perfect match for Bale, and I'm sure he's going to be big in years to come.<br /><br />I'm very happy I went along to see it now, and afterword's I even felt that movie buzz that I haven't had since Dark Knight. 8/10.
