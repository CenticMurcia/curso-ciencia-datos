Dante and Randal are perfectly contrasted men, each one being the perfect antithesis of the other. Dante's glass is obviously half empty, while Randal's is constantly being refilled. I love to see these two characters interact, no matter what they're talking about. Smith's short film, "The Flying Car", shown on The Tonight Show (a few years back) is a perfect example of the character's wonderful chemistry. <br /><br />Also, the man who played the old Jewish man (Al Berkowitz) was by far my favorite actor. I wish I could see him in some other role.<br /><br />Many have accused this film of being unnesessarily profane and disgusting, but I feel that intermittent f-bombs and terms like "jizz-mopper" are crucial elements of the character's identity, and quite frankly are words our society DOES use. Art imitates life, as they say. <br /><br />This is Kevin Smith's funniest and finest story. The directing/photography leaves something to be desired, but as a green filmmaker myself, I appreciate Smith sticking his neck out and doing something like this. It gives me hope for my own films.
