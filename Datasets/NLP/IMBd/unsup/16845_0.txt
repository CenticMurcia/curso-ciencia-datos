Somewhat unusual for a Hitchcock film, I found myself drawn in and actually enjoyed it. I think that probably had all to do with the performance of Charles Laughton as the haughty squire, Sir Humphrey Pengallan. There's no two ways about his wickedness, he's a perfect cad - just catch the way he sizes up Maureen O'Hara's character when she first makes her appearance at his home. And oh, those eyebrows! - you'll marvel at the makeup job that just adds to the extreme of Laughton's over acting. Oh, and one other thing - it's hard to understand what he's saying sometimes, but he's so entertaining in the delivery that you just don't seem to mind so much.<br /><br />The story itself deals with a band of cutthroats, thieves and smugglers on the Cornish Coast of England, while the dark and moody atmosphere of the picture gives it the feel of a pirate film that mostly takes place on land. Laughton's Pengallan is the mastermind that pulls the strings on waylaying ships to their doom on the stormy coastline. Robert Newton appears as the anti-pirate in this one, and after narrowly escaping death at the hands of Joss Merlyn's (Leslie Banks) rowdy bunch, he takes charge to bring Pengallan to his ultimate demise.<br /><br />Here's something to keep an eye out for. After Trehearne (Newton) and Mary (O'Hara) escape from the villains by swimming out to their boat, they wind up seeking refuge at Pengallan's home. While still in his soaking clothes, Trehearne pulls a dry folded piece of paper from his pocket. How'd he do that?<br /><br />As most of the comments on this board suggest, the film deserves a chance, even if it doesn't hold up well for the professional critics. The best way to view it would probably be late at night, with a nice warm brandy to take off the evening chill. A dark and stormy night would do just fine in keeping with the on screen atmosphere. I think Pengallan would agree.
