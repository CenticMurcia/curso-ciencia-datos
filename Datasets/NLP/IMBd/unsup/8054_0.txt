To all the people who are babbling about how the movie had no plot,I've got words 4 things to say to you- 1.Its a Exploitation flick. 2.Its Italian Exploitation flick. 3.Its is a "classic" Italian Exploitation flick. 4.Its a Cult flick(Enjoyed by some and despised by most)<br /><br />The reason i didn't give it full marks is that it doesn't have as much nudity as i wished for,but still pretty good.It has very good atmosphere which i totally love about these movies and the wooden acting also makes me happy.If i want to see great acting i would watch a Mira Nair film. The lead actress is absolutely gorgeous with a great body,and she would do great in my classic exploit collection.
