While it's not universally acclaimed as such, Ruggero Deodato's Cannibal Holocaust is a masterpiece. A lot of the other cannibal flicks hailing from Italy (and elsewhere) aren't masterpieces, however and this is certainly the case with The Green Inferno a.k.a. "Cannibal Holocaust 2". Quite why this film gets to be called Cannibal Holocaust 2 when many better films get stuck with thinking of their own title is beyond me, but there's no way that The Green Inferno deserves to be associated with the Ruggero Deodato film. The film is a sort of cross between an adventure film and a nasty cannibal flick, though it's not as nasty as the genre's "big" films, and the adventure side of it doesn't work too well either considering that the film is completely boring! Nothing that Cannibal Holocaust great features here; the jungle setting is not well used, the natives never really feel like they're posing a threat and the film doesn't manage to be disturbing in the least - something that can never be said for Cannibal Holocaust. There's really not much else to say for this film; if I could go back in time to be before I saw it, I wouldn't see it. If you're looking for something like this that does work Â– see the brilliant Massacre in Dinosaur Valley!
