I'm sorry but this movie was horrible. The acting was dismal and other than than the other guy magician, so was the magic. I am a magician so I was really excited about this movie and couldn't wait to see some magic but it was so not entertaining. Danny's magic was stupid, so was that girl's. The other contestant's magic was pretty cool I forget his name but other than that, it was not entertaining. Just think about that last "trick". That wasn't a trick at all. If a real magician tried that at a show, at best he get applause so little, he wouldn't be booed. Like I said, other than the contestant that did Harry Blackstone's floating light bulb, everyone else was horrible.
