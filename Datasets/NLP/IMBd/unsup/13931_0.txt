Hi, My name is Mark Zara I was one of the members of a South Australia band called Static. In the 70,s we were gathering a following in Adelaide playing pubs ,clubs and large venue,s and were approached to write a few songs for the film.After putting the songs together in a short time,we went into a recording studio and laid down 3 tracks Unfortunately the songs can only be heard on the plumbers radio while he,s working, and even then it,s you can barely hear it. At lest we got a credit at the end of the film I,d didn't see the film until the mid 1980,s a didn't think it was much of a horror movie, I found it laughable in parts hope I gave some help Mark
