Total stinker involving Ginger Rogers who says no to 3 guys during her wedding ceremonies.<br /><br />She finally meets up with Cornel Wilde, dressed as an Indian, at a station. Wilde is supposed to be some guardian angel.<br /><br />The film is an absolutely stupid series of events where Wilde emerges as a fireman, the only true love for Rogers. Seems that the two of them knew each other years before when she was 6. He also has left 3 women at the altar.<br /><br />The film might have been better had it try to develop further the relationship between a wealthy society girl and a fireman.<br /><br />Wilde looks like he is having a good time here. The audience certainly was not.
