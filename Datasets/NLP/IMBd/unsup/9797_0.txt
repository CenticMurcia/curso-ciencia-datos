Loose Change is a documentary created by three college students. The documentary looks to answer a very important question... what happened on 9/11? Their theories? Let's take a look: <br /><br />1) The U.S. government planned and orchestrated the attacks on its own soil, causing the deaths of more than 3000 innocent people. To try to prove that the government is capable of such a thing, they make a reference to a fake terrorist attack, which was to be carried out in Cuba in the 1960s. The only catch is, nobody in that "attack" was supposed to be injured. I fail to see what this has to do with 9/11. Now, I'm not a big fan of the U.S. government. Matter of fact, I cannot stand it, along with Bush. But to actually suggest that they would be able to carry out such a horrible act, both morally and tactically, AND keep it a secret is ludicrous! <br /><br />2) The Pentagon wasn't hit by flight 77... it was hit by a cruise missile. They try to prove this by saying that there is a lack of plane parts, and the parts that are there are not from a 757. Brilliant! I don't know how they missed the mountains of debris sitting on the lawn of the Pentagon. And anyone with half a brain could figure out that if a plane hit a building, it would leave a hole, not a cookie-cutter outline of an airplane like in a cartoon.<br /><br />3) The WTC towers collapsed because they were rigged with explosives, and it was a planned implosion. Again, brilliant. They also say that the plane "barely hit" tower 2. That really got me angry. The plane flew into it at 500+ knots. If it was a planned implosion, how, oh wise college students, could they rig both of the ENTIRE buildings without anyone noticing? <br /><br />4) Flight 93 didn't crash. It landed safe and sound in Cleveland, Ohio, and the passengers somehow magically disappeared. The phone calls from the planes were all faked. It is "impossible" to make cell phone calls from that altitude. All I can say is, how do these people sleep at night? How on earth do they have the audacity to make such an outrageous claim! <br /><br />5) The attacks had nothing to do with Osama bin Laden because, get this, he said so! He said he had nothing to do with it. So the creators disregard the mountains of evidence that proves what really happened on 9/11 and they take Osama's word as it were sacred. Why don't you just spit on the victims' graves? <br /><br />Loose Change is a documentary filled with half-truths, speculation, quotes taken out of context, poor research, logical fallacies, distorted facts, and testimonials from other conspiracy theorists. The research done by these guys was very poor. Not ONCE do they even attempt to actually contact a real expert, because that would disprove their theories right away. The so-called experts that they use are themselves conspiracy theorists. All of the news sources quoted in the film are from right after the attacks. As a matter of fact, I don't think there is a single news article quoted that was from after 2001. A lot of times, the creators are dishonest. And what really gets my blood boiling is that these guys take their opinions and theories and state them as fact! Unbelievable.<br /><br />You should always question everything before believing it, and that includes garbage like this. Throughout the whole thing, I don't think they prove a single point. I don't think they even have one. Loose Change is misleading and dishonest at best, and downright offensive at worst.<br /><br />Recommended reading: http://www.loosechangeguide.com/LooseChangeGuide.html
