My 11th grade Student's Against Drunk Driving awareness video shot with a five-year-old betamax camera and edited between two vcr's was better quality than this. It is so unbelievably, astonishingly bad that I can't believe it was broadcast on any form of television. You will not believe your eyes. The quality of the story, the acting, the dialogue, the sound and the music are inferior to any 70s porn movie ever made, only without the nudity to keep it interesting. You show me any movie, including any wedding videos or barmitzvahs, and I will bet you any amount of money that R.O.T.O.R. is worse. It is the worst thing ever committed to film. Excuse me while I pluck out my eyes.
