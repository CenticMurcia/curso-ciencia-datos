I wasnt sure what to expect from this movie because i knew it combined my favourite actor De Niro's stongest(Gangster roll) and weakest (Comedy)acting aspects in one film . Any worries i had soon were dispelled because i loved the film. Crystal and De Niro worked like a comedy duo that had been together for years. The story is of a Gangster who starts to have emotional problems and panic attacks due to the death of his father 35 years ago.The ensuing antics result in a very funny and action packed cracker of a film. Dont miss it! 9 out of 10.
