If you like Paul Verhoeven's later work (Robocop, Total Recall, Black Book), you should take the time to delve into his Dutch language work.<br /><br />This is a serious work showing class differences in 19th Century Holland, and the total lack of concern for workers. The title character takes a slew of meaningless jobs after the family is forced to move to the city, eventually ending up as a prostitute to survive.<br /><br />Hearing the typical "streets paved with gold" dreams that were typical of America at that time, we can totally relate to those driven from their farms.<br /><br />Women were certainly toys for men, even doctors, to play with, and rape, if they chose.<br /><br />It was interesting to see Rutgar Hauer in a role as a gentlemen, and the experience of Monique van de Ven was not to be missed.
