By definition, I'd really refer to this as a shocker film rather than as a scary movie. This film prefers special effects and disturbing, bloody scenes to say suspense or good writing. The acting was sub-par at best, though I would say it may be Chris Kattan's best job yet. Average cut between shots has to be in the milli-seconds. The shot selection bounced so much I began having a headache. The only movie with more cuts was probably Domino. The ending was sub-par. The movie seemed to want to incorporate too many themes for one horror movie: killer husband/wife, haunted house, deranged surgeons, ancient evil, etc. The best part of the movie was that at very least they had the decency to set the tone early to let you know what was going to be coming at you. That being said, I did watch it all the way through, so it clearly wasn't as bad as it could have been.
