Because this movie is a waste of talent and time. If you have seen the movie trailer, you've seen most of the movie. Granted,I usually like Harrison Ford, and this was a good role for him. However, Robert Zemeckis seems to be obsessed with rich and affluent white people than about the horror story that this movie is suppossed to be about. I think everything in the movie came out of L.L. Bean. Anyways, I'm digressing...the movie is just plain bad...sure there is suspense in this movie, but it's minute. How many times are we suppossed to believe that Michelle Pfiefer is going to go into that bathroom? And another thing, I'm all about adapting or taking some part of a previous movie and use it as an homage to great directors or movies, but I am tired of Zemeckis ripping off other movies and directors. Watch Diabolique or any good Hitchcock film and save yourself 2 hours of this immeasurable bore of a movie.<br /><br />
