Okay, if you can look past the fact that the "comedy team" (a term used very loosely here)is just a rip off of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, and the fact that Lugosi is only here because he was taking any and every role he was offered at this point, it's actually almost funny on it's own, even though most of the time I laughed at the parts that weren't supposed to be funny, and groaned at the parts that were trying to be funny, but were ultimately just embarrassing. There were a few funny bits and pieces here and there...if you can forgive the duo for being carbon copies of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis. Plus Lugosi can make anything watchable, if not respectable. Basically the story, if you can call it a story, is about the aforementioned "comedy team" crash landing on an island inhabited by mad scientist... I'm not even going to tell you who it is, it's so obvious by the title, who wants to turn a man into an ape. The characters run around like idiots for awhile, and the movie ends with a great, disappointing cop-out, presumably because the filmmakers couldn't figure out a better way to end it. It's really sad when your second best actor behind Lugosi is a monkey from the Tarzan movies named "Cheeta".
