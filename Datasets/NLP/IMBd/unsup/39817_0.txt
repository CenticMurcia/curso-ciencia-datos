Dave H., for being a movie reviewer, you sure don't know the first thing about rating one.<br /><br />"I'm a movie reviewer for a Massachusetts radio station. I recently saw Latin Kingz. This movie is a brutally realistic view of the street/ drug crowd with all of it's nasty behavior, womanizing and seedy undertones. It is rare to see a film come so close to portraying the reality of life on the Urban streets.<br /><br />Dave H. Movie Reviewer-WRNX Radio"<br /><br />"The reality of life on the Ubran streets"? Are you kidding me? Was the "brutally realistic view," as you so elegantly put it, before or after the exploitation of porno shots from Latina girls parading around on the beach shore? Or was it in the 2 actual instances of confrontation (one being quelled just as quick as it began)? There was nothing "real" about this story, it was just another sub-par movie filmed on an extremely low budget. The "actors" (and I use that term loosely) were horrible, the plot was hackneyed, and the "violence," as it states on the cover, was minimum. This is basically a ghetto version of "Road Trip," which also sucked.<br /><br />Come off it and come to your senses -- this movie defines all the things that makes a movie wretched. People, don't waste your money, time, or energy on this trash. Anyone who tells you this is good viewing is obviously misguided; don't fall into their trap.
