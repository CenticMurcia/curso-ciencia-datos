Circumstances force a playboy and artist to date a teenager who has a crush on him. It plays like a situation comedy, which is not surprising because it was written by Sheldon, who would go on to create TV sitcoms. What is surprising is that Sheldon won an Oscar for his screenplay. While it is pleasant enough, it never rises to the level one would expect given the star presence. Grant and Loy are the main attractions here and they do what they can with characters that are not very well drawn. It is described as a screwball comedy but there aren't enough laughs. Perhaps a director like Howard Hawks could have done more with it.
