I'm a 14 year old and I still love this movie! why? Because Thomas the Tank engine has been a part of my youth since I was a baby! And since I like trains naturally, this was perfect.<br /><br />One thing I liked was the plot, An evil Diesel with a giant claw who's trying to find a magic engine so he can destroy all steam engines. Short, sweet, and to the point! Not that complicated! unlike some movies *Cough* LordoftheRings! *Cough* Another thing was the change from small little action figures to actual humans! And I got a feeling of nostalgia when I saw they kept the same woman from the Shining Time Station series.<br /><br />Also, It's a nice change to see someone who's a true..."Villain" In the Thomas Series. Overall, this is a great movie for kids, and teens who are looking to relive some happy memories of their youth.
