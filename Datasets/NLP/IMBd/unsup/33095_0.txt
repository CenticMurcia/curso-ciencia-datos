A film thought lost turned up a few months ago on TCM and I finally did get to see it. Stingaree is one curious and horribly miscast film which not even the presence of favorites of mine like Henry Stephenson and Mary Boland can save.<br /><br />Set in Australia in the 1870s, specifically in Victoria we don't see as much as one kangaroo in Stingaree. The presence of a lot of sheep being herded is supposed to make us think we're in Australia. When I finally saw The Sundowners which was actually filmed in Australia, I certainly saw the weakness of things like Stingaree made on the RKO back lot.<br /><br />But no Americans companies were location shooting that far in 1934 so I can be charitable there. But stolid Richard Dix is cast in a role that someone like Errol Flynn might have made believable. Or Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., or Tyrone Power or Louis Hayward anyone with that swashbuckling Ã©lan. Dix just looks silly up there spouting those romantic nothings.<br /><br />Irene Dunne is the lonely ward of Henry Stephenson and Mary Boland who accompanies Boland because Boland fancies she can sing. And she's going to sing come hell or high water for visiting British composer Geoffrey Tearle. <br /><br />Dunne is told not to emote as much as low A from her range when Tearle's around. But when she mistakes the notorious bandit Stingaree for the composer, they're taken with each other. He kidnaps Dunne and later forces a gunpoint addition for the real composer and it costs him his freedom. <br /><br />The rest of the film is too unbelievable to describe you have to see it to confirm, but not to be entertained. Even Mary Boland who usually can save anything with her flighty portrayals doesn't go over well. It's not in her character to throw Dunne out of the house because she was upstaged. Boland is irresponsible and flighty, but never a mean person on the screen.<br /><br />A lot of forgettable songs are included here and the whole film is best forgotten. Good thing none of the cast is still around to be embarrassed.
