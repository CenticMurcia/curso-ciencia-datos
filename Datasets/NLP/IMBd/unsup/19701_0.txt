This little mini series is among the best I've ever seen. The actors are committed to their work, the story is believable, yet uncommon enough (to many people) to be appealing.<br /><br />Katie Blake does a superb appearance as Helen, a teenager about to finish school and go to college, when "Dear Nobody" shows up and turns her world up side down with a tough decision to make and some well hidden family secrets to discover<br /><br />Sean Maguire as her boyfriend also delivers a solid performance, but not quite reaching up to Blake's standard. To me he's too much of the stereotypical handsome male. Rough features, a squared jaw and not a freckle or a zit for miles around. But let's not hold that against him. He does after all perform admirably and manages to convey the anxiety any teenage boy in his position would feel.<br /><br />In closing:<br /><br />Watch this series and ponder the moral dilemma it does in fact present. Or just watch it and be entertained by the actors and mesmerized by Katie Blake's beauty. Like I did.<br /><br />
