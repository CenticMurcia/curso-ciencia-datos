This one has to be one of his best, on a par with his speech in the closing scene of The Great Dicatator 1940! I'll admit I was never much of a Chaplin fan in the past, until I saw these two in the past couple of years. His early Essanay works I didn't like at all, full of gratuitous, senseless violence masking as comedy (people knocking the crap out each other for no apparent reason)but Dictator, and Circus touch the heart as no others do! The film, as a whole, is rather drab & slow, Chaplin playing the Tramp as a circus act, (not discounting his own tightrope work), but the closing scene, as the circus moves on and he's left alone, with only a picture of his love, and his Tramp walk into the sunset, makes it an emotionally powerful piece to watch, giving us glimpse of Chaplin's inner self, not to be found anywhere else, but hidden beneath his character. A must-see for those who enjoy a heartwarming story!
