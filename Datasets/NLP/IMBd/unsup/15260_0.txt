Charley Chase wants to play poker with the boys, but his straight-laced wife won't let him. This leads to a great song, 'I'm in the Dog House Tonight,' that Charley sings to his pals over the telephone, explaining why he can't make it. The next day, while playing golf, he shoots a miraculous putt and claims he 'hypnotized the ball' into the hole. His best friend challenges Charley to prove it by hypnotizing him and while Charley works his hocus pocus, an errant golf ball beans his pal, stunning him into a zombie-like state. Both men believe the trance was the result of Charley's powers. The next time Charley want to go out for poker night, he tries mesmerizing his spouse. She is wise to him though, having seen what really happened on the golf course.<br /><br />SPOILERS: The Missus pretends to be under his spell by not only agreeing to her husband going out with the boys, but deciding to get dolled up and go out on the town herself! She whispers instructions to the maid to leave the back door open as she isn't really going out, but will pretend to, then have the taxi driver drop her off in the alley. Charlie, not liking it a bit the goose is gandering, follows his wife. They keep bumping into each other back at the homestead, making up creative excuses as to why they returned. Finally, they end up in a night club creating havoc until a real hypnotist is brought in to save the day. The problem is, the wife now hypnotizes the specialist and gives Charley the chase! Not one of the best Chase comedies, but it has several funny moments.
