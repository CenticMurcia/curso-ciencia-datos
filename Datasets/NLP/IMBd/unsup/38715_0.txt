I don't have any problem with them making this movie and if people enjoy it, that's great! The problem is the morons that take a movie that has bits and pieces of reality and they assume that it is real. Movies are fiction, pure and simple. From Michael Moore to JFK, they can say it is reality, but the very act of making a movie changes reality, even if they have good intentions. This movie, like most others, was made for entertainment purposes. The people who made it were very clever to capitalize on what are hot controversies in their part of the world, but it is still just fiction. The truth doesn't sell, that is why we are seeing a disturbing trend of "based on a true story" movies that really have very little to do with what actually happened. Go see this movie if you want, and you might enjoy it, but please remember IT IS ONLY A MOVIE!
