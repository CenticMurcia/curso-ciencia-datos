John Woo is a true artist, and he lets it show in this movie. More than any other contemporary action director, he paid real attention to the style of gun battles. And that's what this movie is: lots and lots of gun battles. There is nothing else. Just bullets flying, people dying. So after you get over how massively influential and incredibly cool this movie was and is, you might feel a little hollow from the relentless nature of the violence. It wasn't quite as bad as Natural Born Killers in this respect, but I still felt slightly queasy after two hours. But maybe it's good that extreme violence can still shock me...
