OK, three words: WORST MOVIE EVER!!!<br /><br />Generally I'm into that kind of "horror" b-movies a lot. But this one was by far the most outrageously ridiculous of each and everyone I had ever seen...<br /><br />First, it wasn't scary. But that's OK because only a few of them are. Second, it didn't have a plot. Again, that's OK because even fewer do. Third, the acting was pathetic (I guess my goldfish could be more convincing). Yes, once more that's OK because none of us watches these movies for their Oscar-deserving performances. But what I simply found totally insane was that it wasn't even funny!<br /><br />What's the point in watching a splatter b-movie if there's no laugh - at least?<br /><br />Yes, this movie is groundbreaking after all. Groundbreakingly meaningless!
