I have seen the movie and read reviews that were posted about the movie Indigo.I never even heard about the movie until a week or so before the showing.I personally know one of these children,most of the time he is just a normal little boy like any other child,he doesn't do a lot of the things that Gracie does,but I believe that her character was just a mix of their gifts to show what they can do.The main point of the movie that I feel is the most important is that they are here to bring out the truth,they can see behind what adults and others tell them.You will not pull the wool over their eyes,they CAN see right through you and read what is in your heart,your pain from the past wrongs in your life.And also the good things about you.They can and will heal the planet.The other thing I feel about them is that through the real truth, they will bring peace wherever they go.They came here with their switches turned on,in the past people have had to go through a life changing experience to be enlightened.Near death experience comes to mind.I pray that I meet more Indigo's,If you meet one you will never forget it,he sometimes looks at you suddenly from a break at playing and tells you something about what has been troubling you for some time,then he has that all knowing smile and off they go playing again. I pray that you you all will experience the knowing that they have.Please forgive me if my spelling is not that good,I don't do this normally.Get ready for the truth,it is here.
