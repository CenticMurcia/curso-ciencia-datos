This movie is great. Nice humor and Tim Conway and Don Knotts is always great together. The kids love this movie. We watch it daily. Even our 2 year old watches it. Our five year old laughs so much. Highly recommended. If you like violence, sex then you won't like this. But for good clean humor and entertainment this is it. The little innuendos is cute and so you laugh over and over at them. The facial expressions also keep you laughing and laughing. Our kids even got the poetry in this movie. I appreciate that they did not have to use fowl language and even though Hilda shows "some" bosom, It is not overly used. I had wondered if she would be in it a lot. I was pleased to see she wasn't therefore our whole family could enjoy the clean fun.
