Predictable. Hokey. Waste of time. Don't see it.<br /><br />The title ruins the movie. A lot of their survival tips were completely ridiculous ('don't drink seawater' was the only acceptable one).<br /><br />The acting was poor, but maybe that was just because the script was cheesy. It's really a shame that Melissa Joan Hart and Jonathan Brandis chose to appear in this movie--they could both do waaaaaaaaaaaaay better. I don't even know if you could say that they were acting--there was no real emotion and zero believability.<br /><br />If you're a fan of either Melissa Joan Hart or the late Jonathan Brandis, you'll lose respect for them if you see this movie. Avoid it at all costs.
