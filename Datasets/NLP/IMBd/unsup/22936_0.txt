This was one of the runners-up for the audience award at the 30th Cleveland Int'l Film Festival. A really good story, excellent young actors and a good Indie ending leave you hanging and glad for the tension.<br /><br />The story, told in a nearly complete flashback goes back to a pivotal summer in Erik's life. Many clich√©d (and I don't say this to be mean) elements are brought into play, although since this is Sweden the "forbidden" pleasures are more in the perception of the American movie goer. The story holds together very well, with the various elements of the drama each contributing nicely to the plot and able to be the scrutiny of the viewer.<br /><br />There's no chance taken in catching this movie. The screenplay is well-written and well-executed.<br /><br />Oh, and watch out for the hammer!
