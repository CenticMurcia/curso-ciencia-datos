In a decay neighborhood, the asthmatic and allergic amateurish photographer Marvin Montrose (Karl Geary) spends his days and nights confined in his room snooping his neighbors in the next building with his camera. When a boy disappears in the spot and then the local drug dealer Desmond (Keith Robinson), Marvin suspects of a mysterious garbage man (Lance Henriksen) and his sister Rosy (Alexis Dziena) and her friend Carmen (Rebecca Mader) investigate him. Meanwhile, Marvin witnesses the death of Detective Gary Dumars (John Kapelos) and a stranger on the street by two mutant Judas Breed insects and discloses that their prime suspect is the CDC Agent Kirchner.<br /><br />"Mimic: Sentinel" is a shameful and boring rip-off of "The Rear Window" for approximately forty minutes, with a guy confined in his room and snooping his neighbors. The character of Agent Kirchner is not well developed and the gore action is too brief, with the death of most of the characters in a few minutes. In the end, watching this forgettable movie is a pure waste of time and money. My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Mutação 3: O Sentinela" ("Mutation 3: The Sentinel")
