This was my first Asian Horror movie watch. I was leary about "reading movies" but this one was very cool. You can understand the movie by the movements, so the Subtitles aren't that important (for lack of a better term).<br /><br />Very good work with the cameras, using different angles, and bringing out the smallest details. Not too gory, much to my disliking, but just enough to keep one interested.<br /><br />Good movie all in all, a must see for any Asian Horror Fan.<br /><br />8/10
