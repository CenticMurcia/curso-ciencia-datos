After "I Shot Jesse James" a film which pleased the public and the critics, Fuller made "The Baron of Arizona", with Lippert, casting Vincent Price and Reed Hadley, the actor that played Jesse James. The story, which basically really happened, is about a giant fraud committed by James Addison Reavis, who pretended to own almost the whole state of Arizona. It is interesting that in spite of the damage done by Reavis, the film is sympathetic to him, creating a happy ending, which was not even true, because Reavis died alone in a shack. The story also shows how carefully Reavis planned his fraud though many years.Fuller was able to have as a cinematographer the great James Wong Howe, who wanted so much to shoot the picture that agreed to have a lower salary than usual. Fuller's direction, the great acting of Vincent Price and Wong's camera makes this a remarkable film. It is a shame it did not do so well at the box office.
