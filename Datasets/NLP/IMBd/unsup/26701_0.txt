The hype surrounding this film is just that, hype. It is quite honestly the most boring 'horror' film I've ever seen (and I've seen Oasis of the Zombies!) if you can even call it that. The whole stigma of the film and its controversy was the fetus eating scene which, quite frankly, was not all that spectacular. The version I saw was the recently released 2 disc 'uncut' edition from media blasters/shriek show and I swear that it was still cut. Even so, unless they cut out a huge helping of gore and interesting plot, it would still suck hard. I had been waiting to see this film, uncut, for about 10 years. The anticipation was killing me and when I saw the 2 disc uncut edition for 10 bucks I had to get it. What a waste of 10 dollars that was. Before I discuss the plot let me set the record straight: I LOVE horror films, B-movies and anything that the average person would dub as complete garbage (ie: anything released by Troma). That said, this movie was still the most boring, uneventful piece of trash I've ever witnessed. The plot was so sluggish I wanted to shoot myself (there was plenty of fast forwarding after sitting thru the first 30 minutes), the gore was limited and/or nonexistent, the fetus eating scene looked like it was cut and it was still boring as balls. I know Joe D'Amado is hit or miss, and I've enjoyed a number of his films, but unless you want to see his worst movie ever then stay away from this film. Anthropophagus, more like Anthropo-wheres my f'n $10 back for this crappy movie? End review.
