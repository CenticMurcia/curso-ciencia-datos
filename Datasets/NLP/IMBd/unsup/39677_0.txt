This is standard movie fare done extremely bad. Big rattlesnakes kill people, and the people who know how dangerous the snakes are can't get anyone to listen. The writers and director try to use every clich√© to further their careers. The pity is that this usually works. We're also inundated with the all American look of every man having dark hair and every woman having blonde hair, a neo-Nazi trend used to glorify the Hitler Nazi machine by many movie makers. Again, there are so many rich neo-Nazis who insist upon this being "classic", that directors and writers who use this technique go rewarded with bigger and bigger budgets. And don't be fooled. This is a big budget movie. This is expensive work. Don't ever let someone tell you some of these movies are low budget, because they aren't. You couldn't get this much capital to make a movie, unless you are rich yourself. There just isn't anything good about this movie.
