Given that the first thematic film made was a western ("The Great Train Robbery"), it's startling how many NEW gun-play ideas this film contains.<br /><br />Less in-your-face nihilism than "Sin City" but just as dark, this film has style and a sense of humor without ever staring at you and winking or preening about just how clever it is. It just keeps going - as one bit of dialog suggests, like the Energizer Bunny.<br /><br />Owen does his usual suave-with-grease-on-his-face action, and Giamatti is wonderful - after he hits 10, he goes on to 11, 12 and 13, threatening to burst several blood vessels at any moment.<br /><br />See it on the big screen, while you can.<br /><br />Author is not a studio plant, a potted plant nor a steel plant.
