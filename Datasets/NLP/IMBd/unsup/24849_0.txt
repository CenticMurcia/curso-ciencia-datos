The song was awesome. Bobbie Gentry song is classic. I'll give some credit to this movie. It's a much better adaptation of a song to a movie, than Harper Valley PTA. Also the movie has a good southern Gothic feel to it. The movie though was mediocre but watchable. Glynnis O'Connor and Robby Benson (excellent chemistry in this and Jeremy(a better movie) make this a worthwhile effort. I have something to say about the comments of the boy being raped in the movie. It was rape. Even if it was consensual (which the boy thought it was) the boy was under 18. That is statutory rape. Even if he had tendencies or was gay or bi, that older man was taking advantage of him, a minor.
