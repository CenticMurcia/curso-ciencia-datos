Frances-Anne Solomon has done a fantastic job of combining a well-written script and the perfect team of actors to bring A Winter Tale to fruition on the big screen. This movie is a brutally honest and personal view of the social ills that affect young black males at risk in Toronto. Rather than just presenting a violent shoot 'em-up type of movie, Solomon shows us the lives of men from a community who are proactive in their attempt to deal with the emotional and psychological effects of poverty, and urban violence. These are elements that are hardly highlighted in depth in news stories we hear and see locally.<br /><br />What makes this movie come alive is not just the stories told through a group of men seeking answers, but it's also the passion and emotion evoked by Miss G (played by the phenomenal Leonie Forbes). The history of conflict between her son Ian and herself is emotionally riveting, as is the performance of Canadian actor Peter Williams who plays the role of the social worker, Gene Wright, who initiates the support group for black males.<br /><br />A Winter Tale is a special film told from a unique angle. It's a poignant story that is not exclusive to Black Canadians, but to anyone concerned about the future of their community and the children growing up under similar conditions.
