I was so disappointed when i saw this movie. I had just read the book, and thought it portrayed the characters so well, and showed the bad sides of human nature. In this movie the acting was horrible. There was no emotion, and so much drama over too little drama..if that makes sense The movie also seemed like it was over the span of a couple months, rather than three years. It did not touch on a major issue of the book, how the brother and sister fell in love, which took up a lot of the actual story. It also added in a lot of weird characters and it had little or no detail in the scenes, making the kids seem like total brats. It seemed like everything happened for no reason. If you have read the book, don't watch the movie because you will be disappointed. I hope they make another adaptation, because I think flowers in the attic could be a great movie.
