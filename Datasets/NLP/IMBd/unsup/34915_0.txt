What a gigantic piece of regurgitated whale excrement, and that's being polite! Although I have to blame the suits at MTM, who was the production company, for, along with the suits at the network, giving anybody, golden child or not, an 8 episode deal sight unseen. This is a testament to that never happening again! Consistently in the 5 worst shows of all time television rankings, it's the brunt of every bad joke about Steven ever told. As it should be... If I ever saw a judge break out into a song and dance number, I'd wonder who spiked the single malt scotch.. Know what the real kicker is, we actually sold it. Sydney Channel 5 bought all 8 episodes... It seems my boss at the time (Fred) felt so bad the next day he went back and killed the deal, much to the dismay of the head of MTM (and Mary's husband) but being that he actually managed to sell a Joey to an Aussie nothing was said about it... No other network through 88 worldwide bought it to my knowledge...
