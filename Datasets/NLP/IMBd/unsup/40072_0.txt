Drawn in by an exciting trailer, I made the mistake of seeing this dull, stultifying, exasperating and endless film. Since I knew it was about a British heroine parachuted into Vichy France, I was expecting something along the line of the marvellous "Odette" of the 1950s, Odette being a real-life heroine who endured much hardship while aiding the French resistance. The trailer certainly indicated an action flick.<br /><br />The plot is absurd. Cate opens her legs for an RAF flier the first night she meets him (slut alert) and, when he disappears in France a few days later, she decides to find him (getting a number of French underground fighters killed along the way).<br /><br />Cate Blanchard is incredibly annoying. I yearned for her to be machine-gunned by a Nazi! In fact, I ached to have everyone machine-gunned halfway through the film so that I could go home!<br /><br />It is a true "woman's" film in the classic sense. Few men would waste their time with this, for less than a case of beer and a pizza.<br /><br />I gave it a "2" out of ten. Largely because it is visually beautiful and very well photographed.
