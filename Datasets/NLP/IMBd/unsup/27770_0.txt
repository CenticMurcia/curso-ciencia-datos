Lacking a budget makes for a sub-par 50s creature feature. Radiation again is the blame for A giant creature attacking mankind. Massive amounts of dead fish wash ashore and a man dies of burns from the radioactive beams projected from what will be called The Behemoth, from the Book of Job. The creature is a giant brachiosaurus that attacks ships and submarines before converging on the city of London. Destroying the monster presents the problem of releasing devasting levels of radiation contaminating the entire country. Filmed entirely in England and is actually a remake of 1953's THE BEAST FROM 20,000 FATHOMS. The players include: Gene Evans, Leigh Madison, Jack MacGowran and John Turner.
