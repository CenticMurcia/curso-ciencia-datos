and story and screenplay. "South of Heaven..." is a colossal flop but not for want of talent. Something like The Wild Bunch meets The Keystone Cops, this flick can't make up it's mind what it wants to be. With all the makings of a good period drama, "South..." wanders aimlessly into farce, staggers around in comedy, teeters in the action genre, and falls on its face dying a slow and painful death from lack of a story and substance. Obviously staged and scripted with an unnatural ebb and flow, terrible segues, and poor continuity, "South..." is an obvious collection of brain farts strung together into one of the worst films I've seen in a long time.
