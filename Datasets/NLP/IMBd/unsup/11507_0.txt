Sliders is a perfect example of network television and their short-sightedness......and an even more perfect example showing how the Nielson's are an absolute joke. This show still has a following in reruns.....the websites are a testament to that. Enterprise being cancelled and some jackleg website collecting THREE MILLION DOLLARS to keep it on show the Nielson's are not accurate. Do you ever look at the top shows and wonder, "who the hell is watching them?" Time for the Nielson's to go........Hey, Nielson's, keep your crisp dollar bill and find a way to do it right, or go to hell.<br /><br />I suggest anyone who agrees, write an email or letter and let's get this thing changed.
