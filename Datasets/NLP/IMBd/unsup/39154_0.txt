Trite. Clichéd. Awful. And this ignores the film is written as some wish fulfillment fantasy. Ignoring the strangeness of the main character as some bland and psychotic looking teenager who decides to get drunk and travel anywhere--literally, anywhere--after his failed wedding (to lose his virginity, nevertheless), the audience is subjected to a pointless movie that flip-flops between numerous clichés and blatant ripoff of more superior films.<br /><br />The acting is poor, the script is poor, and the film work is done completely on digital video which makes it look even cheesier than it is. There's no idea of a plot, dramatic elements, or anything to keep your interest. On top of that, the film actually ends twenty minutes before the movie stops. The jokes fall flat (especially the ending one), and it's simply a waste of time. This will be the longest hour and a half of your life, and you will not get it back.<br /><br />Previous arguments about the main character being an irresponsible man-child is dead-on accurate. I suspect the movie was financed so the director and actors could have an 'adventurous' vacation and make a movie while they were at it. I hope they had a good time because the 'movie' they made is more boring than a fistful of slides narrated by your monotone aunt. No wonder it went direct-to-DVD.
