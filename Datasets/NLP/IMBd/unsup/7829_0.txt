For me it really grates when the costume department appears to have done no research what so ever! This is supposedly set in 1660. The costumes the French wear seem reasonably accurate, but when we skip over to the Duke of Buckinghams home in England the English are wearing Disneyland versions of the court fashions of at least ten years later.The Duke of Buckingham himself seems to have invented hair gel and be using it to excess on his most unlikely (for the period) hair style. Since the English court generally took its fashion lead from the French, on top of which the English monarchy had only just been restored it hardly seems likely their fashions would have been so far ahead! I'm sorry, I know I'm being pedantic but for me these things can ruin a film...
