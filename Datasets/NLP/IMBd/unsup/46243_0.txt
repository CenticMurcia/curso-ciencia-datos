Sometimes something sounds good, but the bare truth of it all leaks out when you have a crappy director leading the helm. Once again, Sam Raimi proved he is about as incompetent as most PR-video directors, displaying a real lack of vision and insight. Sure, the concept was good, the idea seemed to be there, but it was simply executed with such campiness that the coolness of the film could never overcome the crap. Sometimes having a known director doesn't always work, and in regards to Sam Raimi, it rarely does.
