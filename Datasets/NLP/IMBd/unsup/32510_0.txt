This movie was not a good movie at all. I understand the story was about a family and not the war but how can people get past the unrealistic points of the war this movie portrayed? The carelessness of Benigni's character's actions in the movie would have killed tons of people.<br /><br />The first hour of the movie was terribly boring I was waiting for the movie to end. The second part was better but I could not get past how unrealistic this movie was. I have seen many foreign films from many countries and movies dealing with war and this is one of the worst ones I have ever seen. One example of a movie that dealt with a boy trying to survive in a camp and the war was realistic was "Empire of the Sun".<br /><br />Another thing I did not like about the film was the beginning. How perverted Benigni was acting with the little girl. I thought I was the only one but talking to people that loved the movie, they also had the same uneasy feeling. I do not think this movie deserves the status it has gotten.
