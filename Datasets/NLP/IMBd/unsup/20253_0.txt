PC Version. <br /><br />This game runs very smoothly. I didn't experience any glitches during game-play. However, there are some patches that should be downloaded to this, regarding a save issue.<br /><br />Ash has been locked up in the looney bin, and Dr. Reinhard is using the Necronomicon to achieve great power. There's all kinds of zombies everywhere. Sam is a half-dead person who accompanies Ash on his mission. Sam Raimi is freakin' funny as Sam. You can play this with a game pad, if you have a good one. Otherwise you can use your keyboard. But I recommend using a gamepad with extra knobs for camera view.<br /><br />This game is totally gross. Blood and guts everywhere. I get a gross feeling inside me after playing it. But I totally love it. Very fun, very worth buying.
