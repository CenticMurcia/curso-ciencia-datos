David is charged with murder and Matt Murdock (aka The Daredevil) is the lawyer who's handling his case. Then the big green dude and the blind justice seeker join forces to fight The Kingpin.<br /><br />Ahhhhh, if you thought The Incredible Hulk Returns was a bit on the silly side, you won't think that so much after watching this. The Daredevil scenes are just painful to watch. Rex Smith isn't bad as Murdock/Daredevil but he's just too damn silly when he's fighting the good fight. John Rhys Davies is horrible as The Kingpin who here comes off even worse than Daredevil.<br /><br />What's worst here is that The Hulk plays second fiddle to the blind lawyer, not even appearing in the (overly silly) climax. This was originally an attempt to launch a series for Daredevil and it's obvious why it didn't take off.<br /><br />Bill Bixby for the first and only time looks disinterested in the proceedings. This movie has "half hearted" written all over it. The Hulk action is unspectacular (apart from one dream sequence) but Ferrigno nevertheless looks great.<br /><br />I just hope this was something Bixby had to do before venturing into the last installment which ended the Hulk saga on a high note.
