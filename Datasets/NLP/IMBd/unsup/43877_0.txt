'Blue City' was nearly a contender in all categories for the Razzies in 1986. I can see why and, if you aren't hung up on a nostalgia trip or your best judgment tainted by seeing your favorite 80s stars in a relatively unknown film, then you'd know why, too.<br /><br />'Blue City' is essentially the story of a hot shot young man (Judd Neslon) avenging the death of his father. He suspects foul play by city officials. And of course, Hollywood movies are incomplete without the love interest sidekick (Ally Sheedy). The problem with this movie is not really the story, but the fact that there is hardly anything to remind the viewer that the movie was meant to be a thriller. Nelson comes off as the most arrogant character, who readily insults even his nemisis. And the villains, despite this, really don't act like their bothered by this guy showing up all the time and accusing them of his killing his father (whether or not they really did). There seemed to be no sense of emergency or suspense on anyone's part, save maybe David Caruso in the supporting role. Aside from the Florida scenery and notable actors, this is one movie worth passing up.
