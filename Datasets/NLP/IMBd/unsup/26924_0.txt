KISS OF THE DRAGON is one terrific slam-bang,kick-ass kung fu action movie that reminded me in some ways of the great 1975 Jimmy Wang Yu kickfest THE MAN FROM HONG KONG taking as it does the premise of a Chinese cop using his awesome skills to survive in a foreign city,here Paris as opposed to Sydney in the Wang Yu movie. Jet Li in his third US movie again plays credible and hard and does not compromise his great ability in the martial arts by use of embarrassing buffoonery as Jackie Chan has chosen to do(particularly in RUSH HOUR and its sequel).Li engages in a long series of well choreographed fight scenes against a variety of foes including a lone fight against a gymful of karate students(another nod to THE MAN FROM HONG KONG)and faces a particularly nasty villain in the form of the excellent Tcheky Karyo who is on peak form here. There are flaws in this movie however.The story is weak and derivative, the dialogue mostly sucks and heroine Bridget Fonda is just there so Jet can have a woman to protect.Nevertheless this movie is an action lover's wet dream and bodes well for future Hollywood Jet Li projects. Hopefully his popularity will soar above that of the aging and easily studio manipulated Jackie Chan.One cannot imagine Li selling himself out in the way that Chan has and I follow his career with interest.
