No matter what you think of Chuck Norris, this is the movie the legend and 'facts' are based on! Of course it is a bad, stupid action movie. But besides that you see just how tough Chuck is. He doesn't drink beer out of a glass - the bottle only, He can take out a whole unit of a foreign army by putting on black clothes, and he sure as $hit doesn't shake hands with commie vietnamese generals, - he's tough, he's hardcore to the bone, he's Chuck Norris.<br /><br />The plot is great for an action movie - Its the early 1980s, and POWs are still being held in viet nam. Chuck knows this becuz he just got out of one. So he heads back on an official US diplomatic thing, but he has an agenda of his own - to singlehandly break out POWs that are still being held. Go Chuck Go!
