Though the movie was somewhat slow and Rhys never got a name- only the "photographer" this was a pleasant movie to watch on a weekend evening with a glass of sherry. San Giacomo is a very attractive woman and carried off the part nicely. Fisher Stevens added to the sleaze factor of it all. What I liked was the romance evolved and didn't go straight into sex scenes. A believable film about two people who are attracted to each other and because both spouses are gone- follow their hearts- though they are breaking vows.
