This movie was a disaster. It disgraces the title of Starship Troopers. Ever since number one, I noticed the quality of movies, instead of going up, it was going down by a landslide. The special effects were a disgrace. My 12-year-old brother could have don't better. The graphics were worse than starship troopers 1, which was made in 1997! But thats not all. The second they tried to put religion into it, it seemed like it was some Christian fan-bot movie. It literally hit an all-time low there. As if starship trooper 2's idea wasn't retarded enough. At least that movie had something in it. The last 30 minutes was like they tried to do something intelligent by putting in something about religion. Im sorry to say they failed miserable. Did you see that part where the girls start praying? Disgrace. In the end I couldn't believe that this was actually a sequel of starship troopers 1. And that means a lot, since starship troopers 1 wasn't exactly the best movie on earth. Still prefer the book.
