First off let me start by saying this is most definitely not a Justice League it doesn't even come close to being in the same Galaxy. I'm not a fan of the childalization of super heroes and this is a show confirms my feelings that it's just a stinky thing to do. The show seems to depend heavily on the popularity of superman and should be called something like "super tweeny man and his amazing lackluster friends from the future" The rest of the legion of super kids are very much unremarkable much as the entire concept of the show. Just say no kids and perhaps they will scrap this pile of don't, don't bother and give us some real super hero action
