This movie provides a real escape from the routine drivel we see coming from Hollywood.<br /><br />Yes, the movie is over 2 hours in length and there is very little dialog. One really wouldn't expect much dialog from a Religious Order, like these Carthusians, who observe silence whenever and wherever possible. These Hermit/Monks are not walking through their Cloister with Stereo Earphones, while their cowled heads bob up and down in rhythm with the latest HIP-HOP Beat!! If one does his homework PRIOR to viewing this movie, they will know that it IS A RELIGIOUS DOCUMENTARY dealing with the daily life of the Hermit/Monks in the Roman Catholic Church's strictest Order.<br /><br />Time has practically stood still for the Hermit/Monks of this Monastery - the Motherhouse of the Carthusian Order - LE GRANDE CHARTREUSE.<br /><br />In a World filled with noise, distractions, violence, and insecurity, sitting for a few hours and enjoying the Carthusian Life-style is a breath of very fresh air.<br /><br />This Documentary offers that rare glimpse into a very obscure and hidden Religious Order.<br /><br />Hopefully the DVD of this masterpiece will be released soon in the U.S.A. It will make a wonderful companion to Nancy Klein Maguire's Book: "AN INFINITY OF LITTLE HOURS".
