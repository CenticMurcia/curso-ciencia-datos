We saw this indie film when it made its commercial debut. The other night it was shown on cable and we decided to take another look. Directed by Robert M. Young, and based on a novel and screen play by Edward Pomerantz, "Caught" is an erotically charged movie.<br /><br />Joe and Betty feel sorry for the young man who seems to be a drifter and employ him to work in their fish store in New Jersey. Betty, who is obviously a sexually repressed woman, finds in the new man the excitement she is sorely lacking in her marriage. When their son Danny returns from the West Coast, things take a turn as this is a doomed romantic triangle from the start.<br /><br />Mr. Young, the director has gotten excellent acting all around from the cast. Edward James Olmos is Joe. Maria Conchita Alonso is Betty a woman of a certain age who discovers pleasure with a younger man. Arie Verveen, is Nick the young man who is the object of Betty's passion.<br /><br />"Caught" is worth a look, as it won't disappoint the viewer who stumbles into it.
