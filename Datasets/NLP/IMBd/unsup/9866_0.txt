When Gyneth Paltrow's character blows her cookies at one point in the film, I couldn't help but feel she was speaking for everyone in the audience. Well, maybe that's stretching things a bit, but "Hush" manages to rise only to the level of a mediocre made-for-tv flick on the USA network...the kind that would have trouble winning its 3:00 AM time slot against cable's worst info-mercials.<br /><br />The acting ranges from NOT BAD (Jessica Lange) to EMBARRASSING (Jonathan Schaech). The screenplay is utterly predictable despite the fact that everything has to go totally wrong - or the characters act really stupid - in order to push the plot along. This movie would be perfect fodder for Mystery Science Theater 3000.
