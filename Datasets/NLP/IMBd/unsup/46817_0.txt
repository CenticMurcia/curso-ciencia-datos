This movie is not what you think it would be. It was four in the morning and i was watching a marathon on the Sci-Fi channel and this movie popped up, and i had to watch it. At the beginning I thought this isn't to bad, but we do we get to see the car. Then the middle, got there and it was not what I expected. Though the movie isn't really a Knight Rider movie, but the action and somewhat of a story line make it a movie that if there is nothing else better on you might as well see it. If you are a Knight Rider fan waiting to see this movie you will know what I mean when you see it. My favorite thing about this movie would have to be basis of the story, it makes a great way to present a film. So if your not doing anything and aren't planning on doing anything, watch and see.
