While I can see why some people might not like this movie (low production values) I found myself very impressed. Right off the bat you know this is a no nonsense crime film. The heist in the picture is well plotted and believable. It's got more in common with ODDS AGAINST TOMORROW than it does GRAND SLAM.<br /><br />What I liked about the story was that the person set up to be victimized is not just some ordinary guy but an almost equally hard nosed crook. Of course the robbers are unaware of this when they set up their master plan and it proves to be a major thorn in their side.<br /><br />Also, I found the dialog (especially in the beginning) to be very high tension and raw. I've read comments it was cheesy but c'mon! The film was made in 1952...and is consistent with other films of the genre made in the same period, except here it much more violent and heavy.<br /><br />And last, a great cast of actors makes the film even better. These guys talk tough and back it up. There's a great scene where one of the crooks gets slapped around similar to Cobby in ASPHALT JUNGLE, except this one looked like it hurt.<br /><br />If you're like me and you like to watch movies about bankrobberies and heists you'd better check this one out.
