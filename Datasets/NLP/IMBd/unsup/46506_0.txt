okay, how shall I start.. first of all, I like you to know that you should not see this movie because it totally SUCKS!!! IT SUUUUUCKS, its the worst movie ever, and thats with "The Presidents Man" and "Titanic" included... that should tell you how bad it is...<br /><br />whats so bad about Azumi?: well, first of all, the special effects where made(apparently) with Microsoft Paint, its worse then Barbara Streisand, and thats really, really bad.<br /><br />2. the scenery, I think that the scenery was made with a huge piece of cardboard and 2 cans of paint, thats how it looks, its really, really, really crappy...<br /><br />3. the "blood"(there is a lot of blood in this movie) is made with red spraypaint...(that should say enough)<br /><br />4. the story... well, I don't have much to say about this, its just... a story, not really good, but not really bad neither ... well, that should say enough about my point of view on this movie, like they say on Newgrounds: "blam this piece of crap!"
