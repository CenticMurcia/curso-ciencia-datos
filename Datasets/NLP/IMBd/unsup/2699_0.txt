Remember this show ? It was a great show about a kid who had downs syndrome and the difficulties he had to deal with.<br /><br />It also talked about other real life problems like aids, teenagers in general and things that had a lot of depth and meaning. Yet it was very entertaining.<br /><br />All the actors were excellent and gave their characters layers.<br /><br />Fast forward to today, all we get are superficial shows like Lost,Prison Break and DS !! They are all about special affects and no substance.<br /><br />What happened to American TV series ? I haven't like one single TV series that has come out the last 10 years from USA. And the shows I liked in the 90s has gone down the hill big time the last couple of years.<br /><br />I doubt I will ever like an American TV series again(or a Hollywood movie for that matter)
