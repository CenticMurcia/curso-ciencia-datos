I was one of the mindless individuals mugged into buying the special edition Aladdin box set with 4 DVDs, thinking that this would be a quality buy and that the 2 follow ups to the original movie (Return of Jafar and King of Thieves) would be of somewhat average to good standard. I was wrong.<br /><br />Since putting on Return of Jafar, I couldn't help but think that this sub-standard-day-time-television-cartoon really was a waste of money to purchase and it's sole purpose of being made was to mug Aladdin fans and kids who love Disney.<br /><br />- The animation was shoddy, I would say that Rugrats probably put more effort into their animation than this film.<br /><br />- The plot was just randomly put together. You could see that by one scene where Aladdin is talking to Jasmine and there is a vase with a white tulip and a jeweled flower in it. These items keep disappearing every so often, sometimes showing an empty vase, sometimes one flower, sometimes 2.<br /><br />- The music was horrible. If you have just watched the original movie and loved the music steer clear of this sequel. I think they paid a couple of monkeys a few bananas to knock together some notes on a keyboard and then they just made up a few words to go along with the song (if you can call it a song).<br /><br />Anyways, after watching this sequel, I can happily tell everyone to steer right clear of it, because all it will do is depress you.<br /><br />I voted 2/10
