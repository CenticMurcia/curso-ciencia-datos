I saw this with 20 other reviewers (including Barry Norman! name-drop, name-drop), and it was funny how everyone (including me) winced and grimaced at some of the action - the guy in the laundry chute, the guys in the kitchen, the black guy in the shop - and especially the two henchmen in the end fight. I'm not joking - everyone gasped, groaned, winced at how those last two fights ended! Very unusual (in a Hollywood movie anyway). Then we were all watching the last bit through our fingers, as it almost veers off into Clive Barker territory..<br /><br />But a solid action film, despite the Bridget Fonda nonsense (she's only in this to 'broaden the appeal' to non-martial arts fans).<br /><br />
