It was very intriguing watching a new movie produced by the famous Konchalovsky (Runaway Train, Tango and Cash)<br /><br />The first 15 minutes are interesting, then trouble begins: ridiculous dialogs, unreal situations etc... Inconsistent, unrealistic plot made in superficial picture of post-Soviet Russia. It looks like tabloid-quality scenario with same ridiculous "bad" and "good" guys... <br /><br />The main character appears being bored, just trying to fight his sleep throughout most of his appearances. The soundtrack is OK. <br /><br />Movies like Moskva, Gruz 200, Bumer seem to be infinitely more subtle in giving a portrait of the Russian past and of the reality without being naive or politically engaged. Really very disappointing.
