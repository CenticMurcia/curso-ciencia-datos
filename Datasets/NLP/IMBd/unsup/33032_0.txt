I woke up one morning and saw that there was a new action thriller running called "Virus" I thought "yahoo" a movie for the international nerd, but when the movie started I soon relised that this wasen't a movie about a virus, but a horror thriller about a "electro" alien that is trying to take over the world using the help of half human robots witch it manufactures in a russian ship, a unlucky crew of a 5 stumbles upon the ship and tries to save the world from the evil alien. first of all this movie is terribly written, nothing in the storyline holds together and all that "save the world" bull**it is getting a bit tired, the acting is below average, and the special effects are horribly out dated. Take my advice, see any movie, just not this one
