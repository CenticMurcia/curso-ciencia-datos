When I saw the advertisement in TVGuide for this animation it was touted as an original work by Randkin and Bass. It so happened that the original TV airing in '56 with Basil Rathbone in the lead was a fond memory, especially the music. The original show featured Rathbone as Scrooge and a great cast of 50's names including Vic Damone, Patrice Munsel, Johnny Desmond and many other talents. The re-make in the seventies featured some great personalities as well but did not have the charm of the original broadcast live on the Alcoa Theater. Hearing Rathbone sing was unique. The other talents speak for themselves. I guess I really objected to the claim that the '70s production was an original work. I guess they thought that the original was a faded memory. Perhaps, since it was live and there is no video or film of the original to keep. The songs are exactly the same as they were in the '56 production but without the same charm.
