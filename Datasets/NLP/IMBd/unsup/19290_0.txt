"Rough Riders", despite the constraints forced by trying to put six months into three hours, is the best Spanish-American War movie, possibly the best war movie, I've seen in years. Tom Berengar's Teddy Roosevelt and Gary Busey's 'Fighting Joe' Wheeler are splendid evocations of two rather well-known men, replete with little details that bring them to life. The focus of the film, however, is on two ordinary troopers: Brad Davis's Henry Nash, a composite of the trooper from the Territories with a real Rough Rider's name, and Chris Noth's Craig Wadsworth -- one of the Park Avenue contingent, who enlisted as a trooper and mustered out as a sergeant. A few liberties have been taken, mostly by merging several men into one (eg, Richard Harding Davis is merged with Edward Marshall) or slightly misordering or misascribing actions to keep the characters down to a manageable and recognisable few (Marshall was shot at Las Guasimas, Tiffany actually died of fever), and the regiment's return to Montauk is left out, but overall tone of the movie is of scrupulous accuracy. It's a wonderful film; the Charge of the San Juan Heights will make you feel what war was like a century ago. Highly recommended.
