A true successor of the Apu trilogy!'Memories in the mist'by Dasgupta artistically and metaphorically inter-wovens the memories and fantasies of a man of his beloved and lost father.Set in the backdrop of North Kolkata,the story paces to and fro between past and present,between reality and imagination,between innocence and lucre!Amongst the numerous metaphors used in the movie,the one which cant be helped mentioning is the reference of the piper which beckons the man to his past,his childhood and his unfulfilled dreams.With this movie,Dasgupta has also endeavored to find the base of our relationships.At the end of the film,the man reveals himself to his father and thus to the audience,and thus forces us to remind of Apu who would,despite hostility as conferred by fate,love and wonder!That is probably the reason some critic has mentioned it as'the closest modern equivalent'to a Ray movie.But whatever international applaud it gets,it may not get along too well with the Bengali audience because of its sheer lack of bangaliyana(Bengali traditions and customs)as compared to a new wave cinema by Ray or Ghatak.
