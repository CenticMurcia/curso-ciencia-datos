How about it's just not funny I don't see the genius that everyone is speaking of I didn't laugh once and to learn that it was made my two white guys "supposedly" making some kind of brilliant social commentary on intercultural exchange didn't make it any more funny or acceptable. on another note, they need their asses kicked for writing, producing and distributing this hatred masked as "creativity" or "comedy". To be comedy, shouldn't it make me laugh? Genius? Come on! Are we using that word like folks used the word "ghetto" when they didn't know how the hell to describe something? Genius implies something special, something uncommon, something groundbreaking. Any idiot could've written this. Let's reconsider our use of English words and stop adding words like "bling" to the dictionary.<br /><br />What a disappointment. The biggest waste of six minutes I've ever spent in my life thus far.<br /><br />Besides, how do Kuntz and McGuire still have a job in America after writing this blatantly hatred-based "comedy"? Oh, I forget, America is still a breeding ground of racist folks. They just wear suits instead of sheets now. Geez Louise!
