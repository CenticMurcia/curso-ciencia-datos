I didn't expect this movie to be this good knowing nothing about it. Kim Novak is not the bitch that Barbara Stanwyck is, but the most beautiful actress on the movie screen and shy way about her that was truly sensuous. No matter who the leading man in her movies was, you just felt the helplessness of them being totally enthralled with this soft, sensuous, unbelievable sex goddess, for lack of another original description.<br /><br />This is only the second movie I seen Fred MacMurray in (no my three sons here) besides Double Indemnity and his performance is very good here also,... just as Double Indemnity... I found myself hoping he would get away with it!
