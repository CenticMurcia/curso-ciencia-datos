I had heard good things about this movie and was very psyched to check it out as I love Chan's easy going humour and mad fighting styles. But as I saw it I got more and more frustrated - where were the people on the cover and where were the jets and parachute people? Silly as it is with things on the cover that aren't in the film, the dubbing is utterly painful - totally out of synch - and when the story is as fragmented as is the case in the version I saw, one has to wonder if the dubbing missed out things, or if the Danish version has been cut, because the storyline is pretty much impossible to understand.<br /><br />Jackie has some good moves and there are a couple of very pretty gels to look at for a few moments, but that is about the qualities that are to be found in this movie. The storyline in the Danish release is impossible to understand for anyone with a normal IQ, as is the character progression, and the quality of the effects are below par for what can be expected.<br /><br />All in all this version is a sorely disappointing flick and not one that can be recommended, unless you are a hardcore Jackie Chan fan.<br /><br />4/10
