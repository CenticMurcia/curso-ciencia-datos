This interesting film from Spanish director De la Iglesia is a road trip that is fun and action packed, as it is obscure. A great premise taken to the extreme, in which a servant of god, has to get in touch with the evil side, in order to save the world. The comic relief comes in Chema, a rock-store clerk, who, along this priest takes this trip to it's ultimate consequences.
