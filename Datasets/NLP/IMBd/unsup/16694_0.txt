Do not expect anything spectacular when you rent this movie. A killer starts killing teenage girls and boys which will eventually lead up to the killing of one girl in particular. Their are some interesting murder scenes but the movie is very slow and drags on and on and on. There is the classic who done it, with the blame being but on every one except the real killer. In the end the killer is predictable from the characters actions earlier in the movie and the final chase scene is pretty dull compared to others. Like I've said in my many other reviews watch it only if you're in the mood for some cheesy 80's slasher films.
