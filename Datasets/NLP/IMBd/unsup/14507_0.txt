I was 13 in 1979 when I first saw this movie and it really made an impression on me. I did an essay in literature that same week about the movie and presented it with so much passion. My teacher was very impressed. <br /><br />Love feels so real at that age and I remember the next year at 14 falling for the 17 year old I had a crush on for many years. I felt like Jesse because sure enough put on a little makeup and some cool clothes and he was following me around. The thing about this age is you also don't know how to handle heart break and that was a tough thing to learn.<br /><br />I have ordered all three of the books even though I have heard they are a hard read. I just can't help myself I have to see how things end.
