This international collaborative effort between musicians, artists, performers, writers and philosophers, titled, '1 Giant Leap', palls in sections, then blows you away with the power of music and words: "We want to show, through the diverse fragments of music, spoken word and imagery, that despite our surface level differences, the things that divide us are far outnumbered by the humanity which unites us."<br /><br />Western collaborators include Tim Robbins, Neneh Cherry, Brian Eno, Dennis Hopper, Kurt Vonnegut, Michael Stipe and Robbie Williams.<br /><br />As someone with considerable affection for Australia, I was cringing under the seat when it came to the section titled, 'Confrontation'. Nine minutes in which to comment on confrontation in the world, and most of the time was given up to a song intercut with a general montage, and commentary, but two long minutes were devoted to Fred Reid balancing a sickening speech by David Oldfield (of One Nation infamy, in case you've somehow managed to erase him from your mental list of villains). Mr Oldfield asked with all the assurance of the unquestionably loopy what stone age people can offer the 'rest of us' today.<br /><br />I would have liked to hear from more women, but those that were there were fascinating. In the sex section, Cosi Fabian, a 'sacred prostitute', was beautiful. She had a sensitive take on the world, and appeared to feel able to be honest, and that people were honest, 'soft', with her.<br /><br />This movie is a celebration that transcends the medium. The energy and sincerity of those involved more than compensates for any limitations. Nowadays one suspects one should somehow preface remarks regarding notions of hope and peace with some self effacing gesture, so as to mark one's recognition that such notions are somehow unsophisticated and breathlessly idealist. But this movie really does imbue one with hope, and it is a brave hope at that. A hope that can be expressed without need to cringe or caper. I hope you watch this movie too, and enjoy the diversity these collaborators have brought together.
