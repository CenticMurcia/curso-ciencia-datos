Every decade has a style. The 1940's after the war had a very slick style. This movie has plenty of this slick style. The music is some of the best swing and the camera work and some of the way shots are framed is excellent. You can't look past the acting either. Everybody plays their part to the fullest and there is a wonderful cameo by the late Lloyd Bridges as a dirty politician. If you like cars, rent this movie. If you like the 40's, rent this movie. If you like good movies, rent this movie. This is one of the most underrated movies in the last 15 years.
