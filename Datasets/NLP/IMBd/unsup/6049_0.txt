It was hard to rate this movie. It had some definite funny parts, and some horribly bad parts, and I originally wasn't gunna review it. But after seeing Date Movie, which was the worst movie i've ever seen, I felt the need to point out some things about Scary Movie 4 that Date Movie is obviously lacking. O.k. where to start...<br /><br />Scary Movie 4 has generally good characters. Anna Faris and Reginna Hall were overall really funny. The jokes in this movie made sense, had many pop-culture references, weren't extremely dragged out, and flowed with the over-all story, wheres Date Movies jokes where just one, hollow, interchangeable joke after another...<br /><br />There were some "not so funny parts", such as the very end. And the constant reference to rappers throughout the movie(Chingy, Lil John,etc.), I guess to reach out to the younger culture. I'm 15 and I just found it annoying, not funny.<br /><br />But overall the funny parts overpower the not funny parts. This movie isn't as good as number 3, which wasn't as good as number 2, which wasn't as good as number 1, but over-all, its a pretty good movie. I would of origanlly given this movie a 5 or a 6, but after seeing Date Movie, i'm grateful for people like David Zucker, and i'm giving it a 7. Its worth renting, seeing once, having a good laugh, then returning it to the DVD store. Its a single serving movie (Fight Club reference)...
