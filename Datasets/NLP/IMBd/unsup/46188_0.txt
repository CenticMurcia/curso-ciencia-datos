I found some parts interesting. Especially the nature photography. But i found the plot and characters not interesting. The acting was as bad as it can get. <br /><br />The film is supposedly over a battle between men and women. But one could easily also imagine Bosnia.<br /><br />On the one hand a rural landscape where everything appears normal but on the other scenes of death and destruction. The long scenes in the bedroom of the ugly old lady bored me to distraction.<br /><br />The hordes of naked children did give a bizarre aspect: but this is a film where nothing really seems to happen. A girl who is always running seeking but never seems to find.
