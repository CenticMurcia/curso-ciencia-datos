I have seen this movie several times since owning it and I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in history, golf, Ben Hogan, or generally being entertained.<br /><br />Upon creating any movie about a real person, Hollywood may choose to cast a light in a certain manner and in the vein of entertainment, what is the harm? Some may indicate that Mr. Hogan was not as cheerful and compassionate as Glenn Ford's version but that is simply opinion. The bottom line is that Follow the Sun is very well made and acted and if you are a fan of Ben Hogan, you will love it as I do.<br /><br />I am looking forward to a DVD release.
