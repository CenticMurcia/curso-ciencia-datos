The 2 rating provided IS generous - this has to be one of the worst movies ever- POOR acting, POOR storyline, POOR production....disjointed, unrealistic and filled with inane script and scenes alike. A few VERY feeble attempts to mimic FAIL SAFE (a classic!!!) - .... probably the most pathetic acting by James Earl Jones (gotta laugh at the stupid cigarette sequence) - what the hell was that all about? The two lead actors (pilot and co-pilot) gave the most out of character and grossly idiotic performances ever seen on film. Even Martin Landau disappoints, and as for Gavin Mcleod , duh... Right from the laughable intro motel scene to the final idiotic comment by deMornay this film will either immensely aggravate you or have you rolling in laughter as you watch scene after scene of idiocy and pure unadulterated garbage. Geez WAS this BAD!!!!
