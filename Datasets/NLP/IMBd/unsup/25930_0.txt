Let's start off with the technical stuff.<br /><br />The acting is great with very believable characters (especially Ramona). Very developed storyline with well-developed characters also. Great conflict with smaller conflicts in between.<br /><br />Now for the juicy, meaty, chunky part.<br /><br />The issue of obesity is a very real problem. However, the problems are not just health-wise, but also a sociological and psychosocial problem. I don't want to spoil anymore for anyone, so I shall just say this: the movie addresses the latter two problems effectively. I myself am overweight, but not to the same extent as one of the characters is. Personality-wise, I'm a likable person, but just like the heavyset characters of the movie, I, too, underwent similar persecution in high school, which was not too long ago.<br /><br />All in all, whether you are fat, skinny, or in between the two, I suggest watching this movie. I'm quite sure that you, at the least, know someone or of someone who falls into the same category as Ramona.
