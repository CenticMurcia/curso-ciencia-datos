now this little notice is based on the dubbed version I cannot recommend it as the voices are in current english idioms & coming out of the mouths of people from over 1000 yrs ago is pure ludicrous. It is possible if I saw this with sub-titles i would of liked it better<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />
