This movie had a good message but it was lost in a story where the characters continued to blame their problems on others. It appeared that the "white man" was accused of causing the characters life of crime. Every time the characters were seen selling drugs, it was to a white man with short hair, a long sleeve shirt with a tie. No street level dealer would sell to such a person. He would more likely be shot.<br /><br />Jim Brown's character says he was convicted of murder as if he was framed but admits to killing people at home. And Animal is only sent to prison because the police framed him.<br /><br />Such denial won't solve the problem.
