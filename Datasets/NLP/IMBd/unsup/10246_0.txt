While the first film gained notariety due to it's allegedly real sex scenes, it otherwise was a boring waste of time.<br /><br />the sequel (which has nothing to do with the first film other than the name) offers more of the same. it's slightly improved in that it actually has a plot and the explicit sex scenes are better integrated into the movie.<br /><br />the acting is average with the only benefit being the presence of the extremely pretty and sexy Nina Siemaszko as 'Blue'. her performance is well done and the sex scenes featuring her are the better ones in the film.<br /><br />overall, strictly for fans of writer/producer/director Zalmand King and boring sex flicks.<br /><br />rating:3
