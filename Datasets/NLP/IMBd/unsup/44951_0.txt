This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The only reason that I watched this crap was because Harland Williams was in it. He is a great improv comic/actor. I wish that the movie would have shown more of him.<br /><br />The plot is just like any other....underdogs beat the champs. Very few funny parts during the whole movie. Harland along with the couple still locked in the 60's made this movie. They were hilarious. The outtakes at the end of the movie was a great way to end this film. <br /><br />The girls were very attractive in this movie. Great job finding them but as soon as they "read" their lines, it ruined it. <br /><br />I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
