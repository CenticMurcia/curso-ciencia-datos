A bad script, bad actors and a Dracula in beard are more evidence that the US vampire movies of the 1970s simply cannot match the UK's Hammer productions of the 1950s and 1960s. Plot holes and silly special effects only add to the confusion of a movie that only the most ardent fans could appreciate. Zandor Vorkov as Dracula looks pale compared to Christopher Lee.
