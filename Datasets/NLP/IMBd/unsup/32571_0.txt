I got to tell you, when I saw this film last week. I thought it was a astonishing movie. I was left speechless. Miller's Crossing was one in a few Coen Brothers films that I haven't seen. Now I need to see tow more of their films: The Hudsucker Proxy and Blood Simple. When I first heard of this film and around the time I have heard of The Coen Brothers, I had no idea this film was directed by them. I thought it was directed by Martin Scorsese. Anyway, this is arguably the best film by the Coen Brothers. I mean, it was a good movie. This is my first time seeing this film so I need to see it again sometime. I hope someday it will be released on DVD. Because I have a Surround Sound so when the action sequences are on, the box will tremble. Excellent gangster movie. I recommend it.<br /><br />10 out of 10
