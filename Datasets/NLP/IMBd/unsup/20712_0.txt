"The Story of Us" is a very real and down to earth movie. Many couples, whether in a relationship or marriage, will be able to identify with the film. It was powerfully acted by both leading roles. <br /><br />The story consists of a lot of flashbacks throughout the couple's entire relationship together. There are many good memories recalled. The children think they have a perfect family life, until they start discovering the things their parents do seem fake and put on. The Willis character then decides that the two of them must confront the children about their separation. <br /><br />So, overall it was a very well done show, and this is why I love to go to the movies. -----------------8/10<br /><br />
