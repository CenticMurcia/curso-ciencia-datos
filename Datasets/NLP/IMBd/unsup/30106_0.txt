I'm on Day 5 and have tried to avoid watching the present edition of the show although I did see a portion of the recent episode where CTU is breached and there's a lot of hand to hand fighting going on. I enjoy the show. I question my enjoyment of the show. There's so much to criticize about the plotting and the propulsive style of the narrative. You really aren't given a moment to think about the implausible stuff. Which is the point and arguably its greatest strength. Jack is a thug, have no illusions, and short of raping his daughter and putting the video online there's very little Mr. Bauer won't do. Sutherland is really tremendous in the role. Its so tailor made for him you really can't imagine anyone else in the part. My only beef with the show is how expendable everyone else is. I miss Nina, Michelle, Edgar, etc. Some folks think this show is Pro-Bush. I don't get that at all. Its hyper patriotic though. It feels like a cartoon sometimes and the violence goes so far out there but then so does the evening network news. I love the show but I question that love, sometimes.
