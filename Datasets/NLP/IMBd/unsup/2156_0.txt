Obviously, "Mystery Science Theater 3000" showed "Swamp Women" (alternately called "Swamp Diamonds") because it's such a slipshod production, and because the movie gets silly whenever the women start fighting. But otherwise, Roger Corman's directorial debut is quite fun, as some female convicts escape a New Orleans prison in search of some diamonds out in the swamp. With them are an undercover cop, and a man (Mike Connors) and his hubby. It turns into a real treat when they cut the legs off of their pants.<br /><br />True, the movie is pretty short on real plot, and you can tell that some scenes were filmed in a swimming pool, but otherwise it's a real pleasure; guilty pleasure, that is. Of course, I do recommend the "MST3K" version.
