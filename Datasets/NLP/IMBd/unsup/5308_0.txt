"All or Nothing" shows that an individual's happiness is the direct result of his or her attitude and choices. Throughout "All or Nothing", the characters are engaged in various self-destructive and demoralizing behaviors. Specific examples of this are best captured, cinematic ally, in three particular scenes: the opening scene of Rachel in the nursing home; Penny, Phil, and Rachel(matriarch, patriarch, daughter)in the kitchen; and the closing scene. The territorial space in each of these scenes exploits the social and emotional confinement of the characters.<br /><br />In the opening scene as Rachel, the ambitionless daughter, mops robotically down the long hallway,she is tightly framed by the walls. When the elderly woman walks down the hall, towards the camera, Rachel appears to be trapped within the corridor's narrow width. The colors of her skirt and smock blend in with the surrounding hue of the walls. Her fading into the background, literally, is synonymous of her life choices to take the safe, least threatening, and stable route.<br /><br />Timothy Spall's portrayal of Phil is brilliant as he interpret's Leigh's English working class life. The awkward and dysfunctional dynamics of Phil's family are the direct result of his choices and approach to life. When Phil enters the apartment and walks into the kitchen, he is framed on one side by the relationship he has neglected and the other by the product of his disconnected parenting and poor mentoring. He is unable to maintain any personal space in his taxi and the viewer sees that he lacks any greater control in his home. In this scene, he is so tightly constricted that movement is not possible. Both with their back facing him, Penny and Rachel barely acknowledge Phil as he attempts to make small talk. <br /><br />Without sharing too much, the closing scene is also very well directed to further underscore the storyline and theme.<br /><br />"All or Nothing" similar cinematic touch is also seen in "Secrets and Lies". Leigh consistently uses 2-shots and closed forms to tell the struggles of the characters in both movies.<br /><br />The theme is reiterated and simplified when Phil states to himself, "Life is too short". Each person's acceptance of their responsibility for the state of his or her life is paramount "All or Nothing's" theme. Commanding one's own destiny through employment, friends, and intimate partner choices is personal journey that everyone faces. The "every man" aspect of this film engages the viewer and creates a personal connection between the audience and characters.
