Director Daisuke Gotoh clearly doesn't understand the erotic psychology behind a successful (or even interesting) women-in-prison film. I mean, the primary component of dykey-women-molesting-other-women-behind-bars seems to have completely escaped him in this one! Yoko Saito is certainly well-cast as the pretty Scorpion, unjustly accused, convicted, and thrown into a California women's penitentiary on clearly spurious grounds. But once she's there, nothing even remotely interesting happens. Yes, there are some dykey-looking women about, as well as some pretty young female inmates just waiting to be sexually victimized by them. But it never happens. There's really no lesbianism whatsoever. Instead, it's the male warden and his guards doing all the dirty work. So why the women-in-prison setting? If he didn't want to include scenes involving girls with other girls he should have set this story in a nightclub or brothel. Obviously this director knows (or cares) nothing about this genre of films, and it was very disappointing as a result.
