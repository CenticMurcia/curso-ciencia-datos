No matter what title you want to issue it, this giddy western (eastern?) from Thailand is one to seek out if you like your entertainment loopy & left of centre. The film seems to have several over lapping plots, and probably twice as many sub plots. Don't let this throw you from having a fun time (just don't approach this with the same seriousness as you would approach a Merchant/Ivory production). The film features a top notch crackerjack cast of Thai actors (none of which I've ever heard of,but anyone with a knowledge of Thai cinema will probably go gog-ma-gog over their personal favourites). I especially admired the visual texture of the film, employing a palate of over saturated colour, giving it a look of classic Technicolor (as Hollywood & Europe used in the 1940's,until the old IB Technicolor process was pretty much phased out in the late 1970's). If you like your soundtrack music on the schmaltzy side, the music in this film will be right up your alley (if you've ever heard Thai pop music,you'll know exactly what I mean). Check your IQ at the door, sit back,relax & bask in (just under)two hours of Asian cinematic goofiness (i.e. have fun).
