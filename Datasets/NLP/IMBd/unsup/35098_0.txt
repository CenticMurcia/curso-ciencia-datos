Okay, this sure ain't a work of art!! Yup, it's hard to be "artsy" with a film about a horrible outbreak of billions of killer worms--and even tougher when your total budget is $39.95 and your actors have never even had the experience of doing TV commercials or community theater! No, it's fairly obvious early on that NONE of the actors had ever before acted (and probably never since!). It's a cheesy and low-budget film that despite its crappiness is actually kind of watchable--provided you're not very demanding! A stranger comes to town and quickly hooks up with a local girl. At first a few small odd things occur--such as the guy getting a milkshake that has worms in it! But later, the horrid beasties began devouring everyone in their path. The script and plot are pretty thin and you see quite a bit of nudity by women who frankly don't look very good naked--but still, the film is oddly watchable and the worm sequences are pretty cool! A TRUE guilty pleasure!
