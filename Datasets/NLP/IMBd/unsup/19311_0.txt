"A test pilot and his weather observer partner are trying to develop a robot-controlled plane they hope their employer can sell to the army. Foreign agents learn of their work and sabotage the plane, hoping to stop the inventors and allowing the spies to steal the invention. Our inventors hope to thwart the plans of the spies and deliver the robot plane to the army, thus saving the country," according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.<br /><br />After making an impression in 1940's popular "The Westerner", young Forrest Tucker (as Jerry Barton) is piloted into a starring programmer role. "Emergency Landing" (inappropriately re-titled "Robot Pilot") is an unimpressive vehicle for Mr. Tucker, who would find later success in television's "F Troop". Listen for an amusing exchange between leading lady Carol Hughes (as Betty Lambert) and aunt Evelyn Brent (as Maude Marshall): on their way to tinsel town, Ms. Brent wonders what she will do in Hollywood. Ms. Hughes replies, "Barrymore is single again." Brent appeared with John Barrymore in "Raffles" (1917) and "Night Club Scandal" (1937); indeed, he had just received his fourth divorce.
