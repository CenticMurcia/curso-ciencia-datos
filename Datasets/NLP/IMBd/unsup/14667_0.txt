To be fair, I didn't watch this entire fiasco. I missed the beginning, which would have detailed some type of alien cylinder that is placed in the ocean, one that drives sharks into a feeding frenzy. One that apparently also provides them with super powers, like the ability to growl while they are under water.<br /><br />But this missing piece only increased my appreciation for the horror that is RAGING SHARKS. Finally, a Sci Fi Channel acquisition that was so bad, so incompetent, that it descends into the realm of the ludicrous. This movie is Ed Wood bad. It's startlingly, stunningly bad, even by Sci Fi Channel standards.<br /><br />My favorite exchange occurs when the hull of the sub/underwater station is compromised. There are explosions. There are fireballs. People run screaming this way and that. Water rushes into the structure. Pipes and walls burst. Then, Corbin Bernsen gets on the radio, looking rather dapper in the command set that he never leaves (like Basil Rathbone in an old Roger Corman movie), and puts out a desperate inquiry: "How long will it take to repair?" "About 15 minutes," comes the answer.<br /><br />Or did I just dream this sequence? It's one of those movies where you can zone out for 5 or 10 minutes and miss absolutely nothing. At least he doesn't scream every line of dialog like many of the actors (who appear to have been plucked from a high school play). To be fair, it's probably not their faults. Many are shot in close up and appear to be acting in completely different scenes, even when they're having interactions. It adds to the insane charm of the piece, which is why I gave it a 2 star rating instead of a 0.<br /><br />Great sets, though. A pity they were wasted on such an abominable piece of work.
