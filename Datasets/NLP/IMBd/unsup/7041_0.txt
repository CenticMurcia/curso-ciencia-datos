I remember seeing this film when I was 13 or so. I enjoyed it then, and I still enjoy it today.<br /><br />The plot is simple. WHile doing a hijacking of their own company truck, the truck's driver is murdered. Little do they know that the murdered trucker has a brother who's a Chicago Police officer.<br /><br />The murder only helps to strain the relation of Truman Gates (Swayze) and his brother, Brior (Neeson)and Truman with the rest of the family. Many of whom feel betrayed because Truman left the simple country life for the bright lights of the big city. This is much evident in the scene in which Gates and his wife (greatly played by Helen Hunt in a small role) arrive via a train. When Gates says that his family "ain't too comfortable around strangers" his wife replies "I'm not a stranger, I'm your wife." To which Gates replies "I wasn't talking about you." Despite the over the top premise, then film spends it's opening act to develop the characters, something that in todays special effect overdose, seems to have been greatly lost. The Gates brothers go on the usual hunt to find the killers.<br /><br />There is even some humor involved, as Neeson and Swayze banter well with each other. This is also a early starring role for Ben Stiller, who's gone on to make a string of forgettable formula comedies. The film also features, in minor roles, Bill Paxton as the ill fated Gates brother, Michael J. Pollard, and ANdres Katsulas as the mafia family head.<br /><br />The grand finale that takes place in the grave yard is a little over the top. However, the final resolution between the families shows the vengeance doesn't need to be taken on the innocent bystanders. ANd with the loss of his two brothers, Truman soon finds himself at a cross roads.<br /><br />If you're looking for Lawrence of Arbia, keep looking, because you're not going to find it here. If you are simply looking for a movie that intends to do nothing more then be entertaining for the viewer, this is perfect for you.
