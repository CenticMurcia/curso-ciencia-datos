This movie is one of my favorites in the Zombie genre, we can watch the human behavior in a serious problem like the end of the world, and the dark side of the people. For example: Cooper hates Ben, because he is a natural leader and he had good ideas to survive, therefore they were fighting every time and they shoot each other when the daughter of Cooper one became into a zombie. Other example: when the "militiamen" appear,they have fun shooting, torturing and burn the zombies (when there are 3 zombies hunded in a tree and the humans are laughing while they shoot to them). (sorry if my English is regular or bad, because I speak a little of English)
