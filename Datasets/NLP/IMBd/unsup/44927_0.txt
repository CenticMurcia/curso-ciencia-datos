Definition of a donkey punch: a blow administered to the back of a female's neck while their sexual partner, positioned behind them, approaches climax. This produces an involuntary clenching of muscles and increases the pleasure felt by the selfish male lover.<br /><br />Definition of Donkey Punch: a mediocre film trying desperately to make itself memorable by basing things around one scene that will stick in your mind for a while (and I am sure that you can guess what that one scene involves). There's a young cast all trying to prove their worth, and not really making any impression at all. There are a few loud dance tunes before things take a turn for the worse. There are even some moments that come close to being tense/entertaining before failing and reverting back to the standard, boring on screen action you have to endure with this group of unlikeable characters you really don't give a toss about.<br /><br />Slick and, for the most part, "safe" and packaged in a teen-friendly way, this is a bland waste of time that I would recommend others avoiding. Writer/director Oliver Blackburn probably thought he was doing something a bit different and entertaining - he wasn't.<br /><br />See this if you like: Dead Calm, The Hole, Open Water 2: Adrift.
