I thoroughly enjoyed this film. The graphics weren't up to say Episode1 standards, but were convincing enough (and I loved the raspy engine noise for the Rapiers). The acting was what I've come to expect from these younger American actors (as in good).<br /><br />I'd say from an objective view point it's a good film. A bit lacking in certain areas, but certainly enjoyable.<br /><br />I say "objective" simply because I have never been exposed to the hugely popular game series, so I was seeing this as a film, not as a spin off (in which case I'm sure it would come across worse, simply because when you're used to one set of actors portraying your favourite characters a new team will never fit the bill).<br /><br />Overall not a bad way to spend my Wednesday evening.
