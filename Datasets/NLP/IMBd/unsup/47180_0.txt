This is by far the lamest hollywood film there could ever be. This film is such crap that it comes out to be funny. Cheap special effects, phoney love scene, and a fat monk. Need I say more?? Why would a company put up money for something like this is beyond me. Why not make a low grade horror film or porn. At least more people would see it. I know for a fact that in 20 years this film will have a cult following due to its great crapiness. There are people who love Ed Wood's films, and there are people who love bad films, and this is by far the worst of all time bar-none!! I need one more line in order to submit this mess. Today is Monday, April 5th. Spring break rules all men and women.
