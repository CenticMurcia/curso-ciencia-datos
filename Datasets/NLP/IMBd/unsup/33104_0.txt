My partner and I won tickets to see the Sydney sneak preview so off we went last night (Monday 16th October) <br /><br />Let me begin by saying 'that is 88 minutes of my life that I will never get back" <br /><br />I was set to see a great Aussie flick; instead I found it mind numbingly boring, predictable 'comedy' (and I use that term lightly) <br /><br />It was more of a reflection on a horde of has been 'comedians' (and I use that term lightly also) who have unceremoniously used their names and positions on radio stations around Australia to tout the movie as being the best thing since sliced bread <br /><br />Suggest you spend 88 minutes watching the grass grow than see this movie <br /><br />I think I would have enjoyed having my fingernails ripped off one by one followed by an acid bath more than that ghastly piece of 'Australian Film making'
