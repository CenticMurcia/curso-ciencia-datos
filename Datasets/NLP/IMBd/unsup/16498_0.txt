Hey, Jamison Reeves, hopefully you read this and get back to me. It's your old pal, Shannon---coffee partner--L.A-1995-1996. Long time...I always knew I'd somehow run into you again. I tried contacting you about a year ago or so through your film. I guess you were on my mind, I did the internet thing, and there you were. A lot has happened in my life. I'm doing alright. Hopefully you get this somehow and try and contact me. I always knew,also, that you would stick with the acting thing.(Denton used to be my last name).I wish you luck in everything if I don't here from you. I'm sure I'll run into you eventually. It would be great to see you my friend. Remember my red bug?
