First-rate rock'n'roll road film.<br /><br />When I saw it in the theaters the year it was released I was a. totally impressed by it as a film and b. totally sympathetic with Rose.<br /><br />I have to say though that 10 years later as a manager and agent for musicians (not rock'n'roll and certainly not on the scale presented in the film) I had a whole new appreciation for people who possessed one undeniable talent yet made life hell for those who worked to help them make a living at it! Having managed one very popular high-end Irish booze-hungry performer who showed up when he felt like it ("I know when the sound check should be") and also felt free to book conflicting dates on his own when he felt the money would be better -- AFTER a contract had been signed! -- I felt huge sympathy for Rudge Campbell. Yes he might have been a little too money hungry but by god he was right when he "fired" her... once the contract is signed it's too late to change your mind.<br /><br />Bottom line though is that this is a fine film and a very accurate record of how an unstable performer can run herself into the ground.
