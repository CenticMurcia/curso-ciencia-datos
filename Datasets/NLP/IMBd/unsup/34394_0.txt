The kids in this show are nice. I'd like to spend time with them, whether in real life or watching them on TV. They all have varied interests and a positive outlook on life.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the show is almost completely ruined by their parents. They don't run the house with an iron fist--more like titanium. Anytime one of the kids disagrees with them, I half expect a whip to come out as the parents scream at them to get back to whatever their personal pet project of the week is.<br /><br />If there was someway to concentrate this show completely on the kids, or at least not try and pretend that the parents are "protagonists," I'd definitely be a big fan of the show. As it is, I can barely stand to watch it and flip to another channel whenever I can.
