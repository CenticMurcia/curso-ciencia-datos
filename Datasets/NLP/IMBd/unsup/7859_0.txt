Bad script, worse acting. The newest Disney venture seems to be almost an afterthought. After the resounding success of Pirates of the Caribbean, you would think that Disney had some inkling of an idea of what the public wants. Clearly, this is not true. This 100-minute yawn fest lays out the storyline within the first half an hour, but continues to meander here and there without really accomplishing anything. Eddie Murphy an irritating, money-hungry real estate agent who cares nothing for his wife and less for their children (I'm not sure why they bothered naming the character -- Eddie seems to be playing himself as usual). He coerces his family to venturing to Gracey Mansion in hopes of selling it. I won't go into detail, mostly because it is too inane to repeat. The characters weren't developed, there's only a few things of interest from the ride, and the final resolution is predictable at best. In short, don't bother -- go buy Pirates of the Caribbean! Disney fans, you WILL be disappointed!
