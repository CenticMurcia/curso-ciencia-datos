The magnificence of "Magnifico" is just undeniable. After watching it, everything else I watched seemed so bland. This was the first Filipino movie I came across, and it instantly struck a chord. The movie was a welcome change after I had viewed scores of Hollywood flicks. "Magnifico" is the best example of how a movie can work just based on fine & natural performances. The child artist is brilliant as an actor and so is the rest of the cast. It's hard for me to believe that just 220 something viewers at IMDb have voted for it (probably only a small number has seen it). It's probably one of the finest movies in recent years. Highly recommended, a must watch: 10/10.
