I watch a lot of horror movies and lately there really is no shortage of them to see. But this was a horrible movie. The blood and violence being the only thing that made it worth while. The acting was beyond high school bad, there were a couple scenes that you could tell the actors were just improving (poorly) and I never notice costumes, but they were some of the worst I've ever seen it this movie. Googles and a face shield? What the hell? I never turn off a movie no matter how bad it is but I almost did for this one. Who ever has there name attached to this movie in any way should probably be lined up and shot.<br /><br />But that's just my opinion.
