This movie is 80% copied from the french version of TAXI, it's awful. Everithing from the dialogs between the actors to the stuns it's a 80% copy from a better, french made, movie. For example: at the end of the movie, when the bad girls remain caught on that unfinished bridge, that exact stunt it's performed in the french version of TAXI (wich was released in 1998) but with one difference: the french one its done much better. In the french one there are a lot more stuns than in the American version of Taxi even though the American version had a lot more funds. And another problem: in the french TAXI the transformation of the car it's made much better. The best way for you to see this it's to see the french TAXI(1998), TAXI2(2000) and TAXI3 (2003) and after than watch the American made TAXI.
