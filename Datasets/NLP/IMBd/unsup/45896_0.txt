There is no point discussing bad films but to save other innocent viewers from the agony of senseless torture it is better if some enterprising reviews are written.This is a righteous attempt in that direction.Travellers and Magicians is a very bad film for many reasons. In Buddhism it is taught that lust for sexual relationships is a very bad sin but in Travellers and Magicians there are steamy scenes of lust.So the filmmaker is not practicing what he has been preaching to his followers.Khyntse Norbu worked with Bertolucci on his film "The Last Emperorer".It is only on that basis and nothing else that he is seeking fame.What a selfish act of pretentiousness.The worst thing about this film is that it is unable to stand on its own save for the crutches of exoticism.If we remove these scenes from this film than it would be nothing more than a visual story book.This film can only be liked by people who are fed up of their own lives, own circumstances and own religion.
