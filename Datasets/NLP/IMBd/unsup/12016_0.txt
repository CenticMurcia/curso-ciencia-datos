Mike Nichols is of a new breed, inspired by a classic breed of stand-up film makers. "Shotgun Stories" is one of those films for those with patience and appreciation of beauty in every day life. When you see those shots of the American landscape through the lens, they are so much more than just this small town where some people happen to live.<br /><br />Gripes with such films is that they aren't entertaining to many people, that nothing really happens or that too little goes on with a dragging pace. If you want to see cars explode and people do drugs, this isn't the film for you.<br /><br />"Shotgun Stories" is about two families who share the same Father. He passes away, and the family he left ignites in a battle against the family he was a part of for the second half of his life. The feud is so natural, so human, and so emotional that it is hard to find a way out of it for the boys as they are sent closer to the edge. The only possible answer is what comes next, death.<br /><br />Michael Shannon gives a fantastically reserved performance as Son Hayes, as he has been building on great performances in supporting roles, but getting no recognition for his stand-out lead performance in "Bug". It is clear that he is one to watch.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Terrence Malick, David Gordon Green, or Andrew Dominik's "The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford", this should be on your list to see.Shotgun Stories
