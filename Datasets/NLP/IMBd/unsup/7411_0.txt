Suburban Commando was enjoyable as a kid. I remember watching the trailer to it on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: Secret of the Ooze VHS tape. But the first Hulk movie I saw as a child was Mr. Nanny. Wanting to see this movie, I sought it in and out with no luck. Finally, it was previewed on TV (ABC or NBC, I think it was, back in 1994). I missed the first half of it, where Shep blows up General Suitor's spaceship. But I enjoyed it all the way through, and ended up renting it time and again, until finally a kindly old gentleman working a video rental store next to my dad's restaurant gave the VHS tape to me. He was moving to another town, and he was getting rid of some of the stuff. I probably wear this tape out trying to watch it over and over, and I'm sure you will too if you enjoy Hulk Hogan's movies.
