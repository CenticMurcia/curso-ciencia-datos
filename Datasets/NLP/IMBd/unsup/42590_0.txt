The Shunned House (2003) is a terrible film "based" upon the writings of H.P. Lovecraft. I have seen some bad adaptations before but this one takes the cake. Not only did the filmmaker used the basis of The Shunned House for the movie but he also used Music of Eric Zahn and Dreams of the Witchhouse. Sadly none of these show up in the movie. The director should have stuck with one story and made a lame version of that instead of taking from several stories. <br /><br />The "movie" was shot on digital video, I can deal with that but their was nothing in this one that was the slightest of interest. Blood, gore and nudity was tossed into the picture but it's still bad. People want to throw around the title worst movie ever made. I have nominate this one. It is that horrible. A message to the director, don't try to adapt anymore H.P. Lovecraft. Please!!<br /><br />Unwatchable, don't even try to watch this abortion.<br /><br />You might get a few chuckles if you get a bunch of your friends and watch it. That's the only way I would see this one again. Don't say I didn't warn you!
