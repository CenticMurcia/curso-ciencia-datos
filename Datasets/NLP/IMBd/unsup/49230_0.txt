Well well well, this film was simply atrocious. The worst film I have seen in the last two to three years.<br /><br />The breakup advertised as romantic comedy is anything but. I can't begin to describe how disappointed I was sitting through this movie.<br /><br />Nothing made me relate to the characters and their infantile behavior. They both came across as whining spoilt brats.<br /><br />The pace of the film is slow and pointless. Arguments, shouting and bickering don't make for light or romantic entertainment.<br /><br />Silly "votes" between good friends as to who is staying at the bowling game are just cringe factor, good grief do people really behave this way? certainly not my circle of friends. It was just embarrassing to watch.<br /><br />Not much redeeming in this film a few short laughs, one of the better ones being when their real estate agent friend offers to sell their home and wants to do so at no commission. BUT unfortunately company policy wont allow it so he has to charge it hahaha that was the funniest bit in the film. How sad :( I would have given it one star except for that real estate agent part LOL.<br /><br />AVOID THIS FILM AT ALL COSTS !!! A great gift for that person you don't really like but have to buy for appearances sake :)
