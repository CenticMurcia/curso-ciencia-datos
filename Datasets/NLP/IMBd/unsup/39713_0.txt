...unfortunately, I didn't. ROCKABILLY VAMPIRE has really very little going for it. I'm a relatively big rockabilly/psycho fan, so I thought I'd dig this film - but honestly, it was so extremely dull that I could barely sit through the whole thing...<br /><br />A vampiric Elvis reincarnate woos a local thrift store girl while a bunch of other boring sh!t happens...<br /><br />Honestly - that's all I got from ROCKABILLY VAMPIRE. There are a few funny characters and a few decent one-liners - and the acting isn't completely horrible for this sort of film - but NOTHING really happens throughout the entirely too long run-time. At forty minutes into it, it felt like an eternity, and then I realized I was not even half-way through. The soundtrack is OK, and I guess if you're a HUGE Troma fan or are such a big rockabilly fan that you MUST own anything related to the genre, then go for it - otherwise, this is a bore-fest with only minimal redeeming factors. Even the over-abundant cheezy gore that you would expect from a Troma release is missing...skip this one...3/10
