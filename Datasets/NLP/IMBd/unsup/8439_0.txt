Damnation Alley is set in a post apocalyptic America in world war three a band of survivors led by air-force major dent-on George Peppard following an accident at their base travel in style in a land-master which essentially is a deluxe camper van which is capable of traveling over rough terrain it has to be seen to be believed! i one can see where George A Romero got his 'Land of the dead inspiration!<br /><br />is one of those films that typically grows on you, i happen to enjoy it what's not to like? for starters the casting is excellent you have George Peppard before he entered further stardom with the A-team, complete with a southern accent( just wait till he utters the immortal line 'the town is full of Killa cockroaches! Jan Michael Vincent before he became famous with air-wolf the wisecracking Token black guy Paul Winfield, who suffers a fate worse than death when runs afoul of 'said Killa cockroaches' French actress Dominque Sanda as a Vegas show girl along for the ride and a Pre -breaking away Jackie Earle Haley as a waif who is adept at throwing rocks at disgruntled hillbillies! it's an enjoyable romp which is aided invaluably by Jerry Goldsmith's music score. the major downside is 'Damnation Alley' was shot in anamorphic widescreen unfortunately it remains to be seen whether fox decide to release this and they should. for the time being we'll have to make do with the horrendous panned and scanned copies.
