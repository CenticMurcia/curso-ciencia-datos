I too, paid to see this stink bomb, made as video slowly ate the Movies as we knew them. Like the other poster, I remember the oddly talkie theme song, easily the most interesting thing about the movie. I think the advantage of this kind of low budget film was that they could do one story, and shut down if they were out of money. I remember one with Vincent Price made around the same time that looked like it had been flung together over quite a few years. Anyway, these god awful "Anthology" films were a drive in filler stable for many years. In my humble opinion, the king of bad is "Dr. Terror's Gallery Of Horrors" , a must for bad movie fans. "Deadtime Stories" as noted here, was a cheapo video staple for a long time.
