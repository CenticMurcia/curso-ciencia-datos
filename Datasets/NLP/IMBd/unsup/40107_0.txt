The problem with the last few Hellraiser movies is that it's not a Hellraiser movie... "Deader" and "Hellworld" are OK stand alone films, but as a "Hellraiser" films, they're a disgrace.<br /><br />Take a simple story, fill it with "real or unreal" events and show some blood every ten minutes. Oh yeah, and don't forget to throw Pinhead in for a few seconds every half hour. True, Hellraiser was never meant to be about Pinhead. It turned out that way and that's not an problem. It's the disrespect the creators of the last films have for this awesome character. That's the issue. The Hellraiser series needs to be brought back to their origins.<br /><br />"Hellworld" is a fine movie when you don't see it as a "Hellraiser" film. I enjoyed Lance Henriksen presence in the movie and the film also includes a few cool kills.<br /><br />6/10
