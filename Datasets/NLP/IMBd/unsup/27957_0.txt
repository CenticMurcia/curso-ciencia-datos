Indigo was delightful. It provided a wonderful story line about family values and families working together in times of trouble. It was captured in a gorgeous setting, and it educated me about these gifted Indigo children and the difficulties they face.<br /><br />It seems that the emphasis and lessons of the movie was learning how to accept one another as they are and offering love and support in an unconditional manner.<br /><br />In summary, I have recommended this film to my friends as a good one to take all the family, and I would like to see more films of this nature in the theaters as I might go more often.<br /><br />Roberta
