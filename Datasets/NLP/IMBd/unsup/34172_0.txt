I appreciate that the series tries to give us a look at a Henry other than the fat old Henry of the Holbein portraits. But when Henry looks like he's in his 20s and Katherine of Aragon looks old enough to be his mom, this makes me annoyed.<br /><br />There were only about six years in the difference between Henry's and Katherine's ages. By the time he meets Anne Boleyn, Henry is 36, Katherine 42. By the time he marries Anne, Henry is over 40, Anne in her 20s. Hellllooooooooooo! Looks like they are not going to age Jonathon Rhys Meyers any in the series ...<br /><br />You want a good look at a younger Henry, look at Richard Burton's performance in "Anne of a Thousand Days." Henry's active here, mature, and not the fat-tacular wreck he was by the time he got around to Jane Seymour, and Anne of Cleves.<br /><br />I give it a 4 because of the "Field of the Cloth of Gold" sequence and the spectacular wood and canvas palace. And in 1520, Henry was 29, so Mr. Rhys Meyers is fine for that sequence.
