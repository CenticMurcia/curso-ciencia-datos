I did not know what to expect from the movie as I never read the book. I must say the movie disappointed me. It looked to be made very quickly. Sometimes actors, especially Tom Hanks, looked like they just said a line in the script... Did they realize they were not at the lunch break anymore and they should at least look like they thought about what they were saying? The puzzles looked childish. Langdon (Hanks) solved them all within seconds... Wow! What a perfect way to protect Holy Grail! And then there was this ancient secret note written backwards... And in perfect English! All ancient people in France, Italy, Vatican and wherever probably spoke perfect English. I think children at primary school would laugh.<br /><br />My girlfriend asked me after the film - Did the characters actually change their dresses throughout the movie? - I guess they did not. Then she just commented - Very stupid movie.<br /><br />I say the same. Very stupid, long and boring movie. Why they spend money to make such films?
