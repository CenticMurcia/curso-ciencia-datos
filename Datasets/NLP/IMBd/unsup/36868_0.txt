There is little humour in this otherwise ridiculous film, except for the one that arises - I suspect unintentionally - from the hotchpotch of conflicts of life-sworn friendship and love interests between the characters. The tearjerking that tugged though was uniquely caused by suppressed hilarity - when I wasn't yawning, that is. The guys look mean and moody and handsome enough, or just handsome and moody, or just mean or just, in the case of the inspector - plain ludicrous - and in the case of the art gallery girl - plain hilarious. Ha Ha - I would sooo love to see some Roman gangster - however darkly handsome and with an unlikely past - fall head over heel in love with Amelie Poulain ha ha ha - I'm still laughing. Why not give the part to Paris Hilton fogossake - would have been so much more convincing. And what about the Whore-who-falls-for-the-otherwise-useless-inspector because - wait for this - he treated like : not once, not twice but three times A Lawdy! ha ha ha ha - I'm still laughing. And what about... I could go on obviously
