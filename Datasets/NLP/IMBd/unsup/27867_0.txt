Third episode of the legendary television series stars Dan Duryea as Al Denton. Al is a hopeless alcoholic in the Old West who was at one time a successful gunslinger. Now Al is ruthlessly made fun of by swaggering bully Dan Hotaling (Martin Landau). A mysterious peddler (Malcolm Atterbury) provides Al with two items - a gun and a potion - that just may affect his life for the better. And when Al's efficiency with a gun returns, a young hotshot named Pete Grant (Doug McClure) decides to challenge him.<br /><br />This episode worked so well for me because Duryea was a very (sym)pathetic figure. The actor makes the most of his role. As his story progresses, he's conscious of history repeating itself and what his ultimate destiny might be. (It's no accident that the peddler is named Mr. Fate.) The truth is that his redemption and second shot at life might come at a price. It's an emotional story that climaxes in an interesting and unexpected way. The ending is filled with hope which makes it all the more appealing.<br /><br />The actors on hand are quite entertaining. Jeanne Cooper of future 'The Young and the Restless' fame is the kindly Liz. Landau is a good deal of fun as the cruel Dan.<br /><br />Overall, a wonderful episode.<br /><br />8/10
