Where do I begin, to tell the story of how bad a movie can be?<br /><br />Here is a list of the tripe which makes this movie a sham:<br /><br />1- College-age sex scenes masked as drama. <br /><br />2- Aliens coming out of any orifice of one's body. (Writers, please stop writing movies with this as a plot element. It is so overused that only a writer with no imagination would be tempted to use this now stock piece of "alien occupation" as anything even remotely approaching originality.) <br /><br />3- Bevy of blondes and bimbos used as an element to demonstrate the cultural diversity of the average population. (Here it comes off more as an element to bring in the little boys and their salivating glands..if not a cringe or two from this viewer.) <br /><br />4- An ending which is so predictable to be almost blasphemously criminal. (Who of you who have seen this movie did NOT see this coming?) <br /><br />5- Hard-rock soundtrack in place of a real one. <br /><br />6- Direction and editing which strikes a new low in vapidity.<br /><br />Only one scene even approaches the word "good": <br /><br />***********PERHAPS A SPOILER***********<br /><br />I am talking of the scene where Elias Toufexis has a sensitive encounter with an alien near the end of the movie. In this scene and in this scene only does one get a taste of the acting abilities of Toufexis. He demonstrates a very believable range as a young man who will do just about anything for real love. I hope we see more of Toufexis. He shows real promise.<br /><br />************END OF SPOILER*************<br /><br />Othewise, this movie was a terrific waste of an evening. I do not recommend it for anyone but the youngest sci-fi aficionados who may not yet know the difference between a sci-fi movie and a sci-fi film.<br /><br />Doink!
