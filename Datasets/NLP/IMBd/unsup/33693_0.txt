Disappointing. With a title like "Adrenaline Rush" in a big IMAX theater, what might you expect to see? Car racing? Being in a burning building? Bungee jumping? Flying in a jet at mach two? Mountain climbing?<br /><br />No? How about skydiving? Lots and lots of skydiving. And then more skydiving. First day at school. More skydiving. Cliffjumping. Skydiving. Hokey end. Credits.<br /><br />This is the worst IMAX film I've ever seen. The beginning, with Peter Gabriel/Afro Celt's "Falling" is promising, but all that promise falls apart when the narrator calls one of the skydivers a "genius" and "modern renaissance man." It's skydiving, not, well, rocket science. Apparently, someone filmed a bunch of skydiving footage with IMAX and then had to create a movie out of it. The result is this. With Leonardo DaVinci cruelly tacked on, the result feels like a cheap ploy to make you think skydiving is educational. This movie is about as educational as my shoe.<br /><br />The ending is trite and hokey (watch and see as everyday Americans engage in risk by going to work!). If, perhaps, the filmmakers had re-edited the movie (removing the first day at school business, the Davinci stuff and the ending) and called the movie "Skydiving: And Lots Of It!" it would have been fine. But the end result is not that great. Save your IMAX money for something else.
