Okay, let's face it, we've all seen this before. Every single scene. But Shah Rukh Khan adds such a refreshing and believable twist to the story that you'll be seeing it again for the first time. I was roaring with laughter the whole movie. No one knows what anyone else is doing in this movie, everything is a case of mistaken identity. But the humor is it's strength. I absolutely recommend, it's not intended to be taken seriously, just enjoyed. Fun songs, cute dances. Wow, I liked it! Am I biased because I'm a Shah Rukhaholic? You bet! You will find yourself singing "Baadshah" in the supermarket the next day, remembering a scene and chuckling to yourself out loud.
