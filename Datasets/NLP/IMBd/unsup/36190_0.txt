"American Psycho 2" just came on HBO, so I am currently writing this as I watch it. The only question I have about the movie thus far is if I can even stand to watch it til it's inevitably horrid conclusion. So far I've subtracted 2 points from my rating for the opening sequence, an amazingly bad tie-in to the original "American Psycho." Might as well go ahead and subtract another 2 points for the terrible acting displayed thus far. And let's just go and subtract another 2 points for the absurd plot. I enjoyed the original "American Psycho"; shame they've destroyed any chance of a quality sequel. The way they attempt to link this movie to the first one should be a crime.<br /><br />**SPOILERS**<br /><br />The movie itself is about a college student with aspirations for working at some special division of the FBI. An almost guaranteed way of getting into the program is by becoming a Professor's teacher's aide. The problem is that this is a much-coveted position and the competition is fierce. She figures the best way to land the position is by killing off all her competitors. Uhhh, right.<br /><br />Mila Kunis (from tv's "That 70's Show") stars as the murderous college student. She does a truly excellent job of showcasing the fact that she has NO acting skills whatsoever. Her voiceover narrative is sub-par and rather grating. This may be the most unconvincing portrayal any actor has given in a role since Freddie Prinze Jr. played a fighter pilot in "Wing Commander." She should be a role model for pretty girls though. No woman has gone as far as she has on looks alone since Pamela Anderson made her meteoric rise to the middle. And Mila didn't even have to take her clothes off for Playboy.......yet.<br /><br />William Shatner is the Professor of Criminal Profiling or whatever. He gives a...Shatneresque performance for the film. I happen to think Shatner is a talented actor whose career has been hindered by playing iconic roles in a couple of television shows, not that he or his accountant have been complaining. In recent years he has been reduced to playing caricatures of himself (the Priceline.com commercials, "Showtime"). Here, he does as fine a job as ever doing just that. In fact, he is the only watchable person in the movie. At least he's still working.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is disposable, much like their murder-victim characters.<br /><br />An hour and 10 minutes into the movie I'm prepared to give this a 2/10. If you get a chance to check this out for free, and there's absolutely *nothing* else on television, you may want to give it looksie. If nothing else you may get a kick out of seeing Mila Kunis in her jogging outfit and low-cut dress.
