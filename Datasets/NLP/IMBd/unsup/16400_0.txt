A young man (played by Peter Chang) watches his father die and grows up wanting to revenge. The story is pretty basic here. Its a bad movie for the most part, but luckily there are some incredible fight scenes.<br /><br />Lung Fei makes a cameo at the start and takes on Cassanova Wong. Some nice kicking by Cassanova, and Lung Fei is defeated easily. Only a warmup of what's to come.<br /><br />After like an hour of no good action, Cassanova gets to fight again. He fights Chan Wai Lau who has a good role as one of Peter Chang's 2 teachers. Chan Wai Lau is a great comedic actor with decent fighting skills, and he performs about as well as he can against Cassanova. He makes good use of a pipe as a weapon, but Cassanova is too much for him.<br /><br />Next up is what I figured would be the highlight of the movie, Wong Wing Sang vs Chia Kai. I am a big fan of both actors, so I was expecting greatness, and that's exactly what I got. Chia Kai does an AMAZING stunt at the beginning where he jumps off of a wall and lands on a table. Awesome fight with good acrobatics and good fist work. Also look for the part where Chia Kai dodges a knife that Wong throws at him. For real.<br /><br />Next Chia Kai takes on Cassanova. Its possibly even better than the Chia Kai Wong Wing Sang fight.<br /><br />Just when I thought the action couldn't possibly get any better, they somehow turn the choreography up a few notches in the final fight. I have only seen Peter Chang in a few movies and this is the only one I have seen where he has a leading role. You may recognize him as the guy with the gun who fights with Wang Chung in Shanghai 13. His acrobatic skills are up there with just about anybody. Its a shame he was only in a handful of movies because he could have been a big star. Major talent completely wasted. Anyways, the final fight is 12 minutes long and one of the best fights I have seen in awhile. I have watched this movie every night for a week and I just can't get over how good the choreography is. Not only will Cassanova Wong fans love this movie, but any kung fu fan will be blown away by the final 30 minutes.<br /><br />I have the Phoenix DVD and the picture quality is a bit above average and its partly widescreen. Sound is decent. English and Japanese tracks, no original language option. For some reason Chan Wai Man is on the cover of the DVD, but he isn't in the movie.
