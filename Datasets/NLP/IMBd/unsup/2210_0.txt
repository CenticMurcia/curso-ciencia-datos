''Highway to Hell '' is one of my favorite horror movies! I don't remember exactly my age when I watched it for the first time(I think I was 11) but since the time I watched for the first time until now I cannot be tired of the story! With some funny elements and also a different plot, ''Hghway to Hell'' starts when Charlie and his girlfriend Rachel are running away from their homes to marry. Charlie is very worried with the possibility of Rachel's parents have asked the police to search her, and they go as fast as they can to a different road.In the middle of the road, they stop in a gas station, and they are alerted by Sam, an old man, to not sleep at the road between the strange trees. Charlie does not pay much attention and Murphy's law happens: he gets sleepy and Hellcop, a bizarre and monstrous cop, takes Rachel to Hell. Charlie now needs to go to Hell , with Sam's help he gets a car from the 50's and a special gun, to destroy the monsters and save his girl.<br /><br />One funny fact was to see Ben Stiller in the beginning of his career in the role of the cook from the Hell...I would never remember he made this movie!
