The film starts confusingly with a bunch of characters whose story is not told and who get shot quickly. Fair enough, but even the two main characters played by Wesley Snipes and ex-Eastenders and Red Caps star, Tamzin Outhwaite, do not create interest. Snipes makes a half decent performance, but the dialogue put into the mouths of most of the actors was terrible. No decent one-liners, little humour, which is expected in a good action film. In fact the dialogue seemed wooden and unnatural. A high point was the psychopathic performance of Peter Lee Wilson - Alexsie - although comical at times.<br /><br />The plot was interesting, but the film making was appalling, so the plot seemed incoherent - believe me the film had potential for a good story and the ending was exciting. Some of the action sequences were entertaining, but it was obviously low budget. Shame.
