Long time dead is one of the best films that the UK has done in ages---and quite rare as well, as we never seem to make horror films. This film however, is the biggest exception, and it is ABSOLOUTELY BRILLIANT, as it is a million times much better and more interesting than american teen horrors, which have become a bit dull over the past few years. normally horror films dont scare me-but this one made me jump a couple of times. i like the way that the scenes are shot (especially when the 'demon' (djinn) is chasing each of the group of friends and the atmosphere is totally frightening and sinister. It is so good to see us British people doing these type of films for a change--that is what made it really 'new' and a bit more intersting than all its american counterparts. it follows a typical american teen horror (about a group of friends all bein killed of one by one)--but it does it REALLY REALLY well. My congratulations and praise to the director who should have won an award for the film. I can't wait for the video or DVD to come out!
