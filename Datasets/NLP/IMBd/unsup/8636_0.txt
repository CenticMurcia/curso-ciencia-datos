I'm a complete romance fluff person and this movie satisfied my taste. You really feel how much Cinderella and Charming love each other, and its so sweet to see that, even if it is only a cartoon. The characters are rather out of character for my taste, but thats only if you're traditional. The plot was decent and the animation, while nothing can compare to the original, is decent and colorful as well.I'm sad to say that the second movie actually had better music than this one. Music is something i really expect from a movie and sadly while slightly entertaining, it did not deliver. The stepmother definitely shows her evil side a little more in this one, a perfect villain. Not to mention you have two sets of comedy reliefs, the stepsisters and jaq and Gus, a great pair. But if your as much of a kid as i am then you will definitely get a kick out of this movie.Buy and watch over and over, trust me you won't be the only one.
