Full-length movie about foxes. The main hero, a little fox Vuk lost his parents and was adopted by another old fox, Karak. When he grows up, he avenges a hunter and rescue a vixen Panny from the cage. Style of that movie is classic, but not Disney's, Hungary made own different animation (and this is not anime!). The movie himself exists in two version: one for TV in two parts and second for movies. That versions slightly differs in some episodes.
