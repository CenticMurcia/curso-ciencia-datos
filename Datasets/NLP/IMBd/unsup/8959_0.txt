I got this movie, primarily to see how it's soundtrack (which is great) related to the storyline. I was shocked to see how good the movie was! The movie is whitty, and kept my interest for the entire duration of the movie. Even my wife, who frequently dislikes indie films, enjoyed the movie. Rent it!
