My husband and I just watched the Family Cruise and found it utterly inspiring. The world could use more programming such as this, and hopefully one day soon people will find a way to accept, if not embrace, our precious diversity and accept the part of themselves that prevents acceptance of others. This program shows in a very unaffected way what all families seek. These particular families are a great example to follow, and we enjoyed sharing in the honesty and courage displayed by the members of the cruise. Please do show more programming that focuses on the more positive aspects of life on this ever shrinking planet.<br /><br />Thanks, Rosie, way to go! <br /><br />Aggie Lukaszewski
