I saw this movie on the Sci-Fi channel and it rocked. I watched with two friends and all three of us were laughing gut-busters the entire time. A great scene is when the heroes go to the Firehouse BBQ and risk their life against the zombies for just one more tasty chicken wing. I will probably need to rent the movie, because Sci-Fi blurred out the two hottie-boom-bottie zombies together in the bathroom. I'm glad they threw that scene in there to keep everyone watching.<br /><br />The Coke vs. Pepsi dialogue was classic southern style. Also, when the only person alive in the police station tells the TV reporter to turn the SEC football game back on, it made me realize this cast injected some real southern dialogue into a Zombie movie.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great movie, but you should know what to expect if you watch it. This a hilarious zombie movie done on a limited budget, but I think there is some real talent in the crew. Rob Rugan and Mike Benson could definitely produce some great work with bigger budgets. Also, I think this movie will go down as a classic break-through for Josh Snead (not listed in cast) as he made his theatrical debut as the erotic, bullet-eating zombie in the police station.
