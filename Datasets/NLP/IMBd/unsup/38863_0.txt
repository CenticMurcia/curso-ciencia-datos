The novel from which the film was based was a very good Maine novel from Ruth Moore. From everything I've read about the movie plot and focus, the story was changed drastically. They really ought not to have put the author up on the credits. People wouldn't want to read the book after they gutted the story for the film. <br /><br />Anne's character wasn't opposed to Hod's going to sea at all!!!! I don't know where they came up with that one for the film and other stuff.<br /><br />The novel's author Ruth Moore must have flipped out when they tore her story up and created an entirely different one.<br /><br />Read the book, Spoonhandle, if you can find a copy.<br /><br />I'd still like to see the film someday for its location cinematography and it's always fun to see the young Dean Stockwell.
