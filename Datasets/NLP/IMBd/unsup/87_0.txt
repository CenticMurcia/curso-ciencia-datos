This ppv was made even better by one of the greatest rock songs ever Highway to Hell and the ppv was so great, one of the best ppvs ever! And the ppv started with a very hot opener with D-Lo Brown and Val Venis which got a surprising 15 minutes and the two men made the best of it! Oddities took on Kaientai in a fun match, X-Pac took on Jarrett in a haircut match, Edge was Sable's surprise partner as they took on Marc Mero and Jacqueline, Shamrock took on Owen Hart in a boring lions den match, Mankind went alone in a handicap hardcore match against the Outlaws which only lasted 5 minutes but it was pretty brutal for the 5 minutes, Triple H and the Rock had a decent ladder match but can't be compared to others, and in the main event Steve Austin defended the world title against the Undertaker, overall another good Summerslam and one of the best ever
