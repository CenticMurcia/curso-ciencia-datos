I'm left incredulous that anyone could see this film as anything but insulting. My 12 year old thought it was moronic. That's fine. Maybe he's too old for it. My 9 year old thought the story was stupid and the characters annoying. Maybe she was too old. My six year old left the room and asked to be told when the movie was over. These kids love films. The worst thing that a film maker can do in making a kids film is to assume that kids are stupid. This is not worth a rental, this is not worth borrowing from a friend, this is a film to use as punishment. If you still insist on watching it after reading this, make sure you take a gravol!
