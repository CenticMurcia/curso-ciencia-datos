I like a little fantasy, but this plot sought to give validity to some lame old Hollywood spiritual fetishes, and their inclusion wounds the story line. So it ended up being shallow and silly.<br /><br />The kids are cute, the directing and acting engaging, and special effects kind of fun. But the plot premise and cult supports made it offensive and ineffective. It would have been better if the creators had made up a whole new set of fantastic causes and endings. And the story would have had a timelessness quality about it that makes for classics. This ended up being another environmental/social/air-headed anything goes plot based on current (and passing) passions typical of the times.<br /><br />They also stuck in 'live-togethers' in the role of a teacher that encourages life styles that never work, as if that aberration of society can be profitable. Live together people are a shame to us all and no one anywhere near them is proud of them. But here, as usual, it is laid before our children as normal and beneficial. But then, Hollywood doesn't live in the real world, has serious trouble with right and wrong, and cares not a whit about our children.
