So add badly done zombies, a villain taken from the old "House" movies, and cookie-cutter characters. What do you get??? A flick that makes "House of the Dead" look like an art-house film.... First off, there is very little connection between the opening scene. The acting was, of course, horrible. There was the science chick who kept looking for a logical explanation to why her friends were being eaten. There was the redneck. The pretty girl who lives just long enough (but no nudity to make it worthwhile). It looks like the budget was so low, they filmed it during one afternoon. Finally, there is a hybrid scene that combines elements from Scarface and Silence of the Lambs. Unfortunately it was sewn together with a safety pin. A high school film club would be ashamed of this dog.
