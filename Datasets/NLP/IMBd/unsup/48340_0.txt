A very unusual, strange, but in the end not at all interesting, simil-horror anthology, based on a different interpretation of classical fables. A really warped uncle tell his nephew three different stories to try to convince him to sleep: the first is a sort of faerie tale with a couple of witches and their young male servant that try to resurrect one of their kind. But the boy falls for a knockout blond and so the story goes. The second is a retelling of Little Red Riding Hood, really strange and boring. The third segment, that is the only good one in this movie, is a sick and totally goofy version of Goldylocks, with the blonde girl as a crazy serial killer of young boyfriends that makes a strange alliance with the Bear family (in fact, a sort of mixture between Bonnie and Clyde and a farmer family coming out of Lil Abner) and find her true love in Baby. All in all, a forgettable attempt at innovation in a field crowded with better ideas
