i saw LAKE PLACID some months a go, and i thought it was pretty decent, not the best alligator movie out there, but i stayed awake. it was kind of funny though, to see betty white, a calm harmless woman be the caretaker of a monster. so LAKE PLACID was an okay movie. 2/5. but when i found out there was going to be a LAKE PLACID 2, i was so excited. i thought, "wow, lake placid's makin' a comeback!". i saw it when it premiered in April. I was shocked. this was the dumbest film ever, next to Cruel Jaws. the funniest/dumbest scene was that part when that girl says to the guy "stop touching my feet" and it turns out to be the 45 foot croc. how does she attempt to rescue herself? she swats the croc with the magazine she's holding like she's trying to swat a fly! she gets what she deserves, and the acting is just horrible. this film was basically a rip off of TREMORS (four predators) and ALLIGATOR. 1/10
