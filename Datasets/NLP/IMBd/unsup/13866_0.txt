Uggh. It's amazing that in recent years, old shows, whether good or terrible, have attained "classic" status. A while back, I heard some folks on TV referring to Yogi Bear as a "classic" cartoon and was absolutely shocked! Imagine,...a terrible cartoon with abysmal production values is now seen by some as a classic?!?! No way,...that is, unless classic means "heaping pile of crap".<br /><br />Back in the 1950s, Hanna-Barbera productions was a good thing. They were responsible for some wonderful Tom and Jerry shorts and they were well-respected. However, after getting fired by some idiots at MGM, they couldn't afford to direct cartoons with high production values. The number of frames used per second and the backgrounds for the animations in their new non-MGM toons were strictly bargain basement. And, in addition to low production values, they simply were unfunny and meant to appeal only to very young kids. And, by the 1960s, lousy quality cartoons were now the norm, so Yogi Bear was a pretty successful cartoon--along with other totally uninteresting characters as Quickdraw McGraw and Huckleberry Hound.<br /><br />So my final verdict is that they are crappy and helped usher in a 20-25 year period of horrible animation. Thanks to newer higher quality animation from Nickelodeon and others, hopefully we can forget this crap and realize that older isn't always better. Don't waste your time with these cartoons.
