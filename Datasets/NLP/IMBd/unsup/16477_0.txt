The unfortunate thing about Explorers is that the studio rushed opening this film before letting Joe Dante properly finish it. And it was all for nothing. Because of the rushed timing it opened on a weekend that cost it its audience. The three leads, Ethan Hawk, River Phoenix and Jason Presson do a fine job in the film, working with an excellent script that is both funny and bittersweet as well. ALso featuring Dick Miller, a regular in Dante's films, especially noted for "The Gremlins." Another excellent role was James Cromwell as the father of Wolfgang, played by River Phoenix. And finally one of my favorite actors, Robert Picardo who plays several characters (in heavy make-up). This film is nothing special, just good family fun.
