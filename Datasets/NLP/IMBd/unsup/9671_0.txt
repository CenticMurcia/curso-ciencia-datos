I admit that when I first heard of this movie starring Sofi'a , I wanted to see Sofi'a topless or in lace nightgowns..but that changed when I watched this movie.. I was familiar with Roselyn's work (Boat Trip,Rush Hour 2)and this was the 1st time I saw Jaci. Like with most of the fans of this movie,I fairly enjoyed it,as a guy -I enjoyed the eye-candy..Especially Sofi'a,even though she emulated that "cuchi-cuchi" Charo style,with her comical antics and Sofi'a over doing her hot and sexy colombian accent!! Because this movie was directed by a woman,this was a light screwball comedy..the story was simple,the comedy tame,lot of silly clich√©'s(especially for Sofi'a)and the acting was OK,though I was surprised at Sofi'a's comedy timing,since she never had any training at acting!!I don't know if this movie would have been better if a man directed this,his perspective.But because I enjoyed watching Sofi'a working off on the other Latina's,in all their sexiest,I could bare to watch this over again!!!
