Interesting presentation of a weak marriage, with excellent performance by Bruce Willis and a mediocre one by Michelle Pfeiffer. Willis shows a very dynamic person who is both playful, sentimental and serious if he has to be. He is a wonderful father who connects with his children on a deeper level then one would imagine. <br /><br />Pfeiffer on the other hand, plays on overly stressed out mother,who talks about her old self that Willis once fell in love with, and points out the moments that made their love possible, but she does not act them out. And when she does, she goes too far in it. Her last speech seemed fake, insincere and over exaggerated that it made me sick. <br /><br />Overall, if you ignore the less then satisfactory acting at times, it is a sweet movie which gives you plenty to think about. Oh and don't see it with someone you are having problems with...Only people in stable relationships can endure this movie together and not get into a fight about it, because everything that's argued is so real and so true, you forget that it's just a movie.
