Dreary and flatly directed, 'The Philadelphia Experiment' is a disappointing lump based on a supposedly true story in which sailors Michael Pare and Bobby Di Cicco are transported from 1943 to 1984 during a radar test. Could be intriguing. Isn't. The plot unfolds so slowly, and is directed with so little style, that it's of practically no interest. As Pare gets closer to finding how he ended up in '84 things pick up a little but those developments are skipped over pretty quickly in favour of a conclusion filled with crummy visual effects. Pare injects a little charisma into an otherwise duff cast that includes Nancy Allen in full-on plank mode.
