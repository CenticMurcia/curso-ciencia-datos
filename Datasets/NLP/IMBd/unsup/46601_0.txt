I was excited to see the movie. Then I was disappointed. Much of the acting, especially the "known" stars, was quite cheesy. The writing seemed disjointed and the characters weren't funny. I especially was put off by the nastiness of some of the dialogue. The reference to defecate or not to defecate was gross. Occasional humor but too sporadic.
