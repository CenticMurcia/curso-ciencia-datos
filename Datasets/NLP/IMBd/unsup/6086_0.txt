Though I know Schumacher is an established and good director, it's still hard to forgive him for practically ruining the Batman franchise. Town Creek is definitely a good redemption piece.<br /><br />I will admit, the first 40 minutes of the 90 total minutes had my head spinning at what this is all about. It didn't help that the original title was Blood Creek then changed to Town Creek. I definitely agreed with the "blood" part of the first name, but was/still am confused on the "creek" and "town" words. Sure, there's a creek involved, for all-but 56 seconds, but as far as I remember, there isn't much of a "town;" the overwhelming majority takes place on a farm.<br /><br />At any rate, the movie begins to unravel and it quickly becomes clear on what this movie's about. And, frankly, it's not that bad at all.<br /><br />The movie begins more than half a century ago with the Nazi's mission to locate the occult and its items of witchcraft located inWest Virginia, USA. (Really? Uh, okay, then.) An officer's willing to pay top dollar ($150! Fine, today would probably be over a thousand) weekly for the search on their land. They reluctantly agree and he finds what he's looking for quite quickly. The power (literally) goes to his head and, now, let's fast forward to the present Brothers reunite after one went missing for two years, and older brother, Victor (Purcell) leads his younger sibling, Evan (Cavill) to a sectioned off/private farmland to shoot up the inhabitants. Other than loyalty to his brother, paramedic Evan really shouldn't be involved in such cold-hearted murders, but, alas, he goes, attempts this and with his inner-conflicts, he botches a lot of Victor wants to achieve: the deaths of the entire family living on this farm. But, he's also looking for a "him" also living there.<br /><br />It's quickly apparent the family's equally afraid of the "man" living on their property, and once released from their makeshift prison, all literal hell breaks loose.<br /><br />Not too hard to place two and two together to discover both who the evil "man" is as it is the family living at the estate, but that's besides the many points/plot twists the movie brings up.<br /><br />It turns out the man can't enter the house where Evan, Victor and what's remaining of the family is hiding out due to symbols they've painted on the windows/doors. But, the "man" can kill mammals and send them in to get the blood he needs to "advance to the next stage." Quite frankly, I've given away a lot of the surprises in this feature, but I assure you, as I stop here in the plot synopsis section of my review, there's so much more to the storyline. As is there are other good qualities to the movie.<br /><br />Like I said, Schumacher is an established director; he knows how to build suspense, creativity and make a movie. This is a well crafted film and does have surprisingly good acting on all fronts. And though the plot (or I should say, the second portion of the movie) isn't the most original (SEE: Tales from the Crypt Presents Demon Knight) it's still entertaining and recommended for horror buffs.<br /><br />Just do what I did, brave through the first 40 or so minutes and let the pieces fall into place and have fun.
