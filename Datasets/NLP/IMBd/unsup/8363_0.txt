I saw this as a kid and loved it. I watch it again and again with my kids now. No bad words (one is implied, but not spoken) totally clean for the whole family. One scary part for kids younger than 6 or so, if you want to censor it, have your kids leave the room when they go outside to dig up the body. You have plenty of warning, they are in the crypt for a while before the open the coffin.<br /><br />It is written by Tim Conway, and stars Tim Conway and Don Knotts. The plot isn't deep, but very light and funny. My favorite line is "for a short person, you have long sentences" so funny. <br /><br />They say I have to write 10 lines of text and I have nothing else to say, so now I am just filling space. Sorry, but all I really wanted to say was that it was a good movie. I don't really know how else to say that.
