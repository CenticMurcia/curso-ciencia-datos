An all-star cast have a field day in this excellent adaptation of Grace Metalious' novel.<br /><br />There is so much going on in this town and it is told well with wonderful acting and 5 acting Oscar nominations to boot.<br /><br />Constance MacKenzie settled in this town after her husband allegedly died and is raising a daughter, Alison, while the proprietor of a dress shop. Truth is that Alison is illegitimate. Constance is soon courted by the town's young new high principal, Michael Rossi played well by newcomer Lee Philips. The position of principal was supposed to go to veteran pedagogue Elsie Thornton. ( a wonderfully spinster-like performance by Mildred Dunnock who specialized in these roles.) As is so true in life, a school board stepped in and used Thornton's age to thwart her appointment for the supposedly young, dynamic Rossi.Dunnock conveyed the right stuff in depicting her disappointment but her determination to continue her commitment to teaching.<br /><br />Alison's best friend, played by Hope Lange, comes from a dysfunctional family. Her emotionally wrought mother is victimized by a second husband, played with a fantastic sadistic quality by Arthur Kennedy. Alison is Diane Varsi and Lange's mom is Bette Field, who eventually kills herself.<br /><br />Town gossips and other vicious people reside in the town. Dr. Lucas Swain, a marvelous Lloyd Nolan, will come to the aid of Lange, when she is accused of killing her stepfather Kennedy. Lange's scenes on the witness stand are believable and Nolan is at his best in his condemnation scene of the town.<br /><br />Russ Tamblyn put away his dancing shoes and stars as the boyfriend of Selena Cross (Lange). Victimized by an overbearing mother, Tamblyn showed he could do some fine dramatic acting.<br /><br />With all this, we have a fine Lana Turner performance as Constance MacKenzie. A sexually suppressed woman, afraid of a romantic involvement in her life, Turner turned in a powerhouse performance.<br /><br />Lana Turner was nominated for best actress and supporting nominations went to Tamblyn, Kennedy, Lange and Varsi. While no one won the Oscar, their performances are memorable.<br /><br />A truly wonderful rendition of town life with the problems of gossiping pursued.
