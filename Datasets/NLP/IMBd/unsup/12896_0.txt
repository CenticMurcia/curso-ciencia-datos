This film works as a nice little reality check for us "over-aged" surfers. We see Rick teased with getting a so called real job, and we see him doing what he loves to do....being at the beach. Nice direction for a 70's film and real nice character development. Ann Archer shows her acting skills and of course Sam Elliott steals the show.
