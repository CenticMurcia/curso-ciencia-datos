When speaking about pricing, we are saying that price is the value on what is exchanged. Normally, something that has value is exchanged for either satisfaction or else for utility. If a certain product is worth Lm25, customers automatically think if the utility gained from this product is worth the buying power that has to be sacrificed. In every company, marketers study the value customers place in their minds on every single product, and therefore this is how later on they are given a basis on giving products various prices.
