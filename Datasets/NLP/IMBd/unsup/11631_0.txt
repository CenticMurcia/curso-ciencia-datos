I think this movie was great, Jamie Lee and John couldn't have been better! Especially the soundtrack, the songs really suited the movie. I have been looking for the soundtrack for ages, but no luck... I reckon it has a entertaining storyline, It's not the best film of JLC and JT but I'ts still worth watching. I've seen it quite a few times and It doesn't get old. I'm one of Jamie Lee Curtis' biggest fans, she has never looked better in this movie, her figure Is just to die for... And yes, she wears leotards for most the movie. Jamie has said herself "Jee, I was HOT", when she was watching the movie with her daughter Annie and one of her friends.
