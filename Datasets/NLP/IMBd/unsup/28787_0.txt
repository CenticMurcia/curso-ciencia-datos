I remember seeing only one Lash LaRue film as a kid growing up, but the image of the black clad cowboy brandishing a bull whip has remained with me ever since. Seeing one of these "B" Westerns some sixty years after they were made is a neat exercise in nostalgia, and only goes to show how far films have come since the good old days.<br /><br />As far as shoot 'em ups go, this one has a lot of them, about every ten minutes between different factions. Like many (most?) of these oaters, the title doesn't really have much to do with the story, though this one comes close. But instead of "Border Feud", why couldn't it have been the "Blue Girl Gold Mine Feud"? That would have made more sense and better described the action.<br /><br />Lash LaRue's character is Marshal Cheyenne Davis, helping out Sheriff Fuzzy Q. Jones (Fuzzy St. John) sort out the differences between two feuding families over gold mine rights in the town of Red Gulch. However there's a third party interested in keeping hostilities going; Jack Barton (Bob Duncan) and his backer Doc Peters (Ian Keith) plan to move in when the families wipe each other out. It might have worked too, but with a cute Condon sister (Gloria Marlen) romanced by the opposing family's Bob Hart (Kenneth Farrell), the truth will have to make things right.<br /><br />You can tell this PRC picture (Producers Releasing Corporation) film is an entirely low budget affair. Watch for a scene in the second half when Fuzzy shoots one of Barton's bad guys, he repositions himself ever so slightly so he can continue to fall down a stairway - no time for do-overs.<br /><br />"Border Feud", along with most of these era Westerns are great for a one hour diversion, as long as they're not taken too seriously. What I'd like to know though, is how is it that no matter where Cheyenne is at the start of a gunfight, he can always find a way to sneak up behind the shooters?
