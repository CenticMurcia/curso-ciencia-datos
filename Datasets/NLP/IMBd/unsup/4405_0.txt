"Why We Had To Kill Bitch" is a funny movie with a good story. And what else do you really need these days? Many comedies out there tend to dumb-down just to get the easy laugh, but the director here takes the high road and is rewarded for it. I enjoyed "Bitch" quite a bit. I found the not only the story satisfying, but the characters as well. Some take a little time to grow on you, but by the end of the film you actually find yourself rooting for them.<br /><br />Plus, being set in Pittsburgh and actually being a good movie gives it double points in my book as Pittsburgh is my hometown. It's nice to finally have a movie other than "The Fish That Saved Pittsburgh (1979)."
