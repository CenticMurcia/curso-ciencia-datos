This movie is by far the worst I have ever seen. Don't get me wrong, I love slapstick, I can even confess liking Police Academy. But this?<br /><br />The basic story, some kids join a "Dojo" to become marshall arts masters. Of course they mess up. The director's been following the blueprint on how to make a slapstick comedy.<br /><br />don't see it, never, noway, nohow...please..<br /><br />
