If you love what now would be called 'red-band' trailers (the greats ones that don't skimp on the good stuff, be it any of the three B's: blood, boobs, and/or bush), this compilation of trailers for low-budget 'grindhouse' movies is definitely for you. True, a small handful of the trailers are useless (thankfully relegated closely to the end, such as 'Superfuzz', and one or two others), but for the most part this collection is superb. Not one, not two, but three Christina Lindberg trailers with her in her FULL glory, if you catch my drift. (God she's stunning), The Hammer when he was still at the top of his game as 'Boss N*gger', campy gay bike riders, and a ton of nudity, gore and violence are just a few of the delightfully high points. Of course this is not really for everyone, but anyone who wants a trip down memory lane or just wants to see how good trailers used to be, rent this ASAP. You will NOT be disappointed.
