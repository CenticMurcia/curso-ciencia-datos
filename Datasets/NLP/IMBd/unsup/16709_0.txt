Too bad he's only in it for a short while. This whole movie was sort of like Ghostbusters meets Men In Black. It has ghosts, gadgets, as well as my favorite Hong Kong actors, Sam Lee, Stephen Fung, and Nicholas Tse. It offered me a nice escape, and I'm currently watching the making of the movie on the DVD. Unfortunately, that part is not subtitled in English. It is still interesting to watch though.
