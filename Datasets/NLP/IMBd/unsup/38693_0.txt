I like the movie but I does NOT do the book justice. I actually saw the movie before I read the book. THere is SO MUCH the movie runs together and leaves out at the same time. It is TOO obvious that this movie was "made for TV". It would be better if the director took the time to read the book and actually "see" the layout of 'remember house'. The movie is good, if you have already read the book and have an inkling to what is going on in the first place. It is an awesome book! I have read a few of Mary's books, and they are great. Bu this version to be transformed into a movie... Not such a good choice with so LITTLE detail. This movie was made for people who have read the book, and then they still need a little help. The movie is in my opinion a POOR rendition of the book, although I would LOVE to know where the house is that it was filmed at. That is the ONLY thing that serves my imagination from reading the book (outside only of course).
