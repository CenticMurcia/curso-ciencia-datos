Credibility was given the first version for the usual reasons. Is there really anyone who hasn't seen the first one? One of those was that their were gray-hairs in charge of the project and working in the lab. I find it hard to see where the survival of the entire planet would be given to a handful of young scientists. It's more like "The Andromeda Strain for kids". I understand that everyone who does a remake feels compelled to "update" by adding more time and effort to the sub-plots, but really! The original version was tight and tense for it's time. The story was compressed into a normal time slot of approximately two hours. Dragging this story out with unnecessary sub-plots and editing out pertinent data derived from the book is a good example of how to take a good story and ruin it by forcing and expanding sub-plots where they were never needed. Would be a good example for film school on what not to do in a remake.
