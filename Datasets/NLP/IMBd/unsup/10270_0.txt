I am Turkish and I watch the show every week and have every single episode recorded,great show,i recommend every 1 to watch it,it is really amazing that we are so close to Greek friends,we must be brothers and sisters same culture living in different countries,I love grandfather of nazli and grandmother of Niko,every Buddy fits in to their role and the show is acted perfectly,i would say it is the only show i watch actually,I can give copy of all the episodes to any one if requested(in Canada,Toronto area only) I salute all of Greek friends.I love you people all except Turkish and Greek politicians,they are leading us to wrong way.Take care all.
