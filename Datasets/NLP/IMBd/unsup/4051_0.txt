It's not the best gun movie. It's definitely not the best fighting movie. It doesn't have the best dialogue. It doesn't have the best cast. It doesn't have the best plot. What it has is possibly the best combination of the above in any action movie every made. It takes the pieces that it has to work with and forms a better whole. The dialogue is good. The cast is good (Rickman is the best of the bunch). The plot is good. Together, they are great. This film is the benchmark by which all American action movies should be judged. If an action film is better than Die Hard, then it deserves to be praised for that achievement alone.<br /><br />I rate it a 8.5/10 in it's genre. I gave it a 9 here.
