I first seen Tarzan Finds a Son when I was quite young and have seen it several times since. It is one of the best Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan movies.<br /><br />An aeroplane crashes in the jungle and the only surviver seems to be a baby boy. The rest of the party look like they were taken away by headhunters, including his parents. Tarzan brings the baby to his tree house and shows it to Jane and they call it simply "Boy" and raise him as their own. The movie then goes on a few years and we see Boy swinging through the trees and swimming. A search party then comes looking for the plane and then discover Boy is the young couple's son. Jane reluctantly agrees to give him to his relations but they get kidnapped by headhunters but Boy runs to get Tarzan who brings with him a heard of elephants and the headhunters' village is trampled by these. Jane recovers from a wound after a spear went into her and everyone is OK at the end and Boy stays with Tarzan and Jane.<br /><br />As well as Johnny Weissmuller as Tarzan and Maureen O'Sullivan as Jane, the cast also features Johnny Sheffeld in his first role as Boy, British actor Ian Hunter and Henry Stephenson.<br /><br />Watching Tarzan Finds a Son is a great way to spend an hour and 20 minutes one afternoon. Excellent.<br /><br />Rating: 4 stars out of 5.
