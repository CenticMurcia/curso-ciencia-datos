What a great movie. This movie cost probably $100 million less than Chicago which is our favorite movie by far. This little gem is simply spectacular a cast of unknowns is simply wonderful in this Danny Devito directed film. Music, dance, great story. WOW WOW WOW. We need more independent films like this. Keep up the great work Danny.
