I've seen Hidalgo twice and will go again (and again) and I will buy the DVD. I hope that people will not listen to the critics and will give this movie a chance for success. It doesn't matter if Frank Hopkins did these things or not. If he didn't, he gave us a rousing story. Viggo is perfect in this role as the "cowboy" and rides Hidalgo like the wind. The Arabian desert is frightening and beautiful. The horses are beautiful. Some don't like what seems like stereotypes, however, it takes place in 1890 and Native Americans were killed, then played for sport in "shows". Africans were enslaved and women wore (wear) veils. The movie is right with the times. The music is enjoyable. I'll look for the soundtrack on CD. See it and decide for yourself.
