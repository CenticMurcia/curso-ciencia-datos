This is a better than usual Fatty Arbuckle film because the plot is different--so many of his Keystone films look awfully similar and this one is unique. Dr. Arbuckle's wife has a childhood boyfriend that comes to visit. Despite being happily married, Fatty is jealous. And, in some very odd scenes, his worst nightmares come true,...however, they actually DO appear to be nightmares. The old flame is really a nice guy and Fatty finally realizes this and welcomes the guy when he awakens from these bad dreams.<br /><br />While the way these dreams aren't integrated perfectly, it is still a great idea and a lot of fun to watch. This is one of the few cases where there is a pistol that shoots dozens of times without reloading (a common thing in Arbuckle films) that makes sense, since this is part of a dream and dreams DON'T need to make sense!
