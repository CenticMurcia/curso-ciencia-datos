Wow, I should have taken jalape√±o man's advice and not watched this movie. I only watched it because I went to High School with Corban Allred. The acting done by Corban and Kirby was fine, but the script stunk! It had its funny moments, but they were few and far between. This was made by LDS people, but it's not an LDS film like Singles Ward or the RM. The one thing this show has going for it, is that you don't have to worry about your children walking in during an "uncomfortable moment." It's nice to watch a clean movie, however some brain cell lossage might occur while watching this film. Don't bother, in fact, run the other way! Kirby and Corban are very good in Saints and Soldiers. Go see that instead.
