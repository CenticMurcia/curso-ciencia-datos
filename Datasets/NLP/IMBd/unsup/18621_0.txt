I am not of Italian descent however, I have lived and loved and experienced Italy with an Italian heart and soul. I besides having studies film, worked in film production for many years and have a masters in psychotherapy (MSW), I would say this film was brilliant. Sure, it has it's holes. However, Italy has not produced a better piece of film work since....the 1980's. it is very difficult to create a mini series which engages and tells the nuance of the big picture in such a poetic way. Yes, the family seemed to have been hit hard with all the drama of the times, but, there were things this family did NOT experience where others did and that was good. it showed the integrity of the filmmakers to maintain true character continuity and development was consistent.<br /><br />The sequences of events made lots of sense and the Giorgia Character was perfect!! She was even some sort of catalyst for the brothers.<br /><br />I think all the characters were important components in telling this very rich story.<br /><br />I also appreciated how subtle things were told. with passion but not melodramatic. Important issues were brought up, but like life, not always spelled out so clearly. A lot is left to figure out..especially whether Matteo is a latent homosexual or simply repressed emotionally causing sexuality confusion. he could only express anger and this was the sign few could see could lead to his demise.<br /><br />it was a great film.<br /><br />Capo lavoro amici! grazie per sei ore bellissimi!
