I have no idea why but I like this movie. There are so many obvious mistakes in it, but the simplicity and sweetness of the story make up for the horrible outfits that Drew Barrymores character, Julia wears. Nothing about her said 1985 to me, the year in which this movie takes place. Robbie's friend, Sammy, wears a jacket identical to what Michael Jackson wore in his Thriller era, and I really think that any guy, (at least over 14) that wore this kind of jacket in 1985 would in no way be cool. And what is with the almost whispered lines? In any scene where Robbie isn't singing his voice is so quiet and low. The acting was terrible, except for Christine Taylor and a few others and Drew Barrymore needs to learn a new accent. Other than these faults I can't help but like this movie.
