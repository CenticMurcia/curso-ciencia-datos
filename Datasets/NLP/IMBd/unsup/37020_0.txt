Poorly written, this film has the thinnest and most ridiculous "plot" I've ever seen. The acting (even from the Duke) is also sub-par from such a cast. I think that Janet Leigh actually out-acts Wayne. I can't see much to commend this film. A defecting Soviet pilot (Leigh) is given a totally free rein (no detention, no interrogation, nothing!) and even allowed to fly modern US jet fighters, watched only by Wayne's character, who has fallen for her. This film is too laughable to be called anything other than a comedy. However, it wasn't shot, edited or released as a comedy. It was designed as a pure propaganda film. As such, it's a total failure. This thing's a complete waste.
