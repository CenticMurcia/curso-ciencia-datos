This is the worst crap I've ever seen. I would like to hear the opinion of a real doctor about this film. What kind of doctor doesn't wear any surgical clothes for making a 'surgery'? Why you never see a tube or lab in that house? What is that green stuff he forces Adam to drink supposed to be? Why are they such bad actors? What those cheap blue contact lenses Adam wears after coming back to life mean? In the scene when Adam's wrists are cut, why do you hear the blood dropping only when the camera moves down? Who gave the money for making this awful abomination of a film? Is just funny the way this film is so terribly bad.
