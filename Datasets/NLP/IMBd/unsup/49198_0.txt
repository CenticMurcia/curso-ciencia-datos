By the looks of things on the Anime Network, I actually thought that there would be an interesting story with this movie... scratch that theory.<br /><br />I finally got the chance to see this at my monthly Anime Club meeting, and I have never been so disappointed in my life! For starters, there's a war going on that sounds an awful lot like the Civil War all over again- except it's Japan and the US; not the Confederate States and the Union States.<br /><br />Secondly, the movie just moves so slowly.<br /><br />I know that that's normal in an anime you see first-hand, but the least you could hope for is for them to get to the next scene.<br /><br />Another thing that annoyed me were all the false endings: you had no idea when they'd finish the movie and when they do, it's a total cop-out! The girl wakes up, and the tower (along with a big chunk of the city) gets nuked! All anime fans, I cannot stress this enough: do not watch this movie! 0/10
