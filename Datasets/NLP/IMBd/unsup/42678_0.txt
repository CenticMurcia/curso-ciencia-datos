This movie was so disappointing. I could not believe how bad this was. I don't know about the theatre you were at, but at the one I was at, the whole they're was LAUGHING. It was so fake and hi-tech to be a horror movie. This is definitely a sequel that you MUST see the first one to understand the second one and this is a sequel u DON'T NEED TO SEE. I couldn't believe it. There was only two victims who saw the movie and had to pass it along, and right there was your climax. It was too dull and not enough information. Aden(the young boy)is too weird in this one and makes it too obvious of the outcome that I won't share with you if you haven't seen this movie. I recommend not going to this AT ALL! It is sooo bad...I expected SOO much better. **out of **********
