Some of the lousiest special effects imaginable are on display in this all-star dud about a meteor spiraling toward Earth. The US and Russia work in unison to try to stop it. The cast of acting giants in this dreck is mind boggling. Sean Connery is the lead and the supporting cast includes a particularly bad Natalie Wood as a Russian interpreter, Brian Keith as a Russian needing her services, Karl Malden, Martin Landau, and Henry Fonda (proving again his chronic need to appear in all the really BAD disaster movies of the 70s...ROLLERCOASTER, CITY ON FIRE, TENTACLES). The director, Ronald Neame, was responsible for the classic POSIEDON ADVENTURE, but lightning does NOT strike twice with this waste of time.
