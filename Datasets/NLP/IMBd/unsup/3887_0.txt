Hopefully Feds will be brought to DVD!<br /><br />Feds is a unique "buddy" comedy. Two women are admitted to the FBI academy on the assumption that they will fail. Academically weak and physically strong Ellie pairs up with academically strong and physically weak Janice for mutual aid. Both have plenty of moxie and come up with unique solutions for overcoming roadblocks. <br /><br />Casting Rebecca DeMornay as Ellie was genius; soft-spoken Mary Gross is exactly right as Janice. It's refreshing to see two women in these kinds of roles. Has one of the best funny bar-seduction scenes ever. Fred Thompson is the perfect FBI director Bilecki, with a hard-guy manner and that warm southern accent.<br /><br />Family-friendly despite the bar scene.
