Pretty bad film is all I can say. Why did I rent a movie made on cheap home video cameras? Subsequently, I am sure they are making money with these cheap movies or why make them? Bunch of school girls get lost and trapped to be killed off on by one by the school principal wearing a womans body and face mask! What the heck is that about? Oh well... no real nudity either so that killed it even more! Don't waste your time or dollars to see it. Go and see DREAMBOAT with a bunch of hot babes in a few scenes if that's what you want! Otherwise AVOID this one at all cost and get a porno. There are some pretty good horror films out there as well. Don't be fooled by the box covers on these cheapies
