This is a film everybody should see. It is a truly mind opener for anybody who does not know what ethnic conflicts and war does with peoples minds. I did not think that this film would be that good when I rented it, but this is a film that stays in your mind forever and makes you think in a different way for the rest of your life. A must see masterpiece for short.
