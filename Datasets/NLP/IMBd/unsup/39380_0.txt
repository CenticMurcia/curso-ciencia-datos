I have this film on videotape and I sometimes annoy friends who visit me by making them watch it. To be honest, the first half of the film is in fact quite amusing due to its low production value and completely dysfunctional storyline, but it becomes somewhat aggravating to watch the latter half when these redeeming qualities get old.<br /><br />The locations mostly looks like they are inside the producers mansion, and I highly doubt any of the actors have any formal training. I never really got the plot, but I think some dudes from prison are brought out to fight 3 or 4 evil communist coming from a neighboring country. Their plan I think is to kidnap the daughter of someone important. And this will supposedly create huge diplomatic problems.<br /><br />There is one or two scenes of nudity (one with breasts shot in slow motion) and some of the commando-training scenes looks like infomercials with some cheesy synthesizer music in the background.<br /><br />I do not encourage to spend money on this, but please catch it if it runs on TV.
