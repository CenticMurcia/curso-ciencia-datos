Bela Lugosi is one of my favorite Horror stars and I always watched all his films, this particular one I do not remember. However, the film was selling for one dollar on a DVD and I decided I had nothing to lose. Jerry Lewis & Dean Martin acts were copied by Duke Mitchell,"Baby Face Nelson", and Sonny Petrillo,"Shangri La",'61, they did a great job of imitating their act and the singing is better left with DEAN MARTIN. They make fun of a rather fat lady, which I thought was stupid, as well as, the entire picture. Bela Lugosi made a come back after a long period of unemployment and the use of drugs, and he was the only person with great acting abilities. Just simply have to stand up to Bela Lugosi and his life of being a TYPE CAST ACTOR !
