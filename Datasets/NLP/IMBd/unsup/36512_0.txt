This film starts off promising with a very dark creepy opening sequence. It seemed to have a different tone from the beginning and indeed it managed to keep the same feel through most of the film. The dubbing is atrocious and the score is almost unbearable.<br /><br /> There is a very very wierd sub-plot between two very close family members. (I won't spoil it for you guys who have not seen it.) <br /><br /> While this little films is far from being great, I really can't put it into the TERRIBLE zombie film wastebasket with such attempts at filmmaking as Zombie Lake or Barn of the Naked Dead and other films of the likes, but I cannot put it on the same shelf with Romero's Dead trilogy or some of Fulci's Zombie flicks. Any hadrcore Zombie fan will probably enjoy it, but for you Romero and Fulci fans, don't expect too much.<br /><br />** stars
