Rain stars Joan Crawford as fun-time gal Sadie Thomson and Walter Huston as the preacher trying to save her. Director Lewis Milestone has a great eye for the visuals with the close-ups of rain in rivers, sands, and trees in the beginning and near the end. Besides the two leads, there's also good performances by Guy Kibbee as the hotel owner that houses Crawford and Huston, Beulah Bondi as Huston's wife, and William Gargan as Crawford's Navy protector. Two of the best scenes are when Huston repeatedly says the Lord's Prayer as Crawford becomes mesmerised and starts saying it herself and Huston's final scene as he says a silent prayer to himself before he changes his expression to one in which he seems about to lose self-control before he rushes to where Crawford resides. I wish questions about Sadie's time in San Francisco had been answered. Other than that, I found this to be a compelling pre-Code drama about individuality vs. conformity. For Crawford and Huston fans, this is well worth seeking out!
