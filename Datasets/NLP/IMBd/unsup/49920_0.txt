I do firmly believe that the revue on this film is highly unfair. The "If You like this try..." says it all. The recommendation is "Requiem for a Dream". It is most certainly not one of the best movies I have seen, but as the angst ridden road movie it is, it is highly watchable. At the time it premiered it was widely discussed due to it's sexual and to some degree violent sexual content. It is a spiraling vortex down to an unavoidable end. Capturing some of the counter culture of the time, wanting to escape Your surroundings, Your situation of Scandinavia, it gives prof that You can leave but never escape Yourself. If You want shine happy people, stay clear away from this one. This end of the 80's piece is as dark as it got back then.
