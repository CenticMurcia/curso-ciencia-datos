C'mon people, i really donÂ¡t understand why some of you says that this is a good movie. Trust me, i have seen a lot of horror movies, and this is one of the worst, not the WORST (beacause "The Brink" wons that tittle years ago) but this is on my top 10 of bad-bad horror movies of all the time. <br /><br />Bad Effects. Bad History. No blood. No gore. No Horror.<br /><br />and ... this is a horror movie right?<br /><br />So, please people. Don't See this movie. Its Crap, like a millions other. Just don't waste your time in this, save your money, or whatever.
