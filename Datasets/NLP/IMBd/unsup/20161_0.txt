I commend the author, producer, actors, etc., on this movie. It one of the best, cleanest and educational movies shown in a long time. Everyone I've mentioned it to has not heard of it. This is what disappoints me about good clean movies, they don't receive enough publicity. Our children and families need more of these movies to remind them our success is to be earned, not given. Also, giving and showing concern for others takes our mind off our own problems and makes us aware of how fortunate we are compared to the majority of the world.<br /><br />Please continue producing more movies with true meanings.
