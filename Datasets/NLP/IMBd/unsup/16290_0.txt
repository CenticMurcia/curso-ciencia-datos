Do not expect a pleasant movie-going experience when walking into the theater to see Grey Zone. Do expect to walk out feeling like the air you breathe is little clearer, the things you see just a bit sharper. At the screening I was at, many people walked out, briskly, within 15 minutes of the lights dimming. Grey Zone is that kind of movie. Women being tortured, lost screams, point-blank executions. This is a horror movie. Story is secondary to witnessing the behind-the-scenes crematorium politics, uprisings, and certainly the ghastly inhuman Nazi actions. Go with a loved one and walk out holding them just a little tighter.
