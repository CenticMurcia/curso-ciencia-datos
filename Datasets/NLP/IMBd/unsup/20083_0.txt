When you consider the horrible script and bad grammar, nonsensical "science," run on sentences Dr. Goddard had to try do something with, anyone who has any intelligence at all will conclude that the actor who had to speak these lines did an incredible job. In fact, he may be the only true actor in the film! We can only hope someone gives him a good script so those who can't see beyond bad scripts and directing can see how talented he truly is. I saw another review of this film on another web sight in which the review was dead on. I don't recall his name, but he commented that at first you may think the actor playing Dr. Goddard is a bit awkward, but when you realize the horrible lines and situations, and direction he had to deal with, you will also realize he must have the spirit of Brando in him to pull it off half as well as he did! Kudos to Mr. Kuhn for what he was able to do with lines no one could could do anything with. Someone give him a good script!
