I have seen a lot of poor movies in my time but this movie has to be the worst ever made. Aside from a terrible plot, awful effects, poor acting, and laughable dialogue, the English version of this movie has horrible dubbing. Some characters speak in broken English, some characters are dubbed into English from their various languages (this movie features both Japanese and Chinese actors and dialogue), and the rest of the characters spoke in their own language while English subtitles accompanied their words. If you like to watch movies that don't have any real direction then this movie is for you. Otherwise, there are a lot of better and more complete action movies out there.<br /><br />Graham Kennedy, Esquire
