for the purpose of full disclosure, I am not American, but I do not mean do offend anyone by saying that if you watch flight 93 simply as a movie, it sucks. it really really sucks. The corny emotional dialogue and contrived filler scenes that were made up for dramatic purposes really killed this movie for me. <br /><br />United 93 also made some stuff up, as was necessary considering the mystery surrounding the whole thing, but at least it was believable. The way the air traffic controllers and the military people discoursed sounded, more or less, exactly as they would sound confronted with a situation for which virtually nobody was prepared. <br /><br />and was was with that line near the end? "The plane is down" "down as in landed?" "no, down as in..some field" Was this supposed to be funny? terrible. Just watch United 93 instead. it's emotional and touching for all the right reasons, and it doesn't exploit anyone. oh, and its well acted
