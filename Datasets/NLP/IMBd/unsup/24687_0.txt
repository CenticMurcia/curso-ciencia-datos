First up, let me explain that I adore mosaic movies. Movies like Magnolia and Short Cuts are among my favorite movies ever.<br /><br />That's why I like Wonderland so much. At first you have to keep your head together to see where the characters interact and at what level they are coping or not coping with their troubles. This was expertly done in this movie. But once you get the hang of it, this will not let you go until you see the credits.<br /><br />You really felt close to the characters during the movie and they started to grow on you throughout the flick. This is probably in a large part accelerated by the audaciousness of the photography, which reminded me a lot of Festen or The Idiots (both Dogme 95 films). The grainy picture can be off-putting to some who are expecting to see a crisp clear picture. It is also the documentary style that makes this movie so real. That and of course the tremendously well acted performances.<br /><br />But, of course there are things which aren't executed properly to my opinion. First, the character of the brother of the lot was not fleshed out enough to make him really a part of the family troubles. He clearly has run away without notice and ever since his parents have lived in disarray. I would have liked to have seen this explained a little more. Second there is the character of the black guy who still lives with his mom. I had a hard time believing this guy who was clearly infatuated with Nadia would still be living with his mother in such a timid way.<br /><br />But all in all this was an excellent movie about regular people with regular problems in an enormous city like London. It was nice for a change to see a movie like this outside New York or Los Angeles. I award it the grade below because this took me by surprise and kept me locked on the screen for 108 minutes and that's a rare accomplishment these days.<br /><br />9/10
