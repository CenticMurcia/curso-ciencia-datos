Some may find the cursory examination of Christian belief an over-riding message in this 1991 film by Michael Tolkin, but if one can put aside the discussions over whether god exists or not, it is an hysterical comedy, in that indie self-important message movie way. Starring Mimi Rogers as Sharon, in a film her ex-TC would have no doubt prevented her from doing back in their day, Rogers' character is the stereotypical information operator by day/swinger sin-sister by night. The extreme binary of her character makes for hysterical lines when she decides to convert to a cultish Christianity based on the notion of prophesy. With David Duchovny in an early semi-naked role as the firm, young, stud whom Rogers cavorts and later marries, and Will Patton as a sheriff who encounters the demented Sharon who has followed her faith into the wilderness, the male balance to this film is one of flesh and reason made secondary to literal interpretation of scripture in vacuous gestures of uncritical blind faith without rationale.<br /><br />Frankly, other films have addressed questions of faith and belief in more sophisticated ways than the heavy-handed approach of The Rapture, and it is far more satisfying to compare those with this attempt. While Rogers is lauded for this performance, it is a complex character but the actress interpretation is shallow and so pulled back that it makes for an uneven and superficial read, however, I think this is more the fault of the director than the actress. On first viewing, I thought this film was intriguing, but after several viewings in the interim years, it becomes more laughable and comedic than worthy of intense reflection or serious attention.
