take an enjoyable movie, make a pants sequel, forgive pants sequel for trying, THEN make a 3rd installment, add a dolop of rubbish, a heavy lashing of religion, sprinkle with shoddy CGI and flavour with 1 hot woman from star trek, put it into an oven and let it simmer for over an hour until crap and awful. do not serve to anyone. I sat there hoping for a glimmer of hope, to be entertained like the 1st movie did so well, but instead they let loose on a shoddy script and pointless nudity (not even that got my attention) and some TERRIBLE (thats the only word i can use without getting kicked off for fowl language) acting from CÃ©cile Breccia. She makes Keanu Reeves look Oscar worthy in ANY film.<br /><br />i give it a very generous 2*, but im not sure why.
