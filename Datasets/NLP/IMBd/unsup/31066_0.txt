Waliking into the cinema i could tell that this would film would be a drag and yet i still watched the whole movie. To put it simply this film stretched the plot of a Christmas carol too far, and left a lot to be desired in even making it remotely funny. having watched Jenifer Garner in P.S I Love you i expected a lot from her in this film, but instead of being a leading role as she was a vital part of the plot she felt a lot like an addition to the thin story line, most of the time she looked like she was tripping over her tongue when Connor Mead was mentioned. The only saving grace that could have been was humour which it lacked in abundance and the Hysterical wife to be was extremely annoying to the point where you wanted one of the cast to slap her out of it. The whole thing was distasteful to say the least that any man can treat numerous women in that way and still get away with it, for instance grabbing the future mother in law's breast with not even a raise of the eyebrow from her in the least, any man doing this in the real world would have received quite a hefty slap. To put it bluntly it was a let down from start to finish and a truly awful film.
