It's difficult to find words to describe how truly sickening this show is. It's also extremely difficult to know whether MTV deliberately made a show which is a complete shower of trash or whether this really is the insult to humanity it appears to be. Even if this show is a deliberate strike at the heart of human decency the fact this point is not made obvious (perhaps because of the increasingly shallow context of MTV) could even be considered quite dangerous owing to the fact that the intended audience really are too young to realise just how this sort of attitude blights society. The primary problem is the unabashed worship of materialism - this show represents selfish, hateful, greedy and ignorant behaviour in much the same way loyalty, respect, dignity and love are represented in mainstream media. Revolting garbage, has to be seen to be believed.
