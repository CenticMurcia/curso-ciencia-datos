A masterwork of exploitation and grave robbery worthy of the late Edward D. Wood Jr. Approximately 11 minutes of footage of the late Bruce Lee, including film of his funeral and his body in his coffin, are used to sell a movie about a supposedly dead actor avenging himself after being killed' for not paying protection to organised crime. There's an uncomfortable echo of the death of Brandon Lee when Lee's character dies' after someone replaces a blank in the gun that shoots him for a stunt sequence with a real bullet. If they'd used all the real footage of Lee either before or after this, the film would have made much more sense: instead, they used alleged look-alikes, their faces sometimes hidden by false beards or motorcycle helmets, intercut with close-ups of the real Lee. If you're a martial arts fan, fast-forward to the climactic fight scenes; if you're not, the only possible reasons to see this movie are (i) Colleen Camp's cleavage and (ii) the sheer ghoulish awfulness of this barely animated corpse.
