What can I say, that was the longest one and a half hours of my life and its safe to say there will definitely not be a sequel and if there is, I shall set pickets outside major cinemas campaigning for a national boycott....<br /><br />the dialogue was so bad, the story even worse, i cringed for the likes of Robert Carlyle and john Malkovich, this movie was far beneath them, in fact it was far beneath my 98 year old Romanian Gran who has no teeth and cant even act old....<br /><br />The plot was dry and would have made excellent burning wood....<br /><br />Please I beg all out there, do not watch this pile of dragon Pooh
