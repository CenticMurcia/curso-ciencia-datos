There's a reason why this film took a limited release and little fanfare despite having some solid actors in the line-up. However, it just goes to show what sloppy direction can lead when the concept of creation comes into effect. Samuel L. Jackson is too typical, Milla Jovovich is WAY too typical, and Doug Huchison is rather disappointing. I won't even talk about Stellan Skarsgaard. The acting is where the whole story went south, considering the story was pretty decent. I guess I am one of the few who got to see this film, considering I was the only one in the theater when I watched it.
