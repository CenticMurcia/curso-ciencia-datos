I might be mixing KB 1 and 2 below, sorry for that, it all blends together. <br /><br />Being no fan of Tarantino (except for Jackie Brown, end of the list), I could not say that there has been anything that specifically great about Kill Bill. The fight scenes are spectacular. Period. <br /><br />This is a movie in my eyes that tries to say "hey, in case you do not like or understand me, you are just not at an appropriate level of evolution yet, okay?". It is bloody, and illogical. This is often true for Tarantino's movies, I think (I did not like Pulp Fiction either and could not get through it once).<br /><br />Many have stated this before, but pray tell me, in case you wake up on your hospital bed after years of coma, how on Earth are you meant to grasp the whole situation immediately. And in the first place, why did they wait patiently for Uma Thurman's character to wake up? Did they assume they could chat it over in the end and be good friends again? <br /><br />The genre works with Asians - all-round, real, not imported Asians I mean- as in Wo hu cang long, but is in my opinion a total miss here. The same is true for the Anime part, which I found ridiculous and overdone. Why bother that much with Lucy Liu's character anyway? <br /><br />I do not believe there was much originality in this movie. The Charlie's Angels up against each other thing might have worked but did not. <br /><br />I suggest Tarantino and manga fans watch. Martial arts fans pick something decent instead.
