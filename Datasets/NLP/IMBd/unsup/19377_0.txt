This film and "Limelight" could well be subtitled as "Chaplin on Performance Art Vols. 1&2." But while "Limelight" focuses mostly on the interaction between the performer and the audience, this film seems to explore two different themes relating to performance: its hypocrisy (the tryout, being told to eat the apple by the director and then being chastised for eating it by the actor), and humour in its deficiencies (note the uproar when Chaplin knocks the table off, exposing the hidden man feeding the animals through the hats). These are both characteristic of Chaplin, walking around in a tramp's outfit on his own Hollywood studio, also the two opposite roles in "Dictator." The production difficulties are notorious, and Chaplin cleverly adds a tyrannical stage-master into the mix. But still what resonates most with me is an example of Chaplin's ideas that great art and, consequently great humour, comes more out of desperation and ignorance, if accompanied with a good heart, than talent and coldly calculated intellect.<br /><br />That and I consistently laugh during this film more than any other Chaplin.<br /><br />4 out of 5 - An excellent film
