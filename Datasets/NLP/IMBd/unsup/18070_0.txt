Dumb & Dumber is the best comedy film that I watch ever,Farrelly Brothers are the masters of the comedy in the 90´s with matt groening and Trey Parker.The film has got a funny and ironic screen with a lot of gags .Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are Jack Lemmon and Walter Mattau of the 90´s.Lauren Holly is great because she never do a comedy role and she play it very well.THE BEST COMEDY FILM OF THE 90´S AND MAYBE IN THE HISTORY. SENTENCE FOR DUMB AND DUMBER:EXCELLENT.************
