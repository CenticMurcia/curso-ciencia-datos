Michael Moore is a genius. This movie's amazing. Unfortunately USA have had problems with Bush administration these 8 years, and I really like Americans like Michael, smart. He really woke up and he is trying to wake up all the Americans. Also, I don't know how this grade could be so bad, maybe because there's a lot of republicans here. Michael knows how to put together in a movie information and comedy. The part that he's praying with republicans, and your answers ("and I think that someone has stolen their sense of humor" - about the Republicans who tried to take him to the tribunals) to them are really amazing. Hope that Michael make more movies like it.
