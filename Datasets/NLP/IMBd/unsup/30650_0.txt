I really enjoyed Hidden for what it was - a no budget digital feature made on the back of writer/director and stuntman Tim McLachlan (who is one of New Zealands best stunt men and a Director with a bright future).<br /><br />You have to admit it's got some mean stunts! And I don't think a 13 year old could get those performances out of the actors! <br /><br />There was some choice acting by Hayley Halliday (played Brooke), Kiel McNaughton (played Mark) and Luke Peary (played Carl) and all the other actors were really easy to watch and likable.<br /><br />I'm curious as to weather people know just how hard it is to write a film, shoot it, edit it, and do post production all on your own because you have no budget?!<br /><br />Hidden won 4 awards at over seas festivals and was nominated for an award at the 2006 New Zealand Film Awards. And I can see why but I guess its a matter of taste - can't please everyone! <br /><br />I highly recommend renting it!
