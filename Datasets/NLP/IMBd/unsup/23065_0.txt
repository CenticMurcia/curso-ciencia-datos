Okay, the film gets a 3 even though it's duller than dust because back in 1898, ALL the films were duller than dust--having NOT AN OUNCE OF PLOT--consisting of people doing mundane stuff that thrilled audiences at the time but would hopelessly bore people today because films are so omnipresent.<br /><br />This film, believe it or not, consists of some Scottish-looking guys in kilts jumping about--and it's bad dancing at that! THAT'S IT!!! Just guys in skirts dancing! From a historical standpoint, this is a very important film, but in every other respect, it's pretty pointless. How this could encourage ANYONE to buy their Scotch is beyond me!
