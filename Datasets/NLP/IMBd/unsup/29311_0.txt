Don't ruin this film for yourself by going in with expectations, limitations, rules, preconceptions, etc. of what you think it's supposed to be. Step inside the movie and let it tell you the story. It has the formula down for the typical old style western but it's done in a unique fashion. It's not supposed to be a carbon copy of an old American Spaghetti Western. Appreciate that, and you'll appreciate what this film has to offer. The Japanese-accented English only added to its charm, although I will admit that it was difficult to understand the dialogue at times. The film does include subtitles so no worries. The visuals/cinematography were wonderful, the story was interesting and overall it was a fun movie to watch. Purely entertaining.
