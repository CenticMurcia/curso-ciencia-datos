I watched LB from the movie to almost the bitter end and if you'd asked me six months ago I would have been hugely complimentary.<br /><br />However time plays tricks with the memory, and I've recently had the chance to view the early episodes again.<br /><br />I was shocked at how empty and limp the stories were, though punctuated by increasingly spectacular yet predictable 'shouts' with associated danger, drama and of course death. Death was a major player in LB, and 'Blue Watch' would surely have been renamed 'Death Watch' and would have come to national media attention due to their high attrition rate.<br /><br />Some of the drama between 'shouts' is incredibly wet, and usually punctuated by sax background music. The stereotyped characters that I had enjoyed any years ago only annoy now, and Josie's lines when she returned to the show during the big 'shout' made a roomful of viewers laugh with embarrassment.<br /><br />Best remembered and not re-watched - you may spoil your memories.
