Why is everybody giving so high ratings to this? Come on, the movie is absolutely boring! I'm not a hardcore horror movies fan, but I still enjoy watching one or two when there's something interesting to watch. Believe me, this is NOT one of those.<br /><br />"The orphanage" is a long, boring, no-scares, no-suspense, and totally overrated flick that almost made me fall asleep. I could have forgive the story's lack of originality if its narrative or pace would have been good... But they weren't. However, there's no reason to panic because even if the script is bad, at least the characters and dialogue are very well done, right? WRONG. They are dull and very poorly developed. The mix didn't work at all and there were many scenes that seemed false or even ridiculous to me.<br /><br />What more can I say, lately is a common practice for me to consult some IMDb users's reviews before paying any serious attention to some foreign flick I don't know much about, but the truth is... I don't know if that will keep being useful for me. I mean... Boy, I expected way, way more of this one. It really doesn't deserve all the good treatment that has received here.<br /><br />The only two reasons for the stars I'm giving are the fine cinematography and the leading lady, who actually did a decent job with a bad material (well, at some moments). For all the rest... Better to forget.
