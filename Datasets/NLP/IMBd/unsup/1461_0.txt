Like "Emmanuelle, "Joys of a woman" wallows in pseudo-philosophy while displaying a lot of aroused women seeking satisfaction The setting is Hong Kong, where Emmanuelle is taken through the high-life of the aristocrat <br /><br />In Jack Jaeckin's first film, Emmanuelle was sexually reserved, and came out as she discovered her hidden sexuality In the sequel, she explores further into the erotic domainespecially other womenin trying to find the perfect lover <br /><br />The characters are not real, but ethereal, dream-like creatures floating through life This quality actually works quite well as Sylvia Kristel encounters other women The eroticism is soft and sensual When she confronts a man, however, there is a feeling only of performance It's much more sharply refreshing and keen The male lovers never seem to be as compassionate or as feeling as the women, nor are their characters as developed <br /><br />The photography is quite rich and luxuriant, and has captured a postcard view of modern Hong Kong
