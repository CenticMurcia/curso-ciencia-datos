What a terrific movie. An Aussie success. Kerry Armstrong deserves the highest accolades as do all the kids doing the dancing. Mister Jonathan may not get the top prize but he gets points for showing the audience that dance is not always a love story but can be used to convey the darker side of world issues. Passion is messy and cringing sometimes but the director and writers handle the edge between drive and madness with soft eyes.<br /><br />Sydney film locations included a historic building in Parramatta and Justine's home in Northwest of Sydney. Unexpected bonus: Imagine my delight when I recognized Justine's home as one designed by friends - Indigo and Ochre, Architects based in Sydney. The slightly over the top house matched Justine's character perfectly.
