A father and son travel around the world making a film about other fathers and sons that they find along the way. The interviews illustrate the dynamics of the relationships between fathers and sons and are often touching and enlightening.<br /><br />There is some sentiment and tenderness in this film so not every person (especially male) may be comfortable with all of it--but it doesn't venture into the arena of being a coerced trip down saccharine (artificial sweetener) lane.<br /><br />According to the filmmakers (on the commentary track of the DVD) they didn't coach the people in the documentary to say anything specific about their father or sons. Most fathers and sons just seemed to want to use their interview as a vehicle for expressing things they were not normally permitted to say or express. A lot of the power of this movie comes from the sense of personal meaning that these fathers and sons bring to each other and that we're allowed to watch.
