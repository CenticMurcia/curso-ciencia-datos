Here it is. Out the thousands of movies I've seen over the decades, this one BITES. I could always find something to like about every movie, but this one is totally disturbed. A bad writer in a bad situation makes some bad decisions with bad results and creates more bad situations that snowball into more bad situations with bad dialogue and bad filming and bad screenplay. The dog is bad, even before it dies. The characters are bad. The music is bad. The smell of the DVD is bad. The art work is bad. There is no suspense. The gore is bad. The special effects are bad. I had to take some Pepto in the middle of the movie, but like a trooper I choked the entire movie down. That night I even had a bad dream about the movie. Guinness Book is looking at this one right now as the worlds badest of the bad.
