This movie didn't make sense at all. My rule is if it's not a comedy and it's move funny than dramatic then it's not serving it's purpose. It was like Gilligan's Island gone horribly wrong. First of all; why couldn't they get one person to take them away years before the daughter became grown. The first mother came their with her husband but couldn't get out, that was kind of understandable. The daughter grew up and had a child of her own, a girl, and she couldn't get anyone to drive her into town. I don't get why the plot was about her 59 years like her mother didn't exist. The daughter/grand-daughter was a trip and she gave the movie it's comedic edge but there's were the problem comes to light.Everything she did was wrong and wouldn't have been fun if the movie was good and made sense. It hurt the film when the lady that first played the Grandma was used to play the mother and the young woman used to play the daughter played her own daughter.
