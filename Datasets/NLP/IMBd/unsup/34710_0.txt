In Grim Reaper, a terror movie from director Michael Feifer, Cherish Lee plays Rachel, a surviving victim from a car crash stalked by the Grim Reaper himself who feels she should have died. In the hospital, Rachel tries to convince the staff that Death is hunting for her. Thinking her nuts, Rachel is committed to a mental health facility, where she finds herself with other inmates that have also cheated death. That night, the Grim Reaper comes for them. The movie is full of the usual terror clich√©s and formulas, where common sense is absent. It is a sloppy hash of a movie, poorly directed and plotted in a way that looks as if it were improvised on the spot. Feifer, who has produced over 30 independent films, could have done a better job staying closer to reality, than trying to frighten his audience at every turn. Grim Reaper feels like one cheap shot after another. Even the film's target audiences (terror junkies) are probably going to bail on this one.
