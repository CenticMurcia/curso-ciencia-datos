This might be my favorite Edward G. Robinson picture. It concerns 3 rather dimwitted criminals who come up with a plan to rob a bank by tunneling in through the basement of the luggage shop next door. Robinson is the boss and he is supported by even more dimwitted Eddie Brophy and Broderick Crawford.<br /><br />Once they buy the luggage store, one of them must man the store while the others work on the tunnel. The funny thing is since they could care less IF they sell any luggage, the customers start frequenting the store in droves. After a while, they realize that despite their larcenous plan, they would become much richer if they just continued running the business. At about that time, the smarter and more nasty Anthony Quinn happens upon them and discovers their original plan--where upon he forces them to break into the bank against their wills! The film is cute and slickly paced throughout--an overlooked gem.
