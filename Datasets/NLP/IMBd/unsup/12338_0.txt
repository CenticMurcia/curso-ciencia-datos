3 Deewarein is a mystery unfolding. What attracts this woman to probe into the lives of these three men? What lies within them? Whatever is apparent at the onset may not be so. It is easy to become wrapped up in their lives as you watch this film, with a growing concern for each of the convicts. The writer and director did a superb job of creating all these questions, making you wonder throughout what everyone's goal is. The acting is top notch, every single performer, major and minor, suits their role. Each personal life is examined, past and present. Supporting cast in the form of prisoners and guards are also extremely well developed and integrated into the story. Nothing happens without a reason, everything is intertwined. A well done gem of a film that breaks away from the standard Bollywood fare.
