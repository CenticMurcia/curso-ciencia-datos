I watched this epic when it was first released on Aussie TV. I was 18. I watched it again this week and enjoyed it even more. THis drama is well written, the cinematography is simply stunning and the talent is fabulous.<br /><br />Hugo Weaving plays a magnificent portrayal of a man who's life long quest to build an empire in the Australia Outback.<br /><br />Living in the Central West and well not really that far from Nevertire where the story is based, I understand the trials and tribulations of life in the bush.<br /><br />Steve Jacobs by far is my favourite in this film.<br /><br />I could watch this over and over. There are no special features, no fan fare or special effects. The film relies sole on a wonderful story and fantastic actors.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to anyone!
