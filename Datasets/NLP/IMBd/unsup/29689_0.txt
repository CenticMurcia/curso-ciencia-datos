This is Probably the best Dr.who I've seen ever! Peter moffatt does an excellent job at directing this. The Special effects an action sequences are top notch. This is probably the only Dr.who that doesn't have effect errors. And I was so pleased to see sarah and the brigadier! those 2 really do add a lil spice to the Dr.whos (But why on Earth is the Brig wearing fur? He didn't seem like much of a fur wearing type 2 me.(Maybe it was to attract the yeti in the cave for mating)). And of course there's the Cybermen, which are of course my al time fav aliens frm who. The Cyber Massacre sequence has got to be the best bit of the whole film. Although how the robot can fit all those arrows in itself is beyond me (works well none the less). This Dr. who pretty much has it all Comedy, Action and there were even bits that gave me the willies (i.e. the old looking companion phantoms). And lets not forget the Cyber Vomit!
