I actually haven't seen this a thousand times, yet it feels like I have. It's just so predictable and boring that it seemed pointless to even watch the end. This is why I stopped watching with about 15 minutes left on the movie. What's the point? I just didn't care.<br /><br />The only redeeming value this movie posesses is the fashion style of the two leading ladies. They have some really awesome clothes! I bet their clothes would be worth a lot of money today. <br /><br />I gave this movie 3/10 because of the clothes. Sounds lame, but these clothes were really that good!<br /><br />Another reason I gave the movie more than 1 star was the audio. They do a decent job making scary sounds that actually freaked me out a little bit. There's a part where something is squeaking and it's dark and no one knows what it is. The sound itself was harmless, but if you let your imagination run away, it was actually scary! <br /><br />I also liked the sex scene between the sex-crazed lady and the hot young guy. He was pretty hot! I liked his tight pants. The scene was good because it wasn't all hair flipping, long kisses, and loss of innocence. It was actually kind of sly and rough. They did a good job making a sex scene that didn't make me wanna hit fast forward. <br /><br />That's it. Boring movie. Who cares what the ending was? You already know.
