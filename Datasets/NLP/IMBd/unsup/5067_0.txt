The geometry of "Live Flesh" involves two eternal triangles which share one man at a common apex with two men and two women at the opposing corners and lines drawn between each collectively representing the spectrum of emotion; love, hate, desire, jealousy, etc. Beautifully crafted, visually crisp, and an intriguing blend of drama noir and artful comedy, this film tells its tale of human relationship entropy with an abundance of verve and style. In Spanish with subtitles, "Live Flesh" makes a solid watch for film buffs and foreign film enthusiasts into tales of human drama. (B+)
