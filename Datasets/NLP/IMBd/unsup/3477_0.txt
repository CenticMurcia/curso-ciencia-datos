Matthew MaConnahagh and Christian Bale give good performances as two foes coming together to wipe out the dragon race. The start of the dragon race all starts off when young Quinn stumbles upon a dragon cave and awakes a dragon. While he and his mother try to escape, his mother is killed by that dragon. Now, 20 years later when the Earth is dominated by a race of dragons, Quinn (Bale) has become the leader of survivors from England. When Van Zan (MaConnahagh) and his group of surviving Americans come to Quinn's fort, Quinn must make the decision to trust Van Zan, or kill him. When he finally finds out why they have come to his fort, Van Zan asks for men. However, Quinn says no and sticks with his answer. But Van Zan gets men anyway and Quinn makes the decision to go along and try to eliminate the race of dragons once and for all. The special effects are a real treat and the story is interesting. It's full of excitement and action. Although this movie got negative reviews, I strongly disagree with them. This movie is a non-stop ride that leaves you begging for more. Great fun<br /><br />*** out of ****
