Otto didn't reinvent himself with 7 Zwerge and its possible to see this in every second of this movie. If you saw a lot of the old stuff by Otto Waalkes there is not much new to explore.<br /><br />But the film isn't bad at all. Its only old fashioned. Otto plays himself as usual even if he tries to act as a character called Bubi and his parents.<br /><br />The jokes are funny as they were when Otto told them the first time and the little new stuff is pretty cool.<br /><br />I like the scene about "Brettspiele" very much.<br /><br />If you didn't watch a Otto Movie before you can add up to 2 Points to my Vote.
