It's bad. It's awful. It's not so bad that it is funny or campy, but it is just plain terrible.<br /><br />I thought that Out of Step or Pride and Prejudice were the worst of the Mormon cinema sub-genre, but this is worse.<br /><br />The story can't seem to decide if people are LDS or not. You have two guys on bikes in white shirts and ties (obviously missionaries) who are bug sprayers? You have an Idaho community with everyone being brother and sister, but they are some kind of protestants? You can also see every plot twist coming from a mile away (such as where both guys get their girls in the end). Even when that happens, neither guy kisses either girl! The script sucks.<br /><br />If you want good, funny LDS cinema, stick to the original Singles Ward or The Best Two Years. Leave this one behind.
