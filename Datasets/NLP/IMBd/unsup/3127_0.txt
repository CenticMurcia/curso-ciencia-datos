Comedian / former sitcom star Jerry Seinfeld's filmed farewell performance of the material that he had been using for years in his act, touching on such subjects as old people, supermarkets, men and women, airplane travel, etcetera.<br /><br />This HBO special opens with a comedy bit, a funeral, featuring several of Seinfeld's comedy contemporaries, mourning the "death" of his much-loved jokes.<br /><br />Not always terribly funny, but that's only because of its familiarity. Whatever the case, Seinfeld is a consummate professional who has obviously perfected his timing and delivery over his many years as a stand-up comic and he still has what it takes to make his old jokes work. Of course, this special has to be actually SEEN to be appreciated due to Seinfeld's often hilarious expressions and mannerisms.<br /><br />I enjoyed watching "I'm Telling You for the Last Time".<br /><br />7/10
