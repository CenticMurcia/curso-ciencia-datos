This film is about a middle aged woman, Melba May (Park Overall,) who has big dreams, but is going nowhere. She lives in a trailer, in Nevada, with her husband Flint (Don Harvey.) One night Melba catches Flint with another woman, and leaves him. She decides to go to Vegas to meet up with an old friend from high school, Dottie Delgato (Veronica Cartwright,) who's dreams went where she wanted them. But when Melba finds her, she finds out Dottie's dreams only lasted temporarily.<br /><br />Back at home, Flint gets a knock on his door, finding out that Melba just won a million dollars. But only Melba can expect it. So Flint goes off to find her, basically to kidnap her, so he can keep the money himself. It was only possible for Melba to get to Vegas by three young agents from Hollywood, off to Vegas to make money. This movie is an okay movie. I'd give it a 7/10, only because I didn't expect much from it. It's better as a movie made for TV.
