Based on the true story of a legendary wolf-like creature inhabiting the woods near a small Wisconson town, this movie proves to be the weakest werewolf movie I have seen in a long time. Following a spree of mysterious mutilations taking place in their town, the local sheriff's department decides to exploit the case as a werewolf hunt in order to spark the public's attention. The new sheriff, on the other hand, teams up with a zoologist and attempts to kill the beast. With the exception of several decent disembowelment's and a cool looking creature, The Beast of Bray Road feels just like another straight-to-video snore fest that follows a familiar premise and leads up to a very predictable conclusion. If this movie is based on the same concept I think it is, than it did a horrible job of presenting it in an even remotely believable way unless, of course, there really is a town out there where the drunks roam the woods alone at night while the bartender leaves her post for a quick snack every night. Lame.
