If you ever take the time to read the novel, you will realize that the movie absolutely sucks. The plot has been butchered, some characters are miscast and it just doesn't give you the same feeling as the novel does. When I read the novel, I felt like I was in prison and like I was going through the same hardships as Papillon was. When I watched the movie, it didn't really leave any kind of impact on my emotions. It seems as though the screenwriters didn't read the novel, but had instead heard a few things about it, and then went on to write the screenplay. That usually doesn't promise a very good movie adaptation. So in conclusion, read the book, do NOT watch the movie.
