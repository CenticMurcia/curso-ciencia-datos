OK things I liked about Stargate: The Ark of Truth: + Nice intro. + Nice ending. <br /><br />Things I didn't like about Stargate: The Ark of Truth: - Poor corny acting with inappropriate comedy I found an issue throughout the entire show(s) Apart from Universe which remain to be seen. <br /><br />- Low resolution Visual Effects: Low model texturing on that spaceship. Poor weapon effects on the Ori spaceships. Poor giant Stargate models. * Didn't have the money to do better? lacked creativity? *<br /><br />- Mediocre Script: What's the point of telling a story if it adds nothing to the show credibility. * Quick cash that's the answer. * - Poor props: Super clean village, anyone? Shiny clean million year old artifacts? - Poor customs: * Same team as power rangers? * <br /><br />- Bad camera work: On sets that clearly were made in one day. Ie that super clean village, dudes if you don't have the money to make something good, hide it with camera angles. * 101 stuff. * <br /><br />Goodbye SG1, maybe goodbye Atlantis.. All hopes rest with Universe.
