I bought this DVD because I expected it would provide some serious and interesting insights into Indian cult adventures, followed by some keen deprogramming techniques back home in the pond of Christianity.<br /><br />However, in this movie, for a sincere truth-seeker, the whole matter is interpreted on perhaps the lowest possible level.<br /><br />There is hardly a life lesson to learn from this movie, except one should perhaps not spend one's life on the Australian countryside, and the fact that sexuality is a strong force that's easily misinterpreted when it comes to true spirituality.<br /><br />An almost true waste of time.
