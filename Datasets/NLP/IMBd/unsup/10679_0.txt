This one of my favorite movies. My kid hates it. but i love it. Movie Mason (Mickey Rooney) knows every thing about movies. It is a must see movie. It is scary and funny at the same time. 5 out out of 5 stars! Only on Disney. There is a man who is going around making bad stuff happen. That is all i am going to tell you.
