You know, during this entire movie i expected everyone to start whipping off their clothes and start making-out. Look, the acting is appalling, trying to ignore it is futile. Things just don't add up, i mean i know its low budget and all, but if a person is repetitively stabbed, there will be at least a little blood on the knife! The acting could have been improved if the actors felt the moment, i felt like screaming it after a while! I'm all for independent movies, but if the movie is as bad as it was, then you shouldn't use such a good looking cover! And also, a psychic ability should have some sort of introduction (but don't worry, its only a 3 second thing that has no follow through, so no plot spoiler here)!
