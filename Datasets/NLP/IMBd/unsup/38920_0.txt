I've read the book and despite knowing that the it's way too comprehensive to fit into 90 minutes of film, I gave it a shot. If you've read the book and want to watch the movie - don't! I finished the book in about two days, I couldn't put it down. It was exciting and upsetting. The movie is something else, in quality it's not as good as for example the Beck-movies, but still an okay movie. I guess that people who haven't read the book can enjoy this one as a quite good thriller. <br /><br />So in my personal opinion it would have been a 1, if I hadn't read the book it would have been a 5, so I landed in between.
