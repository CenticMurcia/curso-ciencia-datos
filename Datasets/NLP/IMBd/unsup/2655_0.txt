This is a film meant ONLY for the theaters, and should be restricted to IMAX to boot.<br /><br />I just watched this on a regular TV/DVD player. Okay, although it may have been a viewing experience in the theater it was boring at home.<br /><br />I was bored, granted I didn't experience the film the way it was meant to be.<br /><br />That being said, this was another film that banked mostly on the effects (computer 3d animation) and little on the story. Yes, it was a cartoon, basically, so what kind of acting can you get out of a cartoon.<br /><br />All I can say is that the film ended with me feeling cheated.
