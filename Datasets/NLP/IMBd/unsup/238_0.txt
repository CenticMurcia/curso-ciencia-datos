I'm pleased that you all like the show. I love "Static Shock". It is indeed (or at least was) one of the better toons on TV. Though every now and then, it appears to go a little over-board with the whole racism awareness biz, the show was definitely an anchor point for individuals who felt that they were not equally represented in the pool of superheroes that we know of today.<br /><br />However, I must bring forth the fact that Static is not a new character. He isn't the first African  American superhero either. In fact, his character was taken from an earlier DC character named Black Steel.<br /><br />Also, FYI Green Lantern, Cyborg, BumbleBee, Herald and HotSpot are all African American  in addition to Static.<br /><br />But I agree with all of you  Bring Static back! Induct him into the Justice League  as a matter of fact, BRING BACK THE JUSTICE LEAGUE!!!
