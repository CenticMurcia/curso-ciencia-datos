awful awful awful awful. If they'd cut out all the pointless horse riding and crummy gunfighting it would have been 10 minutes long of very bad dialogue. George Kennedy gets top billing for a gut-wrenchingly bad scene. This is the fun part: count how many things are wrong with Kennedy's scene. There are lots, mostly in the set where they chose to shoot the scene. Although I always thought a cameo was a surprise appearance that makes the movie more enjoyable for those in the know, it was really just the most crap scene ever. There are a few gems ("You bastard!" "My mother's choice, not mine.") but they are delivered so badly you hardly notice them. It seems obvious to me that some guys were sitting around (maybe drunk) when they thought of a handful of witty lines and wrote a script around getting them on screen. Seriously. And they weren't that great. I'd say it's so bad you have to love it, but really, it's so bad that if you love it then you're just... well, you have weird tastes, my friend. very weird. And we're never letting you choose the movie. EVER.
