5 minutes into the movie, and I have already figured out what the ending would be. Nevertheless, I decided to sit through the movie just to see the special effects.<br /><br />The movie could have been much more. IMHO, too much time has been spent on the introductory part - wandering around the house, etc. But wandering is exactly how the movie is... It has a hard time trying to decide whether it is a horror or a psychological thriller and ends up being neither.<br /><br />Minor spoiler: When the approached the chair and were about the turn it over, I kept telling myself - not another "Psycho" rip-off again...<br /><br />End of minor spoiler...<br /><br />
