Occasionally, a movie comes along that is a delight from the beginning to end. "Innerspace" had all of the elements perfect, from writing to acting.<br /><br />Martin Short is absolutely hysterical. This was the perfect vehicle for his physical nature. I never laughed at him in other films as much as I did here.<br /><br />As I recall this movie in my home town, it did not spend that much time in the theater. I never saw it until it was released on video. It apparently did not gross that much money, and that is a mystery to me. It remains one of my all-time favorites.
