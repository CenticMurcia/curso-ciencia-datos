As a fan of baseball and movies this has to be one of my favorites in both categories. Barry Pepper and Thomas Jane do a fantastic job in their roles as Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle. Billy Crystal(not to my surprise)knew exactly what he was doing for the movie and made it to be the best baseball movie I've seen since Field of Dreams(no offense to Rookie of the Year,Little Big League or the first two Major League movies). This movie made me like the Yankees for the first time in my life. Now if only someone could make a movie about the Pirates, aside from the original Angels in the Outfield. I'm sure there are movies, but let's get the biggest Pirates fan in Hollywood and have him make the Roberto Clemente movie...
