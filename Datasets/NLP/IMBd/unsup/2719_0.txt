OK i read this book and was curious to see the movie to see what they would.<br /><br />I had seen many Russian series before this and was generally unimpressed as i think they spent all the money on the cars and not anything else.<br /><br />Furthermore Goblin and a few other reviewers and critics i read were generally so so on it.<br /><br />So i was incredibly surprised to find how well they pulled this off. Its not an issue of "accuracy" (even though an acquaintances mother who is a teacher of literature in Russia and read this 20 times cover to cover was very satisfied) it is an issue of originality. The black and white to color switches, the acting, the actors, the music i found it really well done as well it should be since it is so well loved in Russia.<br /><br />Really they put in the effort and i was generally pleased with the result. Again not due to "accuracy" or inaccuracy, as that is impossible to do with certain films but with the originality and what i thought was quality film making.<br /><br />Btw, when Kot Begemot turned into the guy who plays Stira in ShtrafBat, my jaw dropped seeing as that was the person with the "cat eyes" who i pictured when i read Master and Bulgakov described him.<br /><br />10 stars is an understatement.
