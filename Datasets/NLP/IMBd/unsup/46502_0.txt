Don't expect this to resemble anything like the novel. In all, its a pretty B grade series with the worst CGI I've ever seen in my life and one wonders, if one cannot take the dinos seriously due to how unconvincing they look, then why watch the series at all? The inclusion of one busty and scantily clad woman and some partial nudity involving Rachel Blakely are perhaps reasons to to see this but if they've thrown these in on purpose, it would seem that they themselves don't take this series very seriously. The story lines are perhaps passable and decent but this series is no great shakes by itself and the CGI dinos don't show that frequently.
