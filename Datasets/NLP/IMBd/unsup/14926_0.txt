For all of those who have been misguided and praised The Matrix as the greatest scifi movie(though i rather call it junk), you have been lied too. The Matrix is actually an overbudget, over-rated, and over-produce version of this classic, Dark City. The special effects, unlike The Matrix, make sense in this film. They not only please the eyes, but they make the mind think. This is not eye-candy junk. This is the real thing. A film which knows no boundries and does not add a nonsense storyline to it. It is sad to see people flock to The Matrix and over look this more original picture. You'll see sequels of The Matrix, but you will not see sequels of Dark City, because it is art. Brillantly scripted, Brillantly acted, Brillantly directed. This is the real sci-fi thriller we've been waiting for. Not since 2001: A Space Odyssey, has a sci-fi film made science so powerful and exciting. As for The Matrix, it made it dumb.
