Screenwriter Kevin Williamson had nothing to do with writing this sequel but even if he had I doubt if he would have been able to improve it much . The fundamental problem with SCREAM 3 is that we've seen it all before . There's a pre title credit sequence telephone conversation that climaxes in death and then we're on a set of a movie which eventually ends with cast members getting killed one by one . We know where everything is heading but the attempts to hold our attention are rather lame . For example one of the characters sees the masked killer coming towards and guess what ? It's a dream which is something that rings of pathetic story telling . We also get a cameo from Jay and Bob from the Kevin Smith movies which leaves a feeling of doubt that the producers we're getting a bit desperate in the gimmick department . The climax is somewhat watchable but is let down by the fact that Sidney probably didn't need saving after all and the finale was written just so the murderer could explain his motives . For a film franchise that shouts how clever and post modernist it tries to be the producers should know about the law of diminishing returns . Haven't they seen THE GODFATHER 3 ?
