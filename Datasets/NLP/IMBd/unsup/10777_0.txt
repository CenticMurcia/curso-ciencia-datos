For my purposes, this title gets a 8 out of 10. Five for the movie itself, an extra two points for Mr. Spiner's diamond blue eyes, and one for the set designer who had the presence of mind to arrange Spiner's character's color scheme around them. Everything around "Devlin Bowman" is blue and white and the effect is quite striking.<br /><br />The movie is a ninety minute fart joke. I'm not kidding.<br /><br />Harold Gould, by far and away, delivers the best overall performance in the movie (such as it is). Casting James Brolin in this movie was a definite stroke of completely ridiculous genius. Austin Wolff is, of course, adorable, and Dana Carvey's particular brand of multiple personality disorder is as entertaining as ever (I got a definite chuckle out of Mr. Peru).<br /><br />Like I said, the movie is a ninety minute fart joke and is quite clearly directed at males between the ages of eight and twelve. If you have a roomful of those kind of people and you'd like them to stop breaking things by playing baseball with the ceiling fan, this movie will at least put them all in one room and occupy them with disgusting noises for about an hour and a half. There's no swearing. The (incredibly) mild "blue" content is really tame and based on a cartoony visual gag, as is the "violence". It's supposed to be a silly, sight gag based comedy and that's exactly what it is.<br /><br />As for Spiner (you knew I was getting to it); first of all, he's gorgeous. Like I said, the character's entire color scheme is a shade of electric blue that compliments his eyes to the point of being captivating. I was hitting the pause button just because I *had* to look. The jokes are (of course) at his character's expense (he *is* the bad guy, after all), and he, appropriately, rolls out his very best "smarmy/irritated" act (the one that stole "Out To Sea" right out from under two legends). It's amusing and relatively gentle right up until the climax of the movie, where he hits the "crazy button" and doesn't look back. Then it's just plain hilarious. In terms of Spiner-related content, I got exactly what I wanted out of this movie and just a little bit more.<br /><br />By the way, Classmates.com owes Spiner a big, wet kiss (trust me).
