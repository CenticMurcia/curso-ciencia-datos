I find this film pointless. Big deal, there was an interracial relationship. This theme can hardly highlight a movie. And Robert Downey Jr. is totally wasted, having the oxygen mask on him for most of his role. Then again, they should have put oxygen masks on the rest of the cast, to stifle their lines. Come to think about, the audience in the theaters probably needed oxygen masks to keep from fainting at this poor flock.<br /><br />I even found the sex scenes uninteresting.<br /><br />What exactly was the theme or idea, or plot of this movie. No need to issue a spoiler here, because anyone watching this movie should be thoroughly dis-interested in the ending.
