Before Ron Howard concentrated his energy on making films that are very messagey and thought-provoking (even if he doesn't always succeed), back at the beginning of his career he was a little more wild and adventurous. Films like Night Shift and Grand Theft Auto were rather more zanier than anything he does nowadays. But the film that propelled him to the A-list of directors was Splash.<br /><br />Splash also feels different from Ron Howard's films of recent years. This is a film made with a great deal of zest and obvious fun on Howard's part. Its a simple but magical fairytale that you really grow to love. It also marked the first of Howard's associations with Tom Hanks. A friendship that still continues today with hits like the superb Apollo 13 and the completely overrated Da Vinci Code.<br /><br />There are not many live-action films about mermaids, which makes Splash rather unique. Its not a perfect film. It has a few flaws, its a little too lightweight and the ending is slightly odd but its also a fun way to pass the time.<br /><br />Allan Bauer (Hanks) co-manages a fruit & veg market with his brother Freddie (The late and great John Candy). He's longed for love in his life ever since he was rescued from drowning as a boy by a mermaid. He's never forgotten the incident. And neither has she.<br /><br />After Allan is dumped by his girlfriend, he goes back to Cape Cod to be alone. The place where he met the mermaid. But when he gets into trouble, he is rescued by the same one. Only now she's a beautiful grownup mermaid (wonderfully played by a perfectly cast Daryl Hannah).<br /><br />Allan goes back to New York and she follows. When on dry land, she has legs. But if she ever gets wet, she turns back into a mermaid. She names herself Madison (after the street) and starts a relationship with Allan that blossoms into true love. But trouble looms on the horizon from an obsessed scientist Dr Walter Kornbluth (Eugene Levy) who wants to expose Madison to the world.<br /><br />Splash is made with such a bubbly and infectious cheer its almost impossible to dislike. Here's your chance to see Tom Hanks at the beginning of his career before he became a favourite with the Oscar crowd. Its quite nice to see him in a part where he's just out to have fun. Big is still his best film performance of the 80s (and 90s and 00s!) but Splash has him on good form.<br /><br />And John Candy is quite the scene stealer as the boisterous and larger than life Freddie. He's obviously having a good time in this film. Playing a part not that far removed from the wild partying he indulged in real life. Although Candy is good, there are moments of painful anguish with foreknowledge of what was to come for him.<br /><br />But the shining light of the entire film is the lovely and criminally underrated Daryl Hannah. Madison is a part she was born to play. Its hard to imagine any other woman more suited to the part of a mermaid than Daryl Hannah. With her long golden hair, statuesque figure, shiny baby blues and natural beauty she is just captivating.<br /><br />Not only is she physically matched to the role, but Hannah has the right personality too. Sometimes Daryl Hannah can seem a little spacy in her film roles, but its exactly that quality that makes her so perfect in the part of Madison. She brings a child-like sense of wonder and astonishment that makes her a very appealing screen presence, and she even has a majestic grace in the underwater scenes (which are beautifully photographed by the way).<br /><br />The real fun to be had is Madison navigating her way through a world she doesn't really understand. She eats lobster ravenously, she thinks nothing of walking through crowds stark naked, and absorbs knowledge from television where she picks up the human language in a matter of hours. Without Hannah, Splash might have been considerably less than it is.<br /><br />But not everything about Splash works. The subplot concerning Eugene Levy's character feels unnecessary. All his attempts to expose Madison end the same way to the point of repetitiveness. And his character has quite an abrupt change halfway through. He goes from being an obsessed, obnoxious paranoid man to a person who sympathises with Madison's plight and helps her escape. Its a change that doesn't quite ring true.<br /><br />And the ending left me a little puzzled. I could understand Allan wanting to be with Madison. But I couldn't quite believe he would leave everything behind to live with her under the sea. Its a slightly strange climax that reminded me of a similar situation in the time-travel romance Kate & Leopold. I just couldn't accept what I was seeing.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Splash is a bouncy and very appealing comedy. One of Ron Howard's best films, and thanks to the cast (but mostly Hannah) it stays afloat and never sinks. So take the plunge!
