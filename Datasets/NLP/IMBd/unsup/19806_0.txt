What the crap were they thinking?!?! I just can't believe ANYONE in their right mind would want to make this movie! The story is a combination of true history and fictionalized drivel. Yes, there really was a health clinic in Michigan that really prescribed a STRICT vegetarian diet, repeated enemas and was dedicated to repressing sexual urges. BUT, to make an entire movie about this AND to try to make it a comedy??? The movie is VERY visceral and goes way over the top in showing and describing human and animal waste. Wow. It looks like movie goers could have saved money--instead of paying to see this movie, they could have gone to a sewage treatment plant or local dairy farm for a tour---or perhaps just stared into a used toilet for 118 minutes! The movie is painfully unfunny and most of the characters are awful--particularly Dana Carvey's disgusting character.
