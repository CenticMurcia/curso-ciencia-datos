Suburban Commando is a very good film and its one of Hulk Hogan`s best films.It is one of My favorite films.I was thrilled when it came out because back when wrestling was wrestling it was so fun watching the then WWF Prime Time Wrestling show and seeing the promotions on it while watching some of the best wrestling ever seen back in 1991.Anyway the film is action packed and has many,many funny moments.One of My favorite actors Christopher Lloyd stars along with the Hulkster and he is very good in it.Christopher Neame had a very short part and I think he should have had a much larger role in the film.William Ball,Shelley Duvall,Roy Dotrice,and Larry Miller all put on good performances.I was amazed to see Mark Callaway (The Undertaker) in the film. The film has good effects,good music and is an enjoyable film.If you like Hulk Hogan and Christopher Lloyd and love action,comedy,sc-fi action then see this film!<br /><br />Notes: <br /><br />The first version of Suburban Commando released has a special message by Hulk Hogan before the movie starts.<br /><br />The following November Hulk Hogan fought fellow co-star Mark Callaway (The Undertaker) in the 1991 Survivor Series.<br /><br />During the song in the intro Hulk Hogan has a few words in the song.<br /><br />Hulk Hogan is the Executive Producer for Suburban Commando.<br /><br />Hulk Hogan`s long time friend and legendary wrestler Brutus "the Barber" Beefcake (Ed Leslie) performed many of the stunts in the film.
