I seem to be in the minority here. I can't understand why this<br /><br />movie isn't getting the most enthusiastic reviews.<br /><br />Sure, the plot has been visited again and again in books, movies<br /><br />and TV (including Richard Basehart's mind being taken over at<br /><br />least 34 times in Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea). Does that<br /><br />matter so much? Haven't we seen "Saving Private Ryan" and "A.I."<br /><br />before? Did anyone criticize them as "just another Longest Day,"<br /><br />or "just another 'robot wants to be human'" movies?<br /><br />The Puppet Masters is expertly handled. The direction is tight and<br /><br />suspense-building. The early scenes of the kids with the UFO<br /><br />roadside attraction are clever. Sutherland is great. The dialogue<br /><br />is realistic. This remains one of my favorites
