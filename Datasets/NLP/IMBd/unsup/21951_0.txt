Didn't see this in the theater, but a coworker told me about it. Wound up buying it on DVD & watching it with my girlfriend and buddy. One of the best movies of its kind! The plot was very good, and flowed well. The action was believable. Many questions undoubtedly, but we have not been able to prove what an actual time shift act would result in. Definitely a movie to keep you on the edge of your seat, and when the timelines converge at the end, it was a total surprise and brought the end in just like a story should!<br /><br />Very few other movies top this... and i am eager for this writer to write something else with this kind of creativity!
