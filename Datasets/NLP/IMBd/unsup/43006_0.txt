Why any film company would choose to publicise the fact that their product is courtesy of the man whose most notable recent achievement was Escape From LA is a bit of a mystery Unlike that though, while a long way short of being a good film, Ghosts is surprisingly fun. Set in a future where Mars has been colonised, a team of police officers led by Pam Grier and Natasha Henstridge are sent to a mining post to escort public enemy James 'Desolation' Williams (Ice Cube) back for trial. On arrival however, they find the place deserted and a lot of dead bodies - and the remaining former inhabitants turned into mindless painted killers. To say this falls short of good is possibly a little misleading. To clarify, it's awful. It's not giving too much away to say that the cause of the human's strange behaviour is in fact an airborne virus which infects people, then leaves the host for another when that person dies. Realising this early on in the film, do our intrepid heroes come up with some cunning scheme to entrap them and the virus? Don't be silly - they grab the biggest, heaviest artillery in sight and blow every virus-carrier they come across into pulp. Both Grier and Clea Duvall are wasted in their parts, while Jason Statham's cop role is so hammed up it's embarrassing. The flashback structure means that you know exactly who survives at the end, so there's no suspense. Mr Cube, taking a step away from the acting of Three Kings, seems to have scripted a lot of his own dialogue in righteous gangsta speak, but his portrayal of a hardened criminal doesn't really work because, put simply, he looks like a big teddy bear. Nevertheless, the plentiful action sequences are well done, and it's this that lifts the whole thing into the 'so bad, it's good' bracket. So much so that the review audience laughed all the way through and applauded at the end. It's so entertainingly terrible, it's almost worth more praise.
