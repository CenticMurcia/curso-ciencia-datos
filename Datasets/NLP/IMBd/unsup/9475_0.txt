I think this movie is more or less for younger kids. Yeah, I watched and enjoyed it, but it is filled with very simple and sometimes corny elements and sequences that were a bit too modest for me. The two actors were great though, their performances were definitely okay. I like Christian Bale a lot and - to be honest - bought this one just because he is in it. Nicholas Pickard was genuine and smart as well. Again, I just felt a bit too old for it, I thought it was presented like a fairy tale. The setting was still okay and the underlying themes are wonderful (father-son, friendship, courage, love etc). I give it a 7 because of its unusual but fine approach and as it does fulfil its basic premise, which is to entertain kids between 5 and 10.
