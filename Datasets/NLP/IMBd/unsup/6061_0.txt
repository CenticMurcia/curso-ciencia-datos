Ehh.. I didn't enjoy this movie as much as I did the others. It gave away everything in the commercials. Just watching the commercials would be enough to watch the entire movie. I don't know if you guys have other opinions but.. I don't think this movie was worth the making. It should have been funnier. And didn't they already use the village in the other Scary movies? Maybe not, but I thought so. If so, they shouldn't repeat. The saw part(s) were good though. I won't say what I liked the most, because I don't want to give it away, but the end with the guy & the woman, is pretty funny :] Anyways, this movie wasn't worth seeing to me, but at the same time I guess it was. It just wasn't what I expected :]
