Wow, i was surprise that this is a movie for TV. I just watched it from the Hallmark channel and frankly i don't watch the channel a lot. This movie you can say is a every day romantic film that you can see from a lot of films.But it made me stuck on my TV to watch it.I think the simplicity of the movie is the magnet of this film. Richard Ruccolo's acting was really good in this film, i can really feel Michael Blake's character. The other cast, was okay, not the best, but fit perfect for the movie. The story really fits the bill with additional story linking with food in it. Nice writing. This film will make everybody think that the term true love is there. Good stuff.
