Not since Ed Wood have we seen someone able to pull this feat off. Writing, directing, and producing and being amazingly bad at all of them.<br /><br />Okay, so this is better than an Ed Wood film but not by a whole lot.<br /><br />"The Man Next Door" follows the carnage of a Ted Bundy like killer, mainly focused around his game with a young high school senior. She has had mental issues since the death of her parents ten years ago. Since then she has been raised by her Grandfather and step-Grandmother. With his cunning wit and charm mixed with her perceived lack of mental stability and a very hard, stern step-Grandmother he seems to have her in the palm of his hands.<br /><br />If that sounds like a TV movie it is probably because it should be only I think even the Lifetime movies of the week are above this.<br /><br />The acting isn't stale, it is decomposing, very slowly before our very eyes. The supposed twist are predictable and expected.<br /><br />One of the main flaws is the lack of any reason we have to believe our lady heroine has any serious mental issues. There is nothing to even remotely suggest this. I guess we are to just go by faith that she had some real breakdowns back in the day even though it is never seen or mentioned.<br /><br />There are only two good things about this movie. The director does give us some different camera angles but it doesn't make up for everything else in this movie. Also, it is nice that the cops aren't made out to be complete fools like in most movies.<br /><br />There are some other things in this movie that have glaring holes but I dare not point them out here in case you are actually wanting to watch this movie.<br /><br />So, if you're at Hollywood Video and see this one in front of you in the horror section, just repeat this to yourself "Put it down, take a step back, turn to the left and then calmly but promptly walk away." 1 out of 10.
