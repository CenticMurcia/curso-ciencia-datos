(Many Spoilers). I know that "Batman and Robin" was a pitifully bad film. I regret to have wasted time and money seeing that film. "Captain America" on the other hand, I wasted no money by watching it free on Hulu.com and it was completely deprived of anything that could make a superhero movie enjoyable. Huge waste of time, talent, and film.<br /><br />I mean wow! this film was horribly scripted, cheaply filmed, and awfully directed. The cheesy set pieces, special effects, costumes, make-up, and poor photography makes the film look like it came out at the 70's. Unfortunately it came out in the 90's! <br /><br />Some people have defended this film because of the film's star Matt Salinger, giving a serious performance. He is of course the son of author J.D. Salinger, which means nothing because... <br /><br />MATT SALINGER CAN'T ACT! HIS PERFORMANCE WAS A LOAD OF CRAP!!<br /><br />In this film Salinger wore only two facial expressions the whole time. 1. Exhaustion, like he's been overworked and sleep deprived. 2. Vacancy, like he's stupid and confused. He looks like he's about to say, "Duh, I have no idea what I'm supposed to do or say, somebody give me direction!" He even sounds like he's reciting his lines without conviction. He could have been reading cue cards for all I know.<br /><br />There are many plot holes, but the biggest one I can't stand is that after Salinger is given the Super-Soldier Serum (At the beginning) transforming into Captain America, he becomes a lousy superhero up until the end for no reason. Throughout the rest of the film Captain America loses in a fist fight with Red Skull, gets tied to a rocket, fakes car sickness to steal his friends' vehicles, learns about world history he missed while he was frozen for 5 decades, flees from henchmen, hides, and lays low. That's right a superhero who saves no one and only fights well at the climax! lays low! <br /><br />Final Note: The only reason why anyone would see this film is for the fight scenes. Sadly these fight scenes are boring, choppy, and repetitive, the editing and cutting of each fight is so fast and phony that viewers have no idea what the hell is going on.
