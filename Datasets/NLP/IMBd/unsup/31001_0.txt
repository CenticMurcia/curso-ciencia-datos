Devaney creates a film filled with strong characters and gritty realism. We actually care about what happens to these people, a point which is often lost in other movies of a similar type. This movie easily could have devolved into some pseudo-Scorsese gang movie but instead chose to focus on family drama, which is portrayed rather compellingly. The story is loosely based on the life-story of the the main character, played by Tommy Guiffre. Most of the acting was great despite the fact that many of the actors were first timers. Noticeable standout is Jamie Hector's role as Courtland, the dealer with the dream of a better life. Production values on this movie are excellent despite the low budget. Shot on location in Brooklyn you get a real sense for the world these people live in. See this movie. You will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Garretron commands, "Get there!"
