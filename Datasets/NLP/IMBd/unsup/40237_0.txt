First, Let me just say I love spike lee. The 25th hour is a classic. Do The Right Thing, Malcolm X, Crooklyn, Mo Betta...,4 little Girls (Doc)...brilliant. But she hate me? If this was a paper, I would give it an "F" for no thesis or organization. I mean what happen spike? You Hurt my heart. I defended you. I was with you for Girl 6, I hung in there waiting for a redeeming factor in Jungle Fever. I thought you were gaining back your ground when i saw the Summer of Sam. Watched Bamboozled and said, "Okay, I see the point." But she hate me? She hate me? Are you Serious?? I mean what the %#$@! Lesbians and white collar crime? Where is the logic? When I think of Enron, I don't think Ellen. So why spike? Why? And I watched this movie hoping that something will make me feel better about it but nope...never happened. Spoiler Alert: And the lessons or climax of the whole movie:White Collar crime is bad and all lesbians need is a good stiff...you get the point. And then Ken Lay and Ellen and Portia De Rossi all live happy every after on Coney Island. It was like is some crazy nightmare sequence. Spike, Do you even know any lesbians? How about women? Do you know any women? Because the female behavior in the film wasn't even close to any real female character of any sort as a matter of fact...No characters in the whole spectacle had any ounce of realism. This movie was one huge caricature of stereotypical, quasi-political,overstated visual rhetoric. Spike, She don't hate you. But I'm hating. Spike, come on...we got to do better than this.
