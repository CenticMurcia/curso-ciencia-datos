The hoary old storyline involving the ex-con, now going straight complete with lovely wife, drawn into, 'one last job', is not the most appealing but do not be put off the super little gem. Gene Nelson and Phyllis Kirk are fine as the aforementioned young couple but Sterling Hayden is most effectively worrying as the cop in charge. At one moment more nasty than the baddies and the next seeming to deserve our admiration, this guy seems to be playing good cop and bad cop all by himself. The story moves along at a pace and the numerous locations shots of Los Angeles and its environs are almost breathtaking. This also features an early appearance of Charles Bronson as one of the ruthless baddies and another reason for making this a must see.
