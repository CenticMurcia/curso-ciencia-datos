My kids and I love this movie!! We think that Richard Pryor and the whole cast did a wonderful job in the movie. It means more to us now since the passing of Richard!! WE will miss his sense of humor. But his movies and shows will stay with us forever!! We especially love the parts of Brad, Frank Crawford and Arlo Pear!! They had some one liners in the movie that were great!! My son and I love to quote those one liners when we see each other and my daughter will join us when we discuss the movie. We thought the moving guys were terrific. We thought he did a great job.WE have to dig the movie and watch it to just to get some great laughs. Richard Pryor we will miss you!!
