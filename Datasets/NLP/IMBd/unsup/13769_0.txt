I found this to be a very entertaining comedy-suspense film with some wild action.<br /><br />Until the movie "Ronin" came out in the late '90s, the car-chase scene in this movie was the best I had ever seen on film. It still may be the best - you have to see it to believe it!<br /><br />Basically, this is simply a dark humor film in which a cop, "Burt Simpson" (Coleman) deals with real - or imaginary - imminent death.<br /><br />Thinking he's dying, he takes ridiculous chances, actually hoping he gets killed so his kid gets insurance. Of course, he survives....and how he does is hilarious. Beware, though: this is not family viewing with the high amount of profanity. <br /><br />This movie needs to be out on DVD!
