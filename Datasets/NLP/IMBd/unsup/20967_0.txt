This film is raw and potent, a true testament to the terrible treatment of POWs in WW2 who were forced to build the Railway of Death over the River Kwai. This is not a perfect film, yet the power of the story it tells is so compelling that I cannot in good conscience give this film anything but a 10. I am glad I had a chance to see this film, to be moved to tears by it, and to hear the filmmakers speak about their experience making it.
