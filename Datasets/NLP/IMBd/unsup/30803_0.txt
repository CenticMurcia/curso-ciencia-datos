This new HBO movie far exceeded my expectations. In the first of the three mini-movies, Vanessa Redgrave gives a stirring performance as the survivor of a lesbian couple in 1961. The message of this first movie serves well to remind people of the tragedy that ensued when one's life long partner passed on previous to the 70's.<br /><br />The second movie, set in 1972, depicts an accurate portrayal of what lesbians faced during the rise of the feminist movement where even sisters were divided over who should be allowed to participate and promote the feminist cause. Chloe Sevigny's portrayal of a "butch" lesbian, comfortable with herself is phenomenal. Ms. Sevigny should be nominated for an Emmy for her fantastic acting.<br /><br />The third and final movie, features a current day lesbian couple who are trying to have a child. Billed as a romantic comedy, this episode has an underlying message amid the laughter and tears which is common to all couples regardless of gender. Ellen Degeneres and Sharon Stone are funny, yet convincing as a couple. Their chemistry radiates throughout and both women deserve accolades for their performances.<br /><br />Finally, a comment must be made about the fact that Anne Heche made her HBO directing debut with the third episode. Having written the story as well, it is clear to this viewer that Anne Heche has a brilliant future not only as an actress but as a writer and director.<br /><br />"If These Walls Could Talk 2" is a cinematic achievement and may very well be the first movie of the new Millennium which accurately shows where there is love and truth, gender is nothing but an afterthought.
