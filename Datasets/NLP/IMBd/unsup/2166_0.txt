Bad story, bad acting, terrible computer generated "Killer Bees" that don't even fly like bees would (more like the killer beauty marks from another dimension).<br /><br />The thing that gets me overall: this film makes no sense!!! Now even though the terrible, and I mean TERRIBLE computer graphics bothered me, the plot of this movie is even worse.<br /><br />It seems the whole town is held hostage by a mayor who just won't call anyone in on this because it might mess up the chances of the giant superstore people opening up a store in their town, and interfere with the upcoming "festival" (can we say "The Swarm"?). The sheriff (C. Thomas Howell) doesn't seem to have the sense to go over the mayor's head and call in the proper authorities. He just keeps running around telling everyone "the bees are here" like a nut and making posters to hang all over town. On a personal note, I truly hope the law enforcement in my town is a little smarter than this.<br /><br />We are further forced to endure the silly sub-plot of the sheriff's failing marriage for some reason, a detail which just makes this horror of a film (not horror film) even longer.<br /><br />So the festival goes on, the people are stung, bla bla bla. I was rooting for the bees.<br /><br />Also I think people from Washington state should be insulted. This film portrays them as kinda dopey. Ah, Mr. Howell maybe it's time for a change in careers, but please not law enforcement thank you.<br /><br />If this had been a student film, I would have given it a D-. Rating 1/10.<br /><br />
