I can understand why Devon Sawa would choose a role like this. Only because he's been out of work for so long, he's probably desperate. Same for Andrew Keegan as well. Both, good looking funny, semi-talented actors, they have chosen this piece, "Extreme Dating", which makes "Harold and Kumar Go To White Castle" look like a Shakespearean piece.<br /><br />After four friends go on a skiing trip, and one of them ends up in a dire situation with a strange girl, and falling in love with her afterwards, the rest of the group decides to try 'Extreme dating'. Meaning, they find different scenarios or situations where they can get trapped, kidnapped or isolated with the people they are in love with or have crushes on. <br /><br />The whole movie was pretty lame, and although there were a few funny moments, it's not all that enthralling. I will admit that I watched the movie all the way through, partly because I was bored and the other part was because I like Devon Sawa and wanted to give the film a chance. The girl in the movie, whose name escapes me, has been in a few other films, but she looks like she's gone on Mary-Kate Olsen's diet. She used to be very full-figured, and now she looks almost sick. But, aside from that aspect, she was very good, maybe at times a little over dramatic, but cute.<br /><br />It was worth checking out, but all in all not the best teen - young adult movie you'll see. Stick with better Sawa films like, "Casper" and "Idol Hands".
