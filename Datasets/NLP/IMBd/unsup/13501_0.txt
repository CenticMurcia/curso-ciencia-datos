In this film you'll see the sort of things you see when you quick-empty a bottle of vodka and then go and start a civil war. And blow up a whole country and all that. Shocking cinema for the movie-goer, in-you-face history for the social scientist type, bad memories for those that lived through it. Kids growing up to be gangsters in the post-Yugoslav hood. Sanctions-busting crime and normal crime are their path of socialization in the new and uncharted world, where TV crime shows will give them some patterns to follow, but since they're not the faint of heart, they'll soon make their own rules.<br /><br />It would be 10 out of 10 as a gangster movie, yes, but it's 10 out of 10 in many other genres as well. Cruelly satirical blends with insightfully revealing in the portrayal of the era. As our lead characters go out of control, they present you with the uncontrollable dynamics of post-Yugoslav reality, that were beyond the point of no return before most realized. There is the whole story of the former Yugoslavia in the interactions. And the film, typically for its hellishly dark style, even proposes its own very special cure that no UN-sponsored mediation training will ever teach as one to be followed, I'm sure.
