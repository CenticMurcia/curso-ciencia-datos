If you are not a girl under the age of ten, New York Minute will be a head ache inducing waste of 90 minutes of your time. The interchangeable Olsen twins (who cares which is which) star in this rip off of Ferris Bueller's Day Off. Ferris Bueller was likable but these two girls have no personality. Their series of misadventures are not funny. Eugene Levy has a nothing role as a truent officer obsessed with catching the two girls. This character is incredibly stupid, not funny, and very obnoxious. Then there are non acting guys who fall in love with them. Don't get me started on Andy Richter's embarrassing role. Definitely one of the year's worst movies. 3/10
