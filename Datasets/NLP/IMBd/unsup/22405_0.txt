I wish I could slap every 16 year old in this show with a full sized trout! How could any 16 year old be such a low life bag of slime and better yet how could the parents be so mind numbingly easy going toward them! IT MAKES NO SENSE! Couple of words for Mtv. Take the show off the god damn air! Don't give those 16 year old desperate wannabe celebrities the satisfaction of getting on TV! Actually, no forget what I said. Let it stay on. I would be fine seeing these Paris Hilton clones get bad reputations and better yet, publicity in their High Schools.<br /><br />I hate these god damn 16 year olds on it! They make me (as the title says) SICK! PHYSICALLY SICK! 1/10
