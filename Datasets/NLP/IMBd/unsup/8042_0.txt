This drive-in rarity is perhaps best enjoyed in the same style as Mystery Science Theatre 3000.<br /><br />Plot: Alternately silly and confusing. A doctor suffers a minor car accident, then, strangely enough, a young lady has a car accident right next to him. He goes for help at the conveniently-nearby spOOky castle. Strangeness ensues. Dialog: Originally in Italian. On the DVD version, you get your choice of dubbing and subtitles. Both are bizarre and occasionally howlingly funny.<br /><br />Special Effects: Mostly performed by shaking the camera. A few smokepots. A monster that is about as lame as Ed Wood's giant octopus from "Bride of the Monster."<br /><br />Music: You got the synthesizer AND the bongos, but no wocka-wocka guitars or plinked wires. Thankfully, no moaning.<br /><br />Vampiric lesbianism? Of course. It's required in movies like<br /><br />this.<br /><br />Female nudity? Yes, since the plot *absolutely*required* that the female lead wander about the castle and its exterior in either a towel wrap, a negligee, or nothing at all.<br /><br />Male nudity? A short special-guest appearance by the half-red-and-half-blue guys from Star Trek (or their poor cousins) in thong loincloths.<br /><br />Sex? Eh, barely as racy as your typical R Rated Motel Fare.<br /><br />Gross? Hardly.<br /><br />Funny? Often,
