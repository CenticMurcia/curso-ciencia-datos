Another movie some people hate or love with good reason. If you aren't a sci-fi fan, you will likely hate Sci-Fi spoofs as you will not get much of the humour and aren't interested in the setting of the story!!....Galaxy Quest is similar...If you hate Star Trek and never watched it, why would you laugh at a Star Trek spoof? I like this movie, because John Lithgow is one of the funniest people alive(my opinion and taste), I get the jokes because I read the comics, watched the Sci Fi movies, like satire, lived the 80s, and like silly humour. 8 out of 10 if you like silly, sci-fi and in-jokes. 2 out of 10 if you dislike silliness, satire, slapstick and sci-fi..<br /><br />"Only and idiot would drive head-on into another car without first having a few drinks"
