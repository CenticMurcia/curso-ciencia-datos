Not only is this movie awfully directed with plenty of unbelievable (and impossible) situations, but it's blatantly racist. The worst: it's meant for kids!! Talk about encouraging racism! A dangerous movie, probably made by crazed Zionists. The first message conveyed is that Arabs are evil and behind attempts to sabotage peace talks. The chimp is wearing a kind of a Saudi garment. Hint to Arabs looking bad too?? Or not Humans? Sounds like some Zionist leaders calling Palestinians "cockroaches". Then the chimp saves Japan and beats Japanese ninjas worshiping some kind of monkey-god... Wow! What Pat Morita does in that garbage is beyond comprehension! The whole is a vile propaganda stunt from the evil elites of this world.
