This should not be red as a suggestion not to watch the movie , but that's the impression it gave me . Also , it needs CLASSIC or , maybe , a little enhanced CLASSIC drawing not computer animations . In this case , computer animations ruin the pictorial atmosphere that characterized the new Batman Series . Maybe it costs more but it's worth it ! Also , the plot should have been more serious or insidious . The story is too simple . Besides , if it's a cartoon , the kids would buy it anyway . The music is good , the sounds are good but the computer generated animations and the lack of story complexity drags this project down to the level of a simple good episode of The New Batman Adventures . It is really not up to the par with The Mask of The Phantasm .
