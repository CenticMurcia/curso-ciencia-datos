I was so excited to see a film adaptation of A Little Night Music, but grew suspicious when I saw that Elizabeth Taylor is in it. Don't get me wrong, I love Elizabeth, but a musical actress she is definitely not. I tried to watch this disastrous movie and then just decided to skip to "Send in the Clowns" which about an hour and 45 minutes into the picture. I thought that, at least, would redeem it. Elizabeth sings this in the absolute worst version (bar none) that I have ever heard.<br /><br />Please don't waste your money on buying or renting this film. It was worse than the film version of A Chorus Line and, up until now, I thought that was the worst adaptation of a musical.<br /><br />I am so very disappointed.
