Having seen no trailers or anything apart from the usual blurb on cinema leaflets I was fully expecting a humorous film when we went to see Disturbia. But what I got was a classic piece of film making that had had suspense, a few twists, a bit of romance, and a dollop of humour.<br /><br />Kale sees his father die in an horrific way and one in which he himself nearly dies too, but the scars won't heal and he goes off the rails, and when he attacks a school teacher he is placed on house arrest.<br /><br />Soon with the help of his best friend and new neighbour/love interest they start to investigate one of the neighbours. What unfolds is a string storyline to keep you intrigued to the end.<br /><br />A great film
