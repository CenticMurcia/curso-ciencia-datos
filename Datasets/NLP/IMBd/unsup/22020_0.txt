This is going to be a warning. Do NOT count on the rating and the reviews of this movie on IMDb. They are fake. If you want to see it yourself, then just check the first few pages of the comment history in chronological order. Except a few honest comments, more than the first 30 comments in a row have "10 star" reviews over-enthusiastically praising this movie. This obviously arose through a deceptive campaign by the associates of this movie. If you need further proof to see that this movie is purposefully over-rated, then you may want to check the message boards as well; you will see many post regarding how people are desperately looking to buy the DVD if only it were available nearby, or how you can buy it.
