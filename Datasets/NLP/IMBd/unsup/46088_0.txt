This movie represents something that is actually quite rare. A movie that is so horribly Directed and Written with a cast that has no acting ability what so ever. Well, the point is that I wish more movies like this were made because they are so much fun to make fun of because they are so horrible. You get to sort of interact with the movie instead of just sitting and watching paying close attention to the plot. You need a movie with a plot that is so ridiculous and plot less like to do this. (Please note that the next comments on the movie are stretching the truth to the limit. Every scene in this movie is done so horribly that I don't know how this movie actually made it to a theater) Christian Malcolm is such a great action hero like when he chases after his truck and has to jump in the back with the cult right on his heels. Then, he has to fend them off as his truck is slower than the Gran Torino. I wish there was a scene between Satoris and Mike Pipper. Satoris is a great villain. He's dark, scary and fights well with a torch. What this movie needs is it's own series. That would give 10 or so episodes where Troy and Rowsdower could go on and try to uncover and solve mysteries together. Mysteries that would of course bring lots of danger to themselves and would force the two of them to put there wits together to come out alive. Of Course they need to keep the classic 60's GMC Pick-up, it serves to create situations of suspense and trouble for the two. I mean, come on, when it's above 50 or below 40 degrees it never starts right? Also I love the music composed by Robert Skeet. It fits the movie well.
