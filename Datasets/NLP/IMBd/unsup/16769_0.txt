Jean Harlow and Clark Gable do share chemistry. You can check it in any of the films they were together, but in this one it is so subtle and exquisite... From here on, it contains definitely spoilers: I've read that this is the typical story with a typical happy ending. I don't agree with that, in fact I strongly disagree. It is obvious that the secretary is attracted to the boss, just look at her staring at him in his bedroom, and she doesn't seem so drunk as he is. It is a story of sacrifice, a story about a non confident wife, an immature husband and a good girl who prefers to end up attached to one boy of her kind who doesn't want her to work and prefers her at home having lots of babies. Where is the happy ending???
