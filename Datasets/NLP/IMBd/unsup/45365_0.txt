I remember my thoughts when I picked up the movie. "I've heard this is pretty good." I don't remember where or when, so I rented it. After watching this dreck, I now think, "Somebody lied to me." The lies just get better and better (or worse and worse) depending on your perspective<br /><br />The lies continue. Look at the top of the page under Genre. The first word is COMEDY. Huh? Comedy for whom? There's nothing funny here.<br /><br />Go to: Box Office and Business. Budget $2,000,000. I didn't think that Julia Roberts did anything for less than 20 million. I think that somebody is guilty of fraud. How do you quantify a big fat favor from her? This is fraud on an Enron scale.<br /><br />Finally, this is from the Plot Summary: "Julia Roberts, Blair Underwood, David Duchovny, Brad Pitt (cameoing as himself), David Hyde Pierce, Catherine Keener, and Terence Stamp are reason enough to see the film, which is billed as a 'movie about movies for people who love movies.'"<br /><br />A movie about movies for people who love movies? What? This should be billed as 'self-indulgent crap'!<br /><br />And notice who was left out. Nicky Katt (although very annoying) was the best actor in this mess.<br /><br />Alas, there is some truth. It was filmed in 18 days. I think just about anyone would agree, that sounds about right.<br /><br />
