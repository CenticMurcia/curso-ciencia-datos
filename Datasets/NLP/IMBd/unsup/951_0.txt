A comedy before it's time - it's all about sustainable resources! This is a brave little film, having neither big names nor obvious genre. The three principals are the latterday highwaymen Dylan and Jez, pulling scams on individuals and corporations alike to make a living. Their plans are big - they need a vast sum in order to move from their (ivory) tower to townhouse and hire - in typically unconventional fashion - a secretary to help them organise their income. Kate Beckinsdale's Georgie is far too lovely a PA to allow things to continue between the friends as smoothly as it had and soon they are on the back foot with only the fresh object of their contention to bail them out.<br /><br />Stuart Townsend and Dan Futterman (especially the latter) are good value and engage with the nuttiness of their ruses to the extent that you just go along with it all. I like Beckinsdale in this - acting fresh fair and occasionally feisty is nothing to be ashamed-and-run-off-to-Hollywood about. Perfect for a Bank Holiday weekend. 4/10
