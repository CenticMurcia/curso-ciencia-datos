This movie stars three Academy Award Winners at their best; T. L. Jones is simply perfect but Charlize Theron as well is very inspired and delivers an Oscar quality performance. Susan Sarandon's role is marginal but strong too. Plot is quite original for its suggesting war is terrible and wrong, not only because it is unjustified but because it has a corrupting impact on people, especially when they're back and return (try to..) civilization. Paul Haggis (a genius well known after Academy Award winning "Crash") tries to ask and answer provocative questions and his new film disturbs, heats and moves a lot, every character being powerful.
