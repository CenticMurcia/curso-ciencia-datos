I know Turkish and you missed a lot for not knowing. By understanding what they are speaking, it would be much funnier. I watched this film twice and will watch it again. It is not a comedy but better than most of them. Try to find subtitles for this film or find a Turkish friend!<br /><br />Let me give a summary instead.<br /><br />Two astronauts go through a portal and find themselves in an other planet. The planet is being ruled by emperor and the emperor has an army of monsters and robots. The only think that he needs to get the ultimate power is human brain. (Two of them would be much better :D ) <br /><br />This should be enough I think. The film is simple enough but dialogues make the film even funnier. <br /><br />The important think about this film is; it is a science fiction, fantasy, action film which was made with a low budget. It is also one of the first sci. fi. try for Turkish film industry. It is a brave attempt but like most of them really poor in quality.
