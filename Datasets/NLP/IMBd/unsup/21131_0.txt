Had a chance to see this film at a screening. This is the kind of film that just plain creeps you out,and lingers with you. I can't even tell you how many times I had to look away. It's dark, suspenseful and shocking. The story is very thought provoked (yes you have to use your brain) the ending forces you to ask questions and the acting across the board is solid, especially Conor Duffy and Travis Schuldt, and as far as Savage goes well, he comes across in a way that I have not seen him in years, like he was made for the role. Can't wait to see it on BluRay as it should jump off the screen and make one go screaming even farther into the dark.
