Inconvenient Woman is a fabulous miniseries, based on the book by Dominick Dunne. Dunne took the plot partially from the Alfred Bloomingdale scandal. The movie is hot stuff, starring Rebecca de Mornay as Flo, the waitress who attracts the wealthy Jules, played by Jason Robards. Jules and his wife (Jill Eikenberry) are married in name only. Jules falls for Flo and sets her up in grand style.<br /><br />As the title suggests, Flo becomes inconvenient, particularly after Jules dies suddenly.<br /><br />The film is peppered with slimeballs, and they're all excellent, including Roddy Macdowell, Chad Lowell, Grant Cramer, and Alex Rocco. DeMornay is perfect casting as Flo. Peter Gallagher is the writer on whom it falls to tell Flo's story, and Chelsea Field is his love interest from a high social station.<br /><br />An Inconvenient Woman is entertaining, interesting, and sad. I loved it.
