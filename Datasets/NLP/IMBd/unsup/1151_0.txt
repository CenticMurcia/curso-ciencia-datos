This movie paints a grim picture of a group of people's lives destroyed by violence. I can't say that this movie is a statement on the realities of life because the characters' circumstances are so specific that many would have a hard time relating. Here's a list of the lessons taught in the movie. <br /><br />1. Don't hit a cop, you'll get sent to prison. 2. Don't shine a laser pointer in a cop's face, you'll get sent to prison. 3. Don't stab a security officer in the neck, you'll get sent to prison. 4. Don't push anyone onto the 3rd rail of a subway station. They'll be electrocuted and you'll get sent to prison. 5. Don't try to escape from prison. You will either die trying or get sent back to prison.<br /><br />I'm not really sure what the overall message of this movie is. Elijah does everything right by staying out of trouble, going to school, etc., and yet he still gets the shaft. 3 out of 10 only because I like Q Tip.
