If you have any interest whatsoever in lesbian lives as they really have been and still are lived this is THE documentary to see.<br /><br />No doubt that we have to salute those women who "dared" to show their faces on screen in this documentary; it's not anything we are used to at least not outside the North America.<br /><br />Even though the woman portraited are, of course, living in North America it is still a fabulous documentary, actually quite breathtaking in all its "naturalness".<br /><br />Also spiced with a bit of "filmic erotica" I feel is it a necessity to watch for any lesbian woman.<br /><br />Bravo to those who came up with the idea and bravo for the woman who dared all along!
