This is a very good basketball movie, it is set up very well. Even if you dispise sports, (including me) you will love it. I watched it with my daughter one night. We both liked it, although she has seen it more than I have! It is on quite a bit because it is new, you should try it, you will be surprised how well it turned out!! :)
