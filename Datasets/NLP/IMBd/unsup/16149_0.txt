Seems only fair, given you have to speak his name five times to get him to show up. Which points out one of the flaws of the movie: _why_ do you have to speak his name five times? He shows up so many times in this movie that summoning him is usually the least of your problems.<br /><br />Anyhoo, this movie is thoroughly unlikeable, without a likeable or interesting character in the lot. Basically, CM shows up, kills someone, frames our "heroine" (I use the term loosely, as she basically whines, jumps in startlement a lot, and wanders about in her undies) and disappears until the next time.<br /><br />I could go on at greater length about how bad Tony Todd is (although he does the best he can with what little he is given), or the excrutiating dialogue, but I won't waste my time or yours. Avoid at all costs. There's a good reason this wasn't released in theatres or direct-to-video.
