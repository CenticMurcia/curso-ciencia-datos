I just finished watching this move, twice. I watched the Synapse DVD (absolutely awesome picture quality) and was delighted to see an adult tale, well told. <br /><br />A comment on the Synapse DVD; the subtitles default to 'new' ones which cover up the original ones burned onto the DVD. According to Synapse, the original subtitles were not too good. I watched the movie with the default 'new' subtitles and while the content was good, they cover up a LOT of the movie. Hence the second viewing with the less obtrusive though inaccurate ones. The use of subtitles is actually quite minimal. However, in two scenes, they cover up some shocking footage better viewed with the less intrusive old ones. Enough of the DVD.<br /><br />...........Possible Spoilers..........<br /><br />I just loved this movie. I loved the photography, the extreme behavior, the brilliant acting...everything. The daughter, who I think was played by Meredyth Herold, was incredibly sexy and appeared constantly on the point of orgasm with the slightest provocation pushing her over the edge. What a stunning performance. People have compared this to what you would expect from John Waters etc. however, while I like his movies, nothing comes close to the beauty, acting, photography, atmosphere and sheer stomach turning quality of this work of art. (That goes for the infamous Pink Flamingoes regarding grossness also). I was also concerned that the movie was in Black and White. I shouldn't have been. Aside from making this one of the best photographed movies, ever..it makes the gross stuff even more extreme. And there is a lot of gross stuff; incest, cannibalism, sexual regurgitation, urination, torture, masturbation (with food ... and without), violence etc...and it looks just wonderful. <br /><br />..........Spoilers Over........<br /><br />This movie is for strong stomachs only. Some of the scenes will likely offend 99% of the viewing population. However, this is a movie of great physical beauty and is not to be missed. A pure work of art!! To think I didn't plan to watch this for several weeks after getting the DVD. Thank goodness I changed my mind. If you have a strong constitution, don't miss this movie. VERY highly recommended.
