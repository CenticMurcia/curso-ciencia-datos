As someone who loves blaxploitation movies and modern vampire movies (i.e Lost Boys, Interview with a Vampire, and Underworld ) and paranormal TV shows (i.e. Super Natural, True Blood), I can say this is hands down the worse vampire film I have seen that was made in the past 20 years. It was the kind of movie you watch because it is so bad you can't stop but watching it to see if it gets worse, and you know, it does get worse. I really wonder if the actors knew the movie was as bad as it was while they were making it. The only reason I gave it a 2 out of 10 is because there were a few fine chicks in it and it showed a little booty. Otherwise, this is garbage!
