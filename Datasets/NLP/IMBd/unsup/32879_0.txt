I have always loved going onto this site to check user comments because i find them interesting and helpful. I have many times thought about signing up so I could post comments but never really had the desire. That all changed after I saw feardots**t. This movie is so incredibly bad that i felt obligated to warn others. When i tried to rent this the guy at blockbuster said dont and told me that it was a terrible, terrible movie. Being the idiot that i am, i rented it later from a different blockbuster and lost 2 hours of my life that i will never get back. The movie does not make any sense what so ever. My friends and I were literally on the floor laughing when the mother said that her daughter used to play at the abandoned steel factory. Of course every character in the movie logged onto the website even though they knew damn well it would kill them. Please, if you havent seen this movie and are thinking about renting it please dont. Not even to make fun of it or see how bad it really is.
