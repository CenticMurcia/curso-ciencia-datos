This film worked for me in three different ways. First, the acting was strong, with lots of star quality. Second, the film worked better than most as a murder mystery. But what I most liked about the film was how it dealt with abstract issues as "justice." There were three layers to this portrayal: The first layer of course was the murder itself, and one of the things that makes this interesting is that although we don't know the identity of the killer, we know he is a German general. And then there is the identity of the murder victims, who are prostitutes. This primary tale of murder and justice was played out against the backdrop of World War II, with the time frame of the film including not only the war itself, but the Nuremberg trials and their aftermath. Finally, there is the murder of the holocaust, which also has an explicit portrayal in the film. What most appeals to me about "Night of the Generals" is that it weaves together these three layers of storytelling, without being heavy handed, and letting the actors and their actions speak for themselves. The film is definitely worthwhile.
