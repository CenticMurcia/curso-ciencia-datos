Danika had the potential to be a great movie but it ultimately went no where. There was massive build up and it seemed like there would be a big pay off but then the ending ruined the entire movie.<br /><br />If you ignore the last 20 minutes or so of the movie, the acting was great, the characters had enough depth to draw you in and you will really want to see how it all plays out. Where are these visions coming from? Is Danika psychic? Is someone hurting her daughter or is her daughter hurting herself? Did her son kill the neighbors dog? Why is there such a tension between Danika and her husband if they had supposedly moved past him cheating on her so many years ago? Its that last 20 minutes that destroys it all. You find out everything you just saw was a lie. The kids died long before they got to that age and it was ALL a hallucination of a crazy bag lady.<br /><br />I was really excited to see this film but it stumbled and fell at the very end. Bottom line? Don't waste your time.
