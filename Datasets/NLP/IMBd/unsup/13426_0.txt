True, "Splash" is pretty silly, but it's impossible not to like. The plot of course has unfulfilled clerk Allen Bauer (Tom Hanks) meeting up with a mermaid (Daryl Hannah) who turns his life upside down. Much of the movie's humor derives from Allen's brother Freddie's (John Candy) goof-ball antics - namely when he drops coins and later speaks Swedish - and nerdy scientist Walter Kornbluth's (Eugene Levy) chronic bad luck. Another great scene is when the mermaid identifies her sea name before choosing Madison.<br /><br />All in all, this affirms Ron Howard as a director who always has some ideas. This movie really does make a splash!
