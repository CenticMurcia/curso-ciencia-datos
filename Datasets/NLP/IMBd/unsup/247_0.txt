This film takes you on a pseudo-sexual journey through the eyes and minds of several virile seniors. What you think you are getting at the beginning is not with what you will leave. Kudos goes to the director and his creative staff for approaching this heavily debated topic with such fearless creativity. A quality film should evoke the thought process and possibly release repressed fears and anxieties. The surprise ending should leave the educated viewer questioning his or her own personal views on the plight of the aging in America. If this is a 15 minute journey, I cannot wait to take a full-length journey with this man.
