Admittedly the reason that I first decided to see Ten Inch Hero was for Jensen Ackles (Priestly) who I must say did not disappoint, the young actor has wonderful comedic timing. However, I returned to the Phoenix film festival for a second viewing of the film (with all my friends in tow) for an entirely different reason. The film is incredible and I can honestly say I that I would watch it again and again, a point that everyone who accompanied me to the screening would agree to. In general the acting was superb, Clea DuVall has immense presence as the shy and self-conscious Jen and John Doe is excellent as usual as the quirky Trucker. The story itself is wonderful, simple yet not to the point of boredom as it has several twists and turns that even my best friend who has a knack for ruining all plots reversals for me couldn't guess. I can't wait the see this film in theater or at the very least on DVD and would love so much to be able to have in my possession the soundtrack of this movie. The the soundtrack alone (trust me on this one) is worth seeing the movie for, the original songs by Bethany Joy Galeotti are incredible! All I can say is that I am so glad Jensen Ackles was chosen to play Priestly or I likely would never have seen this film, and that would truly have been a huge shame.
