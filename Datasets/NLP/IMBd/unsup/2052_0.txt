This film is actually much better than you might think - much better than some of the others in this Universal series, like House of Dracula, for example, which features a whole roster of horror characters, but no plot whatsoever. Son of Dracula, on the other hand, does have a fairly reasonable plot, special effects which are excellent for the period, and a very good performance from Lon Chaney Jr. as the Count. Chaney is much better than you might expect, and although obviously not in the same vampiric league as Lugosi, is much more credible than John Caradine, who starred as Dracula in others in this series. At times, you can *almost* forget that Chaney is forever typecast as the Wolfman, and suspend disbelief in his portrayal as the Romanian - but with an American accent - Count. Apart from that, you have here all the ingredients for a psycho-billy treat - steaming Southern swamps, Gothic Southern mansions, creepy fortune tellers, raven haired Gothic beauties, and even hot roadster coupes - yep, all this in a in a Dracula movie. Just a shame that the original Meteors or the Cramps didn't get to play on the soundtrack! So, don't dismiss this as another ragbag filler - it's actually quite entertaining.
