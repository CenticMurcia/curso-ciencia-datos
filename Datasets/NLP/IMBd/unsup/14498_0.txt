Pop Cultured is maybe the worst television show ever made. I am not even exaggerating when I say that it really is possible that this is the worst show that has ever been put on TV. I know that if you went through every show ever made in the world you would probably find some old shows from the 1970s or something made in Croatia with a budget of about five dollars that are maybe even worse but considering the quality of shows we have in North America and the fact there is a real budget, etc, with this show being available in like thirty million homes, then the amount that this show was a total fail really becomes apparent. Those who have seen this show know what I mean. The show hasn't even been on for years, I just signed up for IMDb so I can check out movies etc and yet still here I am, years later, coming to this page, one of the first ten pages I visited after I signed up for this service just to complain about how awful this show was. Worst TV host ever, worst interviews, worst guests, worst sketches, worst on screen talent, worst acting, worst writing, worst directing, worst overall production. It confuses me just trying to figure out how something this bad was even allowed on television in the first place.
