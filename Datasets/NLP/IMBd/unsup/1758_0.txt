Final Fantasy 8 is a superb game. This isn't a where you can just shoot 'em up, blast 'em down and be done with it. This is a deeply involved game with a nice plot that you mustn't view as a movie. Picture it instead as a novel, a novel that you have to sit down, appreciate the plot and the characters as you watch the plot develop over its grand four-disc length.<br /><br />I'm not going into the plot, as you can just read the quotes above to get your details there. I will say it has an amazing soundtrack and great graphics, and some nice dialog as well.<br /><br />If you balk at the fact that it becomes a little unbelievable at times...remember that FAN-tasy equals FUN-tasy and then be on your way.<br /><br />Oh, and if you can, get it for PlayStation, not PC.
