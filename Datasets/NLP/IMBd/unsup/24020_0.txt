What a waste of time! With a cast like Stallone, John C. McGinley, Alan Cumming and Michael Caine, it seemed a shoe-in to be a great movie. Instead, it's slow and pretentious, while at the same time directed as if it were Charlies Angels or The Matrix, with clip-and-snip editing and messy camera work. Everything about this movie is garbage. In fact, I have wasted enough time watching, I shall not waste anymore writing about it.
