First off, I am a big fan of Brian Yuzna's work, as well as frequent partner Stuart Gordon. I felt this film, was way better then Rottweiler, or Faust, which suffered greatly from a miscast lead. I'll get the negative stuff out of the way first. There were a couple underwater shots, that didn't quite measure up to the rest of the film, and being that the actors had different nationalities, some of the performances came off as uneven, due to the language barrier. Most of this was shot in English from what I could tell, although the boys' in the opening sequence may have been dubbed. Now on to the overwhelming majority, which was good. The villain was creepy, and the actor gave a spectacular performance. The story was fascinating, and the sets, and makeup effects were the stuff of horror classics. There was a time, after the excellent opening, that I was leaning more towards putting this film in the interesting, but deeply flawed category Rottweiler and Faust are in, but ultimately for me the good far outweighed the bad. The bizarre finale, really reminded me of Yuzna's work in the unheralded classic Society. My advice, stick with it, it's not quite a great film, but it's a very good one.
