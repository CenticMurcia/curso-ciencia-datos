Naturally, everyone has different tastes, and some people do like the movie - but in my opinion it was just another pointless movie about a bunch of bank robbers. I assume many people will watch it just to see Lynda Carter topless, but in today's world where porn sites pop up on computers all the time even when they are not wanted, there is no novelty in seeing a topless woman in a love scene - except that it's a celebrity and people are into that. A previous user (Ron) posted a message that the two topless scenes were really just the same film clip edited twice into the movie in two different scenes. However, he was mistaken. There were two very similar love scenes - in both scenes, they are making love on the same blanket, and in roughly the same positions and camera angles. It is almost like watching the same scene twice. But they did film it twice, and not a single frame was duplicated in both scenes.
