This movie is kind of disappointing. First, Rosie O'Donnel is in it. Second, Dennis Leary isn't funny when he keeps his comedy clean. However, there is one aspect that completely saved this film for me; the extras. The extras in this film are among the best I have ever seen in a movie hands down. One extra in particular is incredible. His name is Sean Judge. Although he is uncredited, his performance rivals that of Marlon Brando's in "The Godfather". He is consistently on cue and never misses a beat. Professionals everywhere could learn a lot from the work of Mr. Judge. "Wide Awake" will not go down in history as one of the greatest films of all time, but I will never forget the powerful performance of Sean Judge, the greatest extra of all time.
