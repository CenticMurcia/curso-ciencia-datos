i think this is the worst of Meg Ryan's movies, i'm really a big fan of her, she's one of the most gorgeous actress in Cinema, and she'll always be the queen of romantic comedy, and i liked most of her choices in the past, even the not so-good movies of her , she was able to make them worthy watching, but this film is just bad in every possible way?!<br /><br />it's boring, not funny, flat and predictable . nothing in this movie is interesting nor original, it's not comedy, not romantic, not thriller and not action. i've never felt uninterested of completing watching a movie that Meg Ryan appears in before.<br /><br />if you are Meg Ryan fans then i recommend to avoid this movie. if your not, then avoid this movie as well.
