I've only just got around to watching this film - 3 years after its release but it was worth the wait.<br /><br />I wasn't too sure what to expect. I'd heard good things about the film but it seemed that it was a little bit of a horror genre clich√©. So I was ready to give up before it was halfway through. Im glad I didn't.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the genre then you wont be expecting Oscar nominated performances from the cast or a script that will stand the passage of decades. That said, the performances are all above par and the the script is quite clever and amusing in places.<br /><br />If you're like me than you really need to relate to the main protagonists or there has to be a 'hook' which piques your curiosity. The first 10 minutes where you are literally 'introduced' to the main characters is a fantastic hook and I knew then that I was going to enjoy the film.<br /><br />The film starts well and it doesn't let up for almost an hour and a half. You really do have not a clue whether any or all of the characters are going to get out alive. And yes there are several stereotypes on show but that clever script I mentioned earlier throws up surprise after surprise. Just when you're thinking 'I know whats going to happen now ....' it doesn't.<br /><br />For those that like their blood - there is plenty of it! And although its a little OTT in places it never quite gets too silly.<br /><br />All in all its well worth catching and is a welcome addition to the genre.<br /><br />8 out of 10
