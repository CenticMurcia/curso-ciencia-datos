... This movie is made for people who use their brains, and is seeking some answers to the world main questions.If you are wild about action, guns, sf or horror i assure you that you won't find these elements in it but instead it is a great psychological trip in a personal view.And I could say that the movie is more than a personal introspection into the character's body, is made to satisfy all categories of ages and is trying to measure what is worthing to do in life.It is a great gift that has been given by a great mind, Sergiu Nicolaescu. Take it as it is and please have at least a little more respect for someone who sacrificed his life on cinematography's altar. Thank you for reading this, Mihnea
