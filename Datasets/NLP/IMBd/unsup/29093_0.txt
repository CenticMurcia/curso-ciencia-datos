In a world were to be scared, pint loads of gore is shown. This film is different it is obvious that not that much money has been spent on it, yet it still manages to truly scare(for many days). a great film based on true things to get your pulse going even more.The film about a fire demon which a group of friends have unleashed back onto the world through the help of a weejie board, the film could have gone the same way as so many others films have gone but it didn't it kept it individuality as well as help retain many jaw clenching classics. A film that i would recommend to anyone. It has to be one of the most under estimated films for a long while.
