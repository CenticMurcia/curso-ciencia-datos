I've had a chance to see Drivers Wanted a couple times in the past few years. Each time I'm struck by its natural warmth.<br /><br />Ordinarily, "warmth" means that the actors, director, and crew have done their job to create a theatrical experience that simulates "emotional warmth." In this case, however, it feels much more genuine.<br /><br />It's the warmth you feel when you get a gift from your best friend that says they really know you as opposed to the "warmth" of getting exactly what you asked for on your Christmas list.<br /><br />But it's this warmth that's much harder to analyze because it is not carefully calculated.<br /><br />In addition, Drivers Wanted ends up feeling complete but not perfect. It's someone's creation that they completed as far as it needed to be.<br /><br />They didn't hire a crew to come in and apply a dozen coats of paint and polish it to a glass-like shine -- while that result is appealing and good, there is also merit in an artwork that is deemed "finished" by the artist but for which the audience knows it could be done differently.<br /><br />Having met the director on several occasions, let me add that this film is a reflection of his personality. And it's probably that which gives it its warm feel most of all.
