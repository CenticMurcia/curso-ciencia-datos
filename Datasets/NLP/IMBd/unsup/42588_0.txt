What is this movie about? Granted, I couldn't even finish it, I had seen enough! I have to tell you, it takes allot for me to not finish a movie, i even sat through In the woods, trying to make the best out of it, atleast you could laugh at the bad acting and terrible effects. This had a combined crapeyness of bad acting, bad story, bad effects, and bad direction. I am glad I had a free rental that I used on this or I would be really mad. The name of the film company who put this piece of garbage out is called Brain Damage films, and after you see this, thats exactly what you will have. These are the times I wish there was some number less the one you could pick for your vote. I enjoy a B-movie, don't get me wrong. Sometimes the budget is mot there but the story is still good and entertaining. I am not slamming it because of the camcorder back yard feel it gives off. It just sucks.
