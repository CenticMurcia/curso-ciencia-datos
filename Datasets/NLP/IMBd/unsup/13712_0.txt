Wow, what a great work of cinema. "In the Company of Men" will definitely go on my list of the best films of the 90's. This film tells us so much about power differences and manipulation in corporate America. On the surface, many people see the film as a misogynist tale of two men who want to emotionally abuse a vulnerable woman for the pure enjoyment of it. But the film digs much deeper than that. It is more about manipulation in general. Chad is symbolic of this manipulation. His real motives seem to be to manipulate people just because he can. I mean he gets Howard, a weaker man to go along with his ruthless scheme even though it is quite obvious that he really doesn't want to. Overall the film illustrates the lengths that some people will go and use their power to get ahead by feeding on the vulnerability of the weak.
