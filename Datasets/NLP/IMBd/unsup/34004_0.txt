O.K., I'm going to admit. I rented this movie looking for scares. But I will admit it was a good drama. But mostly I got bored. When I thought there was a scary scene coming, and there was nothing, I was like "huh?". A lot of confusing scenes. I think they should of left the original scene with Father Merrin being found dead in the Exorcist, and left it up to the audience what happened. Unless they're brain dead. I was curious why they didn't have some other of the original actors in this. Besides Linda Blair. I mean the first movie made a big success. My theory is that when they read the script they couldn't help but fall asleep. I'm sorry, but a sequel to one of the most shocking movie of all time, is supposed to have some kind of scare.<br /><br />2/10
