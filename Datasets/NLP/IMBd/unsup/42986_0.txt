It really sounds stupid, I mean, you buy the trade rights, you know it's been the greatest "telenovela" hit of all times, it's coming out fine  and then, "if it's not broken why fix it?" Good thing about this remake Jaime Camil and Angelica Vale (leading roles) are great, every thing else stinks. And if it wasn't bad enough that TELEVISA made "infomercials" and lousy political statements fit in to the show, now ¡¡¡¡¡¡¡THEY CHANGE THE STORY!!!!!!!! What made the original story be world wide phenomena is that it's flawlessly written, in this "ugly" remake they squeeze in a cute faced actor just to force the story to go on further, and yes of course, make some more $$$$$ while it lasts, doesn't matter if it comes down as out of character and totally unbelievable. How can dumb get dumber? I totally agree with the other comment, SHAME ON YOU TELEVISA.
