This is one of my personal favorites not just because it has a truly awesome car,The Tubo Interseptor,but it also has a cool almost Western like plot.The story starts with a bizarre spirit forming in the middle of a vacant Arizona road,he apparantly comes from outter space,along with his super-flashy car.This spirit or Wraith as he is referred to in the title is actually the avenging spirit of a murdered local kid back to take on the gang who killed him and that has been terrorizing the roads of Arizona.Charlie Sheen plays the Wraith and Sheryle Fenn plays his girl-friend who is being practically held captive by the leader of the same motor gang that killed Sheen's characterfrom the beginning.Naturally,The Wraith,or Jake as he is called when in human form,takes on these motor thugs one-on-one in some very cool and dizzying death races.In my humble opinion,the best part of this film is the soundtrack.With awesome hard rock from Ozzy,Billy Idol,Robert Palmer,Lion,Honey-moon suite and my personal fav Motley Crue. This film is really like High Planes Drifter meets The Road Warrior,being it combines classic revenge western with action road rage films.My only complaint is that the dialouge could have been much deeper and more serious but then again,this was never meant to be Shakespeare.Randy Quaide needed more screen time as well.All in all ,however,this one is 100 times better than any of those bloated,computer created dumb kiddy rides like Fast and The Furious or Tourque.This is a real road rage film. 4 out of 5 stars.
