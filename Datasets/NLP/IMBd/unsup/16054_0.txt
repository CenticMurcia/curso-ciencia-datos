When watching this film, Sex and the Teenage Mind, one must ask themselves this question. Is Sex and the Teenage Mind a great film or the greatest film? It is truly one of the great tragedies of the 21st century that this amazing masterpiece was overseen for the Academy Awards. Never in all my years of viewing cinema has such a tremendous film been brought before me. It portrays the life of a young boy, Virgyl and his struggle with puberty, hormones, and even worse..............girls!!! Virgyls very sexually active parents suggest that he tries to find a girlfriend and become more sexually experienced. Virgyl is also helped out by his good buddy, the great film actor Michael Bower, and is taught how to sweet talk the ladies, master the difficult art of putting a condom on, and what are the best magazines to 'jack off to'. Virgyl then finds the girl of his dreams and stands up for her in their US History class. But oh no Virgyl, watch out. The girl of your dream's girlfriend, Scott, is a real jock jerk. But oh no, what's this? To repay Virgyl, Kelly hires a hooker to have sex with him. An all too common plot scenerio. This movie has laughs, love and most of all a great soundtrack. From the impersonations of the bee gees to the girl band cover of 'Doctor Doctor'. This movie has it all. A must see for any horny boy that wants to see a movie with one scene of a naked lady or a boy that has rapist thoughts when they look at a girl. This movie was definitely 90 sweet minutes in hump city
