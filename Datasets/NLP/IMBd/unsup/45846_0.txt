Let's just hope he stays Missing in Action along with this movie. If you're going to watch this movie get ready to say to yourself, "What a big copy off Rambo". This movie tries to make Chuck Norris seem like a state of the art stealth soldier. I mean how hidden can you be when your camoflaged in black and your hiding against a white building. Let's not forget to mention how this movie views people from Vietnam. You can tell that the script writer must have some hatred towards them. Another major factor was the amount of unnecessary nudity within this movie. One meet Chuck is talking to a guy, the next you see some man bring a naked women on top of the table. If you are under the age of 18, you should not watch this movie. Heck, if your under the age of 99 you should not watch this movie.
