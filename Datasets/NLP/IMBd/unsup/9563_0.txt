Jackie Cooper was the top child actor at MGM in the early 30s when it was the top studio. He started off as part of "Our Gang" but just a year later was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance in "Skippy" (he just lost out to Lionel Barrymore in "A Free Soul"). L. B. Mayer called him "a wonderful kid" and teamed him and Wallace Beery in the emotional and heart wrenching film "The Champ". It has the most tear drenching finale of any film I have ever seen and Jackie Cooper gives an outstanding performance as Dink, the little boy who has an unswerving faith in his hopelessly alcoholic father. The sets have a very gritty and real look - not at all what you would expect from MGM "the dream factory".<br /><br />Little Dink lives with his dad, a washed up fighter who can't stay off the booze. His managers try to talk him up to some promoters, promising that he is the same fighter he always was - Dink's job is to sober him up but unfortunately it doesn't work. Andy "The Champ" has always promised Dink a race horse and when his luck changes, he buys "Lil' Champ" - an old and beat up horse that they train up for a race. The day of the race Dink meets his mother (he or she doesn't realise it), Linda, who has the horse "Blue Boy" next to "Lil' Champ" in the stables. Dink introduces her to his little mate - "he's coloured" he says, "yes, but he's kind of a pretty colour" she replies. (It was interesting that you didn't see her shake hands with the little boy, their hands were out of the camera range).<br /><br />When "Lil' Champ" loses the race, Linda (Irene Rich)realises who Dink is and wants to give him everything that he has missed out on. (Even though Linda seems lovely - her character is portrayed as once having been a gold-digger who only married Andy when he was rich and famous and left him for a more prosperous gentleman when he was down on his luck).<br /><br />Andy is then paid $100 to let Dink visit his mother - while there he sings a few bars of a popular song (Ruth Ettings' "Don't Tell Him What Happened to Me"), meets his step-sister Mary Lou (adorable Marcia Mae Jones) a little cutie who talks to Dink about the reality of fairy tales. After his visit Linda is determined to take Dink away from the unwholesome life he is leading with his dad. Dink and Andy have a magical relationship but after a heartfelt scene Andy convinces Dink to live with his mother, but with Dink away, he loses the will to go on.<br /><br />The ending is the most emotional ever and Jackie Cooper was a genuine star. There will not be a dry eye by the film's end. In an interview, I heard Jackie Cooper say he did not get on with Wallace Beery. They made a few pictures together and were considered a team, adored by the public. Cooper said whenever people stopped him in the street to ask what Beery was really like, he had to lie and say what a wonderful guy he was - he couldn't tell them the truth and spoil their illusion. The previous reviewer was right - Beery was not well liked.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.
