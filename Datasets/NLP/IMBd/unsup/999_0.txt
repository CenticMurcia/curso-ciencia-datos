At the beginning we can see members of Troma team company and Uwe Boll says " This is bad, it's a big s***, don't watch it, don't even think about it, stay away from this movie", now we are warn...<br /><br />But they are wrong, the film is brilliant. OK it have a lot bad things like : no budget (of course), no good acting, no fancy FX, no good location, no good editing, no good sound.....etc In fact, in all technical aspect, the film is bad, but that's not a surprise. But when you watch Zombiegeddon a lot of this disappear or make the film pretty funny. And that's the power of this movie, the film is fun, good fun. Because it's not an annoying and boring movie, no that's more a good horror/comedy, between "shawn of the dead" and "an Ed Wood movie". And that's really enjoying to see a movie like that make you smile at least 75% of the time. The movie is really cool. Great Troma movie !
