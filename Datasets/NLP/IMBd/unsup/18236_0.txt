I loved Battlestar Galactica when I was a kid. I never saw the series, but the two movies were really nice work.<br /><br />And today, I still love those two movies, but can understand the bad reputation the series gained.<br /><br />But I love the scenario (it is so wonderfully hopeless: The last remnants of a human civilisation are fleeing the overwhelmingly evil Cylon empire). It has some very strong moments, for example when the treason of the Cylons is discovered too late to save the human colonies and fleet. This was a bold and different approach. Or when Apollo's brother is shot down and killed just seconds before reaching the safe haven Galactica.<br /><br />I love the spaceships. The model kits are really wonderful, especially the Battlestar design.<br /><br />And I also love the characters. Starbuck impersonates everything a boy wants to be (he's so damn cool), and I still go by the codename Starbuck today, though (or maybe because) I am totally different. Lorne Greene as Adama is the archetype of the wise leader, and the girls might seem very 70s to us today, but they certainly worked back then :-)<br /><br />All in all, I think that Battlestar Galactica, at least the movie, deserves some better praise than that you usually hear. Even though the battle sequences are always the same (they always get the Cylon in the middle, njahahaha)...<br /><br />And yes, I hate the kid and the robot-dog as well.
