After the opening credits , I had some hope - it looked SO bad that I thought it might be funny. Absolutely the worst , most cheaply produced film I have ever seen which tried to pass itself off as a serious movie , as opposed to the toxic avenger series, killer tomatoes , et al -though possibly rivaled by The Texas Chainsaw Massacre II. Much better than the film is Sam's review in the At-A-Glance Film Reviews - a must see.
