I thought the film was very good. I like the symmetry of it in it's treatment of the sexes and in its layout. Many, many parallels run through all the relationships. The one big problem with it is that one of the major parallels,the Don's development of "platonic love" and the "fall" of the heroine are not really justified in my eyes, more development would have been nice but as it is it is a very long movie(although the length seemed appropriate). Why does she do what she does except to advance the plot? That is she neither a man that age changes as such without some prior history nor a girl presented as she is at first presented does what she then does. Those that do what she does have a much darker past then we are lead to believe.
