I turned on HBO last night and this movie was on. For some reason, I kept watching long after the movie got ridiculous. So many stereotypes of white people being racist came out that even I was offended. 150 white people at a party and the one black guy is the one who gets arrested? With no search for evidence? Some cops might be racist, but that would be suicide to handle it the way they did. And of course, every white guy in the movie, except for the leads, is a hillbilly racist (as everyone knows we all are) The only thing that surprised me about this movie was that the guy in the jail cell didn't rape Flip. Of course, that might have made the movie more enjoyable, much like when Flip gets beat up. If you're a minority who wants to believe everything is about race, then watch it and continue to hate, but for the rational people, watch the paint dry...you'll be much more concerned about the fate of the paint than with the fate of Flip.
