<br /><br />****SPOILERS*****<br /><br />Long awaited in some circles, this adaptation of Quinn and Vigil's graphic novel is bound to disappoint all but the most die-hard fans of the source material. No doubt Brain Yuzna was the correct choice for this material given his taste for sex and violence, and this could have been a flashy showcase for his new Spanish production company as it looks fantastic (care of A Nightmare on Elm Street cinematographer, Jaques Haitkin) and has has some good FX, but the film goes down in flames fast because of Quinn's convoluted script that throws in everything but the kitchen sink but refuses to define its characters or tell a coherent story. John Jaspers (the ever-mugging Mark Frost) is given a second chance at life by the demonic M (Andrew Divoff- who should be doing better movies) as a razor-clawed assassin. After wiping out a crowd of diplomats (was this ever explained?) he's arrested by a tough cop (perennial Yuzna star, Jeff Colmbs, who couldn't even Re-animate this movie) and interrogated by a sexy shrink who wants to understand him. Of course, M won't let Jaspers out of his Satanic contract, and ultra-violent hilarity ensues, sprinkled with kinky sex and bad one liners. Fast paced and never dull but quite dumb, a frustrating miss. <br /><br />CS
