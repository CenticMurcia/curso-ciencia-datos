What's with the idiots (who obviously aren't fans of old escapist entertainments anyway) who hate the 'Hammer House Of Horror'? The series is GREAT. It's a tragedy/travesty a second series wasn't commissioned. It may not be perfect, but where else are you going to find so much stylish entertainment packed into 13 episodes? (although Hammers 1960's 17 episode series 'Journey to the unknown' was another superior show - shame that was cancelled early). The 'Hammer House Of Mystery And Suspense', which followed some years after, suffered from demands for less horror and a longer running time from U.S. TV apparently! I've read that the region 2 'HHOH' looks like new because it's been remastered - unlike the region 1 release.
