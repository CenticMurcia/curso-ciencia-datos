Just viewed the DVDs. If ever one wants to see a series that makes one feel good at the end, hire these.<br /><br />I wish I could own the series.<br /><br />Catherine Zita Jones is absolutely one of the most beautiful British actresses out of UK, and also a good actress also.<br /><br />I loved the context of the series. And Pop and Mum were great, never got married etc., and Mum a little heavy after giving birth to what 'seven kids' was a great cook etc.<br /><br />I challenge anyone who watches this series not to feel hungry watching them all enjoy eating, even if they have to kill the goose etc. <br /><br />A great British produced series, wish there were more!
