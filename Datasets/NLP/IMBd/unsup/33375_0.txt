Holy cow...what that guy "AussieStud" from Providence said...really, REALLY awful. It's shot on video, it looks cheap, the acting is terrible...nothing to recommend this movie at all. Get some porn and be done with it...seriously, both the acting and the production values will be far superior to this dreck. I simply cannot say how rotten this movie is. I tried to find one performance that wasn't painful, but failed. <br /><br />The actor who plays the lead is hot. The "hustler" is really not attractive enough to be worth all the trouble he causes. A bad, bad movie, proving that gay men need to demand a little bit (well, a lot) more quality from their artists. <br /><br />Did I mention it was awful?
