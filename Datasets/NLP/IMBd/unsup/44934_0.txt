I've been a little curious to see this one for a long time, and after finally getting to see it.... it's one of the most puzzling movies I've seen.<br /><br />The dialogue is nearly incomprehensible. In watching material like Shaun of the Dead, I usually get used to accents after a short time, but with this one, it started reasonably understandable, but by around halfway through it, I started having a very hard time.<br /><br />Far too much time is spent setting the scenario up. Once the girl dies, the movie feels like it should be over. The drama that ensues feels absurd to me. I can understand that some people are able to take control of others pretty effectively, but the lack of opposition seems to be unbelievable.<br /><br />People start making decisions that don't make much sense. I think that the girls would have both realized that they shouldn't light a signal flare if they don't want the people nearby to notice.<br /><br />The deaths get stranger as the movie progresses. One guy dies by a knife, and that's handled well. Then someone dies by having a flare fired into his chest, then it ignites him on fire? Then someone dies by some tool - it resembled a weed wacker, but I'm not sure what it was. That one seemed particularly strange, but made all the more strange by how the killer had no motivation to kill.<br /><br />The movie is otherwise competently made. The poor lighting out on a boat in the middle of the night is understandable. I can't evaluate the script since it was impossible to understand.<br /><br />With some editing and general re-shaping of the story, the movie could be a nice teen thriller. But as it stands, it's not much more than a curiosity.
