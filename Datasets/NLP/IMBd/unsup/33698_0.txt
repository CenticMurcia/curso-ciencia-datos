There should be no wonder that the majority of the comments approving of this monstrosity are female. This show is a female's dream: to be cute, single, no kids and to have 4-5 decent looking successful, charismatic guys just hover around her, make her the center of attention, but none ever hit on her. EVER. OH-but they're totally hetero. Sure, that's realistic. When in the history of Earth has that EVER taken place? Not to mention introducing alcohol? But she never gets fired at by any of her "boys". It's all totally platonic, they don't introduce any other females that would threaten all this attention she gets, but she just maneuvers in this bastion of testosterone and there are no awkward moments, no lude comments, nothing. Puh-leeze. This is an abomination to all sitcoms and television as a whole. This show couldn't be further from reality if they had the "boys" become bionic cyborgs with the powers on invisibility that can bend space time and had flesh eating incest's that fly out of their mouths, in fact that would be more entertaining because you wouldn't need such a huge suspension of disbelief. This show sucks to holy hell. Once again, this is a woman's fantasy played out on TBS, it's so jacked up and far from the truth, that's the only comical value. It would be fine if they weren't trying to pass this off as 'realistic'. Make a mockery out of male/female relationships like When Harry Met Sally, but don't give me this fantasy-land and insult my intelligence.
