Is this movie awful? Revolting? Noxious? No. But given how charming and well written the precursor was, there is no real excuse for this wretched venture into sequeldom. The only thing this film has going for it is a nice performance by Luke Mably, who doesn't seem to realize that he has wandered into a piece of utter rubbish. He stays the course he set in the original, and for that he deserves considerable credit. We have here virtually no one else on board from the original. Perhaps Mably was under contractual obligation for the sequel, maybe he just needed the money, who knows. But this is a movie to stay away from. My wife, who would ordinarily be such a movie's target audience, couldn't abide this steaming heap. A preposterous script that manages to instill boredom and distraction in viewers, caricature milquetoast villains, a predictable happy ending-- there is literally no there there in this movie. It's honestly not even worth renting on DVD, much less seeing in a theater. Better to chase down the first episode, or The Princess Diaries or even The Princess Bride if you're feeling the need for a dash of royalty in your life. Honestly, this movie is rotten on so many levels that there's not space enough to do justice to how bad it is. A Royal disappointment, indeed.
