<br /><br />I saw this film a long time ago, just when it was new (1982) and was blown away by the very talented (and hyperkinetic) Mr. Keaton. Also notable are Henry Winkler in a most restrained and touching way. A welcome surprise is Shelley Long (For the record: I am NOT her fan) as a prostitute with a heart of gold. A small, early gem from the Ron Howard-Ganz-Mandel, with personal touches, to wit: The line when `Belinda' (Shelley Long) tells `Chuck' (Henry Winkler) just after they made love that `she is not wearing her watch' to tell him that she loves him is just beautiful, a nicely semi-polished little gem that I think most people can appreciate and enjoy.<br /><br />Trivia: Clint Howard in a small role (His brother, Ron always gives him work.)<br /><br />Trivia: In the closing credits Rod Stewart sings a beautiful version of `That's what friends are for' that would later be made popular by Dionne Warwick..<br /><br />
