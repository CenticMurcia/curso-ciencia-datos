Dark, somber thriller about an art restorer Adrienne (Goldie Hawn) meeting Jack Saunders (John Heard) and falling in love. They marry, have a kid and are happy--until 6 years (or so) into the marriage he's suddenly killed. Slowly Adrienne discovers her husband wasn't who she thought he was...<br /><br />Sort of a film noir. Hawn decided to take a chance on a dramatic role. Unfortunately this film fizzled at the box office and Hawn herself later said she made a mistake. I actually like the film. I liked it in 1991 and I still like it now 15 years later. It's got an intricate plot and some very nice directorial touches (some of the scenes were beautiful). Love their apartment too. There was also a very unusual but effective music score and a few nice jolts in the movie too.<br /><br />The acting varies. Heard is VERY good is his role. Unfortunately Hawn isn't in hers. She's somber, quiet and too restrained. She seems very uncomfortable in the role. She doesn't ruin the movie but she lessens the impact--maybe it's a good thing that she never tried this again. Also I noticed quite a few plot loopholes left dangling after the movie was over. Still I found this engrossing and well-made. Worth catching. I give it an 8.
