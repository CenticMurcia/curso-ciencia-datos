You've Been Framed was one of those programmes that as a kid I found hilarious, but it doesn't appeal to me now.<br /><br />It is about people doing stupid things, being caught on camera and if it gets on telly, they get Â£200.<br /><br />Jeremy Beadle hosted it for the first 7 years, Beadle is a very funny man. Then Lisa Riley from Emmerdale did it for 5 years, then Jonathan Wilkes did it for a year, now Harry Hill does it, who I don't find paticulaly funny. It is just the same thing happening in every show. When I was young, I thought someone falling off a bike was hysterical, but not anymore.
