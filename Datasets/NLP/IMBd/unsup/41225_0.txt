This film is rubbish. Lazy, join the dots 'storytelling'. It purports to be about Ireland but unless you believe that Darby O'Gill lives with the little people there is no credibility whatsoever; could have been made 50 years ago and even then would have been crap.<br /><br />There is no attempt to address Ireland in the noughties, the Celtic Tiger, the boom, the me culture, immigration or whatever. Just another Oirish pastiche for some gullible Americans - who must be sick of this rubbish as well.<br /><br />How this film got made mystifies me but perhaps therein lies a more interesting story.<br /><br />I'm from Cork so no 'anti Cork' bias stuff please..This movie is the worst tripe I've seen in years and makes me embarrassed to be Irish and a Corkonian.<br /><br />Avoid, avoid, avoid.
