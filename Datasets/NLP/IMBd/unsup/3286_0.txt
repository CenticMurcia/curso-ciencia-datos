An American friend of mine to me to watch this movie. This movie is awful. This is very offensive to me especially you're showing it to a foreign country. I go home to the Philippines once/2 years and this is a misrepresentation of the Philippines. People who have not been to the Philippines might think that the WHOLE of the Philippines is like this and IT IS NOT. Of course, I do believe that some of the things in the movie is true but it is like showing to the world South Central as the representation of USA. All countries have an ugly side but to say it in the movie that this is the Philippines...THAT IS JUST SO WRONG. I was very hurt when I read some of the comments especially the one that says "Remind me again NEVBR to visit the Philippines" by Scott Weinberg. I am a Filipino and proud to be one but after watching a movie like this I felt so little. I WAS VERY OFFENDED.
