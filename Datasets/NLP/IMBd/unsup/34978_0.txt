Balls of Fury was a poor excuse for a movie. It was not anything near what it was hyped up to be. Character development was crude to say the least, I have no idea where half of the characters came from. The relationship between Randy and Mahogany materialized out of no where, one minute they barely knew each other and the next they're kissing on a river, and Randy has a gun? (I don't have anything against guns-just very random). I felt like this was a Dodgeball rip-off; there was the handicapped trainer, fat and lazy rags to riches character(s), fighting for something barely obtainable, and the gung-ho girl ready to do it all (play dodgeball or pingpong), and some sort of try out where the team/person lost when it appeared to be a sure win. At least Dodgeball had a well written story.<br /><br />In short, the character development sucked, as did the plot and overall development-everything could have been SO much more planned out. I would have liked to see more of the training, and more pingpong battles-there was hardly any pingpong for a movie that was ABOUT pingpong. More of the relationship between Randy and Mahogany-a date or something, please? Who are half these people, and where did they come from?! <br /><br />I want $9.00 and 1.5 hours of my life back, please.<br /><br />--John
