"Drive-In Massacre" tells the story of a serial killer who walks around a drive-in at night with a long sword killing teenagers. Sounds like a typical slasher flick, right? Wrong. The violence is not plentiful, but spread out through the movie between cheesy dialogue and horrible acting. This film is just so boring, I cannot believe I sat through the whole thing!! And it's only 74 minutes!! None of the characters in this film are likable, and you really can't wait for them to die. However, there are several entertaining scenes, such as one of the chubby male police officers dressing as a woman to disguise himself during a stake out! The script is just horrible and so is the picture and sound quality of the movie. There are also at least three scenes that last for five minutes that is nothing but a guy driving around a parking lot looking for a place to park!! Please, stay away from this one!!<br /><br />R for Violence and Brief Nudity
