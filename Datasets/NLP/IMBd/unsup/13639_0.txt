Although a little heavy handed at times with the central theme, "Drop Squad" is an excellent movie. The characters are developed in a way that uses stereotypes to highlight major issues in the black community with identity and the moral responsibility of its members. It is a well directed film and well worth watching.<br /><br />My only strong criticism of this film is that it requires an active viewer. It is doing a lot and sends a lot of messages. Minor characters are not explained more than brief sound bites and quick flashes on the screen. You have to make an effort to keep up and if you don't pay attention to the details you are going to get lost. I wish the director had spent a little more time developing these characters, especially since it is clear that they are meant to represent elements of the community he means to and does criticize. If the characters were important enough to recap at the end, then they were important enough to explain in the first place.
