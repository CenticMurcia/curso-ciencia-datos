I have watched this film over and over again, it makes my whole family laugh everytime. You have to know something of the way the Parisians live and be able to understand French pretty well to 'get' most of the jokes. The Americans tried to make a copy - Jungle to Jungle' and like so many other copies of French films it was terrible.<br /><br />Learn French - watch this movie - Laugh loudly.
