This film shows the enormous struggle that the suffrage movement faced and the amazing dedication that women such as Alice Paul and Lucy Burns used to finally win women the right to vote.<br /><br />The movie features tremendous performances by Hillary Swank and Julia Ormond, as well as many others. A modern soundtrack and editing style make the film feel less like a far-removed historical piece and more like an inspirational story that mirrors the work of activists dedicated to their causes in any time period. As a volunteer with Rock the Vote I owe the women depicted in this film, as well as everyone involved in making the movie, a great debt.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
