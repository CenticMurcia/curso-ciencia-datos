Donald Duck is out by himself, skating on his pond having a good time when his three little kids come racing out onto the surface, ready to play hockey. Donald is arrogant and tells the kids they know nothing about the game, they he will have to show them. He takes them on: one and against three, and kills them. He hams it up so bad it's embarrassing - the ultimate showoff. He rubs it in afterward, too. The kids are not happy. Donald then offers to play the kids again, this time blindfolded. <br /><br />That turns out to be a mistake as they beat him around like a hockey puck. <br /><br />This animated short is really for little kids, and no one else. The humor might make them laugh a lot but I doubt older kids and adults wound find much funny. I know I didn't.
