Like everyone else my age, I read "Dennis The Menace" comic strips and comic books when I was a kid. He and his dog and neighbors all provided laughs. With a cast that included Walter Matthau, Christopher Lloyd, Joan Plowright and Lea Thompson, I was sure this would provide laughs for me now as an adult, as well. <br /><br />Wrong.<br /><br />This was NOT funny, just one stupid gag after another. There was no real story line and most of the characters were annoying, not humorous. No wonder this was another disappointing "bomb" at the box office.<br /><br />Not everything is bad. Matthau is "Mr. Wilson" true to form. He looks and acts like you figure he would out of the comic strip. Dennis' parents pretty much do the same and some of the stuff is fairly funny.<br /><br />But there are some big-time disquieting aspects of this movie. "Dennis" is not the innocent- but-mischievous kid of the comics, but a mean-spirited, sadistic kid in here. Did I really hear Matthau utter "GD" three times without making it sound like it was blasphemous? Oh, how clever these Hollywood folks are in their clueless idea of "family fare." Speaking of that, what was the purpose of the sleazy character "Switchblade Sam?" In this age of child molestation and worse, this kind of character is funny? A guy hanging around schoolyards making threats is funny? No, not really.<br /><br />Once again - clueless Hollywood. What Dennis does to him is not funny, either - it's over-the-line. You would be appalled if your kid acted like this. This is far cry from the intention of comic book writer. It is typical of the sick screen writers of today.<br /><br />If you think I'm over-reacting, check Roger Ebert's review of this movie. I don't agree with him on many films but he was extremely offended by that character, too, and thought it had no legitimate reason for being in this movie. Good for him. <br /><br />This should be a "G" rated movie. It's "Dennis The Menace," for cryin' out loud, so why the PG attitude?
