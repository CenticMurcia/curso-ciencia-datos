This movie starts off with a woman running naked in a field and being targeted by a crazed hunter and is then shot dead. This, along with the movies title sums up what you're in store for. The idea of this film has been delved into on television on Gilligan's Island and in the movies many times already. The premise is nothing new, but at least this one delivers in the nudity department and should keep horny late night viewers very very happy. I've waited for a good movie like this to come along and this one delivers in at least letting the viewer escape into the twisted fantasy of hunting humans.<br /><br />Some have called this softcore porn, I don't know if this is the correct label but it is definitely a fun little exploitation film... and definitely the kind I like! As many of these type films are this is based on a true story, this one's based on an Alaska serial killer named Robert Hansen who after sexually abusing and raping his prostitute victims released them in a remote area of Alaska to stalk and kill them with his rifle.<br /><br />In this film Danielle De Luca plays a stripper named Diana who is kidnapped, stripped naked and awakens in a remote wilderness area in New Mexico only to be hunted by a madman with a compound bow and his rifle. It comes off as an excuse to to show her completely naked with her breasts bouncing in all their glorious beauty as she runs. At times the hunting scene reminded me of I Spit on Your Grave but without the over the top violent rape scenes. If your offended by any of this I suggest you steer away and see if something else on.<br /><br />As most movies like this do, the victim clearly has a chance to escape or at least disarm the killer at one point as Diana had but decides to run off instead giving him another opportunity to to hunt her down and even kill others along the way. In the end it turned out the killer had preyed on and hunted prostitutes, as to the final victim it leaves it open for a possible sequel.<br /><br />By far it's not the best movie in the world and it does come off at times as some made for television movie but well worth watching just for Danielle De Luca's performance during the hunting scenes which is worth the rental alone. The only recognizable face otherwise is that of Joe Mantegna as a sheriff who has seen better days and most probably agreed to do this solely for the paycheck.<br /><br />As said, if seeing half naked strippers do their thing on stage or if you enjoy watching women captured, stripped naked and then hunted like wild animals then don't miss this one! It's really not as bad as it could have been and with the nudity removed could be a decent Channel 11 late late movie.
