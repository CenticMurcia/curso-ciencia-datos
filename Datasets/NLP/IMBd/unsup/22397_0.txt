if you want a review of modern American society, look no further than mtv. what they feature is utterly saddening (although i do have a weakness for, and do enjoy, jackass). but my super sweet sixteen is probably of one the worst. (ill get to the other mtv shows later.) to begin, we start at some rich girl's (or rarely, boy's) mansion and she's planning a massive sweet sixteen party where she gets anything she wants. a $50000 country club? check. a $500 dress? check. a $100000 audi? (and it better not be used) check. what's sad is, the parents have their hands tied. they don't seem to care that they could be well taking their estate into bankrupcy, just to please some stupid brat.<br /><br />what is the lesson in all of this? first of all, mtv is full if hypocrites. i mean, how do they launch anti-drug and anti-smoking propaganda, when in their shows, they promote rudeness, debauchery, heavy drinking, lavish spending, materialism, etc? second, this program shows how parenting has changed over the last decade or so. gone are the days when parents were respected authority figures. now, especially with all these modern gadgets coming out, kids don't feel like they should earn anything and feel like they don't need to respect anything. and you can't even try to put some disciplined without being labeled old-fashioned, or even worse, be acussed of child abuse. and we complain why our beloved country is falling down in all senses of society. so sad.=-{ by the way, the 10 star rating, that's me just being sarcastic, before you all get all pissy at me.
