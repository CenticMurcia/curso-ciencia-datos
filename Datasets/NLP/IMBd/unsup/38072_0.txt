This film was not only predictable but the poorest film in the world, i could of done a lot better and thats saying something. I had never heard of this film because I'm 100% positive it did not get onto screens in the UK and now i see why! it was not scary, unbelievable and the acting was rubbish. Sorry for me being so negative but i seriously suggest that no one put themselves through the 2 hrs of this movie because i would rather stare at my ceiling than watch that film. it does not even deserve a 1 out of 10! Ripped off Urban Legends,Grudge,Final destination 3, it had no original ideas and only sequels to the films that originally have the ideas can pull it off, this was just a cheap film, trying to add everything and anything into it to make it scary or good but failed miserably.
