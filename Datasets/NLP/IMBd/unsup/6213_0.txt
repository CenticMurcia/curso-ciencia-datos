"Calendar Girls" tells of the exploits of 11 British women - all fifty-something-and-up members of a Women's Club - who decide to pose in the nude for a calendar to raise money for a local charity following the death of one of their spouses. The result is a media feeding frenzy which reaches all the way to Hollywood and The Tonight Show. A warm and fuzzy flick with an up-beat attitude about life (and death), "Calendar Girls" is a fun frolic which conjures moments of pathos and poignancy, sentiment and sass as the women grapple with the repercussions of their escapade. This British comedy romp should play best with females and more mature males. (B)
