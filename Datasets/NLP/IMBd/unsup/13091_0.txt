I'd like to support indie filmmakers as much as the next film fan, but let's be honest please. The Good: Great supporting cast - Pat Hingle, Betsy Palmer, Emmanuelle Chriqui, George Morfogen, etc. The Bad: Average story, a formula weeper, underdeveloped "romance", Not enough Artie Lange. The Ugly: A Harvard Doctor that can't pronounce "Alzheimer's." Whose fault is this? I can't believe with 2 directors, they could both let that slide. They are as much to blame as the "star". "Convincing" is hardly the word I'd use to describe this performance. It was a nice try, I bet they all cared deeply about this serious subject, but when the lead can't lead, or even follow, he should stay out of the way. 4, out of ten, for effort.
