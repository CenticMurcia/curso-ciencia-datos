This is just one of those films that is completely beneath contempt. It's so formulamatic and hollywoodized that its sickening. First of all it rips off other primal thrillers such as "Fatal Attraction" and "Cape Fear", second of all THE ACTING IS TERRIBLE!!!!!!, except for Keaton in the smaller role as the bad guy, come to think of it he didnt have to act much. Griffith was just plain awful in the lead, Modine was almost as bad but i'll put him ahead of Griffith because he tried. Everything was just so predictable and boring that I wanted to shoot myself. If you want to see an unoriginal predictable thriller done well see "Unlawful Entry"(1992) with Kurt Russell and Ray Liotta, at least in that movie the acting was good and their performances let the movie rise above the formulamatic plot. Overall this movie was awful and should have ended many careers, maybe it did!! Bomb out of ****.
