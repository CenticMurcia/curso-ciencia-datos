Presented as a history channel style documentary, detailing an alternative history of the United States, or in this case the Confederate States, as though the south had won the American Civil War.<br /><br />The production is about as exciting and innovative as a standard historical documentary. Black and white photos, sound bite interviews, and a somewhat monotonous narration. That would not be a problem if the information provided was true, as the main purpose of watching a historical documentary would be to learn about history, not for entertainment.<br /><br />For me there was little enjoyment in watching dully presented information which does not even have the virtue of being true. More interesting would have been an actual documentary where academics and experts discussed what they believed the consequences of a southern victory could have been based on real facts. This is just someone's unjustified conjecture.<br /><br />If you don't have at least a basic knowledge of the events a consequences of the Civil War this film would just be confusing. If you do, then its mostly just annoying.
