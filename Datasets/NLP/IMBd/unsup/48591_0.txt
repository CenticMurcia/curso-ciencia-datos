Horrible. Like nature and living? This is not it. Don't watch it. It is like the most terrible thing nearly anyone has seen. Boy, I am never going to go on the website again. If it's rated U or something...that is stupid. 18 is the proper rating. If it's not rated at all, they should rate it because children would just think, "ooh, I MUST see that because I LOVE nature." Believe me, this has nothing to do with nature. This is all just one big joke about little, cute, cuddly creatures dying in many horrible ways. Awful nature. Very strong bloody violence. Cute little beasts. I hated every single one of them, so don't even THINK about wanting to watch it...unless, of course, you like blood & guts.
