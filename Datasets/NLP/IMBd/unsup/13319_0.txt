Like all screen plays, a writer does his/her best to avoid unnecessary dialog. I'd imagine in short films, this rule of thumb is even more pertinent. Although Cute and Creepy does not answer all your inquiries about love, it definitely raises new questions. How would I react to a secret admirer? Would I be flattered, or would that note left on my doorstep be borderline stalking? While many films are made to entertain, this one will definitely make you think. Highly recommended. Just as satisfying as a 90 minute feature, minus all the popcorn in your teeth. Looking forward to more pieces of work from this brilliant writer/producer...
