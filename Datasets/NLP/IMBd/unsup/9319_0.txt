Okay, 'Megalodon' is better then other films about other films such as 'Shark attack 3: Megalodon' and 'Shark Hunter'.<br /><br />It opens up with a newscast where Maria Barrera is doing a report about shark attack and and oil stuff. With interviews from the head of it 'Peter Brazier' and 'Robert Amstrong' she ends up saying reporter 'christen Giddings' will be there for a week. The crew gets eaten to. The cgi and sound is great! I l o v e this m o v i-e it does not s u c k you h e a r that????? It i s a g r e a t s h a r k a t t a ck m o vi e! Watch it! I hope you will enjoy it as much as i did. It will be better then most shark attack films you will ever see. It goes next to Deep blue sea and shark attack 2!
