It would probably be no different then Moral Orel. All you would have to do is change the designation of the religion being bashed in an unfunny, bigoted and mean spirited fashion (all the while accusing bashed religion of being bigoted and mean spirited).<br /><br />It's that hypocrisy that's cast over every minute of Moral Orel. Here we have 10-11 minutes of nothing but thuggish slurs against Chistians and they got the balls to make the Christians out to be the intolerant, xenophobic and reactionary half-wits.<br /><br />Moral Orel is still an interesting watch (as long as it comes between superior shows on Adult Swim) because it is a satire. However, It is more a satire on the people that make it rather then the people it is depicting.<br /><br />If you ever want a representation of how some arrogant, elitist "Blue Staters" views flyover country and how bigoted some are against those who sets foot in a church, look no farther than Moral Orel. <br /><br />The people who make this think it's edgy. Yeah, right! Give me a break! Dopey, borderline racist, clueless, out of touch, out of the times Christians are the only Christians that modern Hollywood depicts and recognizes. All the MO team is doing is making a bad Davey and Golieth parody out of it but there is no shortage of the meat of what they are doing (quite badly).<br /><br />Edgy and brave suggests consequences beyond the occasional cold feet of Adult Swim Standards and Practices. It suggests social and in some cases financial and physical risk.<br /><br />So if Dino wants REALLY be edgy and brave bashing religion let him turn his sights on militant Islam. <br /><br />But this will not happen since that would actually be taking a risk in the politically correct circles that Dino is presumably a part of. The pats on the back he probably gets for ridiculing Christians by similar thinking "enlightened" people will turn to accusations of "insensitivity" for saying anything bad about Islam.<br /><br />Also, militant Islam's reaction to slurs against them are... well... militant. So, let's not kid ourselves, some iconoclasts are only safe iconoclasts, going down well worn roads of supposed "envelope pushing" while the envelope has already been broken for some time. <br /><br />There is a way to do biting religious satire without crossing the line into bashing and bigotry. But the whole point of MO is ignoring the line. In the hands of more empathetic and talented people that might work (i.e. Trey Parker and Matt Stone).<br /><br />But as it is, MO is just a look into the mind(or minds, who knows if just is exclusively Dino Stamatopoulos's baby) of insufferably arrogant, iconoclastic arrested adolescence.<br /><br />The type that feels entitled not only to jab at deeply held beliefs of a group of largely decent people but to totally stomp on them while slurring those people.<br /><br />And they (the people slurred against) are supposed to grin and bear it because it is all in good fun, after all. They must learn to be tolerant and understanding of those that are practicing the opposite towards them.<br /><br />They don't have to watch it, after all. All they have to do is tolerate others watching a stilted, moronic, stereotypical, negative portrayal of them. All done for and by people that seem to have contempt, hatrid and ignorance for who they are.<br /><br />So there you have it, "Moral Orel" a comedy satire in the great tradition of "Amos and Andy"
