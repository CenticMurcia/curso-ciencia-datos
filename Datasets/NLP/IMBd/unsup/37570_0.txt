Any film which features a dwarf secret agent battling bad guys and seducing babes has got to be a winner, right?<br /><br />Wrong! Some films are so bad that they actually end up being very entertaining; For Y'ur Height Only, however, strives to illicit laughs by deliberately being dreadful, but actually ends up being rather boring.<br /><br />Philippino pipsqueak Weng Weng plays 00, a short-ass secret agent who, with the help of sexy assistant Irma (Beth Sandoval), embarks on a mission to rescue a scientist that has been kidnapped by the evil Mr. Giant and his gang.<br /><br />For a while, this tongue-in-cheek spoof spy movie is fun enough: our bow-legged mini-Bond runs, jumps and kicks butt while the bad guys cower in fear of having their knackers bashed (the half-pint hero's trademark move); Mr. Giant's henchmen inexplicably deliver their cheesy lines in the style of 1930s New York gangsters; and 00 uses a variety of badly designed gadgets.<br /><br />But it's not long before the film loses its novelty value and becomes tedious in the extreme, repeating the same gags (00 sliding along the floor with his gun, hiding in tiny places and acting cool with the ladies) ad nauseum.<br /><br />I had hoped that For Y'ur Height Only would be an umissable slice of 'dwarfsploitation', but instead it is merely a cinematic oddity that unfortunately fails to deliver on its unusual premise.
