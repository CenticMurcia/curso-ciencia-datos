Time hasn't been kind to "Regarding Henry" I remembered it like pleasant enough bit of sentimental tripe. But now, 19 years later is truly an embarrassing movie for everyone concerned. Every common place in place, every line of predictable dialogue could be anticipated by a 7 year old. The characters, if you can call them that, are a walking clich√©. As if this was not enough, Harrisson Ford, mugging his way through it. A truly epidermic performance as phony as anything I've ever seen him do. The strange thing is that Mike Nichols , one of my heroes, has always been so spot on in the casting department. Wonderful performances in all of his movies, so, how can anyone explain to me this, scholastic performance by Harrison Ford. His scenes with his physical therapist, a good natured, African American, made me cringe. Everything so premeditated an, I repeat, phony. The only one with a tinge of integrity is the girl playing Ford's daughter and out of respect for her I'm giving "Regarding Henry" a 2 not a 1. Phew!
