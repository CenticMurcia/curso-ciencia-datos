Sharpe's Battle. Starring Sean Bean as the unimaginably fitting role for Richard Sharpe. Daragh O Malley is the best sidekick for Sharpe, and the riflemen are great. The new characters are good too, but Runciman reminds me of Jabba the Hutt (both are fat, and without manners). Lord Keily is also a great character. Loup is obviously the villain, and Juanita is easy to hate. By contrast, Miranda, the girl with Perkins, is a character-emphasizing asset.<br /><br />This follows the book okay most of the way, but the ending was quite different. In the novel, the book ends with the Battle of Fuentes d'Oneros. Here, it ends with the fall of a village serving as Loup's headquarters. I see no fault in anyone's acting, either.<br /><br />This episode has some incredible scenes. The two main ones I'm referring to are the death of Perkins and the death of his murderer. I felt so sad for Perkins. He was awesome! And Daragh O Malley in a real temper is incredible as he pounds through the street, shouting "ORourke! You bastard O'Rourke! "(the killer of Perkins). I'd say that was his best acting in the whole episode.<br /><br />Watch this thing for yourself. It's good to see things for yourself.
