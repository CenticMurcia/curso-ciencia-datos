This is a beautiful story between a normal person and a goddess, this is a classic. I first saw this on AXN, the animation looks just like You're Under Arrest. But as I watched it, I found it interesting, and I wanted to see more of it. It starts out with Keichi Morisato, who decides to order some lunch, but accidentally dials the Goddess-help-hotline but when he tries to tell them it was a mistake, and all of a sudden Belldandy comes out of nowhere! This is a wonderful show and worthwhile to see for anyone, and a memorable role and this is one is the most recognizable of Kikuko Inoue, who voiced the older sister of Akane in Ranma 1/2, the Boss of MGS 3 and Rosemary of MGS 2, and Kikuchi Masami, the voice of Tenchi, and Aya Kisakawa, the voice of Yuki Sohma. Recommended to all anime fans and non-anime fans.
