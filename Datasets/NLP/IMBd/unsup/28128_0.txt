I don't really know where to start. I am still deeply disturbed and have been for days after seeing this film. I don't think a film has ever affected me so much.<br /><br />"The Girl Next Door" is based on the true (yes TRUE events) story of a young girl named Meg and her sister Susan who move in with a foster mom after their parents are killed in an accident. The foster mom begins to abuse the girls and then singles out Meg and gets her kids and numerous kids in the neighborhood to abuse her. She is starved, raped, beaten, burnt, and many other horrible things. She is abused like this for 3 months until ultimately, she dies.<br /><br />Meg is played by the sweet and innocent Blythe Auffarth. She is so charismatic and looks beautiful on screen. She plays Meg hauntingly well. Whether she's screaming, crying in despair, or just laying looking down right pathetic, she never loses the audience. You really want this girl to survive. You really want to kill the evil people doing this to her.<br /><br />Which brings me to our main villain. Ruth Chandler. She is played by Blanche Baker who I HATED in this film. No, I didn't hate her acting. Her acting was amazing, which is why I hated her. She is vile, disgusting, evil, alcoholic, and she is the ring leader of the torment. You will absolutely HATE her and want to kill her yourself. I know I did.<br /><br />The last person I want to point out is young David Morgan. He plays David Mache, who befriends Meg and even develops a crush on her. He starts to notice odd things about Ruth and the way she treats Meg. He begins to become uncomfortable with the situation, but he wasn't even ready for what was to come. When he first sees Meg tied up in the basement, he is horrified. Throughout the rest of the movie, he struggles with his own self, trying to distinguish wrong from right. He knows what is happening is so wrong but yet he can't seem to do anything about it. Well he tries to help Meg numerous times, but all are to no avail. You really want to grab him and shake him and say "JUST TELL SOMEONE!!" but of course you can't. And in the finale, he lays with Meg in one of the most heart-wrenching scenes I have ever seen. He lays with her and cries as she slowly dies after some words to hi. David Morgan really did a good job. I hope to see him in the future.<br /><br />The main thing that disturbs me about this movie is the kids. It's so disturbing to me that kids so young and even older could commit such horrible acts. It really is a disturbing film and if you are easily disturbed please do not bother with this film. And it is based on a true story once again, which to think about only will lower your faith in humanity. Trust me, this is a super powerful film.<br /><br />10 out of 10 stars
