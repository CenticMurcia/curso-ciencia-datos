Matthew M beefcake shots everywhere. Horrible, unbelievable storyline, oh and let's not forget the KWAAZY ANIMAL SEQUENCES! A lizard bites Matthew and then chuckles like a Budweiser chameleon. By the end it was so predictable in its lame attempts to tie the story together it was EXCRUCIATING! The only reason I didn't give Fs is because the actors at least showed up.<br /><br />Poor Terry Bradshaw, he did okay until he agreed to prance around naked for cheap laughs. You how some movies go in and out in their quality? This one never comes out of the steaming pile that it is. I couldn't even find the director's name on the closing credits (probably too embarrassed).<br /><br />Don't even waste a rental on this dreck!
