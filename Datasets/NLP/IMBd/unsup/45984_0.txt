As in unbelievably bad, that is.<br /><br />To a reviewer who called it superb, the director owes you big time,as he has at least one (and probably only) fan of his film.<br /><br />Boring, slow and 90 minutes longer than it should've been, this movie gives nothing but painful shivers.<br /><br />And, after the end credits finish, the main question persists: What on earth was it all about? Even though I haven't had a pleasure of being introduced to Mr. Paez's music, I am absolutely positive he is a great composer. But let's face the truth...Neither Mozart nor Bethoeven tried to make their living as painters....With all my respect, Mr. Paez, I hope you get my hint.
