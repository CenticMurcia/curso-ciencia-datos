This was without a doubt, the worst show I've ever watched. I was at home one day, bored, and decided to watch the television. This came up. I thought, hmm, let's see what this is like. I spent the next hour wanting to bash someone's head in. These girls and guys obviously do't appreciate what they have, and their parents really need to give some of them a spanking. One girl stopped her father from trying to get a lower rental price for the mansion she wanted for her party. 'Ooh, $ 50 000 is fine, daddy'.<br /><br />She was the girl in high school that everyone hates, and is completely obsessed with herself, saying that she's hot (she only rates a 5 on my scale), and publicly giving invites so that everyone knows who didn't get them (and inviting guys and not their girlfriends). She whined when she didn't get a star for her birthday (her parents later surprised her with Lil Frankie, or some such person).<br /><br />It scares me that there are people in the world like this. Her party cost US$ 150 000 in the end, for one night. I couldn't help but think, that's more than my university and living costs for 3 years. Nearly double, actually, even with flight costs factored in. Scary.
