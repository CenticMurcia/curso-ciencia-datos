This movie is the spiritual ancestor of so many later boxing film, including the great 'Raging Bull,' but its story is too by-the-numbers for it to be a true classic, in my opinion. It's still an effective movie, however. Similar observations could be made about its star, John Garfield, as well. For a fight film, not that much action takes place inside the ring. This is not inappropriate, since the focus is on Charley Davis' (Garfield) struggles outside the arena, both to win the woman he loves and against the mobster who wants to control him. The last fight sequence, however, is handled particularly well. Director Robert Rossen and cinematographer James Wong Howe can be thanked for that.
