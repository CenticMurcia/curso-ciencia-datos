I don't think this movie holds up well over time, and it certainly wasn't as good as the first two movies. I especially liked Topper Takes A Trip, and found myself laughing uncontrollably in several places. While I like Joan Blondell, and the other actors, I just found that this movie missed. I didn't find it funny at all, just annoying. Maybe it was a case of going to the well too often. In general, very few sequels are as good as the original movie. In this case, third time's a clunker. Roland Young and Billie Burke are always delightful, but even they couldn't save this movie. It could cure insomnia. The first two movies sparkled, and could stand alone on their own merits, and as part of a series. This one just seems out of place, and not worthy to be considered a sequel. Maybe my expectations were simply too high. Having thoroughly enjoyed the first two Toppers, I expected a laugh riot in this one. I don't remember laughing in this one at all, which surprised me. Maybe Topper's time had passed by the time this one was made. I would watch it again to see if it was just me or the movie, since I suspect it's a little of both.
