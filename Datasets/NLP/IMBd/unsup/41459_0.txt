This movie was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. I was very disappointed, I love Psychological thrillers, but this was far from that. Although Shue did a decent job in the movie, it couldn't save the fact that it was a horribly written movie. The story literally went nowhere, leaving me frustrated and annoyed. Many questions were never answered, and the character development was almost non-existent. <br /><br />In the future I will think twice before ever seeing another Isaac Webb movie.<br /><br />VERY DISAPPOINTING MOVIE<br /><br />DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME
