I have always been an animal lover but these meerkats stole my heart. Especially brave little Shakespeare. The editing and narrating are incredible. It pulls you in and you really start to care about these little creatures....as is they are are somebody you know. Kudos to Aminal Planet for bringing wildlife in Africa into the American home. This series touched me so much that I was compelled to donate to Fellow Earthlings' Wildlife Center. This center revolves around taking care of Meerkats. After watching this series I hope that you will contribute too.<br /><br />These little meerkats are really incredible. Their social order is almost human. They have the dominate female who rules all (and what a perfect world that would be :-), babysitters who watch their young, and they don't mate with anyone related to them (please tell me how they know that). I urge you to watch this series and I promise, you will will fall in love with meerkats too.
