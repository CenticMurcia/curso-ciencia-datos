This is a beautiful and misunderstood film. I remember seeing it as a child and it opened up the world of fantasy and adventure visually for me, it was a great film. Unfortuanitley, the film was not at all successful. For the reasons that the aliens don't come into until 30 minutes before the movie ends, and the rest of the film is the dramatic adventures of three best friends going through life and making discoveries, guiding themselves by their friendship which will last for ever. The film wasn't popular and I don't know how much it grossed, but this is really a recommended film for those that have dreamt of space and adventure.
