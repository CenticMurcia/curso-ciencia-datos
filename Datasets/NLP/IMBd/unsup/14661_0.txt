OK, don't get me wrong here, this is an awful movie. Awful story. Awful acting. Yet AWFULLY entertaining! Yeah? See what I did there? <br /><br />It's aliens, sharks, a thermos full of orange goo and Parker Lewis. How can you lose on this one? <br /><br />I don't know what it was about this movie, but, for as awful as it was, it was strangely entertaining. It made zero sense, but was fun to watch. Think SciFi Channel on a Saturday afternoon. It's that kind of entertaining. Keep in mind before watching it though, that it's going to suck. If you can shut your brain off for a minute and enjoy the (repeating) bits of stock footage, you might just get a few (unintentional) laughs out of it.
