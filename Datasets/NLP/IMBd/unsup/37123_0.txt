This was an OK movie, at best, outside the context of the book. But having read and enjoyed the book quite a bit it was a real disappointment in comparison. I don't recall ever seeing a movie that took so many liberties, large and small, with the book that inspired it. For example, the Hawaii "happy" ending at the conclusion was absurd and a bit of Hollywood in the worst sense. And the portrayal of Stoney was a complete joke relative to the badass he was in the book.<br /><br />The book was so much deeper, nuanced and philosophical (even beyond the usual book/movie dichotomy), you got a much better feel for, and understanding of, the time and place depicted in the movie. In comparison the movie was flat and felt phoned in. The cast was OK, some decent actors but nobody doing their best work. If you want to have any hope of enjoying the movie, DO NOT read the book first.
