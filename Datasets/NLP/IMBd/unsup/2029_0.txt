I thought this movie would be just a Hong Kong version of Charlie's Angels, but it is not. The movie was about two sisters who became professional killers because of their traumatic childhood of witnessing the murder of their father. Their father has developed a high-tech GPS technology just before his death. The sisters used this technology to aid them in their profession. The effect used on this movie is a lot like Matrix'. I thought the movie used the effect properly and therefore, the movie itself is a lot of fun to watch. The storyline is rather predictable, so also is the drama. However the fighting scene is cutting edge. Any scene that can make Vicky Zhao (Zhao Wei) looks like a vicious fighter is worth seeing :)
