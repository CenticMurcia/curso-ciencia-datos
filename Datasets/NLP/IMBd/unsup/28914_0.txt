This movie is amazing. I enjoyed it very much. The story is very sad, and its even sadder that its a true story. J.D Pardo acted out the parts very well. He did an amazing job. I love the moral of the story and I think everyone should learn from it. The moral would be to accept people for who they are, don't judge people for that's on the outside, love and accepted them for what's underneath. This movie will definitely make you stop and think how cruel society can be. I'm glad they brought Gwen Araujo's story to life. I think it was time her story was heard. The people who acted in this movie did an amazing job. I can't see anyone else better for his movie then these people. I'm glad they made this movie as touch as it was. May Gwen rest in peace.<br /><br />Thanks: Nicole
