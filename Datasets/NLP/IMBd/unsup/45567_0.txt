That nasty pack of clich√©s, plagiarism, terrible acting and really, really, really clumsy plot isn't watchable. I can at least guess, because it's definitely not for teenagers, 'couse they're gonna laugh at almost every scene (for some time, because THIS movie isn't even funny in the way Ed Wood movies can be), older viewers will easily spot all the plot holes, bad acting and terrible idea. I had the doubtful pleasure of watching this flick at late night on the polish TV... and found it very difficult to enjoy it in any way.<br /><br />Even for a B (C? D?... E?... um...) or DTV movie it's waaaaaay below the bottom line. It is much worse then Steven Seagal's movies. Don't waste your time on such trash.
