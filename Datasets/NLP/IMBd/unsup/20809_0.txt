This movies story line is all over the map, the way the movie starts off is just goofy, i'm not going to go into details but this movie is just plain ****. The acting was crappy the only thing this movie had going for it is that Samuel Jackson was in it thats it. This movie isn't worth renting, I rented it when it first came out on DVD what a waste of 4.50 this movie is someones idea of a sick joke. <br /><br />Picture starting to watch a movie have way in, because thats what it feels like when you start watching this, They don't explain a god dam thing. This movie is about as good as being kicked in the nuts, All i can do is give you a heads up by saying this movie makes battle field earth look OK.
