I believe that our fundamental film opinions take 3 categories: Excellent, OK and Awful. Sometimes you get a movie which is below average throughout but then the last 15 minutes are as if it has been directed by someone else and it suddenly grabs your attention. At the end of it you think back to the film and although most of it was less than mediocre, you still class it under "Ok" simply because of the ending. Well this movie is exactly the opposite... once in a while, you get a movie like THIS.<br /><br />The bulk of the movie was quite good until suddenly the last 5 minutes of the film was so terribly awful that I was left with total disbelief and my jaw had dropped while I was thinking to myself "No... that cant be the ending... they cant have finished it like that". The ending in this "film" is quite simply THE worst ending I have ever ever EVER seen. It drops this film so far into 'awful' that once I saw the ending I even forgot all the funny, good bits in the rest of the film and just imagined watching that ending for 3 hours instead.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who needs a lesson in how NOT to make a film. If you like realism then i wish you luck when watching this movie... and worse still it sucked 3 hours of my life away! UNBELIEVABLE!
