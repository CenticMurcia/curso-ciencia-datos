Before I start I did watch this movie twice, i didn't like it at all when I saw for the first first then watched it watched it second, i did find it bit more funny then before.<br /><br />The plot A humanoid alien lands on earth, and soon discovers he likes to eat Italian. Italian people, that is. Incompetent detective McSorely is the only one with a clue about what's going on, and even his grasp of the situation isn't too firm. The rest of the police force thinks he's crazy, while the alien continues sampling the Italian cuisine of New York City This movie is so Cheese movies, if you do like cheesy movies this is cheesy at it best. Not scary at all (Maybe for 4 year old).<br /><br />The whole movie is over the top and acting not bad for this kinda of movie.<br /><br />It did have some really funny stuff in this movie, McSorely who talking to (us instead of using the voice over thing ) himself was really funny.<br /><br />Everytimes his goes to see his boss, The boss is always eating, you don't see him not eat at all.<br /><br />Alien itself was silly just like the whole of the movie was over the top however it fitted in well with the rest of the movie <br /><br />If you like really cheesy movies, check this out others wise i don't recommender this movie to anyone else 3/10
