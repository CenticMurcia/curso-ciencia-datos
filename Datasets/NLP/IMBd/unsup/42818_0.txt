I wish sci-fi/action movie producers would hire decent writers and directors; people capable of providing realistic and interesting characters. The effects in this film were somewhat satisfying and engaging, but the main characters (with the exception of Hank Azaria's character) ruined most of the scenes.<br /><br />Audrey, the "love interest" for Matthew Broderick's role, is perhaps one of most irritating female characters I've ever seen on film - shallow, stupid, totally lacking in judgment, and she runs like "Gloria" from Body Double; a film not known for its satisfying female characters.<br /><br />What's perhaps most sad, except for the fact that she miraculously manages to triumph (sort of), is that the director tried to make Audrey lovable and appealing to the audience, as a vulnerable, sweet, yet misguided woman, despite her effective ability to alienate the interest and care of most female AND male audience members. How could they not see their blunder and correct it by feeding Audrey to Godzilla at the end? I have never been to a movie wherein I eagerly joined audience members chanting "EAT HER!" We were disappointed.<br /><br />And why, I wonder, did they think it was a good idea to name 4 or 5 of the French characters "Jean-_____"?<br /><br />A recommendation to any aspiring directors: make sure the annoying characters get eaten, and if you really insist on naming 80% of your French characters Jean-something, at least have them laugh at themselves for it IN the movie - don't just hope people will notice and think its funny, because they won't.
