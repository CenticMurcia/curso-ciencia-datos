This scores a three only for the visual competence; Rube Goldberg meets a pinball machine, with the free-floating '3D' perspective. <br /><br />The jokes are funny for 10 yr. olds, we suppose. The creators are certainly among the mentally challenged. Witness the utterly crippled attempt to goof on HAL 9000.<br /><br />Otherwise, this borrows mostly from the Wizard of Oz. The derivations are from flash in the pan pop culture concerns, so expect a short shelf life.<br /><br />However, we have to confront the real reason for its existence, which of course, is to inculcate young minds with Hollywood/leftist flapdoodle.<br /><br />-- The benevolent elites 'invent things that make everyone's life better'. <br /><br />-- The small business owner is a cash register.<br /><br />-- The homeless man 'got screwed'.<br /><br />-- The corporation is ipso facto Evil; there's 'no money in concern'; offering products on the market involves 'making (us) feel crummy' so we need Upgrades. It must 'suck the last pennies' from customers'; if the bums can't pay they're just 'scrap metal'.<br /><br />-- No one can afford insurance (so the answer is to make it a birth right).<br /><br />Evidently, resources come from nowhere and can be distributed freely! Spare parts (money, health care/medication, insurance, etc.) are cheaper than what Evil Corp. pushes! They're just greedy...off with their heads!<br /><br />Folks, if you let this drivel influence a child's thinking, you deserve what you get. Ice Age contains similar noxious themes, surrounding predator/prey cooperation in nature.<br /><br />The leftist push for collectivism can't escape some hard facts...can you name one technological invention, one wonder drug, one cultural achievement that owes its origin to Socialism? No, because there are none. For Eisenstein and Tarkovsky to see, they had to stand on the shoulders of many non-communist giants, starting with Edison. <br /><br />It's leftism that belongs on the scrap heap...
