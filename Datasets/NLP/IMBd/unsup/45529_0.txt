Well I just spent the evening watching this with a group of 7 friends, mostly high-school teachers, collectively our book & film club. It started off quite positively - a bit bonkers perhaps but sort of amusing but by the end the audience was variously commenting: "I'd have preferred having needles stuck in my eyes!" or extending toilet breaks so they had less of the film to watch, or lamenting the sheer tedium of this movie. I didn't think it was THAT bad (not "up" to Death in Venice standard for example) but by the end I was wondering what point the film-maker was actually trying to make. Given that it was impossible to have much sympathy for any of the characters and given that nothing actually happened, surely there must be a philosophical point to it all? Once I realised there was none, I realised we had been yet again tricked into admiring an Emperor's invisible suit. I cannot believe people have given this film such high ratings. I think you've had the wool well and truly pulled over your eyes.
