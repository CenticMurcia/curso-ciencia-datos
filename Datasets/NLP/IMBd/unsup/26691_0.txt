It's amazing to me how many people comment on these old Italian horror films saying things like: "Don't watch this movie and expect to see 'The Godfather...'" This film can't be compared to big budget Hollywood productions. In many ways, it's miles better than anything else out there because films like "Anthropophagus" achieve an emotional effect greater than films like "The Godfather" on a fraction of the budget.<br /><br />There are two famous scenes in "Anthropophagus" that people tend to focus on because they are so shocking. If you've seen as many Italian horror movies as me, you'll find these scenes to be typical of the genre, albeit a little excessive. The things about this movie that I really like is the editing, the acting and the music. George Eastman makes for a perfectly creepy bad guy. He's big and intrusive and believable. The setting is perfect: a strange deserted island. The gore is over-the-top and D'Amato delivers it as usual.<br /><br />It would be impossible to find a movie nowadays that's this effective with such a budget. Nothing but vintage Italian greatness here. I recommend the Shriek Show version which includes the uncut masterpiece plus a whole disc of extras.<br /><br />8 out of 10, kids.
