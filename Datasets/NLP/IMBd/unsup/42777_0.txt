I am a huge fan of Jackie Chan. I have and loved his autobiography, along with a good deal of his American movies. I love the cartoon. I started to watch it just cause it had him in it. I will watch anything of his and it's really, really hard to get me to not like it... Well they must have worked exceedingly hard. The movie is dubbed in English horribly, and is so incredibly, unbearably tedious I stopped watching it and tried to lay there and fall asleep instead. At a half hour I was thinking oh come on it has to be at least half over! but no I rummaged around till I found the case... IT'S OVER 2 HOURS LONG! I didn't have high expectations for it... I was just thinking something to watch when I was bored and a little like the pacifier in terms of comedies with a baby... but with baby-napping... So I got Rush Hour 3 which I loved and this. Don't waste your time watching it... There is no funny at all at least when I gave up at 45 minutes into it... Everyone's life sucks, main characters are: Jerk Of The Year, Jackie as Loser Gambler, Blind Dude with insane depressed wife... No part of it is happy... I really want to go return it just cause I hate giving 20 bucks for that crappy of a movie. Like it sucked so bad I still can't believe it. I don't know why Jackie would have done this rush hour 3 came out on DVD at like the same time so it's not like for the work or for the money... And you know Rush Hour 3 had to pay well and it's not like if he wanted to do more movies he couldn't. It's just incomprehensible why when he needs no padding in his career he would subject anyone to this drivel. In short, MOVIE SUCKS DON'T BUY! I definitely won't blindly trust Jackie to give me a good movie anymore that's for sure... If you have an option between watching paint dry/staring at an already painted wall or watching this the wall wins by a landslide.
