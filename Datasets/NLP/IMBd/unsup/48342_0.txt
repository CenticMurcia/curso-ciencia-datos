"Dead of Night"..."Trilogy of Terror"..."Creepshow"..."Twilight Zone: The Movie"..."Cat's Eye"...yessir, the horror genre has had its share of fine anthology films; films that crawl up your sleeve and slide down your spine to produce commendable shivers. "Deadtime Stories," however, is a horror anthology like no other, basically because it's utter CRAP. Via a lame, low-budget framing device, a 'randy' uncle tells his restless nephew fairy tales in an attempt to get the brat to go to sleep (I, however, had no trouble falling into a somnambulant state while watching this). The silly script takes a darkly farcical view of 'Goldilocks and the Three Bears,' 'Little Red Riding Hood,' and some story about two witches looking to resurrect their dead sister. While obviously low-budget, we do get some fairly impressive, "Hellraiser"-style FX work...but that's about all "Deadtime Stories" has to offer. The soundtrack, the fashions, and the hairstyles, combined with a script that's obnoxious when it wants to be funny, and eye-rollingly stupid when it wants to be scary, sends "Deadtime Stories" to a watery grave in the latrine of '80s nostalgia.
