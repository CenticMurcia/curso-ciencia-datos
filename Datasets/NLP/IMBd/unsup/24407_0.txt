I just love these old classics,you can watch them over and over again and never tyre of them.<br /><br />I recently bought this original of ebay,an ex-rental as they have the original trailers etc on them and boy was it money well spent! I have a fantastic collection of these original movies and this is one of my favourites! It has all the horror and gore and tension you could want along with a bit of nudity chucked in for good measure.<br /><br />I'd say this is a must for serious collectors if you can get a copy as this has been deleted in original format since 1993!<br /><br />The story is good and the special effects are above average for the budget the late 80's early 90's horror films usually had!<br /><br />Go get it now and have a great slice of retro horror in your proud collection!<br /><br />10/10
