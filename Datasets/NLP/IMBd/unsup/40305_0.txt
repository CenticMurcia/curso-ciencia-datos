This could have been a great movie. Director should have let Cate Blanchett just act. When she is allowed to, she's amazing and carries the film up. I was with others, and we were split on the film, so some may love it. I found its script tedious with all the info-giving; it made me cringe at times. And all the shots of Guerin (Blanchett) smirking sideways at the camera -- it seemed like the filmmakers lost perspective. The story is remarkable and important, and there is so much talent in this movie, it's a pity that whatever happened in the execution didn't work to show the film's story as the amazing tale it is. I do not like criticizing films harshly, but for people with so much money and talent and resources -- what happened? The fact is, this movie should have been great. The story is great. One thing at least it does accomplish is get the woman's name and possibly some of her story out to the world.
