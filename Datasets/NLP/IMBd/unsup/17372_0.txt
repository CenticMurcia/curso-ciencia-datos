Within a kind of light and shadow there's almost a trademark photography for a film noir movie, and "Sea of Love" is a film that takes place in the shadows <br /><br />Al Pacino plays Frank Teller, a self-conscious detectivein search of a serial killerdrawn into a torrid sexual relationship with an attractive young woman he met in a super market when all the good citizens of the city are asleep and the people who are walking around are the ones who are leading the most solitary lives <br /><br />Helen Barkin is just so right for the part You can believe her when you see her dressed in her red leather jacket and tight jeans She's a lady of the night, sexy as hell, and a woman who can take care of herself Between her and Pacino, there were enough attraction that's deep but also there were feelings of vulnerability and suspicion
