I enjoyed this movie. I rented it because it had Parker Posey in it, but enjoyed all of the characters. Maybe because I've had jobs like that before : the sense of "us vs. them" and the wacky little things that the characters did to get through the day to 5:00. I would rather watch a movie about these four girls than most movies readily offered to me. Watch the movie. Enjoy it. There aren't that many great movies where the female characters aren't just there to give a guy character some depth.
