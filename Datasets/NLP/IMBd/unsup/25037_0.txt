I've seen Mario Bava's giallo splatter "classic" about three times in my life and it never really appealed to me. With the exception of several fairly gruesome demises scattered throughout, "A Bay of Blood" (aka Twitch of the Death Nerve, Bloodbath, Carnage, or Last House on the Left Part II) is slow moving with some dull characters and absolutely no creepiness at all. The plot revolves around the residents of a bay that has the eye of several business people who want to buy it and turn it into a high class resort. After the countess refuses to sell over the land, she is mysteriously killed along with her husband. Soon, more people - including some horny kids turn up slaughtered. I just see nothing all that spectacular about this film aside from it's undeniable shaping of the slasher genre, yet it is just plain forgettable and the gore effects aren't anything to marvel over either. Sorry Bava fans but "Baron Blood" takes the cake over this...
