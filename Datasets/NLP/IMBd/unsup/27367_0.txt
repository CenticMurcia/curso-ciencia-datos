Name a slasher since the big three that has added anything new to this genre...more graphic gore is not setting a trend...blair witch was absolutely a yawner...and i am guessing the same people yapping at this movie loved Blair Witch...what an awesome idea treating it as behind the scenes documentary for the first half...sure it was predictable....name a slasher or any other movie for that matter that isn't...sure there were movies that have shocked us but they are few and far between...as to protecting people...relax those protector's also love the nanny state and probably need people to protect them from things like horrible flicks. We all have different tastes and I never expect anyone to agree with my assessment of movies, books, or even food. As to a clerk laughing at a customer's choice; a nice simple comment to management will reorient the employee's attitude, one more in line with providing a more enjoyable customer experience.
