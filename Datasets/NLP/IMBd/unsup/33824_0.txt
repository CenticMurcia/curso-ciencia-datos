This movie is very average: SFX are childish to non-existent; plot is paper thin; acting amateurish. Teenagers on a "love lane" parking expedition ( the belle brat of the city's lawyer and a lower class boy her father knows nothing about ) by mistake hit & kill an invading alien with their big clumsy 1950s car. Alerting the police, they are tested for alcohol (=they are drunk), accused of manslaughter and jailed...or is it a set up? Couple of bums wandering from city to city seeking "opportunities" splits after drinking in a solitary pub in this small provincial town: one goes home to bed; another takes a ride and after he spots a spaceship, wants to set up a freak show to get rich quick. Too bad aliens attack & kill him injecting him a large dose of alcohol, and he is whom the two youngsters are accused of having murdered. The bum who went home sleeping stars in some "comedy moment" scene, and there is also some hillbilly redneck trying to chase youngsters away from his property ( a character reminiscent of minor Laurel&Hardy supporting actors ) who provides comedy relief. Minor plot twists, such as the two teenagers escaping from the police station. This movie is a bizarre concoction of comedy, parody and 1950s-styled sci-fi. In the end the teenagers are cleared of suspicion, while a goofy -yet pompous- military expedition inadvertently causes the spaceship to blow up. In the end invading aliens (= middle school kids wearing poorly sewed costumes ) are surrounded by teenagers in their funky 1950s cars, and burn up once exposed to direct light. Very modest movie not worth watching twice.
