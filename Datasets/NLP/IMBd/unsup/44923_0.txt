Might be the worst film I have ever seen.No character development,cliché scene heaped upon cliché.The main actor(Jennifer Beale)seemed afraid to both act or be involved in what was a very limited production.The entire cast consisted of the members of an AA group.Avoid this film at all costs,I sat jaw agape about a 1/3 through the film.The viewer is unable to connect,or make an emotional investment in the characters due to not being given any background.I was actually surprised at how easy it was to spot the flaws in this film, but they are stark. I would give this film a zero if it was possible.
