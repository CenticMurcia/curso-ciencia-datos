As a former skater back in the day, I knew the names and board designs of everyone in the flick. It was a great documentary for those of us who used to skate and now just hang around. I was out of skating and SoCal before Gator's downfall and never heard about it. It is quite a tragic story. However, people should pay close attention to a real hero in the story, Tony Hawk. Tony has always been an inspiration and a role model. He is a masterful businessman, an unbelievable athlete, and someone totally uncorrupted by fame and fortune (as far as I know). Seeing Lance and Christian et al, was also awesome.<br /><br />...and for Gator, I have no sympathy...unless of course you want to blame his father. NOT.
