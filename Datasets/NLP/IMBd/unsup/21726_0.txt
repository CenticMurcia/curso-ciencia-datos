In South Dakota, in an Indian reservation, an old storyteller Indian (August Schellenberger) asks his grandson Shane (Eddie Spears), who is in trouble owing money to some bad guys, to take his old pony and him to Albuquerque to the great powwow, an Indian meeting. While traveling, Grandpa tells mysterious Indian tales of love, friendship and magic.<br /><br />What a great surprise was watching "Dreamkeeper"! Released on VHS in Brazil, with 167 minutes running time, it is composed by several wonderful mystical Indian tales, with gods, spirits, enchanted horse, evil serpent in a lake, all of them connected through the narrative of the Grandpa to his son and with the support of excellent cast and special effects. This feel-good film is a must-see entertainment for the whole family. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "O Guardi√£o dos Sonhos" ("The Dreamkeeeper")
