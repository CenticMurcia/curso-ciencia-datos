I probably had the highest standard for Urban Legends Bloddy Mary that you can have for a direct to video. I thought it would be either okay or it would be horrible. This movie was probably okay to good but definitely not great. I't wasn't scary but it had some memorable scenes like a ring finger in a beer bottle and a guy even gets electrocuted to death because he wizzes on a high voltage sign. The acting is good and there's not a huge plot to it. Don't think it's anything like the first Urban Legend because it's not. My final verdict to the movie URBAN LEGEND BLODDY MARY is I liked it but i'm not sure I could watch this movie over and over again. I give it 4 stars out of 10 and 1 thumbs up.<br /><br />Rated R, Violence and some language.
