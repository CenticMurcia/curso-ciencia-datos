One of the few times I generally was embarrassed to actually be in a theater. The story of Joan of Arc generally appealed to me but the direction this movie took did not and this mainly due to the fact the storytelling itself is flawed. Milla Jovovich's character "Joan" describes the screenplay of the film to a letter, dazed and confused throughout. It interesting though how the story also tries to balance itself by introducing new ideas on what is and is not divine and even this element was clumsily and randomly introduce as plot elements, from Faye Dunaway's character fumbling with the vile of "blood" to Joan herself seeing "visions" Dustin Hoffman's performance was fair but totally unnecessary the film could have limped on without him. Joan rationalizing with herself would have been much more believable then this. As far as the cinematography goes it's quite nice, brilliant in fact along with the score. I was really was expecting much more from this film and Besson which usually makes excellent work, unfortunately this is a dud.
