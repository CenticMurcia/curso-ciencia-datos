Unlikeable characters fling 'tude and computer buzzwords at one another as they diss the big bad adults with their magic computer skills in a series of goofy and unconvincing situations. Any similarity to real computer terminology and technology, or real hackers' lives - both far more interesting than these hip cartoon technoteens - is purely coincidental. Read "Cuckoo's Egg" instead.<br /><br />- Kate Orman
