I think that 7th Heaven used to be a good show. Now it's gotten so lame that I don't care what happens anymore. The show is still a tiny bit addictive, but it just doesn't have the same appeal to me it once had. This is by far the worst season of 7th Heaven ever. The show has always been sort of predictable, but now I usually know what will happen before it does. Like this week's episode for example. Simon and Rose fought over that stupid wedding ring she forced him to buy. She made him feel totally guilty for something that was her fault. And as usual, he was dumb enough to take her back. Now it seems that they will get married after all, but who knows? Next week, Rose is supposed to drop yet another bomb on poor Simon. If the show really does end, it can't end with Simon marrying that insecure, needy, clingy, spoiled, selfish, manipulative brat.
