"24" has certainly changed the way suspense and addictive television is overall viewed.<br /><br />Everything about this show, the real-time format, the story lines, action and even characters is impeccable. I give huge credit to the producers for figuring out a way in which we can engage and learn about the characters inner beings, from only seeing a day in their lives.<br /><br />Kiefer Sutherland is spot on perfect for the role of troubled hero Jack Bauer, who works for the Los Angeles CTU (Counter Terrorist Unit). He has fantastic support from the hilarious Mary Lynn Rajskub as Chloe O'Brian, Kim Raver as girlfriend Audrey Raines, James Morrison as Bill Buchanan, Reiko Aylesworth as Michelle Dessler and of course, everyone's favourite Carlos Bernard as Tony Almeida.<br /><br />Each season is about different terrorist threats that face the United States (bar the first season) and the CTU's efforts to thwart them, all unfolding in real-time, as each hour-long episode of the show represents. The terrorist threats being the problem. The series is now approaching its sixth season and the theme of Jack Bauer saving Los Angeles from annihilation is getting old. Don't get me wrong, the show is still suspenseful as ever, while there are even some interesting non-terrorist related subplots. But a change would be nice. We can hope for this in the seventh & eighth seasons which FOX has already ordered (the show is that good).<br /><br />Other commendable support include Dennis Haysbert, Penny Johnson Jerald, Gregory Itzin, Jean Smart, DB Woodside, Xander Berkeley, Sarah Clarke, Jayne Atkinson, Shohreh Agdashloo, Peter Weller and Glen Morshower in their roles of David Palmer, Sherry Palmer, Charles Logan, Martha Logan, Wayne Palmer, George Mason, Nina Myers, Karen Hayes, Dina Araz, Christopher Henderson and Aaron Pierce respectively.
