Shown at the MIFF as 'The Bridge in the Rain' (why? I dunno).<br /><br />I almost didn't see this film as it sounded as if it could easily have been another of those 'mundane' foreign films but no, it was excellent.<br /><br />Gustav, who originally intended to go to the Tokyo monastery, is the type who gets lost in supermarkets. The other brother, Uwe, ends up going along after drowning his sorrows when his wife leaves him. Unfortunately, Uwe seems to fit right in with the strict monastery life, much to Gustav's torment! He even copes better than his brother when they get lost and separated in Tokyo. They both have personal torment and sibling rivalry which is equally engaging and funny.<br /><br />The monastery is in quiet, idyll surroundings out of Tokyo. A memorable line which hits home if you live in a big city comes in the form of a saying about 'hate' and anger - but I won't give it away.<br /><br />I thought that the story could have gone in any number of possible directions with equally enjoyable results.<br /><br />I also think that filming this on video and using footage from the video camera in the film enhanced the realism. A very memorable film.
