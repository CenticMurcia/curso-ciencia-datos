A beautifully disturbed film by Hungarian director, Gyorgy Palfi. I will warn you all now, this film is not for the faint hearted, you do see graphic sexual images, you do see people vomiting, close up, on many occasions and you do see what is meant by self-surgery with about 2 mins of entrails, blood and guts. This film is not for the ordinary film going public, more for the people who like artistic films that are just completely barmy, hence why I love this film. The film is in three parts, each part, a newer generation of the same (in a way) family. each of the generations have it's own story, plot lacks a bit in this film, however, the cinematography is amazing, and I think that if I was to watch this film with no subtitle's and understand nothing, I would still enjoy the cinematography with the soundtrack by Amon Tobin complementing this film to a "T". If you like family films, documentaries, thrillers, suspense, comedies, DON'T WATCH THIS FILM, if you like the likes of "la cit√© des enfants perdu's", "Das Boot", "delicatesson" and possibly even "guinea pig", then you will marvel in this film.
