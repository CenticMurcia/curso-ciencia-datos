Everything in this movie is unbearably implausible, false, phony. How comes a woman doesn't recognize the man she loves, just 14 years after he's disappeared, and when it happens that much more than half his face looks exactly the same it was? What the hell did the main character do to become so rich and respected? After all, how many cabin boys have become that rich in real life? And, most of all, how comes a young woman like that stays 14 years with the man that has beaten her and, to her knowledge, killed the man of her life? Ridiculous. The screenwriter of Taxi Driver has made a film that is a very good candidate to the title of The Worst Movie Ever Made.
