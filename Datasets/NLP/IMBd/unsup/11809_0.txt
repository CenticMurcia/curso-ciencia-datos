This movie is just plain awesome! i gave it 9 because Its one of those action packed thrillers where your dad goes " Oh it was him ! he did it!" gets really cocky about it and it was someone so unexpected. This is because most people cannot guess what will happen because the movie is ingeniously clever. The action sequences are very well handled. Many people say that they got very bored watching the explosion again and again , but i found this interesting as each time you see it from a different view point and each time it gives something else away and leaves you on a cliffhanger, wondering what will happen next. This stylish action packed thriller is great for all the family!<br /><br />YOU'LL LOVE IT - unless you don't ?!:P
