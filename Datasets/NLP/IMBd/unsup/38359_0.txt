There are bad movies (ones with poor acting, writing, etc.) and then there are BAD movies (stinkers which haven't one ounce of inspiration). "The Ambushers" falls into that latter category. The third (and worst) Matt Helm spy-yarn, it is offensive, stupid, witless, and--worst of all deadly sins--boring. Matt Helm may be tracking a lost U.S. saucer to the jungles of Mexico, but Dean Martin is fast asleep at the wheel. His attractive co-stars can't even rouse him from his mumbling stupor. This film is truly rank, poor in every conceivable department. It's hard to fathom it, but Martin was once a pretty decent actor, yet everything at this point was slipping: his talent, his looks, his focus, his patience. NO STARS from ****
