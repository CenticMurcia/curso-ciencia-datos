This film is a lot like THE CROW only with fast cars. I love the premise of the film. The characters are very good; although, I felt that Charlie Sheen was a bit wasted as the title role of the movie. I wish that we got to see a little more of that shotgun he uses. Nick Cassavetes is great as the villain - in fact, he's so evil that I named a character in one of my stories after his character of Packard Walsh just as a reference to show how evil my character is. The action is good. And the script is well-written with a lot of good and bizarre twists. But what I liked most about this film was the soundtrack. I wish I can find at a used record store or something. I love the song "Hold on Blue Eyes" by LaMarca which plays in the scene where Charlie Sheen and Sherilyn Fenn are making love in the pond. In fact because of that song (and other reasons), I thought that was the best scene in the movie. The only thing that I didn't like about this movie was Sherilyn Fenn's annoying performance. If I was Charlie, I'm not sure if I'd really want to return from the dead for her.
