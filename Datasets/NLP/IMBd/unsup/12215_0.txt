Oh my God! This film was incredibly touching. I think i lost a litre of cry water during the whole film. Penn was incredible. I think he really would have deserved an oscar for this. Michelle Pfiffer was great as usual. But the young girl, Dakota Fanning, was the one who stole my attention most of all. So young and yet such a performance, and with such ease it seems! This film is one to watch!
