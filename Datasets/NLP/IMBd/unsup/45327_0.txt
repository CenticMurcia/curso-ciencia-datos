Okay, first let me say, it takes a lot of horrible things in a movie to make me think I wasted my time. I can quite often enjoy a movie even though I know it's pretty bad, because there is usually something there worth enjoying. Somehow, the creators of this terrible film could not seem to do that, and this garbage has absolutely zero interest factor.<br /><br />The movie starts and you're introduced to a film-crew going around documenting the pre-impact thoughts of a new virus. Hmmm. There's the usual talking and interaction between the crew, in which a normal director would use to establish character development. And after a droll 15-20 minutes of interaction of absolutely no worth, we finally get to see some zombies. Or zombie, I should say. Now is when you'll probably be like "Oh ****, get out of there!", expecting it to viciously attack. Nope. Not at all. It'll just menacingly (or blankly) stare at the camera. NO, STOP! IT'S TOO SCARY!<br /><br />Now our crew is outside, freaking out at all the blank staring, barely walking zombies surrounding them. That's right, these zombies don't run, or even walk. They stumble. How they get anywhere is beyond me. And now I'll take a break from "spoilers", and just tell you the rest of the movie is JUST. LIKE. THIS. You'll have people freaking out at zombies 150 feet away, moving at .1 mph, screaming not to waste ammo when a gun isn't even needed to kill the reflexless things. Just go club it to death, GEEZ!!<br /><br />The actions made by these people will have you DUMBFOUNDED. Instead of running over a couple of zombies in a car, this idiot decides to crash the car instead, knocking out a girl in the process. Now, instead of dragging her along (the zombies still wouldn't catch up) or closing the doors to keep her safe, they leave her there, only to stop 10 ft away to film her dying. Way to go, heroes.<br /><br />The acting is plain terrible, the script is awful, the camera won't stay still, the effects are decent according to the budget, and some parts will make you go "WTF?". Oh, and might I add, don't let the cover fool you. None of that happens. Not even the guy on the front cover.<br /><br />And in the end, this movie should be avoided at all costs. Into zombies? You won't be anymore after you watch this trash.
