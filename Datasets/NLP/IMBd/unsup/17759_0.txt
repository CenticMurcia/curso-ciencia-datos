10 years from today you may or may not remember elements of Star Wars but you will remember every scene in this movie. Great Cast, Good Plot and the action is actually well scripted. Of course you could do without the car chase at the end but VERY WELL written and even the minor characters put in "A" performances. I could think of 000's of ways to waste $ 7 on a movie. This one is great and you can actually see it for free
