After seeing this film, you cant help but feel something. From reading comments on the message boards I've noticed it range from feeling repulsion to feeling awe. Personally, I feel in awe of the whole film and its actors portrayal of the sensitive issues within. Levitts and Corbets acting is amazing to say the least. Both of their roles show the opposite ends of how people deal with such a shocking event. Neil manages to ooze sex and allure even though he is just trying to ease the pain of his past by embracing it and letting it control who he is. Even by believing what happened to him was an act of love and how happy he was to feel that special. Where as Brian believes he was abducted by aliens, and experimented on. Which explains his random nose bleeds, asexual orientation and withdrawing into himself (feeling he is the only person to experience this event). It all leads to a conclusion you can see happening but that doesn't take away from the films emotional impact one bit. Tractenberg and Licon are also worth seeing the film for. Its just a shame the two couldn't have more screen time (I gotta buy the book!). Wendy manages to be Neils soul mate and understand him like no other person can. Shes Neils backbone and tries to be his Savior, but obviously she can only try. Where as Eric provides the film with extra warmth and humanity. His scenes with Brian are probably my favorite as it shows just how much he cares about him, and also gives Brian that true friend he has always wanted and needed. Someone to make a connection with (until he meets Neil, who without, Brian would never have come to understand what happened to him). Overall I cant praise this film enough. Although there are a few disturbing scenes that have to be there (which some people might not be able to look behind and see the meaning of), it doesn't take away from the beauty of the script, film and acting. Now I need to go and buy that book!
