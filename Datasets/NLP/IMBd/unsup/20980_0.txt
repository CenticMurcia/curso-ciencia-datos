If you are looking for your typical shoot 'em up war movie then move on to something else.<br /><br />This movie shows what real courage is, and REAL COURAGE isn't always what you think it will be.<br /><br />I thought one of the most poignant statements in the movie is "the ultimate destination of hate is self-hate." Many of the characters go through complete transformations throughout the course of the movie, and we get to witness this firsthand. sometimes we get caught thinking 'why would he do that' when a character commits a particularly selfless act, and I think that is a big part of the writer's intent.<br /><br />There's a lot of historical, literary, and biblical allusions which add to the complexity of the movie, and ultimately I think it adds depth and helps us to understand the transformations of the characters.<br /><br />The movie is all the more amazing when you consider it is based on a true story.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie but beware it isn't a walk in the park to watch.
