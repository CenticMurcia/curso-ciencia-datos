When I was younger I only watched a couple of episodes of this crime solving guy. He was basically an idiot with gadgets. A little girl named Penny (with a dog) has an uncle called John Brown. In the show he solves crimes for the police with help of his egos, which is why they call him Inspector Gadget. Inside his body are many big and small mechanical materials to help him with his job. He could turn himself into an airbag, he had a helicopter propeller, he could extend his arms, legs and neck, and many other weird and wonderful devices. The only problem was he was an idiot when he used them. I mainly liked this show for the theme tune. Personally, this a lot better than the poor movie, don't bother seeing the movie, just see this! It was number 46 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Okay!
