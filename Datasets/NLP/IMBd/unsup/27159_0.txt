I watched this on Turner Classic Movies(TCM)and was surprised to see Grant Withers in the lead. I had always seen him in westerns in the 40's as one of the "bad guys" that has to be defeated by the "good guys". Nice to get a new perspective on his acting with his early films. It has an excellent cast and as long as you remember it was made in 1930 and respect the morals of the time you will enjoy it as much as I did. Mary Astor as the loving wife torn between husband Tomey and best friend Withers. There is plenty of guilt to go around,as there should be in a moral play with really nice people caught up in uncontrollable passion. You want this to turn out alright and in this period,they usually did. I will always remember the Withers line he would leave with,"Have a chew on me.",throwing a stick of gum to the person in question. Watch and enjoy.
