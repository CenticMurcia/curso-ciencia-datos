This movie is dire. The characters are all ghastly, with the exception of the cutesy kids who are cheesier than my unwashed gym kit. There are some interesting issues asking to be covered by this film, which the writer and director swerved to avoid with alarming regularity. "Here comes an interesting issue - OK let's have someone smash a bottle over someone else's head or have someone pull a gun." I wasted 90 minutes seeing it and I'm wasting more time now spleening about it. Save yourself the bother - miss it.
