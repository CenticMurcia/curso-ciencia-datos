This movie was released in 1984 starring Keir Dullea as Glenn, Adrienne Barbeau as Andrea and Peter Hobbs as Barnaby. In this standard sci-fi romance, the widow Andrea lives on a Greek island with her son Timmy and, like the other islanders, is amazed when a stranger Keir Dullea washes up on shore during a magnetic storm. She brings the apparently injured man home to help him recuperate his health, and a relationship develops between the two of them. At first seeming to suffer from amnesia, the stranger has a mysterious quality that comes more into focus when he performs certain miracles. As he demonstrates his powers, it is slowly revealed that he is a time-traveler, and his brother, in fact, once traveled back 2,000 years further in time. Again, another Adrienne Barbeau picture that was disappointing. Outside of the scenery from the Greek Islands there wasn't much else exciting in this movie that's why I'm giving this picture just 4 weasel stars.
