Brill film for youngsters, I loved the film as a kid, first saw it on bbc 1 or 2 in about 1985 when I was 8. Watched it not so long ago at around Christmas, my little twin brothers are about 7 and they were glued to the tv. Best part, oh poor old Jacko just been eaten! The Octopus still looks quite good now and the effects were good for then 1978. I would love to see a 2002 remake, its just a shame Doug's not here to play the good guy part.
