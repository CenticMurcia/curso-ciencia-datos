One of those rare movies where the acting is good, the editing, direction, filming and pace are all excellent and not over done in any fashion. Movie never really misses a beat and despite times it could have rolled over into being way too heavy kept it just right. There are no bad guys and just some good old raw emotion is played out in a tasteful fashion. If you want to have life look a little better a very good way to do it.
