The first time I watched this movie it made the life of what is emoral become heartfelt, but after a few other times the movie became mundane. An ecocentric humor of realities truth. The movie is so elaborate as to depict a fundamental flaw in nature, a fluid flow of what is to become reality in itself. Retelling what we already know. The working IMMIGRANTS AND THEIR PLIGHT AND STRUGGLE. YET THIS STRUGGLE CONTINUES. Frank a hard working son of an English born mother must face hardships with the Italian community in New York and still uphold mockery from his Polish brethren. A movie fit with hidden lies upon the stuggle in America, showcase a nonstop heartfelt sympathy for a man who strives for much more yet receives acceptance only in wish. Frank. My god, this movie should be banned by everyone and their mother. vile.
