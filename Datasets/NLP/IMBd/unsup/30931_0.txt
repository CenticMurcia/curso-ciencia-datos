This was by far the worst movie I have ever seen. The disaster scenes were ridiculous - people on fire walking around after a plane crash? come on, that's just stupid. The direction was awful. I felt embarrassed for the actors the whole movie. And the end, stupid beyond words... only the kids that can hear the creepy whispering people can go off in the spaceship... no parents allowed... and the kids don't really mind that their parents are either dead or about to die, because they each get to have a white fluffy bunny to hold... most of the audience was laughing, and those that weren't sat there with their mouth hanging open. Save yourself Don't go It's 121 minutes you'll never get back
