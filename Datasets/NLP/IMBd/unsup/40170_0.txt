The story is unique enough to warrant making a movie. However, this movie moved way too slow to hold a viewer's attention for very long. I wish this movie had been better because the story line is a very compelling one. Children respond to tragic events in many different ways. This movie does show that. This movie was frustrating because of the slow moving story. I watched it to the end because I really wanted to learn what happened. I won't sit through it again though. A good movie producer could make this story into a very riveting movie. Maybe there is a book on this true story. If there is,I highly suggest reading it. This story deserves to be told well.
