<br /><br />Dig that Zither music! The musical score makes this movie. <br /><br />The Third Man isn't as great as all the hype it gets, but it is an entertaining film. Alida Valli is a standout as Anna and Joseph Cotton is very good as Holly Martins. <br /><br />*****************Mild Spoilers Ahead*********************************<br /><br />The opening scene at the funeral near the beginning of The Third Man has something hauntingly memorable about it. There's also clever use of a cat involved in an eerie scene that reveals Harry Lime. The ferris wheel scene is absorbing. And of course there is the desperation of the ruthless and clever Harry Lime (Orson Wells) when he is chased in the sewer. And don't forget the ending with Anna (Alida Valli) walking along the road a second time just like an earlier scene. This film has many fine moments and it is well crafted. Carol Reed, the director, had a nice touch. I don't think the cinematography deserved a best Oscar, though. The film wasn't lit up enough in some scenes. Dark lighting is ok and realistic, but you can go so far that you miss much of the action.<br /><br />Then of course there is the zither music. It's wonderful.<br /><br />I rate this film a 9 out of 10. Very watchable, but I'm not sure it's a classic.
