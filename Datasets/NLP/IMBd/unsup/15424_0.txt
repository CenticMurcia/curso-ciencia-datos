OK. In a nutshell (no spoilers i promise), the main character (Jennifer Jason Leigh) inherits this big old building that has a night club downstairs and living quarters upstairs. As soon as she moves in, strange things start happening. Things move around, crash.. feelings of being watched, etc. This guy, who gibes you the impression that he is some sort of City Official/Detective type, starts showing up trying to calm JJL down as she is scared witless due to the aforementioned abnormalities. Soon enough, she gains the strength to explore this dwelling and finds more rooms and doorways. OK, I gotta stop here. It gets weirder... and KINKY!!!
