I was very excited about seeing Goal! 2 after Goal ! was a great movie.However as I learned that Santiago will play for Real Madrid my excitement faded. The film's plot contrary to other users comments is a very strong one,we see a dark side of our hero Santiago(as fame consumes him),we see the price of fame. One thing that I found stupid in the plot was the fact that Real end up winning the Champions League,in a very unrealistic game. However how the writers of this film managed to twist the plot was very clever.Like for example the fact that Michael Owen moved to Newcastle in exchange for Munez,was a very good twist. There were two things that annoyed me in this film. The fact that this film is one big advert for Adidas,now even in the first film there are a lot of Adidas related stuff,but in this film they push it. Another thing was how the matches were made.The actors were added into real matches digitally and the final product ended up so fake ! In total Goal! 2 is a film which movie buffs will find very fake,mixed audiences (like myself) will like and football fanatics will love.<br /><br />7/10
