I have a some problems with this show, first:<br /><br />1. Flavor Flav has seven kids, is in his late 40's and is messing around with all kinds of crazy women half his age. 2. Flav decided to bring NY back and then dumped her 3. He wants ten kids 4. In the FOL 3 reunion he decides to go back to the mother of his 7th kid 5. why do the women on this show embarrass themselves by acting so crazy 6. the women on this show give their race a bad image 7. the women are crazy for wanting a short man twice their age . flav sleeps with these women and then eliminates them 9. why would these optimistic women want a 49 year old with 7 kids 10.the women act like they have no home training
