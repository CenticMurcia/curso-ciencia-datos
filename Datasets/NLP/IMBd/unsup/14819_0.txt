The review that was first posted for this video strikes one as a bit reactionary and defensive. While I've never been a Mormon, I do have a scientific background, and I found the science (and the scientific conclusions) very straightforward and solid, and yet it is done in such a way to make it accessible to the layperson. I didn't find it at all "bashing" or disrespectful; on the contrary, as a scientific documentary it is quite dispassionate, though there are some personal stories and struggles interwoven through it. Although I can understand how it might cause some discomfort for some LDS viewers, I would nonetheless recommend it to them. As a production it is simple and uncomplicated, but there are a lot of very interesting and challenging sound bites. Even if the subject matter doesn't pique your interest, you might give this one a try.
