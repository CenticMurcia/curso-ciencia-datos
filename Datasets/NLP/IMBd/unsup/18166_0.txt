at bringing Lovecraft to the screen, something that is notoriously difficult to do.<br /><br />The movie follows the story much better than most attempts, although there are certain changes to make it more accessible. One of the main problems in bringing Lovecraft to a movie is the lack of atmosphere created by his word choice in his writings. The makers do a fair job in creating it by the sets, music and lighting. They also avoid the most elemental mistake in Lovecraft adaptations, they never really show the "brother" who's part Old One until a quick shot at the end. They cut to some quick shots of tentacles but the main sequences only show wind and sound to suggest something being present. As Lovecraft knew a person's imagination is capable of creating something much more terrifying then anything that could be created by someone else.<br /><br />Stockwell comes across as kind of a space cadet but then again he's allegedly only part human so that may be forgivable. Sandra Dee seems to be in a different movie entirely. Watching her performance makes me think she was coerced into doing this movie for little money. She seems to only be a part time presence. Sam Jaffe of course does a wonderful crazy old codger. Watching it there's no question that it was made in the 70s from the bad hair to the bell bottom polyester clothes. But hey, it *was* the 70s so it made sense. <br /><br />All in all one of the better adaptations and worth watching. Not terrific but enjoyable.<br /><br />
