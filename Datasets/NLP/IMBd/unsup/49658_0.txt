Truly one of the worst movies I have seen in years. There is absolutely no tension, shocks or scares. The cast members are despatched in an entirely perfunctory and unimaginative fashion.<br /><br />The story and scripting is stupid beyond belief. At one point a character falls off a cliff and instead of trying to help him the girl he is with runs miles back to the camp to tell the others that he has fallen off a cliff. They don't actually decide to do anything about it and then seem entirely unsurprised when he shows up again with what appear to be only minor injuries (a bit of a cut on the side of his head). And how come the female actors have American accents (sometimes in some cases) whilst the males speak with Australian accents? And don't get me started on the ending. It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.<br /><br />I have seen infinitely better low budget films produced by students.<br /><br />Avoid this at all costs.<br /><br />A pretty good cast wasted.
