<br /><br />Only heaven knows how I sat through this oh so painfully bad movie...one thing I know is that I will never do it again. This film represents everything bad in moviemaking...poor plot, bad actors, weak script, moronic dialogue and bad camerawork. The lead actress is so annoying that I wanted to clamber up onto the screen and strangle her !!<br /><br />Once the lights came on in the theatre...I couldn't get to the exit quickly enough. As for the people who voted this movie as a "10"....all I have to say to them is you need to get out more often. If someone offers you the alternative between watching "The Dumb Generation" and having a manicure with a chainsaw...take the chainsaw...it will be a lot less painful !!
