I have read this book and bought the DVD collection. I would really like to know how DeAndre is doing now. I love the book as well as the series It couldn't have been done any better I really felt these people's pain.Does anyone know how Fran DeAndre Tyreeka or DeAnte are doing now. I would really like to give DeAndre some words of encouragement. I felt a connection with him. In fact I felt a connection with all of these people even though we come from two different worlds. This book and this series will forever be in my heart and I wish the best to everyone involved. And if anyone has any information on these people I would really appreciate a reply.<br /><br />This story touched my heart so much that I drove 15 hours straight to Baltimore to the corner of fayette and monroe just to see some of how it really is. I cant say how much I am truly touched.
