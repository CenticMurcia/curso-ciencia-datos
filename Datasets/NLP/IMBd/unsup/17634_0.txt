Saving Marriage is an aptly titled movie that chronicles the struggle to legalize Gay Marriage in the state of Massachusets. It portrays not solely the political and legal battles, but the personal issues. For those less familiar with the cause, it gives not only the background but puts faces to the issues. It is respectful to those who do not know why gay marriage is such an important goal and educates its audience in a non-threatening manner. As someone who as always been supportive of civil rights issues, it motivated me to want to be more vocal about this cause.<br /><br />There is one quote from the movie that keeps coming back to me....to paraphrase: it's not really about gay marriage, but an acceptance of gays. This movie chronicles legalities, but in essence it is about accepting gay people as equal citizens with equal rights. As a heterosexual, I need to get over my learned prejudices -- we all have prejudices -- get rid of knee-jerk responses, listen and learn from others.<br /><br />This movie is an attempt to make the world a better place. Well worth my time and yours!
