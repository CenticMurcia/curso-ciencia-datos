After many years have passed I have to say that this movie kept me hanging as it did when I watched it was seems now like ages ago. The Sheriff of Nottingham was the main villain (I don't think he could ever play a good guy with his expressions but just as well because he's always perfect as a downright evil mastermind). This is basically what made Bruce Willis and rightly so, he did do some of his best acting in it. All the bad guys were pretty good, the only character that really got on my nerves was Ellis because he was just such a sleaze. I thought it was cool that the father from "Family Matters" (Reginald VelJohnson I think) made an appearance as a cop because he really is such a great actor yet you don't get to see him in too many pictures. This film is still exciting to watch and I definitely recommend it for this upcoming holiday season (as they play many Christmas songs throughout)! Yippy-kay-yay.<br /><br />Final Innuendo:<br /><br />Movies : I was an 80's child and even so I unfortunately missed this opportunity.<br /><br />DVD Purchase : I could definitely see myself watching this once yearly.<br /><br />Rental : A fantastic idea!
