I remember seeing this when it first out, in a theater, and thinking ... why? It was on cable a few nights ago and I watched it again.<br /><br />You know those shows on TV about bad drivers running from the cops? The only reason to pay attention is that at any moment you're going to see something incredibly stupid. That's what this movie is like, only in slow motion.<br /><br />If God were truly merciful, he would have destroyed all the copies of this movie before it made the theaters, and long before cable.<br /><br />(tiny spoiler) ......<br /><br />Did Kirk Douglas appear in it, it just to see Farrah with no clothes?<br /><br />
