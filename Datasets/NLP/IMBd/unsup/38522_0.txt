I am a really big fan of horror films I've seen Texas chainsaw Halloween you name it I've seen it. My favourite is child's play 1 saw the the 1st chuck film when i was 9 and i loved it. I recommend who ever reads this go and see child's play 1 but you have to buy it because it is banned and its rare to get hold of in hired shops especial in england. If you want to know why its banned look it up. Childs play 2 is good if you see the 1st one you can compare it but after you see the first one you will notice that don Mancini has mucked the story line up. I notice that because he didn't explain nothing at all about it he changed everything the main characters from the 1st one should have been in the second one. he should have changed the 2nd story line into the the 3rd one and come up with something explaining what happened to Andy's mum. I recommend after seeing the 1st chuck don't see the rest up to you but if you see the last 4 you will find that the plot as gone you will get really confused about what happened to the main characters. Plus after seeing the last 4 you will find they are boring I recommend to just see the 1st child's play because the 1st was superb
