The casting was well done, but in the progress of the movie I kept thinking that I had seen this one before. Then it came to my mind that the story was the story of "La sirene du Mississippi" with Belmondo and Deneuve. The producer must have a nice sense of hummer to give his film the right title then .......... Anyway, Iliked the story (again) and I always find it an entertaining pleasure to look at Jolie and Banderas and being a European it will be quite obvious that I am definitely not offended by some modest nudity as shown in this movie. This was well acted and it seems to me that the cameraman was knew very well what he was doing.
