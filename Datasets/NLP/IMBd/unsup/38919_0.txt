Hm well. I'm a big fan of Mankell. I've read most of his books and seen the movies. I haven't read "Innan Frosten" thou but I cant believe its as bad as this movie. It was utterly crap. No depth, no characters, no plot, no dialog and the actors, my God, are they really pros? That Sällström girl, shes not in my book, but some regard her as quite an actress but this?! Please give me a break. The directors willingness to shoot her mostly from behind dressed in her tight jeans, I am sad to say, saved this movie from getting a 2 from me. Now I just have to read the book so I can determine if its as bad as the movie. People, save yourself from wasting a good hour and a half, do something else, sew, make pottery I don't care, just leave this be.
