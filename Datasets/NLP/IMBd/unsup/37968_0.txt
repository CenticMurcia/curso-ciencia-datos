Well I just got done watching this movie, thankfully for free on the SciFi channel. I must say I feel sorry for anyone who actually paid to see this movie. Although I have learned to not really expect much from the weekend Horror movies on cable, this one is really near bottom of the barrel material. The beginning was okay, and could be considered somewhat good by horror movie terms. However there was very little building on almost any of the characters in the movie. While Phil Jenkins, does have some background/build, mostly from just a couple scenes where he revealed some information about his past; as well as Pamela's constant nickname of "big city" for him. All of the other characters just seem like cannon fodder. There to be picked off at a moment's notice. I wasn't impressed by the gore in this movie either, it wasn't in the least bit frightening. That of course, could be the effect of seeing a few hundred different horror movies. I think this movie was mostly just slapped together hurriedly with a second rate script and mediocre actors. The acting in the scene where the girl gets out of the car and is crawling across the ground while being "eaten" by the werewolf is actually laughably bad. The attempt at a good plot twist at the end was pretty lame and very predictable if you've seen any kind of horror/suspense movie similar to this one. The fact that evil thing turns out to be the main character's love interest is pretty dried up in terms of plot twists. It also seems to come very suddenly, without any building whatsoever. My overall view of this movie is that it should definitely be avoided at all costs. Unless you're an absolute die-hard werewolf or random horror fan, don't bother with this movie.
