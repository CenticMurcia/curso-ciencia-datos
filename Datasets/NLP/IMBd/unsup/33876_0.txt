This movie is horrible. It's a bunch of boring people sitting around a room talking and talking about boring stuff. It's like being stuck in someone's horrible poli sci college class or something. I almost walked out, and then like twenty minutes in, one of these guys gets his throat cut. And I was like, wow, maybe stuff will happen now. But no. They went back to the room with the boring stupid talk. By the time the bad guys finally show up, you're just praying for all these losers to get it.<br /><br />The script is one of the worst I've seen in awhile. The sets couldn't be more boring than if you took a cam corder down to your community college. The cast cannot save this film. If I hadn't seen some of them in other movies, I'd swear they couldn't even act. I guess they were slumming it with this thing. Don't waste your time or money. It's not even worthy of a Saturday SciFi Channel showing.
