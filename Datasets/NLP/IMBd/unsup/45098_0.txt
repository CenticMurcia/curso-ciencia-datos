This is a terrible movie. I was embarrassed just watching this movie. Don't give this movie a second of your time. I thought it looked like it might be kind of funny in the video store. Turns out that i just wasted a 1/2 a gallon of gas, $5, and 2 hours of my time to see what is possibly the worst movie in the store.<br /><br />The spoiler is that you end up wasting your valuable time. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. It should never become a cult classic for being so bad. That's how bad it is. People that refer to this movie as entertaining are merely jerks that want to tick people off.<br /><br />The actors in this movie should be embarrassed that they ever considered doing this movie. Tori Spelling didn't even want her name in the credits on this movie. Try to guess why.
