Robert Mitchums' son Christopher (who bears a definite resemblance to his legendary father) is the laid-back lead and title character in this Italian / Spanish co-production, a crime and revenge story that delivers impressive doses of female flesh and nasty violence.<br /><br />Ricco has been in prison thanks to the machinations of Don Vito (a marvelously scuzzy Arthur Kennedy). Vito has also murdered Riccos' father, taken over his empire, and even taken Riccos' girl Rosa (Malisa Longo). Curiously, Ricco isn't *that* interested in getting his revenge (for one thing, he didn't care a lot for his father), but is drawn into an inevitable final showdown just the same, affecting everybody else in his life.<br /><br />The absolutely stunning Barbara Bouchet, as the sexy con artist Scilla, and Longo are outstanding visual attractions (Bouchet has one fantastic scene in the middle of a road that needs to be seen to be appreciated). Director Tulio Demicheli never hesitates to utilize their impressive assets, dishing out all of the sleazy and trashy goods that this movie has to offer with great relish. The scenes of utter, shocking, sadistic violence are especially potent - heads getting battered, innocent folks (including Riccos' wheelchair-bound mother) shot to death, people getting acid baths, and the show-stopping punishment doled out to one horny and unlucky mob flunky.<br /><br />Mitchum is a rather amiable, self-confident, yet low-key lead who's easy to watch, although his fight scenes are indeed hard to swallow. Kennedy is a fantastic villain here, doing a great job of chewing the scenery.<br /><br />"Ricco" is an enjoyably dark mix of sex and brutality that is sure to titillate and entertain fans of exploitation.<br /><br />8/10
