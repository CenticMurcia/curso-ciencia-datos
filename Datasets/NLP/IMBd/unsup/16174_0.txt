I just got this one on dvd and loved it.. With a lot of cool bonus stuff and a blooper reel that is to die for.. all i can say is "THE CHEESE THE CHEESE" BEST BLOOPER EVER..<br /><br />As for the movie with it extended scenes was very well done. love the cast that was used for the days of old to the new actors and actress. Can't wait to see their new film "The Ghosts Of Angela Webb" on dvd. A true Ghost story of a haunted house in New Jersey..
