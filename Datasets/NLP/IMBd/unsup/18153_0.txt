I stumbled upon this film, and was tempted not to watch it when the first minutes were so quiet. However, I was slowly drawn into the life of the characters and the reasons why Antonio had returned to his home town. There was a sensitive balance between what was being communicated in words, and what was being said through the cinematography. This is a film that some will not enjoy. It is a gentle film, where matters of the heart are more important than the acts that made Antonio the remarkable person he is. It is a film full of understatement, with so much being said in so many small ways. The exception is the role of Agustin Gonzalez whose has to be over the top in an old world way and who plays his part to perfection. Have we not all met people like him - obsequious, yet trying so hard to be the perfect concierge? Elena, played by Encarna Paso enters the film out of nowhere for the viewer, but we learn she has been with Antonio for many years, out of sight but not out of mind. Again, playing an understated role to perfection. This is a film for anyone who is in a relationship, and who has a heart for the future.
