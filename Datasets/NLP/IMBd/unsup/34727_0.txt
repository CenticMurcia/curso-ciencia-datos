This film is a travesty. I don't even understand why they decided to term this a zombie movie. The 'things' in this film were as similar to zombies as I am.<br /><br />Everything about this film was awful. The acting was just shocking. The effects were painfully bad. The story was a joke and the dialogue...What can I say about the dialogue..words fail me, they really do.<br /><br />Im usually a huge fan of low budget horror but this was beyond the pale.<br /><br />If you are a fan of zombie films stay away from this terrible film. Its a disgrace to the genre.
