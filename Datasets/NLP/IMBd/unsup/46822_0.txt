How they can milk the classic "Knight Rider" series for this piece of trash is beyond me. The 80's series was a classic even though I do think that David Hasselhoff is an absolutely shambolic actor, which really comes through when he plays two roles in the episodes "Goliath" and "Goliath Returns". If you haven't seen those two episodes yet then you must, they are pure comic genius with Hasselhoff playing Michael Knight's evil twin brother Garth, with a ridiculously massive fake stuck on beard!, classic.<br /><br />Regardless, it was a good series, and the makers of this movie have just used the title of "Knight Rider" to get a bigger audience. There is no doubt that more people would be interested in watching this film simply because of the title. It essentially hasn't hardly got anything to do with the concept and original idea of Knight Rider, until right at the end, (at which time I was falling in and out of sleep), when they build a car with armour and weapons on it. No K.I.T.T., no talking voice, no turbo boost, no molecular bonded shell & no incredibly sexy Bonnie (Patricia Mcphearson). Although there is one nice girl in it which is basically why I am gave this movie the rating I did, otherwise it would have been 0 or 1.<br /><br />Here's a thing that the script writers didn't think of. If in the original Knight rider series, if Wilton had Michaels face constructed in Garths image then why is he as well as looking like him in the face, has he got the same afro hair, the same height, the same build??. The only thing different is a massive beard and Garth breathes and overacts more. Just thought I'd throw that one in. Now back to Knight Rider 2010......<br /><br />Would not recommend this movie to anyone, it is definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen and just like Jaws 3 and that awful Jaws: The Revenge, it puts the original films to shame.<br /><br />Dreadful film, Rating 2/10. trash
