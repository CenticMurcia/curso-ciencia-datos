Of all the "lizard" movies this was the only one that scared the cheese out of me, having first viewed it when I was eight years old in 1963! The close up shots of the Behemoth were quite effective & scary. Looking back, my fave scene was the two car thieves being tossed into the Thames in their stolen car by Behemoth! Just desserts!! I'd love to see a remake of this movie using the same type dinosaur with today's modern fx!! Finally, with today's concern about radioactive waste & it's effect on the enviorment, this film was fifty years ahead of it's time!! The beginning showed the detonation of several atomic bombs in the Pacific.
