The best of all "the gods must be crazy" movies. Chinese humor is excellent. (Note, I am not Chinese. I live in America) Vastly underrated. Perhaps, they did not show it in many American theaters because they were afraid that westerners might not be able to appreciate the movie.<br /><br />Excellent acting.<br /><br />Excellent script. The creators of this movie should make more similar movies. <br /><br />I saw this movie a long time ago. But still remember it. It has lots of humor which does not require much thinking. Good clean fun. I do not remember any offensive content in the movie.
