I read the reviews of this film and noticed it was receiving good ratings so I decided to see it, result, don't believe everything your hear(or read). The film was slow until the ending, the director absolutely used his time unwisely, scenes that were presented in 10 minutes could of been reduced down to 3. The actors played their role and basically anything else was pretty good. But this film with a little bit more work could of a been a least decent.
