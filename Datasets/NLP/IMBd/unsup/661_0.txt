The original version based on the same story, El Bosque del lobo was a little spanish masterpiece but this movie is a pathetic waste. Bad acting (The lead female actress was last seen in another bad spanish production, Beyond Re- animator, a terrible sequel to the cult classic from the 80´s)and direction (take a look to his terrible boring first film, Second name), and more than dissapointing visuals, this film is good for one thing: curing insomnia. I will like to know why this Elsa pataky is a big new sex symbol in Spain. She´s petty but that´s it really. Her acting is one of the worst ever. And Julian Sands, who does remember him? Exactly. Where is John Landis when you need him? 2 out of 10.
