This movie should be seen by every person who believes him or herself to be an enlightened intellectual. It functions to assist the viewer in truly understanding not only the culture pervading the southern United States, but also compels the self exploration necessary for achieving an awareness of one's inner personality. Duvall presents an undeniable and powerful image not only of a man torn, but of a man simultaneously driven and assured. One need not be deeply religious to revel, if in nothing else, the extraordinary acting talents of this man. Duvall's angry conversation with God in his bedroom, alone, is a case study in his exceptional acting ability, and the emotion and tenderness which characterizes Christianity's best features is present throughout. Frequently I found myself watching a particular scene with my jaw dropped, silently admiring everything this role meant to Duvall, and marveling in the magnificence of its execution. The movie is, and I've no doubt will remain, a lifetime favorite of mine. It represents what movies should, occasionally at least, be: events, events that make you think, think about yourself, think your place in the world, and the powerful and meaningful institutions which so often influence our lives.
