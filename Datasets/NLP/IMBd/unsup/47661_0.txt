Well no points for completely ripping off any of the Friday 13th movies i'm afraid. Yes sir-ee-bob, they really pulled the wool over my eyes when they added 'lake' to the end of camp crystal. Even 'camp monkey face' has a more original sound to it. I didn't want this review to turn into a scathing attack...but there are several things that producers need to be aware of when making a horror movie on a summer camp; <br /><br />1.The name has to be original. 2.The 'camp counsellors' should be younger than 75, and should have some (relevant) acting skills. 3.There should be some randy teenagers sneaking out to the barn every 20-30mins for some nookie, whilst possibly being caught, sliced and diced. 4. The death scenes should contain at least a little violence and possibly some ketchup or another condiment of some kind -not just 'madman marz' casually strolling toward the victim and then a shot of their face releasing a few insipid yells.<br /><br />After watching 'Slaughterhouse'(which i recommend) - i remember the cold October evening i ordered 'madman', i really thought i had found another rare gem, but luck was not on my side that night, oh no! and i guess it wasn't on the side of whoever bought it from me, but that's another story i guess. <br /><br />Please don't tell me it's a classic - just because it was made in the early 80's. My advice - the next time you feel the urge to view a movie of this calibre, make some spaghetti bolognese and put it on your head and do your best impression of Axel Rose.<br /><br />You would have to be a madman/woman to watch this movie.
