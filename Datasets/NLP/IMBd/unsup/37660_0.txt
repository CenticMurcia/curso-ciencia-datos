I had high hopes for Kakashi. Much to my disappointment Kakashi failed to be scary. But it did succeed in being a bit boring. The director tries very hard to create a feeling of suspense but is unable to follow through. The movie does have several moments where the suspense potential is very high but the director seems to feel the need to rush through it. As far as the acting goes I thought that Maho Nonami & Kou Shibasaki did very well considering what they had to work with story wise. The music was good and much creepier then the story. The storyline also left me with more questions at the end of the movie. I just feel that more should have been explained. I hope that the comic was better written then the movie.
