I do not agree at all with the comment made about this film as I find it even malicious and narrow-minded. Who the hell cares if the film lacks structure or pacing? The most important thing is that real facts are well-presented and narrated very clearly. Regarding humour, I am afraid there's no room for humour in here. I recommend to whoever wrote that awful review to go and check out the latest Jim Carrey's film if he or she is looking for some humour. Unfortunately, I suspect that the author of such one-sided point of view cannot tolerate anything that does not come out of Hollywood whose films are indeed well-structured, well-paced and contain humour but at the same time are mostly idiotic, shallow and meaningless.
