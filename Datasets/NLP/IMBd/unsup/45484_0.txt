I didn't see this movie at all. But i'm writing this comments just to make sure that tiger user (the one that left a message before me) don't make the mistake again of telling people that NINE QUEENS was a British movie. Nine Queens was a great Argentinian film, and then there were, of course, remakes of this first movie because of it big success. But all the credits are Argentinian's. I'm proud to said this and i don't want people to think that is from a hole other country. Well, that's all. I don't have anything else to say, except: You have to see the original one. That was a hit. There are some things you may not understand, because are local people codes, but everything in the Nine Queens movie is excellent, from the scrip to the finish song and the titles; everything.<br /><br />PS: Sorry about my English. I hope i'd understood what i said.
