I hated this film. I was forced to go watch it with some friends that hate me now because they heard me sware. Doesn't this crap ever get old Nickolodeon. Nickolodeon really needs to bring back Ren & Stimpy real bad. Nicktoons is dieing off now and thats a good thing because nicktoons disirves to die for banning Ren & Stimpy. That was down right cold man. So avoid this movie with all you got. I'm not saying this movie is bad because they banned Ren & Stimpy. NO that's only half of it. There cartoons are just plain old crap now. Even back then I actually didn't mind the rugrats. I would rather watch the grass grow for the next 4 years than have to watch this again.
