"Gremlins" is a strange, disgusting, twisted, demented, bizarre, funny, and violence-packed comedy. See what they can fit into an hour and a half? "Gremlins" is a down-right genuine classic. It's all about an inventor dad who buys a fuzzy-wuzzy creature for his son that will make you say, "Can I have one?". But after the first half-hour, you say, "I never want one of those things!" Why? (WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILER!) Because the three rules that were supposed to be followed are accidentally broken, and more fuzzy creatures pop up and then later turn into despicable and gruesome monsters.<br /><br />You'll get more laughs than you expected were in such a violent movie. I hope that you love this movie as much as I did and still do. 10/10
