Oh I loved this movie!! It was so exciting!! It seemed like John and Karen were never going to escape. It was, however, a little bit exaggerated about all the horrors that the poor couple lived there. The character of Poe was cartoonish. But the film was so enjoyable. I can't wait to see the sequel!!
