the entire movie was predictable. the "surprise ending" was a running joke i had as i watched it with my wife. for the most part, the entire movie was a running joke, really. my wife and i moaned and groaned our way through this sub-par plot and pitiful acting. i can't think of a good reason to watch this, unless maybe i had a friend playing a part, but then he/she would never hear the end of it. i do not suggest watching this movie unless you have some time to waste that you will never need back. i'd rather watch "COPS". i now know the value of checking with IMDb as to whether or not a movie is worth watching. i should have just played video games.....
