Blame it on me, but the only reason I wanted to see this film for was that Nastassja Kinski plays in it. So for this alone it justifies being fixed at the screen for 90 minutes...but for the rest? I really wouldn't know.... It all starts with Wesley Snipes who travels from LA to New York to see his sick buddy Charlie who is seropositive. Wesley has a perfect familylife, two kids, a dog and a lovely wife Ming-Na. Everything goes fine till he misses his flight and bumps onto Karen (Nastassja Kinski, with blonde hair this time!). Everything is innocent (they go to an opera) till they are robbed and madame Kinski begs him to stay the night with her as she's still dead afraid. And of course it happens... You can't blame Snipes, Ming-Na....it's Nastassja, remember? The day after Wesley flies back home and his life changes...the most interesting part of the movie by the way as the dog smells something...! Look I could go on and tell you the whole movie but that wouldn't be fair. Nothing more interesting happens and if it does it is pure Hollywood-nonsense (the last 10 minutes are even completely stupid). "One night stand" certainly isn't a bad movie, it even doesn't bore one minute, but it's just a bit too empty and you can't blame the actors as Wesley Snipes plays his role perfect but actors are bound to the script, a script that is a bit too much like those telemovies that are based on true stories. Watch it but expect nothing, expect...well you know!
