This movie is most certainly in my top three of all time movies. I can surely understand why people wouldn't appreciate it but you have to watch it with some understanding and you have to realize its dramatic touch. Winterbottom, did a fantastic job with this movie and it's outstanding soundtrack. Honestly, you have to say that this ost. is absolutely amazing and touching Please go on making more movies which are unique in its kind
