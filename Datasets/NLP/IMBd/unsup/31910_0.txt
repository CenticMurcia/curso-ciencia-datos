It's quite laughable and sometimes even ludicrous when seemingly uneducated, or at the very least, unknowing and uncultured individuals write a comment that is nothing more than trite, shallow, insubstantial, and crude in the hopes that they will sound intelligent or even worth reading. The previous detractor obviously has no appreciation for the principle and the genius behind the creation of the story of the Legion of Superheroes. The original concept was a virtual fertile breeding ground for the creative ideas of writers seeking to birth their own ideas of how a superhero should be, plus the environment provides for an exaggerated interaction between supposed complex relationships of characters. The story of the Legion of Superheroes also gives an insight into the sheer heroism of Superman Prime back when he was still quite heroic and not tainted with the insanity that made him into an intergalactic scourge. If only more people would actually spend more time trying to read about the origin and classical stories of the Legion rather than base the entire concept on the series. Alas, not everyone is gifted with a brain. Too bad.
