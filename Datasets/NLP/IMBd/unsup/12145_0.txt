Wallace Shawn discussing the concept that someone flirted with him at a party! Ha ha ha. He he he. Ho ho ho. Good one.<br /><br />The main problem with this is that it takes 45 minutes for them to say anything that means anything. Prior to that, it is just pompous celibacy.<br /><br />Around the 45th minute, it begins to discuss NY and NYers. Having lived in Manhattan for 6 years, I have to agree with all the nasty things they have to say about NY, NYers, & their dominant shallowness and hypocrisy. Beyond that, there are other honest truths here, but the reality is that the people who will give this a "10" are the exact people who these truths are most honest about. Hypocrisy defined.<br /><br />If you gave it a 10, go pay $10,000 to be castrated. You need to feel something.
