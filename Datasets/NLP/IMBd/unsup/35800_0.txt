I just recently purchased this movie Snake People, and when finished I was just as confused as at the beginning. Snakes were used for shock value, but after six or more times it sorta lost its punch. I hope poor Karloff was paid well for this gig. I can't complain too much, I got a double feature, "SABAKA" being the other, almost as bad for a buck. <br /><br />The young lieutenant swaggered around with his uniform tunic unbuttoned with the supposedly spit and polish colonel never saying a word to him about it. All in all it was pretty bad,but the color was great.The dubbing was fair at best, but Karloff carried his part very well. I'm sure he was glad he could wear a mask through a lot of the movie. His role was almost comical rather than scary. I managed to sleep very well that night unlike some of his movies.
