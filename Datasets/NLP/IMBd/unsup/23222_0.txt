The WWE's 19th annual Royal Rumble event was truly atrocious. The event will only be remembered for one thing, Rey Mysterio's shock victory in the 30 man over the top rope battle royal. Whilst the Royal Rumble match itself was as entertaining as always the undercard, much like New Years Revolution a few weeks previous, was utterly dire.<br /><br />The only notable happening from the undercard was Gregory Helms jumping ship from Raw to Smackdown when he won the WWE Cruiserweight Championship invitational.<br /><br />Mickie James battling Ashley with Trish Stratus as the special guest referee would be a match best left for Raw. It had no place on one of the big four. The match was bad. Mickie won but I don't think anyone really cares.<br /><br />JBL has been billed as the longest running WWE Champion in ten years. So why in the hell did he fall to The Boogeyman in such short time? This could have single handedly demolished JBL's credibility and heaven knows it took long enough for the fans to accept him in the first place.<br /><br />Then came the Royal Rumble itself. Why it was so low down the card I do not know. Like I said earlier, an entertaining affair with Mysterio coming out on top after coming in at number 2 and going all the way. I still think it would have made more sense for Randy Orton to win the match but hell, what do I know. Triple H also put on a great performance coming in at number 1 and going to the final three. Another entertaining part of the match was Shawn Michaels being eliminated from behind by Shane McMahon.<br /><br />The WWE Championship was on the line when Edge defended against John Cena. The match was average and nothing more. Cena won and thus making Edge the "Transitional Champion" he did not want to be known as. What a terrible first Championship reign for Edge. The only decent thing coming from it was his TLC match with Ric Flair on Raw.<br /><br />And then the last match of the night. The good news? It involved Kurt Angle. The bad news? It also involved Mark Henry. Christ, I can't stand this useless waste of space. The match was terrible but still better than I expected. Angle won, which we all knew would happen anyway. As did the crowd in the American Airlines Arena, Miami Florida who started to filter out before the match had finished. This was a pity because they missed The Undertakers return at the end of the show to challenge Kurt Angle for the World Heavyweight Championship. The Dead Man demolished the ring with lighting bolts. Just a pity he hadn't done it before Mark Henry was due to wrestle.<br /><br />One of the worse events I have ever watched in WWE history. One to avoid.
