Robert Altman's wry, tongue-in-cheek and sarcastic look at a pair of high school age nerds who are so far out of the daily loop of their peers they actually believe they are cool, hip, and much admired.<br /><br />Although some of the comedic hi-jinks of the two boys seem mean spirited, by the end of the film they have had sufficient doses of reality so that the viewer feels these kids might not be the obnoxious little monsters they seemed to be throughout much of the film.<br /><br />Bonding first with each other, then eventually with people outside their narrow world, O.C. & Stiggs manage to grow up a considerable amount during their self proclaimed summer of madness.<br /><br />It amazes me that so many people dislike this film. At its core, it is a sweet, wonderful little comedy. <br /><br />
