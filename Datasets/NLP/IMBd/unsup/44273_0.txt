This is just another movie in that well-trodden genre of "Mysterious aliens intend to take over the planet". It adds a unique twist or two to the plot, but nothing you couldn't have predicted in the first reel.<br /><br />Plot: so-so. Effects: basically non-existent. Characters: With the exception of the detective, nobody you'll really care much about.<br /><br />If you need some sci-fi background noise, this movie will do just fine. But if you're looking for entertainment, you'd do far better to go outside and watch the birds.<br /><br />By the way: CD-RW discs are silver, not green/blue. The green/blue ones can't be re-written.
