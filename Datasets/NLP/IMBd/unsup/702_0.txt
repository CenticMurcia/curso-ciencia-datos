This movie ain't bad. A mob boss going to the shrink is actually a very good idea. But I don't think this movie explores the idea in the most interesting manner. I would enjoy this movie more if it were more like the<br /><br />tv-series Sopranos. But I suppose that comparison is an invalid one. What the hell, it's Billy Crystal and Robert De Niro!
