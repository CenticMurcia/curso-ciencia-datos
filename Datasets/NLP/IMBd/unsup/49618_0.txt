Before I even start I have to tell you that I had to stop watching the movie before it was over because it was THAT terrible. there's a bunch of people in ireland, and there's a puppy that's about to be drowned, and all of a sudden they move to africa, and the same people are all there, and people whip their servants, and dogs fight with imprisoned baboons, and oh there's a love story, too. and lots and lots of animal violence. you know those family-type movies they show you in elementary school that are all about the sepia tones and the people on farms who do senseless things? well, this is like those, but worse. far, far worse. family movie my toe.
