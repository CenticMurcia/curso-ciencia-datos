As a single 20-something I've had to watch seemingly hundreds of romantic comedies with girlfriends. "It Had to Be You" is probably the only one I would consider watching again.<br /><br />I was half asleep when this movie came on Turner Classic Movies this afternoon. I've been trashcan-by-the-couch sick all week, so what's been on the TV is a complete blur.<br /><br />Before I could cycle through what was on the DVR, the movie had gotten its hooks in me. When I got up and ran urgently to the bathroom I did something I never do: I hit 'pause.' I'm probably a dream subject for people marketing to the 21- to 35-year-old bracket. I like violence, video games, electric guitars and scantily-clad women. None of these things are in "It Had to Be You," but it kept me entertained anyway.<br /><br />It's not a classic by any means, but this movie is solid. Its humor carries through 60 years later and the actors felt right for their roles. Also, the story is believable in its unbelievability - I still like to think my kindergarten-crush will pop up and be right for me.<br /><br />The movie also has that post-war wholesomeness that's hard to describe. There are a lot things left unsaid in the film that would be brought up in a modernized version, mainly about a live-in male friend who is not the fianc√©. As it stands it feels fresh compared to the last half-dozen romantic-comedies I begrudgingly saw in theaters.<br /><br />If you want to see a quality, lighthearted, funny and fantastic 40s-era movie, then check this one out next time it's on TCM.
