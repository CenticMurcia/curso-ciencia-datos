Let's start off by saying that i didn't expect much from this picture. A guy I don't really know from work told me it was funny. It was playing at the 4 dollar theater and I had about 2 hours to kill. It was actually was worse than I expected it to be and I was expecting low, really low, but seriously I wanted to walk out. However I was only there to kill time so I sat through every last painful second. First thing is, and you get this from the opening scene, that this can't just be a comedy.No, it feels a need to falsely become something greater than that by trying to portray some kind of racy cop flick. The kind of movie where everybody is in the FBI but nobody's doing much of anything. The terrible thing is that they really expect you to go along with it.<br /><br />If this flim-flam plotline wasn't enough you've got Eddie Griffin, a black comedian who expects you to laugh just because of the fact that he's black.<br /><br />He's black! He's loud! He's....a terrible stereotype jammed into a two dimensional character. For those of you that thought Spike Lee was too far-fetched in Bamboozled take a look at this movie and see that our society is not far off from a new millenium minstrel show,it's pretty much right here only in different form. Of course you've also got your most recent up to date humor that won't last even five years. ie " Do I look like Puffy?!" when people forget about Puffy they won't know what the hell this quote means,but if people are smart enough they will let this film and others like it just fade away. Orlando Jones actually shows some potential in acting and in some comedy. However, something tells me that he won't be bold enough to take a challenging role anytime soon. Overall this was extremely painful for me to watch. Maybe I should be happy that comedies featuring black leads are no longer trying to copy 'FRIDAY'(a great film,in my opinion) yet still they're gonna have to try harder than this.
