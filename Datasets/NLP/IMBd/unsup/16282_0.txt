There were so many things wrong I cannot remember them all. But if you, like me, have read the stories several times and remember them reasonably well, you will not like this one. 1) Holmes did not smoke opium, he disliked it and thought it was dangerous. He said so in "Man with the Twisted Lip" and also in another story. 2)Holmes never used drugs during a case. 3)He would never just sit and wait for a killer to strike, he would think about the facts! 4)He had great respect for Watson and would not be so rude or callous to him 5)The family of the murdered girl would not be attending a ball, even if royalty were there. They were in mourning! Victorian society was strict about that. 6)This is supposed to be 1901 or so based on the reigning royalty. Holmes looked a little too young. 7)A woman trained in psychoanalysis??? Even Americans had their limits! I'm sure I could think of more.<br /><br />There were some good points, Everet looked like Holmes, Costumes were wonderful. He acted out Holmes' flair for the dramatic well. Nice touch to throw lines from the Canon in there ("disliked and distrusted women" during the dinner party; cannot make bricks without clay etc.) But I shudder to think what liberties this writer/director would take with one of the original stories!
