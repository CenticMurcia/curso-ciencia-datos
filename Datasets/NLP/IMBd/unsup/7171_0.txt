I, for one, thought it was a solid, Gothic tale that sad, high school girls will absolutely adore. Izabela Miko and Austin Nichols are great as the star-crossed, darkly romantic leads and the mood and tone throughout the entire film. Art direction is good and the cinematography is well done. The breakout role has to be Beth Grant, who really is a delight as the rigid, creepy disciplinarian assistant. Now, if you are looking for an adaptation of the classic Poe tale, then you'll be disappointed. It's a re-imagining, not like Baz Lurman's ROMEO & JULIET. Instead it is very influenced by Hammer films. All in all, I would consider it a good DVD to check out.
