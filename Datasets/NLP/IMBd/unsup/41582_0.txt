This movie was terrible. The dubbing was terrible but ignorable. The plot was OK, but I had to register an account here because people are saying that Sopkiw's character was the hero. He was not!<br /><br />First off, sometime in the movie a car breaks down, but we're never told why. In a deleted scene we find out that it was because a chubby guy sat on the bonnet and blew the tyres. Yes, that's plural - "tyres". No, not just two. Four. A guy sits on a car - that he was sitting INSIDE in a previous scene - and blows all four tyres. WTF?<br /><br />Next, they're in the jungle and there's cannibals around. A guy makes a fire so he can steam off some leeches from one of the women. Another woman yelps because she sat next to a snake. The guy has a go at her because she could give their position away - as the smoke from HIS fire billows everywhere!<br /><br />So this guy gets half his leg eaten by piranhas. Our 'hero' jumps in the water and nurses the wound! Then some other guy kills the wounded guy because otherwise he'd die a slow and painful death. Our 'hero' didn't like this, he must have wanted the poor guy to suffer, so he starts a fight - and they decide to jump into the piranha water to have this fight...<br /><br />Later, the two girls have been separated from the rest and kidnapped by cannibals. Our 'hero' catches up and spies from behind a rock. Meanwhile, a cannibal chief has started to cut open one of the girls' chests. Our 'hero' decides that now might be a good idea to do something, so, as we hear the poor girl screaming in the background, he starts to load his gun, taking all the time in the world!<br /><br />Our 'hero' and the two girls then get taken captive by some evil miners. The 'hero' is tied up in a pig pen as the leader of the miners takes one of the girls into his cabin to rape her. As we hear he screams and the commotion from inside, 'hero' decides that now might be a good time to escape, and escape he does. And hides. That's right, he leaves her in there and doesn't appear until the next day. Nice move. You must really hate these women!<br /><br />Now for the showdown between the 'hero' and the minor leader. Imagine two men standing ten feet apart, one holding a spear ('good' guy) and one holding a gun with one bullet left (bad guy). There is a rattlesnake next to the man with the gun. "Make your choice", our fearless 'hero' says. Well I don't know about you but if I was the bad guy with one bullet left, I'd step away from the snake and shoot the other guy. This doesn't happen, of course. He shoots the snake and the 'good' guy shoves the spear through his chest.<br /><br />Finally, and let's overlook that the remaining girl has been put into a cage with 2-foot gaps that she could easily slip through, our 'hero' creates a diversion, sending all the miners out of the camp, bar the main bad guy, whom he kills. Now he can finally rescue the girl, whom he has already let be raped through-out the night, right? Wrong. He decides to spend his time lying dynamite at the entrance to the camp for when the miners return. And return they do, and when they see their leader dead on the ground and the girl still in the cage, they start shooting at her. Bullets ricochet off and split the wooden bars as our 'hero' is casually sitting back next to the detonator. Moments go by and I saw at least two bullets hit inches from her head. We flick back to our 'hero', who is casually sitting back in a chair smoking a cigarette, as we hear more bullets being fired right at the girl, then finally he decides to push the detonator painfully slowly to blow up the remaining bad guys.<br /><br />At least he releases her from the cage. You'd expect her to be so pee'd off at him now, having let her be raped the entire night, and sat idly by as a dozen men shoot at her, but no, she says she loves him and they kiss!<br /><br />Man, he must REALLY hate that woman.
