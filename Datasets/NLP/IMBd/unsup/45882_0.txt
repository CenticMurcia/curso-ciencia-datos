No wonder Mandy Moore hasn't made a film in a year and a half. Because I Said So and License To Wed, her last two films, were both misfires. License To Wed tells the many times told story of a young couple deciding to get married and then facing all the potential obstacles along the way. It's primarily Robin Williams' film, but he's so obnoxious and never believable as a reverend for one minute. As another reviewer said, why does every character turn into a moron in these movies? John Krasinski was the only one who thought the reverend was over the top with his antics, and the script made it obvious that Krasinski was a fool for saying this. I fell asleep in the middle of the day watching this nonsense. Most of the supporting cast is wasted in roles beneath their talents. Only the young sidekick "reverend in training" comes off as interesting, and his character should have been developed more. Watch the DVD extra about choirboy, and viewers will see what I mean. This was a teen choice award nominee for best chick flick, and it shows. It's a bubble-headed movie with a bad script and little substance. Moore's career is sinking fast. * of 4 stars.
