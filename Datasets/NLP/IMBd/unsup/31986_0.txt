Not only have many of the comments on this page mentioned Marisa Tomei's acting chops, the only thing that should be chopped (besides that horribly fake and unbelievable "head in the fridge", are the microphones that you see in just about every other scene. At one point, there are 3 microphones above each character in the same family kitchen where said fake head lies in a pool of ketchup. Marisa is on the telephone, and it looks like a big black adult toy is about to smack Ms. Tomei in the noggin. Now, this is only in the HD version, so let's say the microphones weren't there. THIS MOVIE STILL BLOWS!!! Like I said, things are chopped, Marisa Tomei's acting chops are not part of this "film", if we can call it that. We can replace her with a robot and get the same quality of emotion. Perhaps she was in a financial pinch, and needed the quick cash to keep up on the payments of her Land Rover. Put this flick on the chopping block, watch The Wrestler, and perhaps then you'll remember why Ms. Tomei is an actress, and you may get a bit more enjoyment out of that film than this horribly edited, scripted, and cinematic disaster. Shame on Ariel Vromen, who needs to go back to NYU, shouldn't have transferred to LA Film School, and needs to stick to dark comedy, rather than supposed dark films that lack intensity or research. To see better works from Arial Vromen, check out Rx, starring Colin Hanks. I prescribe that Vromen stick to writing his own scripts, as Joshua Leibner wrote this script, which is flimsy, and not worthy of Tomei.
