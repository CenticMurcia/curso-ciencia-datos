It's fantastic that the network hired some "social media marketing" team to come in and write 9- and 10-star reviews for this piece of crap. Notice how the first 4-5 reviews are all stellar, and yet the people who actually just finished watching it on the first run of the broadcast schedule are hard pressed to give it even 2 stars.<br /><br />Bad movie. Some good acting, which was impressive considering the script they had to work with. The other reviews have pointed out the endless inconsistencies and mistakes. The only thing I could add was the painful monologue at the end about how "we misuse technology." Um, no, idiot, Andromeda was from the FUTURE, therefore our technology saved us, it had nothing to do with causing the accident.
