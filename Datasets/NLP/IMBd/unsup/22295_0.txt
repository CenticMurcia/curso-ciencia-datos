***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** This is what British comedy is all about. To be honest i didn't even know about Red Dwarf until about five years ago, now i have Series I-VIII (all of them) on DVD. The best series, in my opinion, is series 3. I'll never forget listers shrinking underpants in the episode: 'polymorph'. My favourite character is Lister as he is the one with most of the jokes.<br /><br />Series I: This is when it all started but it only has one of the classics, that being 'Future Echoes' which is one of my favourite episodes. Dave Lister gets put into Stasis for smuggling an unquarentined animal (a cat) on board Red Dwarf and in the mean time, the crew dies from a lethal dose of 'calcium 2' due to a damaged drive plate. 3 million years later he is revived by Holly, the ships computer, and is left with a hologram of his bunk-mate and a creature who evolved from his pregnant cat for company.<br /><br />Series II: This series had more jokes than the original and expanded the series with most of the episodes being away from the mother ship as all Episodes from I were set aboard 'Red Dwarf' and the first mini ship was introduced: 'Blue Midget'.<br /><br />Series III: This is the best series of the show, with every episode being a classic, in my mind. 'Polymorph' has to be the best episode ever as the jokes just keep coming and again 'marooned' expands on Rimmer and Lister. 'backwards' is again a brilliant idea, they finally arrive on Earth, after going through a 'time hole', to find time's running backwards, also a new version of Holly is introduced when he performs a head swap operation on himself to become a woman, and a new character joins the crew, a service mechanoid: Kryten and a new mini craft called 'Starbug' <br /><br />Series IV: This is one of the somewhat weaker series but doesn't mean that it's not a good one. my favourite episode from this series is 'Meltdown' where they arrive on a planet where they meet historical figures made of wax but look and act like real people. they are soon put to war by Rimmer who takes charge of the heroes while a wax Hitler takes charge of the villains, Also Ace Rimmer, a more likable Rimmer, arrives from another Dimension.<br /><br />Series V: This series follows III closely as it contains loads of classics like the best villain the dwarfers have come across to date: The Inquisitor and the introduction of the fan favourite 'Back to Reality' episode that contains the introduction of 'Duane Dibbley' and another great episode called 'Quarentine' that brings us the killer penguin: 'Mr. Flibble' <br /><br />Series VI: This is again one of the great series, despite the Mothership and Holly not appearing at all in this Series. This is where we yet again see 'Duane Dibbley' and Lister marries a gelf in exchange for a vital engine part, screaming as he runs away: 'Change of plan...LEG IT!' and a special appearance from Ainsley Harriot from 'Can't Cook, Won't Cook'. also we see Ace Rimmer again. This award winning series also provides the brilliant western episode:'Gunmen of the Apocalypse' <br /><br />Series VII: This is the weakest series in the show, mostly because of Chris Barrie's (Rimmer) departure from the show, to concentrate on 'Brittas Empire'. The writers brought in a less funny character: 'Kristine Kochanski', Lister's long lost love who died upon Red Dwarf with the rest of the crew but is brought from a parallel dimension. The Rimmer actor was written out in the second episode: 'Stoke Me A Clipper', when Rimmer leaves to become Ace Rimmer. this episode is the best in VII followed closely by 'Tikka To Ride'. Kryten's famous catch-phrase is also introduced: 'YOU'RE LYING'. Lister is also infected by a virus which is beaten by the sacrifice if his arm.<br /><br />Series VIII: This is the final series when 'Starbug' is finally destroyed after a series of crashes in it's previous series and the crew is resurrected by nanobots (small robots) along with Red Dwarf and the dwarfers are placed in Jail along with the resurrected Rimmer as Chris Barrie Returns. The luck and sexual magnetism virus is re-introduced from Series V and a T-Rex called Pete shows up and the show goes out on a high with a cliffhanger in the last episode:'Only the Good...' This show belongs in Comedy's hall of fame and appeals to all ages. It shows what British comedy is capable of, A true classic!
