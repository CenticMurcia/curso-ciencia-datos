This is a stunning film that covers the oil question in a way never viewed before. What impressed me was the calm factual reasoning/questioning/answering/reviewing without the emotional drama normally associated with going to the cinema. <br /><br />This film filled in many gaps, that really made sense to me of what was going on and has been going on for a very long time. It has impressed me so much that I have started going back to review history because of all the questions it has raised for me. <br /><br />This film puts into perspective and also gives me many answers for the bloodshed carried out in many of the wars of the last century, and continuing into this century. When you have seen it there is a recognition, as when you get news/information/diagnosis that makes you go AH ! That explains it !<br /><br />For me it was like getting an economic clinical diagnosis - of an economic terminal illness. And these are the reasons why.... And we've ignored all the symptoms...... And all the indicators...... And now with the best will in the world we will probably still have a huge decline, before things can get better, if they ever will...... <br /><br />But - by doing nothing we will have an economic meltdown.<br /><br />By waking up and taking action - by making sure those in charge take action, we can slow the process and ensure that developing countries need to divert into renewable energy rather than old energy (oil) to achieve their aspirations.<br /><br />There is a lot that can be done, starting with the reasons why that are portrayed in this film. It is absolutely amazing to see such a film on a big screen - but I must remember that this is real - this is our lives/lifestyles we are watching going up in smoke. While cinema is the vehicle, but this is not a film about make believe - in fact it is doing the opposite of what films are normally about and using itself as a means to get us to believe. <br /><br />This is my honest reaction so far after having seen this film only once over a week ago. Initially I thought it a bit repetitive, but afterward I was glad as it has made it memorable, to the point that I can't let it drop. I look at everything differently and through a different value system. It really is like you hear of how people re-evaluate after getting a diagnosis of a terminal illness - that is what this film has done for me. I can't wait to get hold of a copy of the DVD.<br /><br />It is the best film I have ever seen - and the title couldn't have been better !
