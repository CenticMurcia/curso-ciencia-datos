(There might be a little tiny spoiler here)<br /><br />Plot -- Arnold Schwarzenegger plays a disgraced cop who finds a chance for redemption by taking on an assignment to infiltrate a Chicago mob. He finds himself in danger of getting in over his head with this role-playing, especially after getting involved with a woman.<br /><br />Critique -- Not long after I popped this one in, I could see why "Raw Deal" is one of the star's least-regarded films. It's almost completely devoid of the wit and energy that we've come to expect of his best work. Although there's a fair amount of action, none if it is really exciting or memorable, certainly not on par with anything in the "Terminator" films (or even "Eraser", for that matter). In fact, it often seems more like something from the Cannon Films stable than a vehicle for one of the world's top superstars. The script is muddled and unfocused, with a subplot about the hero's alcoholic wife being introduced and dropped abruptly. Irvin's direction is flat and unenergetic, and even Arnold can't enliven the dreary proceedings (though he tries). Reportedly, he only accepted the role to fulfill a contractual obligation, which certainly explains his lack of care in choosing this particular project. In the end, it's safe to say that this is one film that would have been out of print for ages if not for the his presence. Unless you feel you have to watch everything he's done, just skip this dud and rent "Predator" or "Terminator 2."<br /><br />Rating: (*1/2) out of four<br /><br />Released by De Laurentiis Entertainment
