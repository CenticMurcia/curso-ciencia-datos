the most catastrophic result in Christie's TV movie story! Dr Sheppard, the world-famous ambiguous narrator of the story, doesn't narrate anything at all, and he do not collaborate in any way with poirot .His role is completely sucked by Inspector japp, and so the highly celebrated Agatha Christie's final twist is deprived of any sense.The tender relationship among Dr Sheppard and his sister,the psychological key of the novel, is substituted by a silly shooting in a chemical factory, as in a Batman film(but of course without special effects) and by the absurd murder of the butler.Certainly the worst screenplay in a series duly highly praised for the excellent Suchet, but not certainly for the uneven quality of the screenwriters,throwing usually in their scripts Labour party marches or speed water records with no sense or relations with the story they must to adapt.
