This film is good for two things,<br /><br />1, a drinking game made up by a couple of us. what you do is get yourself a bottle of spirits and watch the film. Every time you cringe at a particularly awful line of dialogue, you take a shot. (you'll be hammered in no time) 2. Like the goats man, its good for inflicting on your unsuspecting friends.<br /><br />you have all been warned. <br /><br />There is only one let up in this atrocious mess. which i will not spoil for you here, but for the most part its just one terrible scene after another that it really becomes difficult to watch. Everyone involved should be embarrassed.
