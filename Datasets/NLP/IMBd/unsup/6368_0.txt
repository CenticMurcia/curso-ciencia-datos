This is one of the best horror flicks any one in their right mind could endure. Its lower than low budget and is a masterpiece of both no budget and expliotation cinema. The actors are amazing with some coming out of retirement to act in this. Sitting in his wheelchair the amazing Dr Frankenstien outsmarts a very scary and very black Dracula! The scene is amazing, Dracula is invited into the home but that crafty Dr has placed a mirror on the roof so he can see (or not see) Draculas reflection!! When Dracula realises he has been tricked the 'oh f*uck' look on his face is pure acting genius!!! There are many scenes of joy but to list them would be to destroy a film that you have not seen.<br /><br />"When a man comes into my house and casts no reflection....." What a scene!!!!!! Listen to all the Dr's lines in the film, you can hear his dentures clackin around!!!! This is an amazing decision by the director and gives the feeling of unease and terror one would expect from a production of this calibre perfectly.!!! A must see!!!!
