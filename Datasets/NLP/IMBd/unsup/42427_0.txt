I just saw the movie on Dutch TV. Unfortunately I did miss the first quarter of an hour. I think the movie described well enough how a US military action can fail. In reality it did really fail. But from what I saw only the US side of the conflict was showed. Maybe good for the US viewers, but a bit stupid for European viewers. People all over the world aren't monkeys anymore, as we believed in past centuries. They are even as proud as some US citisens are and that's what ore small world keep spinning around. In my country there are a lot of people that want to see both sides of a developing conflict, especially when killing is involved. I red comments from outside this site over this movie. I met there the word "war porno" and I read about the economic interest of the US in Somalia. Leaving the portraits of the opponent soldiers behind, except just one and leaving the economic question behind makes this movie to an McDonald food, cheap and fast food for the mind. And why a four on the scale of ten: I saw it as an anti war movie.
