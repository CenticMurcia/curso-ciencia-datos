I recently bought this movie without knowing or hearing anything about it. Yes, I sometimes do that. And I can gladly say the choice I made was a good one exchanging my 13 dollars for a round plastic disc.<br /><br />Through the movie it was pretty obvious to me that they wanted to save the big reveal for the end. I don't know if this is what they really intended to but I saw it coming all along. Though one might find it pretty easy to pick out where this movie is going, there are still surprises for those who think they have it figured out.<br /><br />This movie also made me feel squeamish at times. I don't really get like that when watching movies. But this movie sure as well did just that.<br /><br />Overall a good watch for someone who is into independent movies and want to see some real, raw, gritty imagery.
