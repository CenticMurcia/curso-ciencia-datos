This should be worst depiction of a HP novel. I actually felt bored to sit through the movie. So many plot holes and so much disconnection!!! I am fine with change, I don't ask the movie to exactly replicate the book. But the essence should not still be missed. This movie should not be about the adolescence of the characters but the journey into LV's past. How can anyone pull off the next movie w/o actually setting up any key plots needed for it? How can Harry complete his mission in the next part if he never actually saw any clues in part6? People say that we should not be comparing the movie with the book. But how anyone explain the burrow being burnt down? What it its significance in the story? And how corny is Ginny tying Harry's shoe laces. I felt like, where am I? what am I doing here? Even by a teen flick standards, this is bad.<br /><br />I am not sure whether Steve Kloves even read part 7 of the book properly, what with the mundane screenplay and pointless plots of this movie. I guess he is planning to slay part7 down too. And even worse there will be 2 parts to this nonsense.
