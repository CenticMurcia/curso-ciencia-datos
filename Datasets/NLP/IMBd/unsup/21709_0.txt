Excellent story, scenery, characters and acting. Our whole family watched it including my 5 yr. old grandson. It really opened my eyes to different Native American people and customs. Years ago I read and enjoyed the fiction, series books about Native Americans by Paul Joseph Lederer. Dreamkeeper helped me visualize Native American life. When this movie is available for sale I want to buy and put in our DVD library.
