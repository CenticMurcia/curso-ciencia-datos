Zohan is a Special Agent from Israel, but his dream is to be a hairdresser. Decided to pursuit his dream, he fakes his death during the pursuit of a rival agent named "Phantom" and goes to America, precisely New York. He has a lot of problems to get a job in a salon, until he is hired to work in the salon of a Palestinian woman named Dalia. Proving to have talent as a stylist and pleasing old ladies with sex, Zohan makes a lot of success, specially among the elder women. He also meets Michael, a guy who eventually becomes his friend and offers Zohan his house to stay for sometime. But Zohan's fame will bring him some problems too, and after he falls in love with Dalia, a big confusion is going to start.<br /><br />This movie is the worst thing I saw in 2008. It is boring,annoying and I didn't even had the nerves to watch until it ended. It's so Lame!! Why Adam Sandler would make a horrible movie like that is beyond my comprehension,specially because he has a potential to be a much better comedian then that! They tried to copy the Borat formula of a hairy naive foreigner from a middle east country with a strong accent, but they didn't have the same success in doing that.<br /><br />Nobody should watch this movie, unless they want to suffer for almost 2 hours of boredom and stupidity.
