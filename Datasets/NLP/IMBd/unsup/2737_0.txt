I was in the 4th grade when this series came out. I bought the "planet of the apes" magazine every month and read it cover to cover... I was very, very much a Planet of the Apes (POTA) fanatic. I remember learning that POTA was coming to TV and was beside myself with joy. It was the greatest TV event of all time as far as I was concerned. But even at that young age, I was only half way through that first episode when I realized that it was really, really bad. The idea that I was going to be able to have POTA on TV...at home!...was amazing to me. I wanted to like it and was willing to forgive all sorts of junk, but I couldn't do it. I watched each episode, but it really felt like work to sit through. It was just bad, bad mid-70's TV that had people in ape suits. I would compare it to a Starsky and Hutch sort of thing, but that was a much better show!
