Whoa! This movie was bad. I can't believe how the DVD box in my local video store totally contradicted the actual movie itself. However, I won't claim false advertising. I was a sucker and blew about $2.00 Canadian to rent this thing. $2.00 that could have gone towards something far more useful, like bent paper clips or defective elastic bands. DO NOT BE TEMPTED BY THE MOVIE BOX. THIS IS A TERRIBLE FILM. The acting is wooden, the audio is worse. You really do not care what happens to the characters. It has already been mentioned that the idea was good, but it was not done right. I agree. The people who made this film did have a good idea and could have done a lot more with it.
