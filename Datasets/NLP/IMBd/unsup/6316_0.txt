I don't know what was up with that other guys comment. It's intellectual rants like that which were the cause of him probably spending most of his high school life stuffed in a locker. Anyways... What's so great about this movie is the characters. I was in love with Jennifer Connely long before this movie, but this movie made her go to my top 5 beautiful woman of all time list. She looks so good in this movie. The main character is so believable, sometimes the dialog seems a little too set up. Every guy who grew up in the late 80s or grew up in a similar type town can relate to this movie. Anyone who has worked in a store after hours has either done or thought of doing what happened in this movie. Also Hughes does a good job of living out every young mans fantasy of being locked in a place with a beautiful woman. Or having a chance to get with the hottest girl from school or in town. There's so many things to this movie it would take me forever to write it all. The music goes along with the movie perfectly. It also really adds to scenes that would be kind of boring otherwise. John Candy is great, the janitor is awesome, he does a great job for having such a small part. Mcdermot is pretty weird in the movie, it's hard to believe it's even him. A totally contrast from his characters in recent movies. The whole idea and story of the movie is well told and played out. I think the movie is entertaining from beginning to end. Anyone who had a hard time dealing with having to grow up will be able to relate to this movie.
