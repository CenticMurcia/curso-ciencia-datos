One must admit that the world should see more new French and Italian films, which notably differ to those coming from Hollywood. Yes, they are slow in their sequences, not as fast and simple as several Hollywood films, but the quality is there, the style is another thing and it is just a matter to get used to them. This is a very good film, where a convict becomes a kind of proteg√© of the captain of the French island. The convict notices the admiration of Captain's wife and the captain also noticed it, but left the things going as they were. A guillotine has to be brought to the island to kill the convict, but it was hardly difficult to find out a person able to manipulate the guillotine. Finally the captain, under the strong influence of his wife, decided not to allow this 'crime', he was arrested and later judged and killed. The convict was also killed. The captain's wife saw how difficult it is to survive in a 'civilized' society when you fight for good causes and the wealth for all.
