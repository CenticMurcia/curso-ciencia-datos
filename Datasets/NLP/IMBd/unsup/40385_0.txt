I'll admit I love the look of Foghorn Leghorn but I hate his cartoons. Come on, they are ALL the same. It'll start out a normal day on the farm then that annoying bird will come along and say 'I'm a chicken hawk' a hundred times. Foghorn will pretend to not be a chicken but get clobbered anyway. The impartial barnyard dog will get involved and they'll repeat the same unfunny joke over and over until the 7 minutes are up. Am I right or am I right?<br /><br />This was the routine EVERY Foghorn Leghorn cartoon followed and I have never liked, even when I was a little kid. This cartoon is notable for being the first appearance of the Rooster but for no other reason.
