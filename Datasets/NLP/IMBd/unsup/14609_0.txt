I just finished watching Mimic & Mimic 2 together. I had seen Mimic when it originally came out and didn't remember it all that fondly. I rewatched it though and was surprised and how much better I liked it this time. Perhaps due to lower expectations. Anyway, on the the "sequel."<br /><br />Only 1 character from Mimic is here, Miro Sorvino's partner Remy. In Mimic she disappears about half way through, her job in the plot done. Here she carries the movie and does a decent job of taking her 10 minutes of screen time in the first film and giving her more here. Her use of her camera here is a nice continuity touch. Other characters are generally disposable (and nearly all of them are disposed of).<br /><br />No creative people return and yet the style and tone are very reminscent of the first film. The plot is mostly rehash of the first movie with a group of people trapped in a confined space with human sized mutant cockroaches. Of course, the style and look of the first film were mostly borrowed from Species and the Alien series (particularly Alien 3) so this one follows suit.<br /><br />This time, an undeveloped plot about the military (basically replacing the CDC of the first film) is introduced but not fleshed out. Given the film's extra short 82 minute run time, more certainly could have been added. This almost seemed more like an unused idea for the first film rather than a seperate plot line of it's own.<br /><br />The science here is weak (and accounts for the one glaring continuity error when Remy explains what DNA went into the Judas breed) but the plot doesn't hinge on science. It's a giant bug movie. My expectations of credible science are minimal.<br /><br />None of the characters behave in the typical ultra-stupid "I'm in a horror movie so I'm not gonna scream for help but instead hide until I get eaten" manner which helps. Ultimately, if you go in expecting a low-budget straight-to-video sequel to a decent giant bug movie, I don't think you'll be disappointed.
