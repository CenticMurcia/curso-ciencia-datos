The studios were churning out musical comedies in grosses in the 50's and this is a great example of why the genre eventually died. Red Skelton had NO chemistry with the Grayson-Keel pairing. The comedy does not mesh with the singing which is out of balance with the dancing, and there's no plot to speak of anyway. Try Kiss Me Kate instead. My score: 4/10.
