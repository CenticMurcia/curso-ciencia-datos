Although this film has been trashed terribly, there are some of us who actually really liked this film.<br /><br />Maybe it's the traveller in me, but this film about the search to find, and create the ultimate paradise, is actually quite affecting. From personal experience, I find the colony of backpackers that live in the Beach community to be very realistic. I've met these people! Di Caprio is actually quite good as a frat boy kind of American and Swinton is great as the community's dictatorial leader.<br /><br />Don't see this film expecting a repeat of the book. Few films are as good as the book, we all know that. But for those of you with a traveller's heart and for those of you who dream of finding the perfect paradise, I'd say this film is an exotic and refreshing and worth your time.<br /><br />Sure there are some parts, like the video-game sequence where Richard goes all Lord of the Flies that is a bit ridiculous. But all in all, it's escapist and rather sad and examines the downfall of a paradise.<br /><br />
