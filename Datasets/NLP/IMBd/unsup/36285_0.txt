What was the author thinking (or perhaps drinking)? Does he know anything about Europe, Eastern Europe, Slovakia, Bratislava. I think he's a total imbecile. Half a million people lives here. It's not some kind of medieval village, where bloody killers live and crime is overwhelming. Or maybe Americans still think that Eastern Europe is some kind of wild land, the land of poverty, devastation and murder, and it's dangerous to be even near those places. Well then they are f**king idiots if they think so. Such films create a negative image of Eastern Europe, of the Slavs and I think it's a shame that such movies exist.
