OK so I can agree with the other comment about the lake scene, yes it is like 15 min long. Also In the beginning for the opening scene for the credits all they show is the trans am driving on the road for like 10 or 15 min. That is way too long for a opening act! I mean yeah we get the point that there is a trans am with kids going to a lake. The killings in the movie are a big disappointment, all it is, is a guy walking around in cowboy boots. The acting is horrible and the movie is a big waist of time. I am a HUGE fan of the 80's slasher films, especially Friday the 13th. They even filmed it with a home video, so the lighting was horrible and was very shaky. Well I'd say I have to give it at least a 1 out of 10, for being part of the 80's slasher genre for at least trying. I just hope that they don't ever make a movie like this again.
