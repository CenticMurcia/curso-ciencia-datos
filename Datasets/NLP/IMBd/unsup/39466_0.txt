this is by far THE WORST movie i have ever seen ... it is so bad ... the bear is completely horrendous ... the acting is worse than an elementary school play ... i almost vomited at the dialogue .... oh my god it was so bad i even called the company who made it and told them how bad it was ...the only 2 hours of my life i truly regret ... no one should ever watch this pile of trash.. was this a horror or a real bad comedy ... what was the story ... a bear cub gets killed and its mother takes revenge on the teens who killed it ..... who wrote that ... a bunch of monkeys on meth .... i and my wife have never and will never see such an empty abismul movie again .... time to give the raspberry of the century award to this waste of time. i have no more to say .... bring on grizzly rage 2 .... NOT ... lmao
