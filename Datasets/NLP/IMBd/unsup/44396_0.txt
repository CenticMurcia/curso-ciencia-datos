The movie starts off OK with very nice visuals. But then the story sets in and it all goes downhill. It's not the fault of the actors, they deliver good performances. But the story is pretty bad and while the dark space station sets a claustrophobic mood at first, it starts to get annoying at some point. If you read other comments someone probably wrote "a movie for the thinking man", as some moron always does. Don't let that fool you. This movie is not very good and there is not much to think about. The basic idea, a space station for secret research, is not exactly new and neither is "homo homini lupus", man is a wolf to man. If that is actually new to you, I recommend the book "The Shock Doctrine" by Naomi Klein and not a crappy science fiction movie.<br /><br />What this movie sums up to is the washed up back story of House on Haunted Hill, wrapped in a messianic blanket IN SPACE. If you like that, fine, suit yourself. But any thinking man should go watch something else.
