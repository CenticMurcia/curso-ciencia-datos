Hunters Blood (1987) is a very entertaining fast paced movie about 5 men from the city who travel 2 hours to Arkansas on a weekend so they can go hunting in the forest, drink beer and have fun!!! Things soon take a turn for the worse tho when they find out that there's a horrible redneck family who live in the area where they set up camp. These inbred rednecks are cannibalistic and will stop at nothing to torture and kill our city boys!! Hunters Blood is a great movie with plenty of action, some really gory images along the way and the cast do a fantastic job, Mason is my favourite, he's played by Clu Gulager but i'm being biased because he was great in "Return of the living dead".<br /><br />I highly recommend this rare horror movie, if you enjoyed "Deliverance" and "Rituals" then you should love this one, this movie gets a well deserved 8/10 from me.
