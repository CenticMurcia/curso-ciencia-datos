Mr.Woodcock is a boring comedy which did not produce me any laughs because all the jokes are clich√©d and tired.That's a serious problem in a comedy.Billy Bob Thornton is criminally wasted in this movie.He's an extraordinary actor but this movie does not show all his talent.He should appear in more movies like A Simple Plan or Bad Santa,which really take advantage of his talent,and not in craps like School for Scoundrels or Mr.Woodcock.Director Craig Gillespie shows nothing of artistic zeal.His work is simply mercenary.It was very difficult to me laughing with this movie because,as I said,all the jokes are tired and they left to be funny 20 years ago.I do not recommend this movie.
