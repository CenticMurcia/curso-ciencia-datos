The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is rightly regarded as one of the best crime novels of all time. Its initial publication caused controversy in some quarters because of a startling trick pulled by Agatha Christie. To bring this across properly in the form of a TV movie would take considerable skill, but with the right script-writer and director, it could make a fantastic film.<br /><br />This certainly isn't it. The normally-reliable Clive Exton has seen fit to add another murder for no reason other than to provide a cliff-hanger for a commercial break, most of the characters have been destroyed, and what on Earth are factories and airports doing in there? The film only needs to feature three houses to work - it's a puzzle, not an action film.<br /><br />It's such a pity that this should have been part of the regular Poirot series. For the rest of its run, the adaptations have been fairly faithful to the source material. This one's destruction of the structure of the plot is the sort of thing which we'll see more of in ITV's Marple travesties in a few years time. Unfortunately, I doubt that ITV will ever go back and do this one properly, because subjective camera-work could lead to a very atmospheric film version of this story.
