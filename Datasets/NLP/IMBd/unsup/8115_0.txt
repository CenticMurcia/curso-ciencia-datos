If you are familiar with John Lennon's early life, including the development of his various bands, and the evolution of the Beatles through Germany and the Liverpool scene, then this movie doesn't offer much in the way of history. The history is accurate by most accounts. The actors portraying the Beatles a relatively similar in looks. The music is good, they recreate scenes from the Quarrymen, the German era, and the Cavern Club performances. It is also interesting to note that many of the scenes were filmed on location in Liverpool, so you get to see the actual quarry, Strawberry Fields, etc. I would at least recommend watching this once if your a fan of early rock and roll, and would even purchase it if you are a fan of the Beatles and/or John Lennon.
