The style of Maureen O'Hara is unmatched,even today among the best in the business. and there are so many very talented people in the industry. Her classic beauty & comedic humor always has set her apart from others. The Irish temperament,at times,thick accent,especially when angered, her natural beauty, are what set her apart from other women of her generation. She is of a timeless beauty that is so rare these days. I'll never forget her in "MaClintock". I loved that movie so much in my childhood, I couldn't wait for it to come out so I could purchase it,myself.Then, it came out on DVD. That did it. I bought it as a collector's edition. We watch it often. This world has been a much better, enjoyable world with her in it. I am of Irish descent myself,& my family is from Dublin,Ireland, where Ms. O'Hara is from. Though, I've never been, I will always call Ireland the Home of My family. Thank You Maureen O'Hara for all the lovely memories.
