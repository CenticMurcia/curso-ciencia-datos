At the grand old age of 85, Alain Resnais returns with a wistful, sometimes amusing adaptation of the Ayckbourn play, transporting English dysfunction, disconnection and desolation to Paris.<br /><br />Resnais compensates for the limits and staginess of the source by immersing the look of the film in a fire-side lustre and teasing out provocative visual parallels between the six main characters.<br /><br />They could all be shards of the one identity, such do they share the same strain of middle-aged (class) discontent.<br /><br />Favourite scene  When the snow that bookmarks each scene finally cascades onto the set as Charlotte and Lionel search souls.
