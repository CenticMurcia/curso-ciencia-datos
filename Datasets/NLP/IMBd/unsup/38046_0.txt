Watched/listened to this train wreck on the "Secret Stash" on Comedy Central last night. At this hour, it wasn't too censored and I found it virtually unwatchable. Not since Manos: The Hands of Fate, back in the Mystery Science Theater 3000 days, has Comedy Central fielded such garbage. Would actually rather have seen a 44th rerun of an old "Dave Chapelle Show" than to be subjected to this. Most of the commercials were sustaining (Comedy Central) as I can imagine they would have had a hard time attracting any advertising save for local cable stuff. In my opinion, after "Manos", this is the worst movie Comedy Central has ever shown.<br /><br />Skip it!
