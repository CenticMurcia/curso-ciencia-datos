This film features some of the most mind-numbingly obvious symbollism I have ever seen a film. I just 'loved' how the director made sure to linger forever on a piece of symbollic imagery just to make sure we 'got it'. Then just in case, they would show us the same imagery a few minutes later.<br /><br />The actress who played the hooker was simply awful and seemed unable to display any range of emotion. The Polish brothers who played the twins seem to think that the more they sleepwalk through their role the more 'artistic' the film will seem.<br /><br />Overall, I felt that this film was a poseur attempt at making a piece of deep and meaningful art cinema. At the end of it, I was extremely sorry I had spent the whole time watching it.
