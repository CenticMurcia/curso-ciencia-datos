this movie was really good i have watched it a million times and every time i watch it i cry. i feel sorry for the family because they had to go through all this the courts, wondering if the Taylor's were going to take the daughter and sisters baby but they didn't get to. i feel for the family i am going through the same thing right know and we all are scared. no body deserves to be treated the way Teresa was and the family does not deserve to be put through this either. and there son now has to grow up with out his real mom but he will always have Angela and her husband to be there for him. Teresa will not be able to meet her daughter in law or her grandkids she will not be able to see her son graduate. she will not be able to be there for Angela's kids or meet them since they have grown up. Teresa's parents will not be able to talk with her or see her laugh they don't get to spend Christmas or thanksgiving with her or there b-days or her b-day with her anymore
