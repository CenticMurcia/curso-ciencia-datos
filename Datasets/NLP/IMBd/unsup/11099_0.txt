Much better-than-average, very different suspense film. The few plot holes and the occasional trite dialogue don't detract from the overall work. It's such a great improvement on the usual hackneyed crap put out by Hollywood that it's hard not to like it a lot. The acting, largely by no one you ever heard of, is so much better than anything you EVER see in big-money films... it makes you realize what junk we usually have to pay seven bucks to see.
