I just happened to catch this delightful film on cable. At first I had difficulty deciding if this was a comedy or drama. Then I realized it, in fact, was a comedy/drama. I have been a fan of Nivola's for some time and was delighted to see him in this film. Seems as though his "look" changes with each character he plays. I last saw him in "Junebug." The other actors in the film handled their characters very well although the Ernie character could have easily come off as "Barney Pfife" but Norris was able to hold back and make it somewhat believable. The title is rather misleading as the "rock" is only shown briefly and appears to be in the middle of a lake; as if swimming there would be going nowhere. All in all it kept my attention and was a very good film. In an earlier review the booby trap with the paint-tin and town clock was mentioned as not being seen. For some reason that scene ran AFTER the credits. Sort of confusing. I thought it was that last crash we heard but did not see later on in the film. Or, was the booby trap set off after Robin left the jail? i.e., after the credits. Can anyone clarify?
