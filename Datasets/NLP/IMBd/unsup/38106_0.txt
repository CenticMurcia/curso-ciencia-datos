The screen play and slightly higher production values seen in this zombie flick are the only things that set this film apart from the hoard of other "back yard" produced zombie films which flooded the market during the time period of it's release. While it is true that lovers of George Romeros zombie films will see many welcomed and familiar themes and plot elements in this production, the bad acting reflected in the entire cast's performances drag this film's impact and quality to a sub-par level. Sometimes bad acting can be humorous and endearing, here it is just bad acting and leaves the film with a flat feeling.<br /><br />Only serious lovers of zombie flicks will feel that they got their moneys worth out of this one. Any movie that has this kind of stilted acting, coupled with zombies that find a wobbly pile of boxes an unmanageable obstacle deserves a rating of 3 out of 10.
