I saw this movie at the Brussels International Filmfestival on closing day, and I have to say it didn't convince me. It definatly had a sense of style to it, but the storyline (if there was any) was utterly confusing and very hard to follow. Kirsten Dunst is completely wasted in a small and weepy role as the daughter of a corrupt officer, and Eric Mabius as the Crow has a great presence although his dialogue is quite appaling and clich√©d. The plot again evolves around the same subject as the previous two films. A guy is wrongfully accused of killing someone, but during his execution something goes wrong and somehow he is revived by a crow. From there on he goes on a quest to kill the men who killed him. So far so good, but from there on the movie rapidly goes downhill. Aside from some stylish action and a really great 'cop-nearly-abuses-young-girl scene', there is not much going on at all. 3/10
