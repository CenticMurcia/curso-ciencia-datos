I was browsing through my On Demand and found this film, thinking, OK, this may be a decent low budget horror film. Mistake #1.<br /><br />Mistake #2 was continuing to watch the film for about an hour before I finally turned it off. Not only was the acting crap, but the actual plot and scary scenes were lame. I can't even describe how annoying the characters were, which could be related to the Canadian "aboot." Who knows.<br /><br />Granted, I did not finish the film and I don't know what happened to the acne ridden driver of the car, but I had a major problem with one scene. Tell me how hay can fall on someone and knock them out, to the point of unconsciousness? Come on. Don't even bother.<br /><br />So, in general, I can appreciate poorly done horror films. Usually, at the very least, they're so crappy they're funny. This was NOT the case with this film. I kept saying, "Five more minutes, may be it will redeem itself." It made no such attempt.<br /><br />If you wanna see a funny crappy horror film, I suggest Killer Nerd.
