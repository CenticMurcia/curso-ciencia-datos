Though it's not your typical "slasher" movie, with all your stereotypical school-girl power-sluts and horn-dog jock kids getting their asses mangled by a masked killer, "Driller Killer" is - believe it or not - a more maturely done flick. Abel Ferrara - director of "Ms .45", "Bad Lieutenant", and "King of New York" - directed and stars as a struggling New York painter living a "Three's Company" lifestyle with two babes in a rat-hole apartment complex while desperately hoping to score some rent money with his next big 'masterpiece'. Hard to concentrate, however, when a lousy punk band rents out some space in their apartment building and jams constantly as his overdue rent builds up and bills come flying in. The dude seems to just snap and run amok through the city with a power drill, viciously attacking homeless people in the dead of night for no apparent reason... The movie is more of an 'urban drama' than an all-out horror film, which is fine, though the characters were just far too one-dimensional and it comes as no surprise this guy decides to run around with a deadly piece of hardware since there is absolutely no change in his demeanor to indicate exactly WHEN he has officially lost his mind. A little more insight into what exactly triggered such a rampage would've been better because, hell, we all have bills but I always thought living with two hot chicks would compensate somewhat... The death scenes, though extremely gory, are portrayed as much too "in your face" and detracts from any kind of feeling of menace these scenes had or could've had. The movie itself sort of just plods along with nothing really 'gong on' and a lot of really annoying music performed by very annoying people and two of the dullest hot chicks I've ever seen. This isn't the WORST flick you could watch but it's my least favorite Abel Ferrara movie I've seen so far...
