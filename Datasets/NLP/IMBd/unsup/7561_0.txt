This is a terrible movie, even for parody soft core pornography. Part of a series from this troupe, this movie receives two out of ten stars for being somewhat more watchable than its predecessor, Playmate of the Apes and successor, Spider-babe.<br /><br />Basically, what you have here is the end result of assigning a group of high school students to write a parody for a comedy class, and then injecting them with aphrodisiacs. If the flat jokes weren't bad enough, and there are some groaners, the sex scenes are tepid enough to bore even those with insane libido.<br /><br />The one genuine laugh you'll receive is at the movie's end, when Dildo encounters a friend thought long dead, and his cheesy, over powering fake laughter forces Dildo's actress to lose her composure and start genuinely cracking up. She has a nice smile. Lets hope she can get into some higher quality porn.
