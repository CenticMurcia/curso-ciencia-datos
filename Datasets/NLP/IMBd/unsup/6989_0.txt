This visually impressive and imaginative movie is probably Jeunet's best. Here he and his usual team create what they do best, namely weirdness. Take Amelie, remove everything that people label "so French" and turn it inside out. That's the feeling of Delicatessen.<br /><br />The plot is goofy but works very well in the movie and has so many little twists and turns it never lets go of your attention. The quirky(for lack of a better word) characters and the great dark humour is not for everyone, but if you can appreciate it then you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />The acting is good, and the various weirdos in the apartments are very convincing. A personal favourite was a guy who grows frogs and snails in his apartment. His insane look was a treat.<br /><br />If you really liked Amelie then you might also like this. That being said, they are very different while maintaining the same basic mood. Do yourself a favour, delve in the mind of Jeunet and check out this dark and twisted comedy for those with good taste...
