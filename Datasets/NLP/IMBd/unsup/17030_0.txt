I first saw "C'est arrivé près de chez-vous"(Man bites dog) about ten years ago and I was amazed by the whole thing.The darkest humor ever,sick violent scenes,and of course,the Man himself.Poelvoorde plays a violent maniac but he's funny and charismatic at the same time.Fast forward to 2005:I realised there was a new movie with that guy that I've never seen in another film.I didn't know that much about Claude Francois,but I had to see Poelvoorde in another role.Here he plays Bernard Frédéric,an ex-imitator of Cloclo.He stopped his "career" in show-business when his wife,Véro, gave an ultimatum.So now he has a boring job,9 to 5, a son, a "normal" life. But when he learns that there is an imitator contest on prime time TV,his passion takes over.So many funny scenes in this movie! The auditions of his "Clodettes"(he's so rude with them ,can't watch it without laughing)the psycho-therapist,the introduction of his partner Couscous,the sex scene in which he changes his love tempo depending what Claude song he has in mind,...Add to this a great soundtrack, dancing, beautiful women in there Clodettes suit, a happy ending and you have 90 minutes of pure joy.I can't wait to see the long version.
