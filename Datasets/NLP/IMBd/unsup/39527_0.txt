You probably won't be able to sit through this movie, I wasn't. It's good for a laugh though.<br /><br />This is the plot, from the part of the movie I was able to endure: There's basically a big solar flare, and it's somehow going to set the atmosphere on fire. The solution: We'll blow up the ocean! (I'm not making this up). The water thrown into the air will put out the burning atmosphere, or something.<br /><br />The president is portrayed as naive for thinking that blowing up the ocean is too rash and/or stupid a move. Really, I'm with him on this one.<br /><br />Also, meteorites are falling at cities for some reason. Fortunately shooting them with fighter-launched missiles makes them completely disappear.<br /><br />Maybe they shouldn't have tried to make a serious movie based on a Homestar Runner cartoon.
