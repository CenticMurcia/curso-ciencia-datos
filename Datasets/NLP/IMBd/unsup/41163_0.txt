Well there is not much you can say for his film. From the one's that I have seen, I think this is the worst yet. At least the others are watchable. The film follows the same general plot as the rest; the girls go to another country and meet boys, with a nice little story to help you tell the difference. You would think that since they are in England they would be able to find an all English cast. Instead they force on us an Australian (Jesse Spencer) with a fake accent, and I was surprised to see some people who made comments actually thought he was British. My advice is, if you ever decide to watch this film, don't.
