I would call Heroes of Might and Magic III a truly GREAT game- if it wasn't so easy to get stuck in certain scenarios that are necessary to get to the next scenario. When the inability to beat the computer gets so frustrating, you just want to scream- that's usually a bad thing. On the good side, the graphics are great, the storyline supports the game play, it's fun to see everything from not just the viewpoint of one side; but of three, and the creatures are fun to work with. That said, make sure you have a link to at least one page with Heroes III walkthroughs, because you WILL run into scenarios that are literally almost impossible to beat.
