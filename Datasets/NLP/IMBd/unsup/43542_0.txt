Simply boring! This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Colombians must have interests on this movie because you MUST take 5 cups of coffee to avoid sleeping. I don't know why the director (she) never uses music in all the film. The dialogs are very strange and th story ends giving nothing but a need to ask for a refund on the video club. The sound on the movie is really awful. I'm tired of seeing productions where you don't know in what year you're talking about. There's a misconception of time in all the movie. The only thing you can save is photography and Moran's acting. Belloso is on of the best actors in Argentina and the role he plays is for a beginner not for THE actor. That's why I think it deserves a 2.
