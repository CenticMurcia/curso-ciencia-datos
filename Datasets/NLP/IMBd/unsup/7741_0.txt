This film may show its age nowadays but I recently bought it on DVD on the back of one viewing I made back in 87 and it is STILL awesome. Charlie Sheen is superb, many ask why he made this AFTER platoon but I think it was a wise move. The rest of the cast is outstanding and the final result is a masterpiece. Back then as a child I wanted a Turbo Interceptor, now as an adult I want one even more....BRILLIANT!
