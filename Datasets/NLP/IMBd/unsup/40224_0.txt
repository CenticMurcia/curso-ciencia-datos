*Insurrection* quickly plummets into a boring and predictable storyline, with some obligatory special effects sequences thrown in to alleviate the pain. The script for this film needed some more time on the drawing board; nobody I know could understand what was really so bad about what the Federation was planning to do. Relocate 600 vegan yuppies to provide increased lifespans for billions of people?--come on, already--violate the prime directive!! Some of the special effects are spectacular, but others are generic, especially the Tron-ish deployment ship. In a move that's sure to warrant comparisons to *Star Trek V,* the writers go for a lighter tone in this film, throwing in way too many jokes, and even the standard Worf-gets-up-and-bumps-his-head, ha-ha-ha scene. I really had hoped to be more positive about this film, but near the middle it becomes a morass of extremely screwed-up psychobabble and moral analysis, with one very disgusting murder scene thrown in just to assure you the badguy is really bad. Avoid this one; it's a real dud.
