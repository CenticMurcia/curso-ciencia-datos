Do not bother seeing this movie. Life is short, and you'll never be able to reclaim the 90 minutes you'll waste at "The Bachelor".<br /><br />The plot was absolutely predictable and uncompelling, and most of the characters were, quite frankly... annoying.<br /><br />The only redeeming characteristic of this film is the performance of Artie Lang as Marco, O'Donnell's best friend and partner in crime. However, you can see the same performance every week on "The Norm Show", since its essentially the same character.<br /><br />.
