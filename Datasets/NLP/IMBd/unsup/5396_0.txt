Last year some friends and I were able to "save" and gain ownership of an original seawitch sailboat built in 1961 at American Marine. She is a beautiful boat but was severely stripped by her previous owner, but fortunately we think all the "pieces" are there. I was lucky to find the VHS version of OVERBOARD and bought it off eBay a few weeks ago. It is an amazing classic film and there were so many beautiful shots of the sailboat in it that makes us daydream about how she will look again one day. What a great movie and a great find since I hear/read it's a hard to get a hold of. I recommend watching this movie if you ever get a chance.
