As though Mr. Bean wasn't tiresome enough, this film puts Tim Roth into a role with the same sort of inane physical comedy, and it is painful to watch. All his foppish affectations are utterly unfunny, but at least it helps keep the movie consistent.<br /><br />The only bright spot is the third segment, directed by Robert Rodriguez, so if you stay awake that long, check it out. Antonio Banderas is surprisingly good, and the whole segment has a great way of piling on the complications to create a chaotic ending.<br /><br />The fourth segment will make you puke, watching Tarantino thinking he can act. the worst thing about that is that he's also the director, so he gives himself plenty of screen time. Notice during his monologue to Tim Roth, the camera never once leaves his face! Obviously, he's got rather a high opinion of his execrable acting abilities. Lucky for him he's a director, otherwise he'd never appear on film. Oh, how I wish it were so.<br /><br />Then there's the plot. Stolen from a Hitchcock story which was stolen from a Roald Dahl story. They do acknowledge the Hitchcock thing, but it's merely a not-so-clever ploy to try and disguise the fact that he didn't even come up with a story, but used some previously reheated leftovers from 30 years ago. There are no twists whatsoever on the Hitchcock theme that Tarantino describes. So, bad enough you have to endure his "acting," but you don't even get a good tale out of it.<br /><br />So all in all, a terrible film. Fast forward to the third story, and you can safely skip the rest.
