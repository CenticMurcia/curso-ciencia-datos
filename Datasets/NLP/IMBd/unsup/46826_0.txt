You'd have thought a Carter-Spotnitz team up would be a good idea. It payed off later on, but not this time. From the opening scene of a man in the jungle bursting puss-filled boils on a dead elephant or whatever it was, right down to the end scene where a guy gets shot through the cheek, this episode is disgusting, absolutely revolting. It wasn't improved by the fact I was in a bad mood when I watched it, but still, they could have done much better than this. The thing is, we've seen this so many other times in the X-Files and seen it done a hell of a lot better. Even John Shiban's surprisingly mediocre Season Four entry El Mundo Gira was better than this. Still, as Season Two comes to a close, this beats a lot of other trash which surfaced during the course of the Season Two, but it's still pretty rubbish and is one of many X-Files episodes I wouldn't watch again if you paid me.
