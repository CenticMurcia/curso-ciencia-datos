Dark (James Duval) and his friends live in an LA with drugs, sex, suicide, murder and such running wild. Dark just wants to find somebody to love and who loves him back--male or female. Oh yeah--there are aliens wandering around too (!!!???) Other than that there's no real plot--just a bunch of teens on drugs and their various adventures. Full of hilarious one liners or lines that make you just howl with laughter. Incredible set design, lighting and directing (check out the wallpapers on various characters' bedrooms). Duval is excellent (and has plenty of casual nude scenes).<br /><br />Always interesting and very well-acted by a VERY interesting cast. Not as good as "Living End" or "Totally F**ked Up" but well worth seeing. The sequence that ends the film is a laugh riot--unfortunately it's not supposed to be.<br /><br />SPOILERS IN NEXT PARAGRAPH!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!<br /><br />One guy is telling another in bed that he loves him and just got back from being kidnapped by aliens (no kidding!) When he came out with "All I thought as I was being put into the space pod, is how much I loved you". I saw it in a theatre and the audience started giggling--me too (for the record, I'm gay). It just was SO stupid...the acting is very good but the lines are horrible. Then he transforms into a giant bug and says "I'm out o' here" and leaves. By the time that came on, me (and the rest of the audience) were in hysterics. What the hell was Araki trying to do with that? <br /><br />So, a very interesting good film until that really stupid ending. Also it has Ryan Philippee in an early role.
