Typical liberal moral relativism. "Terrorists are people too" Unfortunately it shows a resolute ignorance of the fact that freedom has always been won at the cost of blood and continues to be defended at the same cost. Like Neville Chamberlain and all the apologists to evil throughout history, the filmmakers are like those who would negotiate with those who have no interest in honoring the spoken word. Lenin called these dreamers useful idiots. America remains the only modern country who rebuilt defeated enemies and then returned them to freedom. Is America perfect? Of course not, but in the words of Winston Churchill,"America usually does the right thing after exhausting all the other possibilities." Equating the US with regimes that murdered 30-40 million of their own people is dis-ingenuousness at its worst.
