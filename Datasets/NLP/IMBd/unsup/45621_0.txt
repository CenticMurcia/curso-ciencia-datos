I went to see the movie seeing an IMDb rating of 7/10. I was deeply bored. The script was all over the place. The plot was underdeveloped and the climax was very ordinary. The only one time I felt captivated was the shooting scene at Guggenheim. Whoever wrote the screenplay left a lot to be desired . The dialogues were so run of the mill. A lot of unnecessary mystery is brought in with trivial solutions. All the reference to funds being used for terrorism were cursory. Terror funding plays little or no role in the plot as such. The movie has NOTHING to do with terrorism. And the lead actor was always tense and monotonous. This is not worth a dime.
