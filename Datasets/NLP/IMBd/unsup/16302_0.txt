this is the most impressive holocaust movie ever, If you have ever seen Shoa you'll agree .....<br /><br />may you not be familiar with the ongoing events back in the 1940's in the death-camps maybe you should read into it before seeing this film<br /><br />it's not like Uprising or Schindler's list (I haven't seen the Pianist yet but I very much doubt it'll come close)<br /><br />this is the real stuff .....<br /><br />MUST SEE 5 out of 5<br /><br />
