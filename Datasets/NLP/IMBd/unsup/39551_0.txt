On December 7, 1941 - according to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, "A date which will live in infamy!" - Lieutenant Ronald Reagan (as John "Mister Gardenia" Jones Jr.) finds himself stationed in Hawaii. His pretty sweetheart Laraine Day (as Joanne) helps mother Fay Bainter (as Emmy Jones) and father Charles Winninger (as John Jones Sr.) keep the home fires burning. They have a typical American home. Writer/narrator Carey Wilson explains how Mr. Reagan came to be called "Deany" (shortened from Gardenia). Reagan and his parents survive faltering patriotism, due to boredom; but, they rally 'round the flag when the Japanese attack. The USO (United Service Organizations) want you to support them by sending money for the war cause.<br /><br />*** Mister Gardenia Jones (5/29/42) Carey Wilson ~ Ronald Reagan, Fay Bainter, Charles Winninger
