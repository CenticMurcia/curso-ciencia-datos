First off no offense to anyone that did the movie, actors rocked and other things. And secondly, this is my opinion of the movie, as opinions are ALWAYS different please keep an open mind when reading this review, thank you. I have nothing against the actors, nor do I have anything against the crew, I think they did an amazing job. BUT... I just can't get over how bad the writing was, don't get me wrong, the writing was great the dialogue at least, but the plot lacked. You think a movie being about the Dark Prince would have more of him in it, well it didn't. There was little. Your imagination could do better than what this movie did. So if you wanna add more to #2 and don't really wanna see #3 I suggest get a paper and pen and then write down what you think would've happened, what you would've done differently in either #3 or both of the movies. Maybe what they should've done was had it through Draculas' eyes. Would've been better that way. I suggest also for people who like the story of Dracula to read Bram Stokers' novel, "Dracula" and read anything else you can about vampires, please also read Kim Harrison, Anne Rice, and Laurell K. Hamilton. Like I said my opinion on the movie, and some suggestions, the plot really did lack. But thank you for reading, I really do appreciate it. Gave it a 4 'cause I thought the acting was good, but other than that... you know the rest.
