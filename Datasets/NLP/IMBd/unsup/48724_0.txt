Interesting Idea, Poorly Executed.<br /><br />Here are the positives I can say about this movie. - The idea of a comic going to a bar in a small town in Wisconsin to catch his big break is a pretty cool and an interesting idea. - The background and secondary characters are good. It has a very good small town atmosphere. And it does capture the spirit of the region<br /><br />Other than those two this movie is pretty bad. Poorly written, poorly shot, bad lighting throughout even for a low budget feature.<br /><br />The problem I had with it was that you have two movies going on at the same time and they have absolutely nothing to do with each other. You have one story which is this sort of sideways-ish story about a comic trying to rediscover his love of his work and a second story which is this cartoonish sidebar about a Green Bay Drug-lord.<br /><br />These two stories have nothing to do with each other and any contact between the two stories is completely coincidental. The Drug Lord and the Comic actually probably only share about 3-5 minutes of screen time together in the entire film.<br /><br />Then there are Montages that go too long, scenes that stretch way too long, a lot of unnecessary scenes. The actual guts of the film should really only produce about an hour long film. The rest is just padding, in particular the Macarena scenes of which there are too many and they are too long. <br /><br />It's just weird that you have a movie called "The Godfather of Green Bay" where the character that the movie is named after could have been completely cut from the film and you would have not lost a thing. It could have become one of the secondary characters and fallen to the background without a problem. And as a result there could have been more character development and time for the main story which is really the more interesting story.
