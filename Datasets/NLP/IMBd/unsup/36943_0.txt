This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. Literally. It was a romantic comedy, but unlike most, had no twist. Sort of like 'When Harry met Sally', which I thought was overrated, but at least had charismatic stars. I think the fact that I saw this movie when I was about fourteen, at the height of my FPJ crush and still didn't like it, really says something. I can't imagine what I would think if I saw it now. The acting wasn't stellar, since the material sucked so much. Even Jason Biggs and Alyson Hannigan couldn't save it, although JB was funny. Claire Forlani was okay, but forgettable, and Freddie, well, he was his usual self. Apparently the guy can act when given good material (He was in Kenneth Lonergan's 'This is our Youth' in the West End), but unfortunately none of his movies so far have been able to evidence that. The guy seems to have about four expressions: bewildered, dumfounded, just plain dumb, and something resembling constipation. At least he's pretty though, right?
