This globally acclaimed and masterful film was definitely one of the most risky and dared projects in cinema history and thus it also easily could have been one of the biggest failures ever. A cheerful musical about...Nazis?!? Especially during an era when films began to be very spectacular and explicit ("The French Connection", "Deliverance", "The Godfather"), a love-story set amidst the rising Nasism seemed like a very bad idea. And yet "Cabaret" is still standing as one of the most crucial films of the 70's, although it has to be said that the actual love story is secondary to the immortal songs and  especially  the portrayal of frustrated Germany during the years prior to WWII. Bob Fosse stylishly and appropriately alternates footage from inside the moody bar with scenes from the romantic life of variety star Sally Rowles (Liza Minelli). Sally is involved in a slightly peculiar triangular relationship with German industrialist Maximilian and English language teacher Brian. Meanwhile and all around them, supporters of the Nazi ideas become more and more numerous and their presence soon begins to have a direct impact on the lives of everyone. The acting performances are fabulous, especially Minelli and Joel Grey who plays the sleazy master of ceremonies who pretty much indirectly narrates the whole story. The songs are downright magnificent and masterfully choreographed, with great costumes, make-up and sound effects. The sequence in which Brian and Maximillian are in a public park where the majority of German citizens there seem to permanently turn to Hitler's ideas in intensely disturbing and powerfully highlighted trough an ambiguous song. A lot of film fans, especially around this website, will surely disagree, but Bob Fosse's "Cabaret" righteously stole some important Oscars from "The Godfather"...Maybe not even enough.
