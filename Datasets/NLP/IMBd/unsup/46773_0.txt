I bought a 3 DVD box named "Manga in motion" which contained the movies "Story Of Ricky", "Dragon From Russia" and "City Hunter". I watched the two other movies and thought that they were OK, so I didn't expect very much from this movie, I thought it may as well be "OK". The movie starts with a very stupid scene and goes worse and much, much more worse all the time. The humor is very stupid (even for a hong kong movie), and so is the over-acting. I just had to fight to watch the first 30 minutes of the movie. Then, in the end comes the Street fighter scene. I can honestly say that I have never seen anything as stupid and retarded as that scene. That scene almost made me stop watching the movie, but I fought until the end. The movie is without a doubt Jackie Chan's worst movie, and don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Chan. But this kind of a movie is something that I think they shouldn't have done. <br /><br />2/10 *** WORST JACKIE CHAN MOVIE EVER ***
