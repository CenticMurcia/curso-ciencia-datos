With all the big name talent in this film, I found myself snoozing. This is why film is so subjective, and why it concerns me as a writer that this project got made. I felt nothing for any of the characters, and I wasn't interested in where it was going. Bad things to create in a viewer.<br /><br />What did Tilda Swinton see in this to help produce it? The quirky idea of a 17-year-old who sucks his thumb doesn't hold up over the course of a feature film. Even the "quirky" supporting players came off corny. Keanu Reeves channeling his "Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure" character as a dentist.<br /><br />I respect that the filmmakers got this made, so maybe there's hope for other films with good stories to reach the light of day. Money back, please!
