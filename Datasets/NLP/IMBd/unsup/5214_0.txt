<br /><br />The plotting is banal, the usual "husband is not who he pretends to be, and *possible spoiler* fakes his own death to escape being caught".<br /><br />But the concept has rarely been executed better, and Goldie Hawn is simply outstanding here, with a truly fine supporting cast. The suspense builds logically from one step to the next, with an absolute minimum of contrivances. I was totally absorbed, especially as the "widow" slowly unraveled her husband's deceptions. Possibly the best scene in this movie was when she *possible spoiler* confronted her husband's pregnant new "wife". It was done superbly, with an absolute minimum of phony dramatics.<br /><br />Too bad the ending couldn't have been done better, but, with the exception of those last five minutes, this film is well worth the effort of seeing.
