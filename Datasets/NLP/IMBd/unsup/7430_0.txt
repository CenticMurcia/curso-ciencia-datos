Interesting concept and an OK storyline that had potential to be so much more interesting than what was created.<br /><br />The audio creates a very creepy atmosphere at times and the CG is quite effective in adding to this eerie atmosphere. For the first 15 minutes, the film started very well and I was hoping to to be thrilled and suspended for the entire length of the movie... No such luck! <br /><br />The film was poorly executed and the script was bland and uninteresting. <br /><br />There was hardly any character development and the Heroine in this movie was annoying and useless. The story was disjointed and the characters were just thrown in the mix without much consideration to the plot. The twist in the movie was like having the straightest chip taken out of a Twisties packet. Not much of a twist at all!<br /><br />The over exaggerated movements and terrible acting of Eliza Dushku contributed to this film's demise. The script fails drastically to address empathy from viewers and within 15 minutes of watching this, I succumbed myself to 83 minutes of mediocrity.<br /><br />Bitterly disappointed.<br /><br />This film confirmed to me that Eliza Dushku cannot act at all.
