Best documentary I have seen on a gay-related issue since "The Times of Harvey Milk". Very good quality film and sound. Story flows well...keeps you drawn in. The information is presented in a pragmatic way making it easier to understand the politics behind the story, but then the filmmaker delves into individual stories making the topic very personal. His selection of people in the film representing couples and individuals whose lives are effected by this issue is optimal. As a viewer you really feel for them, and they make their story understood even by those who are not directly affected by the gay marriage issue. Very grateful someone took on this historic topic in such a superb way!
