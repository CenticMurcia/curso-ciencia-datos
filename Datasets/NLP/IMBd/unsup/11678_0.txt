i would have voted 15 if possible, randy Q. shows a side of acting i had failed to see, i knew he was a fine character actor, always supporting but he is the mac. Daddy in this excellent film there are so many gems in this film and make no mistake its a gem, follywood dumbs us down so much that movies like this stand out like light in the night. I wont give you details. this film must be seen at least 2 times, like one poster said i am the only one around me that has seen this movie and i cant talk about it, acting by all is top notch. This film shows us that a great film can be made without blowing up a car with massive blood shed, involving armies, and corrupt police, This film touched me i will buy it keep it view it
