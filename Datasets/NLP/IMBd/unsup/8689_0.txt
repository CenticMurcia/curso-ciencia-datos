I've been a Sleepy Hollow affectionado ever since i saw the animated Disney classic as a kid, and I suppose I've seen pretty much every version from TV, movies, and cartoons since the 1950's. In many ways, the Disney one is still my favorite. I loved the Tim Burton film with Johnny Depp, but something about it wasn't right. In a world where Biblical names were commonplace, "Ichabod" is a most unflattering name, meaning "the glory has departed" - but Ichabod Crane, originally NOT the nicest of men, has become a hero over the years. Depp's Ichabod was too handsome and brave, and there were no NYC police in 1799, let alone forensics specialists. And so Jeff Goldblum remains probably the best-cast Ichabod Crane of all time. He has a look similar to the Disney one, but he has a much more pleasant manner, Burton's film, is ghostly and mysterious and well done. The subplot with a brutish Brom Bones (wasn't Bram the hunky one?) and a girl friend (NOT Katrina)ain't that great - but the overall film is very enjoyable, and seems to have quite a fan following. A good Halloween tale for all ages.
