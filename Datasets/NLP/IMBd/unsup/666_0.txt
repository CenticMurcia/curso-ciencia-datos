As a lover of horror films, and a particularly keen fan of werewolves, even I found this film to be a total piece of crap. Not even slightly scary. I have never been less scared while watching a "horror" film than this. Seriously, Ghostbusters seems like The Exorcist compared to this load of tripe. And Julian sands has got to be the worst bad guy ever. I reckon he's just reading lines off a prompter; that's what it actually sounds like. The only good thing about this film was seeing Elsa Patasky's breasts, everything else was totally shite.It is even more of a shame because the idea has potential. Based on a real life, self confessed "werewolf" (well, a dude suffering from lycanthropy), Romasanta had the potential to be seriously creepy, especially with the dark forests of the area and the quaint little villages so horribly afraid of a big bad wolf. Total waste of time. And coming from me, this movie must be poor -I like pretty much every piece of crap ever made.
