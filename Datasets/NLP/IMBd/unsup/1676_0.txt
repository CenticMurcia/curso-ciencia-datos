Enjoyable musical comedy with a predictable Americans-in-exotic locale plot, but it's all done in a fun way and with great music, besides. Some good dialogue and well done characters by Astaire, Rogers, and Dunne, who looks as lovely as she ever was and sings the show's more operetta style songs (and thus its best, since we're talking about the great Jerome Kern). She's romantically paired with Randolph Scott (!.... sorry but this takes some getting used to for western fans) who plays a football player with gusto! Some nice dance sequences supplied by Astaire and his partner.
