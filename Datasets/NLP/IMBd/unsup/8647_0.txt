This film was a story of which there apparently wasn't enough of for a movie. I like character development, but come on. I'm surprised Cher got an Oscar nomination for this, since I didn't really think her part was that great. (She has done some excellent work elsewhere) Meryl Streep, as always, just killed in her part. With all the attention she's gotten over the years for her accents, this one should have made the list, too. It ain't easy for a gal from the northeast to sound like a Texan, but she hit it perfectly. (Most who try way, way overdo it.) As for the plot, I have a little trouble with it. It seems to be about the powerless little union rep combating the eeeeeeeevil corporation, including making the (SPOILER AHEAD) circumstances of her death highly suspicious. Maybe I've seen too many Oliver Stone movies, but I just don't buy it. And I think poor Karen Silkwood just shouldn't have eaten those 'ludes before driving. That's known to be hazardous to your health. <br /><br />On a general note, it's nice to see a film about a bygone, more civilized time, when one could light a cigarette without being treated like Lucifer incarnate. <br /><br />Overall, an excellent film for Streep fans or conspiracy buffs, and a pretty decent one for anybody else. Grade: C+
