What a drag! I must admit at first that there were some funny moments in the film -- most notably a coffee-guzzling Bill Murray, but it wasn't enough to save it. There were several shorts that revolved around (you guessed it) coffee and<br /><br />cigarettes, with rather awkward encounters between cafe dwellers. Most of the<br /><br />dialoge was unremarkable pretension that just wasn't funny, or interesting. Some performances were good (Cate Blanchett, Bill Murray, and Tom Waits) and<br /><br />others atrocious (Jack & Meg White). A great idea -- poorly executed. Don't<br /><br />waste your time with this -- go grab a cup of coffee with a stranger.
