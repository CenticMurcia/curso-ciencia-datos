There are, perhaps, more salient comments to be written, in addition to the first review of this film, shown above, but it would be for a completely knowledgeable person in the field of psychology to write them. In viewing this film multiple times, I was struck by a new facet of the character of the film's principals each time I viewed it. Like a beautiful and complicated piece of music, one sees something new at each viewing; in one viewing the look on "Joseph's" face as he stands at the window waiting on "Anna" to arrive to look at a new apartment, and realizes she will NOT be there, that she is indeed immersed in "Sean"; in another viewing the changes in Anna's" expression as she is 'rescued' by Joseph on the beach--at one point there is an instantaneous look on her face signifying her realization that life with Joseph, and WITHOUT Sean, will be devastating for her. Her look of misery in this ending scene of the film is heart-rending, and unforgettable.And, of course, as the screen goes to black we are left only with the eternal sound of the sea, as the breakers crash softly against the sand.
