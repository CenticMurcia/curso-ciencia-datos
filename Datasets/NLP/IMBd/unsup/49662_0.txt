Twenty five years ago, the young son of my theater directing professor, Mr. Valeriu Moisescu, while watching at the TV an extremely boring and tasteless comedy, remarked: "Daddy, this movie is sorta stationery" (in Romanian: "stätätor", as he said). "I mean, it's not climbing up, like the beanstalk... It's missing a marble." Exactly the same is true for this completely unwonderful, unwondrous and unwondering "emporium". The script seems written by the worst dilettante (it's chaotic, messy and totally unconvincing). The direction is primitive and static, lacking spirit. Dustin and Natalie are as good as two junior high drama instructors playing next to their pupils. As to the kids themselves, they look amorphous and robotic. The only quality of the whole production is the colorfulness - rich, tasty, endearing. Don't you think it's a bit too little?
