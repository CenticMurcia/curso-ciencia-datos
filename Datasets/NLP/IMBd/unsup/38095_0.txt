.... But not as bad as it could have been either <br /><br />I had a problem with the title of this movie . What does " I Went Down " conjure up to you ? I thought thought we'd be seeing a bio-pic on Monica Lewinsky I seriously did but instead found myself watching a black comedy road movie <br /><br />This is a co-production between the BBC and the Irish film council made at the same time when British film production was picking up thanks to TRAINSPOTTING and THE FULL MONTY . There's aspects that give a vague nod British production premise of having a couple of losers in the shape of Git Hynes and Bunny Kelly make an unlikely journey but the Irish influence adds a lot of charm to the story that was missing in say THE FULL MONTY<br /><br />There are a few problems though . One is that the director seems to bottle out of wanting to use on screen violence . For example Git is shown getting into a fight early in the movie which ends with a bottle being smashed on a table then it cuts to a character telling Git how angry he is that a character has been maimed . It's like the director went out of his way not to show any serious violence . There's also a few unlikely occurrences throughout the movie usually involving Bunny . You'll know them when you see them I'm sure <br /><br />Having said that I WENT DOWN is a lot better than many other movies that were funded by public bodies in the British Isles round about the same time . It's by no means a great movie but is far more entertaining than say THE LIFE OF STUFF and THE SLAB BOYS
