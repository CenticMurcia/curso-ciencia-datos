This is a great movie. What makes this movie so great is the movies own weakness' plays to it's advantage. Instead of using established actors. Camron the movies director chose to use no names actors and rappers out of his own entourage "The Diplomats". Despite certain drawbacks such as a clich√©d story line, amateur acting, and some questionable scenes this movie still shines. Cam'ron steals the show in mostly all the scenes. His emotion as an actor really comes across in this movie even more so than in his debut role in Paid in full, and for those who are familiar with the rapper the way that they tie in real life events with the story line to add credibility and believability keeps the viewer entertained. For those familiar with camron and the diplomats this should be a classic movie filled with enough entertainment that will help u over look the amateur acting, and questionable scenes in the movie
