This film is so stupid, so predictable and just so over the top it is quite entertaining to laugh at. The FBI guy is a complete and utter idiot; he should be keeping matters cool and calm on the aeroplane but instead he runs around like a madman throwing innocent passengers aside. He is a complete nut case; he shouts at staff and is aggressive to everyone he comes in contact with. Constantly seems to stare at people so much the twist at the end should have been that he was the killer himself.<br /><br />His wife is annoying for reasons posted by previous viewers and the main villain is so obvious I wonder how films like this get the greenlight.<br /><br />Bad, really bad.
