It never completely gets you involved. Oh, it does start out on a suspenseful note. The idea is very clever- a successful, attractive New York woman meets the man who seems to be Mr. Right (a successful artifact dealer), and their marriage is everything she hoped it would be, until he suddenly and mysteriously dies. But when she looks into his background, she finds that what she knew about him turns out to be false, and he may have been involved in criminal activity. Also, the music and visual style set the right mood. And Goldie Hawn, not known for film roles like this, gives a respectable performance. But as the film moves along, it becomes increasingly confusing and unbelievable, finally reaching a ridiculous ending. In fact, the closing scene is so confusing, it's hard to tell where it takes place. It looks like someone with a great deal of talent but a short attention span got bored with the film and rushed it to an ending because he was sick of it. Too bad, because it had great promise.
