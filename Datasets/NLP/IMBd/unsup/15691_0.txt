I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. Wow, this has been a great couple of years for Bill Nighy. He has shown such range and he continues in that endeavor in this movie. Romola also takes a striking turn in the lead as the sensitive, wiser, but younger sister. I most enjoyed Tara Fitzgerald's , quiet performance and thought it quite exceptional. She should have received award recognition for it. Rose Byrne, one of the exciting new actresses to come on the scene, is very effective as the slightly self-centered, dramatic older sister. Henry Thomas also turns in a very sensitive performance. This movie doesn't have an unrealistic ending and maintains its identity and integrity with solid story telling and good production values.
