When I first heard about this movie, I wasn't sure what I would think about it, but since I watch lifetime movies like they are a religion, I decided to. All I can say is that it was well worth it..I loved the cast and I loved the story line..I am a fan of Jane Krakowski, and I think that this was one of her better roles..I liked her character, a emotional, yet determined woman to become a mother..I can't imagine a better woman for the part..But of course, what made this movie, was Danielle Panabaker..She played an extraordinary part, and I think she played it wonderfully..She played a confused, scared single mother..It actually seemed like this was coming from a real 16 year old single mom..Most stories seem like they were written by a 35 year old male..This one was so well written, that you would think it came straight from a 16 year old girl's mind..It was definitely a great movie, that I would watch again in a heartbeat
