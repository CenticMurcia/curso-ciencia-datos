This movie was great. It is the first one that shows the cruel reality in Africa and Asia. I like Angelina Jolie even more after seeing this movie. It's great that she does the same in real life as in "Beyond Borders".<br /><br /> The movie itself was really interesting, I didn't felt the 2 hours. It took my attention and kept it till the end, which cannot be said about a large amount of movies. I'm not surprised that it bombed at the box office because most people are, as is said in the movie, "operated on compassion". I think most people didn't like it because they don't know what it is to be hungry and poor and left alone. Once again - I really liked the movie. I got it on DVD and I think it's a great look on reality!
