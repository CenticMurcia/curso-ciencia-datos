Found this in a bargain bin for $1, and thought it was porn, and was highly disappointed. My favourite part of the film was the closing credits. It is a complete copy of 'Shawshank Redemption' (not). Does anyone know where I can buy the soundtrack? I'm glad I can fast forward at 16 times normal play speed, because it got used often. Should make a good drink coaster. "Get to it, undress" One more time... Found this in a bargain bin for $1, and thought it was porn, and was highly disappointed. My favourite part of the film was the closing credits.
