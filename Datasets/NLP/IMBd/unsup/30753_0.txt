I rented The Last Seduction II from Blockbuster when it was first released back in 1998 or 1999. I saw Linda Fiorentino on the video box cover so I thought it would be awesome. When I got home and started the movie I was surprised to learn that it was not Fiorentino's face I had seen--it was that of Joan Severance (the likeness is incredible) cast as Bridget Gregory! Initially, I was disappointed but my disappointment quickly evaporated after I heard Severance speak her first line. She had a certain screen presence that had me glued to the TV.<br /><br />In The Last Seduction II, Bridget Gregory (Severance) flees New York City for Barcelona, with Mike's father (Mike was a character in the first film) hiring a bounty hunter (Beth Goddard) to find her. Bridget meets Troy Fenton (Con O'Neill) at a bar in Barcelona and they become lovers. Bridget also schemes to route some of Troy's phone-sex line business profits into her bank account, with the help of a friend in London named Simon.<br /><br />The Last Seduction II has everything: good actors, stylish cinematography and beautiful locations, glamorous wardrobe, eroticism, violence, humor, and more. Severance is very beautiful in this. The Last Seduction II is more upbeat and brighter than the former. Severance even makes smoking look good (not that I am advocating smoking or anything). Severance, O'Neill, and Goddard really make this movie great. None of the actors are present from the first one, but the storyline appears to continue from the end of the first movie. I recommend The Last Seduction II. 10/10
