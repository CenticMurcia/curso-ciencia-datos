In my opinion this has to be one of the best anime movies ever. Many loose ends left over from the Gundam Wing series are tied up within this great ending. Characters' backgrounds are explored a little more and new light is shed on the original Operation Meteor. Amazing animation, delicious bishies, awesome mecha fights...what more could you want?! An absolute MUST-SEE for any Gundam Wing fan!!!
