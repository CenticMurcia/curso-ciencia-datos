A friend recommended that I see this movie and I am sorry that I did. We start out with the excellent Jack Warden blabbing away for hours in a restaurant out in public about the criminal life of Jimmy the Saint, Andy Garcia's character. People involved in crime don't do this. We are introduced to a group of ex cons who have to do a job for a mob boss. These guys are supposed to be some sort of friends but I didn't believe it. First, one guy in this group is so crazy that I don't know why the others have anything to do with him. Next is the performance by Andy Garcia which just wasn't very effective. There is a hit man played by the great Steve Buscemi. He is supposed to be some sort of avenging angel but the role is ridiculous in this type of film. It would fit better in Terminator 3.<br /><br />I could go on but I'll just add that many very good actors, Christopher Walken, Bill Nunn and Christopher Lloyd couldn't help this turkey. I guess the topper for me was that the film makers had some sort of anal fixation. They were very concerned about what went in, bullets also charmingly called "buckwheats" and what went out. <br /><br />I understand that since Pulp Fiction, anything gross is supposed to be cool. Frankly, this Denver mess made Pulp Fiction look good. But if you compare Things to Do in Denver to the best crime films, Goodfellas or Casino, it is a piece of garbage. And since one character dies in garbage, maybe that is the best description of it.
