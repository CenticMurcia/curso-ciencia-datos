Obviously the purpose was for Fox to cash in by doing very little. So what does that mean for the gang of Beverly Hills 90210? Grab a few of them, put them on a set, and let them ramble on and on about stupid things like inside jokes and who had the worst hair. Ten years after one of Fox's most popular television show, I thought they'd have put more effort into paying tribute to the old days. <br /><br />Some of the cast members weren't there such as Tori Spelling and that gorgeous Brian Austin Green. The Walsh parents showed up at the very last second to remark how James Eckhouse lost his hair and to bellow how everyone grew up (like they didn't already know it since half the cast is still bumming around in showbiz). And the producers and I think the director came in at the last minute as well, to break up the mundane discussions among the silly bunch of kids. There was absolutely no direction here, like what was it about the 10 years that they wanted to emphasize or find to be most significant to remark on? And they had 60 minutes to do it. But it seemed like they just invited everyone out, threw them in a room, and filmed the results. And that was it. There were a few clips, but really nothing remotely interesting. The cast spent most of the time yapping about nothing and laughing at each other.<br /><br />I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Reunion shows never seemed to have much to say. I guess people just like to see what people look like years after seeing them on their favorite show. But that's about it.
