Yeah, I love this film. Ever since I saw it at a preview screening, this has been one of my favorites. I said then Gary Oldman should get nominated for Best Supporting Actor and he should have been, except nobody saw this movie, probably because Orion didn't promote this movie at all. All of the leads are awesome. Sean Penn is so messed up and confused, and the hints that he's having trouble with all the drinking are a nice touch. Ed Harris does so much with so little. There's one scene where you can almost see him literally blow his top. By the end, the effects of each different subplot can be seen on each other, all coming together for one climactic moment. And the ending--I get chills from the music. See this movie. Then tell everyone you know.
