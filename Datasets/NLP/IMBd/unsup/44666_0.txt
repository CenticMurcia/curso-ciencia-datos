So I went out to my friend's college and one of her roomates wanted to see a movie, this movie. The roomate was kind of decent looking so I figured I'd go and try not to be judgemental and tolerant and open minded. How bad it be? It's just your standard cliche laden "romantic" date movie. How bad can it be? VERY VERY BAD!!!! When the best part of a movie is an over the hill fonzie as a TV chef, you know your in trouble. Freddie Prinze and Julia Stiles might be the two most sub-par mediocre hacks ever to headline a movie. Joe Estevez is even better! Joe Estevez! The dialogue could be chopped from a who's who of cliche riddled movies and assemblyed into unstoppable force of all that is predictable. Not only do the two leads suck but they have no chemistry whatsoever between each other. Gerbils or 2x4's would have been more likable charecters.The title of the movie doesn't even make sense in accordance to the plot. My two friends sat through the whole movie in pure awe of the level of crappiness on screen while I sank ever deeper into my chair and contemplated suicide.
