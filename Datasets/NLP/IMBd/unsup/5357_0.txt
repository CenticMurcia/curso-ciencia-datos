Terrible, simply terrible. A disgrace to the works of Jules Vern. The movie bears very little resemblance to Vern's book and destroys or abandons all the best elements of the story. If you are interested in Mysterious Island rent one of previous productions. This isn't worth watching even if it is free on TV.<br /><br />There is no excuse for having CG this bad in a movie made in 2005. Even in a low budget movie made overseas. I could produce better CG in my garage on my Mac.<br /><br />The Dune reunion is what initially caught my attention. Patrick Stewart and Kyle MacLachlan seem to by trying, but they can't save this disgrace.
