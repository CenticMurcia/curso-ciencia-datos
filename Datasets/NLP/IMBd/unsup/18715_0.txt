The painful memory of watching this movie when it was released 20 years ago lingers, like herpes.<br /><br />The only good thing about this movie are the unintentional howlers, such as the bad guys who live in the desert, and wear full-length fur coats (hmmmm, maybe not the best thing to wear when it is 120 degrees out). Reb Brown proved he cannot act in this film. It is ludicrous, horrible, terrible and more than a complete waste of time. It deserves a rating in the bottom 100 on IMDB. <br /><br />Another howler. The scientists Yor encounters tell him that they have been watching his parents. Yor wisely concludes "Ahh, my father and mother". Yep, that's who parents are!
