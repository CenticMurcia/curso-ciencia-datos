This is a movie that asks you to stick with it to the end, purposely confusing the viewer and leaving them unsatisfied until it is ready to reveal itself. That would be fine, except the payoff really isn't worth the time you'll put into this one.<br /><br />The main character, Ingrid, lives in a small, quiet community, and has always been considered to be very level-headed by the other residents. However, when she claims to be attacked several times, the police and her doctor start to wonder if she is imagining it. We eventually find out that she has some lurid family history, but we never really know what is real or imagined. The movie is mostly told from Ingrid's point of view, which proves unreliable. She eventually commits suicide and we find out some more of her past, ending with an ambiguous final shot.<br /><br />I didn't really find the movie atmospheric or involving. It had a low-budget feel and looks to be marketed as a trashy thriller, but it could have been a TV movie considering the content. Nothing really stood out, not much was memorable.<br /><br />Some recommendations: If you are interested in a movie with similar themes but want more something that will make more of an impact, try "Chinatown," "The Grifters," or "Angels and Insects."
