While super-critical cineasts might find fault with this debut offering of Eric Mendelsohn, I was delighted and moved by it. A poetic tone, a profound humanism, graceful and splendid perfomances by sadly neglected actors and an innovativeness that a more splashy, slick film like "American Beauty" lacked. Suburbia and its inhabitants aching for real communion, mostly unable to give or receive it...how well this movie expressed it! Bravo and may there soon be more from Mendelsohn and his like!
