The worst film I have ever had the misfortune to come across. The Director's name is Bland, which kinda sums it up for me. So bad in fact that me and a friend spent the whole film crying with laughter at just how bad it was. <br /><br />The acting was so wooden that a Hayden Christenson and Orlando Bloom hybrid could have done a better job! The camera work made it feel like we were out on the streets with Jerry Springer's film crew, and the storyline was simply shocking. There were also inexplicable overdubs of people's voices!<br /><br />It was all summed up when in a hotel room, the lead male character stands up, goes to leave the room, but forgets where the door is. It's simply embarrassing! Awful!
