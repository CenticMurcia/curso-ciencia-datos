Sneakers is a fantastic movie! Almost perfectly cast--River Phoenix as a hacker is tough to accept, although he's fun in the role. The direction, cinematography, and music are excellent-- it doesn't get much better than these great angles, stylistic cuts, and on-the-edge-of-your-seat jazz (believe it or not!). The script is hilarious, the drama real. And as for the "plausibility", I don't know what the previous reviewer is talking about. I'm a Caltech undergrad, so I have a better feel for Large Number Theory and hacking than the average person, and I have to say, it's about a thousand times more possible than anything technical that Hollywood's churned out since. Okay, so even an applied mathematician being able to build such a chip all by his lonesome is pretty iffy; and some of the gadgetry is absurd, like the movement sensors that can be fooled by raising the temp to 98.6 F. And the character of Cosmo the still-radical anti-capitalist is a little off the beaten path. But these details should and can easily be ignored. As they say, sit back and enjoy the hack. Better performances of *real* hackers personalities you won't find outside of the X-Files.
