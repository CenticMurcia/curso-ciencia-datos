Beginning with the usual explanation/apology as to why Holmes exists in the 'modern' day, the film has the character travel to Washington to help solve where a British Secret Service agent hid a precious microfilm. It's not exactly Conan Doyle but it's very fast moving and sharply written.<br /><br />Unfortunately there are not many moments of atmosphere and the film is blandly shot like any other 40s movie and doesn't affect an air of mystery. Watson is a bit more of a comical buffoon than usual, but I find it entertaining even if it doesn't fit the original image of the character.<br /><br />The patriotic speech at the end (typical of the modern, WWII Sherlock Holmes movies) does feel tacked on and is pretty damn unsubtle.
