This movie is a real joy. Loved the Woody Allen glasses Julie Delpy wore for the first part of the film. Sure, there are a lot of Allen similarities. But she takes off the glasses, and comes into her own.<br /><br />As for the Linklater comparisons, honestly, I like her film as well as anything he's done, and he's one of my favorite directors.<br /><br />One thing Delpy has, that Linklater rarely has, is perspective. He had it in Dazed and Confused, and he had it in the Delpy movies, but otherwise mostly he has this high, etherized meta-perspective on things. It's heady, but there's not a lot of heart in it. Except when he has Julie as a vanishing point to fall towards.<br /><br />I really love this woman. She was singing Nina Simone in Sunset, so I checked her out. I heard a song, Little Girl Blue. It was the most heart-broken thing I had ever heard, and I thought, oh, Julie! Zoot Allure! I wanted to send her chocolates and flowers, to cheer her up, and I would have, too, except she'd think I was a psycho.<br /><br />Very funny, very personal. Vulnerable, yet able to pull it together. Nice work, Julie. I hope you make more! We'll watch them!
