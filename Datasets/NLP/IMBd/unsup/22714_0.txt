Richard Pryor was really one of the most definitive stand-up comedians of all time. He influenced Eddie Murphy as well as many other comedians that became huge successes later on. When I first saw this I did not know what to think because I had seen Pryor in several movies, but I had never seen him do his stand-up comedy. At first I started to crack up because he was insulting this guy taking his picture, which to me when a comedian includes the audience and insults them it really makes the performance a very funny one. The jokes were very original and well sorted out by Pryor himself. This all led into what I think is one of the greatest and funniest stand-up events ever done.
