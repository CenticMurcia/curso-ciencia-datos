oh dear. waves of kids being murdered in favellas in rio de janeiro. an interesting, if disturbing topic. who is responsible? enter rae dawn chong, beautiful but somewhat limited actress (see Commando) and one of the Kemp brothers (of the hallowed thespian soap opera school of acting) Add revered (reviled?) soft porn director Zalman King and the result is an excuse of a film that doesn't really work on any level. The directing credit is actually shared between King and one Walter Avancini, and the difference in opinion they must have had is obvious as the film changes direction frequently, unsure of it's path. the flashbacks are repetitive and irritating, the voodoo sub-plot ridiculous, the characters either too sleazy for words or just plain awful.If you want to see Chong naked this will(maybe)satisfy you, but at what price? There probably IS a good movie to be made on this subject matter, but Boca isn't it.
