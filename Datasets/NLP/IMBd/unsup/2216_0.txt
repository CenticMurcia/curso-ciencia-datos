It seems the President will be stopping at the little town of Suddenly CA on his way to Los Angeles. Crazy killer Johnnie (Frank Sinatra) comes into town and holds a family hostage to use their house as a place to kill the President from.<br /><br />This is dated in a lot of ways--the violence is extremely toned down, there's next to no blood (even when one man is shot at least 30 times!) and the killers are actually way too nice. Still, it is short (only about 75 minutes), moves quickly and has some good acting. Top billed Frank Sinatra is great. This is his first film (and I think only one) playing a totally amoral criminal. Every time he's on screen you can't stop watching him. Nancy Gates as one of the hostages is also good. The rest of the cast ranges from OK to disastrous--especially Sterlinh Hayden who is stone-faced throughout. The film looks cheap too and the print I saw was in terrible shape. Still this is worth catching just for Sinatra's acting. He holds this together. Remade (disasterously) as "The Desperate Hours" in 1990. Now THAT'S a bad film!!!!<br /><br />"Ellen will you please stop being a woman!"
