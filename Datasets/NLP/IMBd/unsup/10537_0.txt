I noticed this had been produced by Oliver Stone when I saw it for sale, thus my reasoning for snapping it up. Usually what Stone touches turns to gold and this is no exception<br /><br />This film will move you to tears; mark my words. I wasn't ready for it, or at least wasn't expecting it. Realism is the key to its power.<br /><br />While some viewers may focus on which ethnic groups are committing what crimes, for the wider audience I think it has a commentary on the human race in general and what it is capable of. <br /><br />Quaid performs his part from top to bottom, which drains the viewer of emotion, making one actually process information that has previously just been news broadcast.<br /><br />A good mix of local and international filmaking skills also present what I would consider an accurate picture of the racial and religious groups depicted in the movie. I'm sure insiders will disagree, but from my time spent in the region, there was not a scene or individual character where I was skeptical of objectivity - from the bus driver to father.<br /><br />There is so much to be said about Savior, and it is a must see for any international audience. It may unearth a conflict of opinions among serbs, croats and bosnians, but perhaps they would be reading too much into it...
