Thinking this was a horror movie (billed as such) and starring guys like Bela Lugosi and Lionel Atwill, I wound up disappointed.....even more so because this movie started off pretty well and had promise. However, that "promise" was never delivered. There wasn't enough suspense or action to keep my interesting after the first hour. It got way too talky for what it should have been.<br /><br />Fans of the two guys mentioned above will be very disappointed. Lugosi plays the butler and does very little and Atwill literally disappears halfway through. Yet, both men got pretty good billing on the opening credits. It's misleading.<br /><br />The story isn't bad but, outside of some good sound effects like the frogs and the crickets, is not the creepy movie it's advertised as being. Maybe in 1942 this creeped out audiences, but it wouldn't today. Then again, I only saw this movie when it was on TV and commercials were continually interrupting things. That's a big reason I don't even watch TV shows any more unless they are on DVD. Perhaps if this film ever comes out on disc, I'd give it another shot.
