I love B-movies, but I have to admit, this was pretty bad and nearly unwatchable.<br /><br />I work in the indie film industry, so I respect the fact that the filmmakers were able to get enough people together to make this stinker, so I give them that, but that's about all.<br /><br />There is a scene towards the end, when three survivors are in the cabin, the chick ranger is explaining what the hell is going on (she all of a sudden becomes the expert) but notice her head turning as she addresses the other two survivors. But if you look at the scene, the other two survivors are standing one behind the other. Bad editing indeed. I had to rewind the DVD to see if I missed a 4th person in the room.<br /><br />The werewolf, though a commendable SFX effort, looked more like a Power Ranger villain.<br /><br />I guess I wouldn't be so critical if the filmmakers intended this to be fun and campy. If they did, it didn't work.
