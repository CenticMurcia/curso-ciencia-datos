Greetings & Salutations! Who can ever forget that great African-American actor and comedian, Mantan Moreland? The world was blessed on September 3rd, 1902, when Mantan Moreland was born in Monroe, Louisiana and the world was saddened at our loss when he died September 28, 1973 in Hollywood, California, where he appeared in 134 movies as well his memorable guest appearances on the Bill Cosby Show in 1969 or on "Love, American Style" in 1969, or on the police drama "Adam-12" in 1968. He also was in "Harlem On the Prairie" with Herb Jefferies in 1937 and appeared in a number of Westerns such as "Riders of the Frontier" in 1939 as Chappie, the cook (also known as "Ridin' the Frontier.") There shant ever be another Mantan Moreland with his portly frame and popeyed look, hopefully all of the movies he appeared in will be on VHS and DVD for future generations to watch and enjoy over and over.
