This movie is very, very funny. It may not be for everyone, but I loved it. The great thing is the premise: it stars three drag queens whose male identity is never acknowledged, so in effect they are women in the movie. The main character, Evie, is an over-the-hill has-been, who starred in really bad "B" movies, like "Asteroid," and marginal TV show appearances; then there's her roommate who Evie treats as her maid, who longs for a baby but has a sordid past; and finally, there's the ingenue of the bunch, an overweight mid-western wanna-be actress who dreams of being discovered in Schwabb's Drugstore "just like Tina Turner."<br /><br />There are just so many funny lines; there are a few times the movie almost goes too far, but it's just so over the top that you don't really get offended. It's kind of like a John Waters movie, but the toilet humor isn't as gross!
