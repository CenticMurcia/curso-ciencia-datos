That's a very convincing point you made. So let me get this straight, you didn't say wow, it was great for adults and teenagers (so they've killed their chances at the toddler and senior citizen market?), it was above average but failed at being a really good movie, BUT kept you on the edge of your seat. Very concise and to the point, good job. I'm definitely gonna go and probably see this movie or another one.<br /><br />Traitor was very edge of your seat thriller. The movie just doesn't really ever make you say wow. The whole movie was the SAME from beginning to end. It was just mostly bombings. The story was way to confusing and was jumping all over. Despite that the movie was ABOVE AVERAGE. If the movie wasn't so confusing and boring it would have been great. This movie had so much potential to be a good movie but failed. This was a GREAT MOVIE for adults to see though. I think most teenagers wouldn't enjoy it as much. So I do recommend this movie to adults. The acting was very good and Don Cheadle didn't fail once. He was great and really was a blast to watch in this movie. Overall though the movie was alright with very good acting. Go see it if you like thrillers.
