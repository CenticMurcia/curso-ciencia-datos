I thought this was a solid film, great acting by the leads, great effects. The first hour was a bit slow, but in the end I understood that, they had to build the back-story in a way that it would be believable. I thought that all the players were good, Bruce Campbell did a great job, as always. I would definitely recommend this film to any of my thriller fan friends. I would compare this film to The Gift with Cate Blanchett. Both were suspenseful without being too gory. I understand that this film didn't have a huge box office life (if any) and that is a real shame. It was a creepy, suspenseful thriller. I rarely give any movie a 10, but this one was really close.
