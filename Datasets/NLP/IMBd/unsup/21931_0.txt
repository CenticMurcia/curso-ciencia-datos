Occasionally, a film arrives with little or no fanfare and surprises many who expected just another film. How often we are wrong. That, should be the premise of this story. Each pivotal character woven within this western tapestry seems to have reached the summit of experience. Then why does each ignore the warnings when they arise before hand? For many Burt Lascaster fans, this is a classic role as he plays Constable Bob Valdez, an aging but experienced peace keeper. Townsmen and friends alike, know little of him or his background, until an uneventful day when a rich and powerful land Baron, incites all to chase and corner an ex-army soldier because he "looks familiar." Accidentally killing the soldier, Valdez seeks $200.00 compensation for the widow. When challenged to get the first $100.00 from Mr. Tanner (Jon Cypher) the rich landowner, the task become an impossible quest as Tanner has no intention of giving Valdez anything, but contempt, torture and pain. What ensues is a noble saga worthy of the former Indian scout and tracker. Although, Tanner is the main obstacle, Valdez is also challenged by Tanner's formidable collection of professional gunmen assembled by his experienced right-hand man, El Segundo (Barton Heyman). Among them is Hector Elizondo as a Mexican Rider and R.L.Davis (Richard Jordon) as a cowardly opportunist. Playing Valdez's friend is Diego, (Frank Silvera), in addition there's Tanner's wife, Gay Erin (Susan Clark) who is taken hostage, but ends up anything but. What transpires is a valuable lesson for all. The experience of a man may be hidden by time, but time cannot hide the experienced man. *****
