I will let you all in on a little secret. People do not go to musicals for the story. They go for the athletic dancing, the fashions and the musical style of the film. Repeat after me: They do not go for the story. As incredible as it may be, the story is a just a vehicle to carry the dancers and musical talent along. It is NOT the main reason. If MGM or Paramount or whoever place major musical stars in a picture, it means it wants to see them PERFORM. As the audience does. The story, well it is - just a what did I say....... A vehicle to show off their talent on celluloid. This one, set on a ocean liner is as snazzy as 50s pix get is only dulled by the awesomely boring mummy's boy of all time BING CROSBY. However it is livened by effervescent clever Donald O'Connor and Mitzi Gaynor.. and Edith Head clothes. The Porter songs are great and the pic/look is sent up later by Kelly and Maclaine in 1964 at Fox in WHAT A WAY TO GO. Gorgeous fun. And not so much about the story.
