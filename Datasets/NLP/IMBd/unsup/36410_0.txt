I almost cried after watching this move, not because it was emotionally moving, but because I wasted $5 to rent it for the weekend. First of all, the editing sucked, some parts of the movie seemed to be recorded on a camcorder. The climax scene was more flat than week-old soda. Many things didn't make sense at all - such as French soldiers in full uniform in 100 degree heat, or dynamite blowing a perfect square hole in the ground in front of a tomb. The whole movie was not believable AT ALL. Honestly, I've seen better acting in porn. If you want a good Egypt movie, watch The Mummy instead.<br /><br />Too bad I can't give this movie negative stars.
