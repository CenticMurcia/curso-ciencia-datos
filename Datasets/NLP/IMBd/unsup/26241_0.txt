Although this movie has three rather uneven stories in separate segments, the overall package succeeds, is quite beautiful artistically and is highly entertaining. For once, I think this movie on IMDb is UNDERRATED. However, I must say that I've seen this film several times and it did get better the more I watched it.<br /><br />The first story is the best. It concerns Moira Shearer as a ballerina who has a heart condition but MUST dance, as to her ballet is a compulsion. The music by Rachmaninof is VERY haunting and I got it stuck in my brain for weeks following the movie. This segment reminded me of The Red Shoes (also starring Shearer) but was thankfully MUCH shorter and interesting--a definite plus for those like me who really DON'T like ballet! <br /><br />The second is about as good and is a cute little fantasy involving a little boy who is magically transformed, temporarily, into an adult. As a child, he said how much he hated his governess, but as a man, hormones kick in and he is naturally drawn to the vivacious Leslie Caron (who wouldn't be?). It's cute and a bit sad as well.<br /><br />The final is the weakest story about a trapeze artist who lost his last partner but now has discovered another,...and LOVE! It's a decent portion but is just overwhelmed by the quality of the other stories.
