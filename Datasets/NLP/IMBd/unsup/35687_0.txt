Before I have seen the movie, I thought that it was gonna be a fun movie but I am totally disappointed. The movie sucks!!! It was a terrible terrible version of SHREK with no script at all. My guess is that the script writer saw the movie SHREK and want to make a Turkish copy of it. But I guess he forgot to write the script!!! Why can't they make an original movie??? I don't even know how they find financial support for the movie. There were very good actors with a little appearance and almost no lines. Instead of watching this movie, go find to do something else. Believe me whatever you choose, it will be better than seeing this movie.
