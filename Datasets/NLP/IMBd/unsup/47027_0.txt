This film ran on the Sundance Channel last night, and after watching less than ten minutes of it, i knew I was in the presence of yet another poorly written, embarrassingly acted piece of TLA crap. This film had me groaning out loud at how poorly written the dialog is. It makes Kevin Smith films seem like Shakespeare...and I hate Kevin Smith.<br /><br />If you are so starved for frontal nudity, I guess you could turn the sound off and get a few nice bodies to look at now and then. But I warn you, if the sound is on, you're going to be screaming at the screen.<br /><br />Don't waste 90 minutes of your life on this mess. Rent "Shortbus" instead.
