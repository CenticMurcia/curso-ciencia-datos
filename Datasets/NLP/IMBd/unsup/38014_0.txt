To even the score I jumped from D.O.G. - THE BOUNTY HUNTER" right here. I enter another room in the same mental cellar. Flavor, what makes you tick these days, it's not your clock. Your clock is gone. To quote the German band Die Sterne": Was hat Dich bloss so ruiniert?" (="What has only just brought you that low?").<br /><br />Man, your PE-records were like lead on my turntable; in the late 80s, early 90s I couldn't turn them off! And now? You used to be one major influence on my political education, and now ... (sorry, it'll get ugly now but you asked for it) you abandoned all self-esteem and present yourself as the "brainless bimbo", that all the white racist-pigs tend to see in your skin; are you fraggin' out of your mind? That the show is probably a fake doesn't make it any better, rather worse.<br /><br />You wanna get laid... Okay you wanna get laid, get the gal-reel served on a silver plate and also get paid for it if possible. I can relate to that... somehow. But does the whole world gotta know and watch? Okay I admit: that's their idiotic decision. But you didn't spend all your millions to survive on such a lobotomized format, did you? Do you suffer of a profile-neurosis? Well, I probably do, for writing a comment on such a brainless show and hope, it might bring you back to the Mic. Poor riddle me...<br /><br />Your sound was a vision, your records my gyro, you aborted the mission, now you're channel zero! <br /><br />By the way, you got a colored POTUS lately, you noticed? Mission accomplished and ... oh great, you're still in bed. <br /><br />GET IN YOUR FACKING GILLIE AND GO!
