Okay, it's not exactly Gone with the WInd or a great comedy, but this is a very cute movie. In fact, it's so sweet and innocent that it's a sort of live action cartoon that would be great for children. (There is one instance where the squirrel is said to be "dead" but he opens his eyes so quickly that I don't think children would be upset.<br /><br />One of the downsides I was going to say was that it wasn't in color, but I see that there is a colorized version. I would definitely recommend seeing that one over the black and white version I saw on TCM because as I say there is a real fairy tale feeling to the story and the color will add to that, especially if seen for Christmas. It even gives a good morality lesson about prayer and using it as a gimmick, but is not overly preachy about it. <br /><br />I had to laugh out loud when they said the animation was so "realistic." To our eyes today it looks (much like March of the Wooden Soldiers) as if the animation was done in a 3rd grade video class, but that is part of the charm of the movie and I think you will find yourself laughing at it as I did, from the charm and not out of cynicism.<br /><br />But of course the main attraction is Jimmy Durante in an endearing role in which he gets to crack jokes, sing sweet songs and just be his lovable self. This film will allow a whole new generation to fall in love with him.<br /><br />So definitely sit down and watch this movie, especially for the holidays, with the kids. It's a sweet, sentimental and silly story about a "saintly" squirrel. But if you don't watch it you'd be...ummm...nuts! :)
