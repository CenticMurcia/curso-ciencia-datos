I enjoyed the plot of this movie. Certainly, monster in the closet is not an original idea, but they put their own spin on it. Sometimes, old plots are the best plots. I don't want this to be a spoiler, so I won't reveal too much.<br /><br />This movie is about a boy with telekinetic powers. From early in the movie, we know there is something evil in his closet. The plot builds up throughout the movie and comes together nice and tight at the end. This is not some movie with a bunch of weird supernatural stuff that have nothing to do with each other, like Friday 13th part 7. This one all comes together.<br /><br />My favourite scene is the one with the ceiling fan. Very exciting, though I don't see how a mere ceiling fan is cause for that much alarm. Well, thats what I love about B-movies. Some people just don't get it. I gave this 7 out of 10. It is a good horror B-movie. Not a movie for harsh critics though. Its good fun, very imaginative, but some would think its pretty stupid. If you're one of those people who hate everything, don't watch this. If you like B-movies and have a good imagination, than this, like so many films I recommend, is for you.
