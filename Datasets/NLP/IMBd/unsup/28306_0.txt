I came across this little lions gate gem by accident. And yes I must say that i was a bit impressed by it, maybe cause my expectations fell so low. But i think not. Sure the film's acting isn't great, but it's very few films especially in the genre that measure up. The spfx are non existent, the camera effects are a bit annoying but the sound and the storyline are pretty damn cool. plus the guy who wrote and directed this has some talent and will probably be going places very soon. The film centers around a young woman named Laura who was brutally attacked by a stalker. Because of the incident shes sustained agoraphobia ( for anyones whose seen Copycat-it's fear of leaving the place you find safe.) Unable to leaver her apartment she finds herself being haunted by a violent ghost. She almost immediately enlists the help of an internet fake who ends up being interested in becoming the real dead. the film has some nice twists and turns, most of which are quite surprising. But the big question here is how and why this film hasn't been talked about more. sure it looks a little like one of my weekend film projects but like mine this film has some real potential. it's obvious that everyone associated with the film are genre fans and it really shows. Kudos to the cast and crew of Ghost Watcher let the buzz begin! 7/10
