Well all the editing and technical job done by western people has really helped this movie in making it a treat to watch. Though the end is sad but movie leaves various questions open: 1.When Kiron Kher who was forcibly stripped of her identity once finds that she is once again social pariah due to no fault of hers ,anguish and bewilderment at her face are really powerful. 2.The girl cycling outside the Jehadi meeting shows how oblivious world remains when dangers like breed in our surroundings. 3.There is marked similarity in the speech of Leader in the conference and interview of Amir on the TV in the end.Same vague things about identity of nation. 4.Encounter of ayesha with her brother where she asks her that after killing girls to save their HONOUR what was he seeking now?.This scene is superb. 5.Scen at marriage party gives a good glimpse of social interactions in Punjab also how feudal elements still hold sway. Overall I would like to see more movies by this director.In fact world wars' horror are kept alive by superb movies based on that period.Partition of India, an equally momentous event which left behind a trail of human suffering should be depicted in more films of this type so that young people and people outside Indain subcontinent are sensitized that violence and religion never mix well.
