I have read a lot of negative opinions, but fortunately I didn't take them seriously. I have found in this film exactly what I have expected - a deep look into typical modern man's programs for lifetime.<br /><br />There's nearly everything what's important and on top today - repression of emotions, repression of sexuality, repression of basic drive for power and survival... all in one. And all of these is being revealed right into it's true, fully mad picture by Jack Nicholson, a person whom I reckon the second most deprogrammed actor in the world, after the great Anthony Hopkins.<br /><br />This is a great film, but not for purposes of mindless entertainment, rather for purposes of knowing self. I strongly recommend this film.
