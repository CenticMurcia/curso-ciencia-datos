I have nightmares about this film! For years I thought I had made it up because I could not locate information about it anywhere. If you look up Rich Little's official website and his filmography, he will not admit to making this film. Little plays Richard Nixon as if he were Oliver Hardy and Herb Voland plays Spiro Agnew as if he were Stan Laurel. Sounds like a kick? It isn't. It is truly, truly awful. I have been a film buff since I paid $.25 to get into the Ritz theater as a little girl. I believe this may be the only movie in my life that I walked out on. And, I was a very politically aware teenager in the 70's, very anti-Nixon and his administration. I still found no redeeming value in this "spoof". No one should be forced to sit through this film and I am pleased to see that it has never made it to video or DVD.
