Youth Danny Embling (Noah Taylor) suffers the pain of learning his long -time favourite piece of crumpet is starting to expand her own social circle, leaving him still too slow in the growth cycle to keep in step. Noah, Bruce Spence & Graeme Blundell are superb (with some thanks to flawless script and damn fine direction), while the bit parts played by Robert Carlton (only seen elsewhere in High Tide), are bonzah-funny. Beware, this feature plays on true-to -life reaction to true-to-life occurances, utilising true-to-life dialogue. The Year is an anti-soap. Conversation including "I'm sorry, you're so mature for your age.", and "He thinks you're sexy" would not suit if the film wasn't meant to be aimed at describing ordinariness.
