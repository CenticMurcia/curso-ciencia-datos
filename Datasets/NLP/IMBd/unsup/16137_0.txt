With 3 kids (now 16, 13, 11) I have seen a lot of kids movies over the years, this one is pretty funny! Even though my kids are getting older they still enjoy watching this movie, and I do too. The dog is so cute and trained so well that you can't help but root for him.<br /><br />If you haven't watched this one yet, I recommend it for a fun family movie evening. Not only is it funny, it doesn't have all those annoying songs that your kids will sing for weeks on end!
