The only ones who think Space: 1999 is any good are those who grew up watching it as kids, and therefore has a nostalgic relationship with the series. I am not one of those.<br /><br />When I view this series today (as TV reruns), trying to be objective about its value as sci-fi, I find hardly anything to enthuse about. Compared to just about any other sci-fi show, even from its own era, Space: 1999 has probably the most terrible and obnoxiously inaccurate scientific content I've ever seen, and that includes the basic story (the moon sent hurtling through space at what must be sub-lightspeed, yet encountering new worlds and aliens in every episode). Martin Landau is a very serious-looking actor who's trying to be professional about it, but he cannot save a horrid, brain-dead show like this.<br /><br />Apologies to the show's fans, but I - a seasoned sci-fi fan - find the show practically unwatchable. It's even worse than the old Battlestar Galactica series, though not by much!<br /><br />My rating: 2 out of 10.
