I am a big fan of the first movie - "Zenon girl of the 21-st century", and after watching the first sequel I thought to myself that they ruined the whole story and the illusion, I saw this movie because there was nothing else to see on TV, and I'm glad I did, because this movie brought back my admiration to this story. The character of Dasha is great, and really adds to the movie... The best thing of the 3 movies is the special futuristic language. My favorite line is "Vega Omega", as you can tell, and "Stellar". The producers of this movie are geniuses. They have managed to create a perfect futuristic world, very similar to our world nowadays, but still with the cool outfits and language. May there be more movies like this one...
