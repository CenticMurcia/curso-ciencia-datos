If you haven't seen 2001, Silent Running, Event Horizon, Dark Star or Alien, you might enjoy this film. <br /><br />Otherwise you'll just find your mind continually wandering back to the previous films. If you've seen them then avoid this one, as they're much better films (yes even Event Horizon).<br /><br />As stated in previous reviews, the FX are very good, but that alone isn't enough to save this film.<br /><br />I read that Alex Garland wanted the film to be about meeting god. It's a shame he didn't want to inject some humour and more action into the story also, because its quite heavy going.<br /><br />I'm amazed that Danny Boyle has produced such a turgid and morose (quite boring) film (by his standards that is).
