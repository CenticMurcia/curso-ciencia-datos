People watching Heavy Metal for the first time with on prior knowledge of the magazine or the basic concept of the movie, like me, will undoubtedly give you mixed reviews.<br /><br />Some will love the violence, sex, humor and all-around edginess. Some will hate the animation (which is good in some instances and frustrating at its worst). The degree of nudity seemed a bit intense when I began watching it, but I quickly adapted to this stylistic choice.<br /><br />On its own, it isn't a particularly good movie. Its Tarentino narrative style and dropped-in-the-middle exposition can't help but upset if you're not expecting it. The reason the film is called Heavy Metal isn't even readily apparent (unless you've done your research and discovered that it is, in fact, based off of something else).<br /><br />But, if you're willing to look past those things that irk cinema fans, and if you picked up this little cult piece you probably are, either being an animation fan or just a free spirit, it's a rather satisfying film. The emotions and ideas of the film come together if you are willing to take some of the other elements with a grain of salt. Some people may hate it, others herald it as a masterpiece. I just think it's so bad it's good. That warrants it a 7 in my book.
