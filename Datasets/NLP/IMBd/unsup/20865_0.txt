Far better than American shows of the same type (Saturday Night Live)which spend more time showing political leanings than just being funny. L Britain is very funny--a bit more male kissing than I care to see--but the skits are very well done. As odd as it may seem, the funniest skit to me is the shortest, the politician holding the press conference in front of his home explaining the latest misunderstood sex scandal. The fat jealous women is funny although it can cross the sexual line a bit. The only gay in town skit is just plain funny along with the racist neighbor lady.(I'm trying to fill 10 lines) As good as it is--it ain't The Benny Hill Show though---sorry
