Late night films don't get much better than this. As the story went on the plot got more and more ridiculous and entertaining. I was surprised with a little cameo by Ben Stiller. The main character was a bit of a lost soul and his lady (who once played a great Buffy the Vampire Slayer) seemed a bit more mature. I found many of the citizens of hell to be decent characters and enjoyed their roles in the film. When the movie was over i thought about what a waste of time it was. Yet I found myself watching it a couple weeks later, what else am i gonna do at one on a Saturday night. If you plan on watching some cheesy movie on a non cable channel, Highway to Hell is the best one you could see.
