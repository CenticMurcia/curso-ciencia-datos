Claude Berri's most disappointing movie to date. Perhaps Claude is surrounded by too many 'yes' people to take a truly objective look at his efforts. How some critics could extrapolate any glowing positives from such a tepid offering truly indicates that a career in film critique is available to just about anyone. Remarkably ALL the characters lacked an ounce of charisma (quite an achievement in itself),with the result that 60 minutes into the movie you really could not care where the thinnest of plots was heading. Quite sad to say that even the normally beguiling Miss Tautou could not provide a sufficient distraction either - perhaps the 'Da Vinci Code' has momentarily upset her ability to distinguish turkeys from true quality.
