I just love Occult Gothic movies and Little Witches is just that, i love the whole witch/satanic thing it really makes the film, the main character brings it all together as she is the most evil one. It's great when the school girls stumble across the old satanic temple and find the book on black magic spells and then they start to form a coven and try to summon up a demon and then one of their friends tries to stop them before they offer a human sacrifice, it's just really good. I loved The Craft but liked this even more as it dabbles more into the evil side of magic and satanism, if you love movies about witchcraft & black magic you will not be disappointed.
