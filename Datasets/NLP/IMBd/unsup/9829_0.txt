If it wasn't for the occassional flash of skin, this film would have no interest at all. Don't waste any money on this one, wait.. not for the DVD but for television to show it. It should bomb fast enough to be on TV within the year. The only strong point is the presence of Meghan Ory, a beautifull newcommer who makes a strong showing in a waste of celluloid. Nicole Eggert's contribution is less than stellar, times must be tough after Baywatch. As for the alien babes, well, there's more interest at a Victoria's Secret TV special. Finally, the movie's logo for decoys is a representation of a spider; they only show up for about 2 minutes near the end of the film. No plot, no performance, no interest; who was the genius that made this looser.
