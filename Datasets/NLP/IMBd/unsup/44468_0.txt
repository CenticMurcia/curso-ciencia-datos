As an avid fan of silent and early talking films, I saw no harm in wanting to watch this film. I had enjoyed the Three Stooges growing up, and the opportunity to watch a film from 1930 was always welcoming to me.<br /><br />Never before have I been so disappointed in a film from this era. It was absolutely atrocious, and a waste of seventy minutes' time. As for what happened to the actors, I couldn't care less, not that they were doing anything anyway. Somebody should have given some care to this film. The film was not even enjoyably stupid- it was just plain foolish. To think that this 'masterpiece' was preserved makes me question whether someone really didn't just throw money away. To return to the film- do you want to be sickened, made uneasy? Then watch this awful thing! Also, Fred Sanborn- ha! what can one say save that he turns the stomach! To be somewhat fair, there was one good five minute sequence with Healy and the Stooges at a party. As for the rest, it should have rotted away.
