Script and Plot - Juvenile and clich√©d.<br /><br />Acting - Incomprehensible - The worst ever Welsh accent starts it off, and it only gets worse.<br /><br />Direction and Editing - Awful.<br /><br />If you're tempted to watch this on rental - please don't. It is truly, truly awful. Nothing more needs to be said. Sorry.<br /><br />Well, it appears that IMDb needs ten lines to make this valid. OK - the plot is invented (in spite of the back of box blurb), and it involves a caper to run after German loot as a side operation to operation "Market Garden". We have English actors running around with silly fake German accents and it's terribly stupid and tiresome.
