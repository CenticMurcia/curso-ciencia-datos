The good thing is that it lasts only 80 minutes. That's the longest run for a script like this. A man, while having a sexual intercourse with his girlfriend, gets bitten by a werewolf, and his gf gets torn to shreds (yes, you've guessed it, she was in mid-orgasm when the beast attacked). He becomes a werewolf. The rules in this movie are such, that he turns into a werewolf every single night, no matter what moon phase it is. And also, silver bullets and garlic are not the only things that can kill him, as he insightfully explains it to his nephew "a good shotgun blast to the head" will get him too. He moves to his sisters (and nephews) house, away from his trailer home in the mountains, because he has murdered 5 hikers already (as a werewolf), and believes that only family love can save him from his destiny. He is dead wrong, and soon, as a man also turns into a psycho, killing all the duality of wolf and man, usually found in these movies, which is just too bad, as it could have been a lot better that way. The real hero of this film is not this man, he is the antagonist. Nor is it his sister, not her son. Actually, the protagonist is a German shepherd. Yes, that's right, throughout the movie, a German shepherd, owned by the little kid, is protective of him and his mother, against his uncle. He is the only one that can suspect that the uncle is not all he seems, and he is also the one who kills the werewolf at the end, and lives to tell, even in the closing shot, we see his "angelic" face down on his paws. So, this movie is actually about the devotion of dogs to men. And that saves it from being a total disaster. In conclusion, watch it, if you get a chance, it's watchable.
