This is a masterpiece by John Sullivan who went on to write the brilliant Only Fools and Horses, only one sitcom is better than this and that is Dads Army.<br /><br />It is about Marxist Wolfie Smith (Robert Lindsay), who is leader of the "Tooting Popular Front (TPF)". He and TPF Member Ken (Mike Grady) are lodgers at the Johnson household, which consist of Shirley (Cheryll Hall- series 1 and 2) who is Wolfies fianc√©e, until she immigrates to Italy, Dad Charles Johnson (Antro Morris-Pilot, Peter Vaughn Series 1 and 2 and Tony Steedman series 3 and 4) and daft Mum Florence (Hilda Braid). Also in the TPF are Tucker (Tony Millan) and Speed (George Sweeney). They drink at The Vigalante which is owned by Harry Fenning (Stephen Grief series 1 to 3), who is a hard-man, until he goes and is rumoured to have been killed by Ronnie Lynch (David Garfield) who is the new landlord of the pub. He is married to Mandy (Susie Baker).<br /><br />This is great comedy, the best character in it is the Mum. I'd have thought when Shirley left, the show wouldn't be as good, it was still a masterpiece. A fantastic ending theme tune.<br /><br />Best episode: The Hostage, series 1 episode 4. Here the TPF kidnap a Tory M.P., but it turns out to be Harry Fenning............
