Al Gore did the cerebral - lecturing us like a bunch of college freshmen.<br /><br />Now Johan SÃ¶derberg gives us heart and soul: frankly an absorbing and confronting multimedia experience. This piece deserves some serious awards for the powerful blend of images, music and ideas. I watched it on a Linux box with stereo TV capability, taking live broadcast TV to a tiny 17" monitor screen.<br /><br />The audio quality was great, but for maximum impact the stunning visuals need to be seen on a bigger screen, preferably in DVD picture quality.<br /><br />I plan to get the DVD and lend it to as many people as possible. It really should get a run in the high street cinemas, IMO.<br /><br />The next paragraph is a quote from the film. It was the real punch-line for me, but when you hear it in context, it has much more force (therefore: not really a spoiler, more of an appetizer!)<br /><br />"There is a profound human fear - even terror - of destroying the human habitat - with our own technology, by our own hand, and to no purpose." - Robert Jay Lifton, Psychiatrist.
