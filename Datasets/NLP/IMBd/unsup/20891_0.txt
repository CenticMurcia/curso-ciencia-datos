My Rating: * out of ****. <br /><br />I saw Anger Management for the purpose that there was not much else out. Lets just say, I hated it. I think Adam Sandler has an uneven resume, there are movies I like of his and there are some I just dont care for. I have never actually hated one of his movies (although I never saw Little Nicky, nor do I want to), but Anger Management actually begins a new category. Adam Sandler movies that are plain terrible. <br /><br />Anger Management offers an interesting premise. But with all the bad and unfunny jokes its just a mess of a movie. There may have been possibly one time when I laughed, but thats it. Theres a twist at the end that I would have thought was more clever, if the movie had been somewhat watchable.<br /><br />The acting is not much of a strength. I thought Adam Sandler was great in 2002's Punch Drunk Love, but I found him unconvincing and dull here. Jack Nicholson makes his character into a caricature. This performance does call for Nicholson to be over the top, but hes just ridiculous and kind of annoying. I wanted his scenes to be cut or maybe someone else to play the character. Marisa Tomei is somewhat pleasant to save a few scenes of the movie, but she is not in it much. <br /><br />Anger Management could have been good, and thats probably the biggest disappointment. It needed a more intelligent script, and as much as I'm a fan of Jack Nicholson, I dont think he should have been in this movie. Anger Management is a waste of a movie.
