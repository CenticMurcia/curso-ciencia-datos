Unbelievable that a movie like this has been produced in 1999; if it had been from the sixties I wouldn't have been surprised at all. It is full of cliches, it is terrible predictable (I watched it together with a friend and told him exactly who would be killed and in which order by the time they arrived at the lighthouse!) and awful music - completely identical to the kind they used to use in the earliest horror movies I can remember. I really can't think of any reason why someone might want to see this movie.
