just got my 2 disc anthropophagus DVD in the mail the other day put out by those awesome folks at shriek show.this movie could have used a couple more gory killing in it but i'm not going to complain to much and what there is for gore in this Italian classic is pretty bloody and gory.george eastman is perfectly cast as the mad cannibal who stalks a boatload of tourists on an island.i am a huge fan of joe d'amato so when this came out i threw my old bootleg in the garbage.disc two has a sixty seven minute documentary and interview with d'amato so just that is reason enough to buy this DVD..so if you are a fan of gory and cheesy Italian horror buy this right away
