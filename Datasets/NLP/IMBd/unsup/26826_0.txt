Well I was sucked in. I'm a New Zealander, and even though I have a fairly good handle on my country's history, I found what I watched to be quite believable. This must be the premier hoax documentary of all time.<br /><br />When Peter Jackson (yes, of LOTR fame) discovers "lost" old movie footage and then arranges restoration of same, he finds a historic record of work by one of the country's pioneer movie makers - film that shows, among other gems, proof that Richard Pearse achieved powered flight before the Wright Brothers.<br /><br />What's really clever is that you are never actually told the whole thing is a hoax. In fact, when it first screened in NZ it caused an uproar because it was assumed to be fact. Once you know it's fiction, you can look back and see just how incredibly ridiculous the whole thing is. Really, the whole thing is just so far fetched, yet that is the film's great achievement because when you watch it, you actually believe it (at least I did!) Appearances by genuine movie industry people like Leonard Maltin of course add to the realism.<br /><br />Having said all this, I guess this review has spoiled it for you readers...
