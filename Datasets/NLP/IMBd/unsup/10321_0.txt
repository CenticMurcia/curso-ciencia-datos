This is definitely Charlotte Rampling's film. On the screen nearly all the time she admirably plays the part of Marie, a middle-aged woman whose husband Jean disappears suddenly during a sunny day at a lonely beach.<br /><br />Her mounting despair and refusal to accept the facts which seem to point to his certain death by drowning grip our attention at once. The uncertainty of the incident and her disbelief nurture in us the hope, however meagre, that somehow or other he is still alive.<br /><br />The acting throughout is both sensitive and convincing. Charlotte Rampling is a great actress moving with such grace she can even make the preparation of a cup of coffee interesting to watch. The magic of this film is found in the simple every day incidents that make up our lives...like going to the beach or wondering who is at the other end when the telephone rings. Add to this a mystic quality and you have a winner.<br /><br />Not every one perhaps will agree with the ending, but I think this one is intriguing. A big question mark confronts us. Our hopes rise..... There comes to mind the old saying...."The wish is father of the thought".
