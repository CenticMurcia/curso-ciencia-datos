Lucia, played by veteran actress and foreign film diva Cecilia Roth, is your typical rite-of-passage character. Through the events surrounding the disappearance of her husband, Lucia discovers a new side of herself she hasn't felt due to the freedom of being unmarried and unrestricted. Is it her womaness, her sexuality, her independence she finds? Bingo! You guessed right. The movie wouldn't be so bad if it actually showed her character development from a more personal-inner perspective ... but the journey is clouded through the integration of two men in her life and a weak plot that just seems to drag on and on and on ... at least that's how you feel when the so called "mystery" is solved. It's like you sat through the whole movie for no reason at all ... Roth's acting is good ... although bit overkill on the crying scenes ... the actor who plays Felix is a bit distracting ... facial expressions and lines are given unnaturally, and the other man, her young-love toy, is nothing more than slight eye-candy to hormonal admirers.<br /><br />In short, the plot is fairly original, but not well executed, circular camera shots confuse the audience, the comedy is a bit dry and weak, the drama is a bit heavy, and the acting is moderate. This movie gets four stars (****) ... had Cecilia Roth not been in it, it would have received (**) ... she is the only redeeming value of this flick.<br /><br />-Daine-
