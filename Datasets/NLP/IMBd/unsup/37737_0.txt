I had no idea this movie was made by Michael Moore. I still try not to think about that, because normally I really admire his work. But this movie just wasn't funny. My husband fell asleep while watching it because he found it so boring. I really wanted to stop watching it but decided I'd stick it out to the end and see if it got better, and it just didn't. The jokes weren't funny and the pacing was really slow. I normally appreciate a wide range of humor - everything from the sophomoric to the sophisticated. This just didn't seem very funny at all and even though it's been a number of years since I've seen it, it still reminds the standard against which I measure how bad a movie is. I'm glad Michael Moore went in a different direction with his career, because it would have been a disaster if he did more like this.
