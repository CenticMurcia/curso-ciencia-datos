Ugly violent, incoherent western. Directed, scored and starring country singer Dwight Yoakum. The music score is also a disappointment. It was exec produced by Buck Owens. You would think all this would bring you a half way decent western, but I think the Bakersfield Ca sun got to them first!<br /><br />Even veteran character actors such as Bo Hopklins and Matt Clark can't save this one. Vince Vaughn, Billy Bob Thornton, Paul (Pee-Wee Herman) Ruebens, Bud Cort, Peter and Bridget Fonda - an unusual cast for a western, is wasted in this beautifully photographed travesty. Hang up your guns Dwight, stick to singin'
