This (cough cough) "movie" is almost semi-quasi-sorta-kinda watchable if you're not too terribly particular at the moment.<br /><br />Or, at least, it had an interesting idea premise, but the execution was overly amateurish. The excessive stupidness of some of the college students got a bit annoying after a while. You'd think that if they knew that what they saw was just an illusion hiding a slimy, butt-ugly alien, they would discount the illusion and be cautious and wary. But no-o-o-o, the dummies could always be counted on to fall prey to the alien's come-hither routine.<br /><br />Speaking of the aliens, how come they had breasts? If they're not mammals and don't feed their young with bodily secretions, how come they had boobies? The aliens were obviously fully sentient and therefore had crossed the threshold into personhood, how come they were using other people (the humans) as prey? It's sort of one of those universal no-nos that people will not use other people as prey. The aliens were very obviously total skanks, and i didn't feel sorry at all for them when they were killed.<br /><br />The movie had an interesting concept of evil aliens running amok, but the concept got bogged down with clich√©s and too much airheadedness and cutesypoo-ness.<br /><br />This "movie" could use a re-make, but done correctly this time. Dump out the smarminess and play it seriously, and it could be a real humdinger of a movie.
