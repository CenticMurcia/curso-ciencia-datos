As people have different taste in everything, humor doesn't differ.<br /><br />To me, this is one of the funniest British shows ever. It is in the top with Fawlty Towers, Bottom and The Fast Show (YES, Bottom is still funny).<br /><br />Sure, it's tacky and rude, but isn't that a reflection of the world today. I can understand if some snobs don't like it because vomit and nakedness is a part of the show, but don't say that it's made by people who don't understand humor.<br /><br />I'm Swedish and see a couple of Vicky Pollards on our streets every day. And I don't care if they're "repeating the same jokes every show". As long as it's funny that's fine by me. You can't be innovative with every single part of the show.<br /><br />So, all in all, this is really the dogs b****cks!!
