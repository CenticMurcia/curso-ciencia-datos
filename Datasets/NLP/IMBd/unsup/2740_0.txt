Planet of the Apes was a pretty good show. I have seen a few episodes and for the most part I liked it. I think the plot works and the acting is good. I think that it works that there are two guys stranded on the planet rather than one. Roddy Mcdowell being in the series really helps A LOT. He is a great underrated actor and was key to the Planet of the Apes series. So him being a character in this series is awesome. WIthout him I really do not think this show would have been as good. Often when a film tries to become a television series they do not bring along one of the key actors from that film but in this case they do. So this is a pretty good show, it only lasted one season, and it is definitely worth watching.
