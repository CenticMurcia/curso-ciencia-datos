I have one procedure with movies: they get 30 minutes of good will to prove that they are worth watching. With some films, when I'm not quite sure, this "probation" time is prolonged to 45 minutes.<br /><br />So, I'll tell you what: "I Can't Think Straight" had me bored to tears in 20 minutes! The screenplay is dull and highly predictable, so don't expect any surprises. But it gets worse: the performance of the two main leads was gruesome. The question is not whether they should join acting classes - but whether they would be admitted.<br /><br />What remains? Here are my recommendations: spend your time with something useful, maybe an evening walk with your partner in this early, mild spring, or watch an excellent lesbian movie like "Fingersmith", but not THIS movie.
