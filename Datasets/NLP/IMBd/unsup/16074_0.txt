I went into this movie with pretty high hopes, honestly, I did. My guess was, after the American destruction of Godzilla a couple of years ago, the boys over in Japan would take up the reigns and crank out a Godzilla movie unlike any other seen before. BOY WAS I WRONG. I remember back in the days of saturday childrens matinees, when they would show all of the old Godzilla movies, I mean I've seen them all! GUESS WHAT? They are all the same! It's like Friday the 13th, you can't do anything with a non-talking star like Jason, Same basic story except you put new bodies in the way to get killed. Godzilla, it's a new monster. I've always hated the humans in the Godzilla movies, this is no exception, they think they know it all, but they don't, they stink, and they are on screen way too much, the human scenes always kill the movies. If you go knowing there is nothing special about this show, and it like all of the others, you'll get what you expect. If you want more, sorry, as long as these movies make a ton of money in Japan, they aren't required to raise the standard on GODZILLA. BUMMER!
