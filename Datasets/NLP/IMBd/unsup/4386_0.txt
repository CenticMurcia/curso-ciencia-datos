I discovered this movie through a friend, and my husband and I LA-OOOVE it!!! We actually ended up at the premier in Pittsburgh while visiting and have managed to see it at least a couple more times. It embodies the every-kid experience: "one night my friends and i decide to go after this girl our one friend likes, which is great cause we hate the only other girl he ever liked, and along the way all this crazy sh*t happens." Anyone who's been to high school in the last 30 years will definitely relate, although some may not tolerate the weirdness well. Perhaps if you were a cheerleader in the last 30 years, you may not relate.
