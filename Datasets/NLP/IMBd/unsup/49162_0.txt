This film makes no sense at all. I gave it a 2 because the actors did not phone in their parts; but a 2 is a gift.<br /><br />Unless you want something really really bad to view -- so that you know just where the bottom of the pile is, please don't rent this film. Rent (or buy) instead the videos of the Television series.<br /><br />What were the writers thinking?
