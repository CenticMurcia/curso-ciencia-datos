It is a completely awful movie without any substantial plot. The characters are doing nothing else but screaming and insulting each other and they don't play their role naturally in some scenes. It's an effort to put out a Greek family with problems but this is done very extravagantly. I was tired during watching the movie. I expected something better. The characters seem to insult and shout just only to provoke. I think it's a patchwork without making any sense. It's definitely unsuitable for children or people who can't tolerate the abuse and the movies of type "lets write something quickly just to produce a film". There is no use of vocabulary's variety and no level. They humiliate the Greek family. So, if you don't like the nerves' war with the bad meaning, then don't watch that movie.
