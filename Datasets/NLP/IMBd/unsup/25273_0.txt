This is a favorite movie of mine. Mostly, because I am a fan of James Cagney's and thought his performance in this movie was excellent. In his autobiography, "Cagney By Cagney" Mr. Cagney told of many actual events in Mr. Chaney's life that were used in the picture and one in particular that was so sad they decided not to include it. Although loosely based on the life of Lon Chaney, Sr. I still felt the producers used enough actual events in Mr. Chaney's life to convey to the viewers what a truly talented man he was. Also, the tremendous challenges he faced being the son of deaf and mute parents. This is an excellent movie that stands up well through the years.
