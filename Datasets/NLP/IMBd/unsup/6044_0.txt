Mega Man 2 for the NES is one of the best 8-bit games ever released! When I was ten (1990) I bought the first Mega Man game there ever was. This game was very addictive and made me an instant Mega Man fan. Before 1990 had ended I read a preview of MM2. I couldn't believe my eyes! A sequel was being made of my favorite game! As soon as it was released (early 1991) I bought a copy of it, and played it. I never stopped playing it. MM2 boasts some brilliant music! Most tunes are world famous now, and every Mega Man fan can hum these tunes. Especially Dr. Wily's Castle tune, which seems to be the best Mega Man tune ever! The graphics MM2 shows are of extreme high quality. It puts a lot of 16-bit games and even some 32-bit and 64-bit games to shame! The graphics are very clear and the use of colours in the background is very detailed and a pleasure to look at.<br /><br />In total there are eight levels to conquer before you can fight the master mind Dr. Wily. In the first Mega Man game Dr. Wily reprogrammed six of his peaceful robots to conquer the world. In total seven were made, but the protagonist of both games, Mega Man managed to escape the clutches of the evil Wily. It is now Mega Man's duty to defeat Wily for a second time and destroy his new eight robotic minions. Each robot has its own stage and Mega Man has to beat go through the entire stage to battle a robot master. Once a robot master is defeated Mega Man can use the power of its defeated opponent to battle other robots.<br /><br />Although it sounds all rather easy, it's not. Try to pass Heatman's schasm of fire or pass Quickman's deadly laser beams! This game will get you hooked instantly. Not only by its outstanding graphical and musical quality, but by its playability as well! Controlling Mega Man is a piece of cake, within no time you can make him run, jump and shoot! All in all a must have for every NES owner, but I guess every NES owner already has this game in his collection!
