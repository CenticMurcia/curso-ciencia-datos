I have been an Indian for 28 years now, and have not seen my culture or country being made portrayed more awfully than this.<br /><br />1. Shiv-lingam : Is not a phallic emblem. None of you would like an Indian movie which calls Jesus a bastard. How do you expect Hindus to digest this. Being the third largest religion in this world we deserve some respect for our beliefs, we aren't as aggressive as Muslims to blow bombs on this topic, but at least one could have researched on thi topic before making a movie.<br /><br />2. The Indian BPO Industry : Is booming, doesn't mean that there are call centers even at places where there cannot be an internet connection, You ought to see few of our really nice call centers, due to economy of construction costs, they look much better than a lot of American companies. Location selected for this movie was pathetic.<br /><br />3. Hindu Girls : Your Hero character did nothing to impress the girl, I mean come on, I have dated so many girls but I know it takes time man!, Its not like you go together book a room and "Asha can do anything"...its your exaggerated fantasy of getting a decent girl in a cheap and easy way. Try it yourself!, You can't even date an Indian hooker that easily, girls really do have a class here unlike anyone in US.<br /><br />Please do some research before you make another freaked out Indian movie.
