First of all, u must see this movie at least 2 times, to fully understand what the hell is happening there! A butcher, who really likes to cut meat, whatever (or whoever) it is, his daughter, with [a very beautiful] conception of love from the last decade, a poor but very talented circus artist. One thing that is really exceptional in the movie is the amazing (and weiiird) soundtrack, and the unique musical scene that happens with everything that can probably create a sound, or noise, in the context... A MUST SEE!!!! (bis)
