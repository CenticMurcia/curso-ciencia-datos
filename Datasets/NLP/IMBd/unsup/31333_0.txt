This is the best series I ever saw, Except then when agent Caitlin Todd died :(. I think this was the first series I followed good (mean that I watched everything) And in the last episodes in season 2 it was really dramatic. The actor Mark Harmon ( Agent Gibbs ) is ex marine Who haves a great instinct The actors Micheal Weatherly ( Agent DiNozzo ), Sasha Alexander ( Agent Todd ) and Sean Murray ( Agent McGee ) Are funny Todd and DiNozzo always blackmails each other or DiNozzo looks always in to the privacy of Todd and DiNozzo always fools around with McGee. It is really a funny TV series you really need to watch it.Its dramatic and funny so buy the seasons :P
