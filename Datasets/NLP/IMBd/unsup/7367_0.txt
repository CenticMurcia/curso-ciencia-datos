This film tugs on every heart string imaginable. I loved each charter in the movie for having such heart. There were 2 moments in the film. which I will not spoil, that had tears streaming down my cheeks. The other great part of this film is the action is amazing. It is a throwback to the wonderful blockbusters in the eighties where a single seat wasn't empty in the theater. This is a special film. Made by a special director and cast. I love this film. It is a failure by Hollywood not to release this film. These are the films needed. Stop recycling old ideas. Realize Sky Kids / Flyboys is a special film. I have no other connection to this film other than being blessed to have seen at the Garden State Film Festival. If you get a chance to see this movie, don't pass it up.
