This movie could be the worst movie I've ever seen. It has been showed two times on television here in Norway, and it stinks!!! The first time I saw it, I laughed and laughed of the bad acting and the bad effects!! They suck big-time!! The first time I saw it, I didn't catch the name of the movie. The second time this movie played here, it was the replacement for some sailing-contest, so I thought there was no hope on getting the name of the movie, since they don't show the name of the replacement-movies in the newspaper. But I searched up the character name Jim Conrad here on IMDB, and found this movie. Now I finally know the name of the worst movie I've seen. This movie, the acting, the effects, it all sucks big time!
