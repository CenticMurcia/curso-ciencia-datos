The comments on this board are all interesting and quite valid in their praise of Warren Beatty's gutsy take on American politics. However, no one's made mention that this is film is also brilliantly crafted. Beatty has made a film that balances dozens of well-etched characters in under two hours and made it move lightning fast. The story never loses focus, is wildly romantic and is the first political film that is so gorgeous to look at--it's painted in lush, primary colors that made my jaw drop open with delight.<br /><br />It is fantastic and should have been honored with more Academy recognition.
