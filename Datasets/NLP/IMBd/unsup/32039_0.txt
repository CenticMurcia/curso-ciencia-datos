This is an excellent movie, albeit very short. The protagonists of the movie Yossi and Jagger are seen very little, and the love that they share is very special. Unfortunately for their love, it is torn from them when Jagger is killed during a night skirmish. I respect Yossi for coming to grips at the end when they all go to visit Jagger's family and Yossi is the only one that knows the most about his love-Jagger. I could not wait for the movie to be released in the USA. I bought my copy the day it was released. I had read other reviews, and agree that the movie is far too short. I love the theme song by Ivri Lider-In your Soul. Great movie. Rent it first if you like, you won't be disappointed.
