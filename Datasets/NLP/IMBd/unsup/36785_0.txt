This must be one of the worst movies from 2005 in Sweden, bad actress/actors, a lousy and very predictable script makes this movie so boring I can't find words. The only good thing I found to be of a positive thing, was the music, which makes you remember the 80's, but other from that, there wasn't anything in it for me.<br /><br />From 10 minutes in to the movie, you've already figured out how it's going to end. I also mentioned the actresses/actors being bad, I got that feeling where you're pi*sed off at them, thinking, no, that's not how you behaved during that era plus their performances aren't convincing on any plan.<br /><br />No, this is not a movie I can recommend, you'll find more substance in a Chuck Norris movie than this crap, don't rent/buy this movie!
