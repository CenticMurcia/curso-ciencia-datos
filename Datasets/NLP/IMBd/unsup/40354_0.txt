This movie is really to awful for words. They took a beautiful play and comic and turned it into absolute crap. The special effects are so bad that you can't laugh about them anymore. You can on the other hand wonder about the fact that the movie won an award for best special effects at some festival....Why? Are the people who gave away the awards blind? Cause that's the only logical reason I can find for it. And then the acting...Oh my God, even wooden puppets could act better then all those people together in this movie. The worst thing of it all is that Brian Yuzna really could have made a beautiful movie looking at the story of Faust, but he didn't. Instead he made a movie not really worth seeing. In my opinion this movie never should have been released in the first place.<br /><br />
