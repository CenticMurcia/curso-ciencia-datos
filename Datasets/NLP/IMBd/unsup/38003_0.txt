First of all I went for this film with no expectation. Until half of the film I don't know what this whole movie is about. Then Reema Sen's role introduced. Simbhu failed to convince us Reema as school student and she has an awful screen presence. The things Reema doing to check whether Simbhu is in love with her or not is too ridiculous and some time disgusting too. And Climax.... Just for sake of finishing the film and nothing much to say about it.<br /><br />The only thing which makes us relief is the music. Even the background score makes us think that something is going to happen next even though nothing interesting after that.<br /><br />Towards my point of view this film sure gonna loose some money because Simbhu spent more that he should. I read an interview of him that he will become the next "SHANKAR" and what I am saying is being "SHANKAR" means not dancing with more than thousand people around you. It is more than that.<br /><br />Simbhu should sit down and think more on developing the story than his screen presence as a director. I think even SUPER STAR RAJINI did not had such "Build Up"s than Simbhu in his films...<br /><br />Simbhu still have a long way to go and as a result he should TALK LESS.
