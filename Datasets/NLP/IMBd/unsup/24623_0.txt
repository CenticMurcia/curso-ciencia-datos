This could be a really good show if they ease back on the sex and the long posses. Parts of the show (movie) had me thinking "Oh my God" while other times, I got up to clean out the litter boxes. The acting was okay. No character had me feeling the fear or passion. The story line was okay, but they tried to put in too much in too short of time. They need to really build up the characters. If it makes it to prime-time TV I will give it a go.
