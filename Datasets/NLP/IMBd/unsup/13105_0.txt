Found this film quite unbelievable because of the fact that so many men seemed to be attracted to Greer Garson,(Irene Forsyte) first met a very rich man named Soames Forsyte, (Errol Flynn) and Soames falls immediately in love with Irene and he keeps asking Irene to marry him and after many years of trying, Irene decided to say yes to marriage, however, she told him she does not love him. Irene finds it very difficult to join the family named Forsyte who were a very close family who thought Irene was just a gold digger since she was not a very wealthy woman at all. Through out this picture Irene is hit on by many men who fall in love with her, namely: Philip Bosinney,(Robert Young); Young Jolyon Forsyte, (Walter Pidgeon) , all these men want to marry Irene and do not care if she is married or not. Irene even breaks up a marriage between June Forsyte, (Janet Leigh) who was going to marry Philip Bosinney. It is very hard to understand just who Irene really falls in love with, and you will never see the men going to bed with her since this film was made in 1949.
