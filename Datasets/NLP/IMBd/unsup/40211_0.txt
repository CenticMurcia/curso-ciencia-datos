It looked like it would be nice watch this as a joke, but even that made my brain hurt. It's the type of movie that makes you ashamed of the industry. Just think of all of the starving children that could have been fed with the money this CRAP used up... The time people wasted on watching this instead of doing something useful, like, watching paint dry. Even being drunk probably doesn't make this movie better (I wouldn't know, I only watched it once sober and am in no way meaning to do that to myself again). <br /><br />I've found that watching this movie was only good for one thing - whenever one of my friends regards some movie as "the worst movie ever", I simply raise my hand and say - "Tequila Bodyshots."
