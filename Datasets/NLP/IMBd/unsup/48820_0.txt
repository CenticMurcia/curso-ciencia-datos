This has got to be one of the most boring films I have ever seen. What the Last Broadcast did wrong, The Blair Witch did right. I watched this movie and waited for something to suck me in. And I waited, and waited....until the anti-climactic ending.<br /><br />I wanted to turn it off after about 45 minutes, but I sat through it hoping for the twist, or hoping for SOMETHING to happen, it never did, thank goodness I only rented the movie....
