I saw this piece of s*** last November, and I have never turned the Television off in such disgust. Kelly McGillis was absolutely hideous as the demented divorcee who marries her cousin (Harry Hamlin, in an inappropriate and forgettable role)!!! The film is gross, even for television. The film could have been cut to 2 or 2 1/2 hours, but not 4 wasted hours! Keith Carradine is as milquetoast as usual, even by his EX-wife. This picture just goes to show that all child custody cases are bitter, and was there really a need to wipe out the whole family and the kids? My god! The person who wrote this trash, should be blacklisted in Hollywood, and any other place that has acting as entertainment. This is entertainment?!! I have never seen such a horrible and depressing movie in all of my life!! This gives the term, "bad tv-movie", look like "Gone with the Wind"!! I hope Lifetime NEVER shows this again!! For your sake, don't view this crap. See Gone with the Wind! Especially if you have 4 hours to kill, it certainly is the best film EVER!! Not this Garbage! Don't say you weren't warned!!!!<br /><br />0/10 The lowest!!, The WORST!!!!!!!
