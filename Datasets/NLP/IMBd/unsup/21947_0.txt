I have to admit that Frequency surpassed my expectations. I was skeptical at first but the plot drew me in and held me until the end. Although it tries to straddle several genres, as it progresses it eventually boils down to a mystery/crime thriller.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I do dock some points from Frequency. At times it was a little too cheesey. Most of the 60's props looked more 90's to me. I hardly noticed a difference at all between the two eras. Maybe I'm too young to tell?<br /><br />The whole time-travel paradox was handled a bit sloppily, but really no worse than most time-travel movies. On the other hand, it was probably a good thing that the movie didn't get bogged down trying to explain the physics behind the radio time-connection or the details of the time-paradox. <br /><br />Rather they simply established that this radio communicates through time. It's something to do with the stars; leave it at that. If they tried to offer some lame, detailed explanation, it would have hurt the credibility more. Overly picky critics may think themselves clever in pointing out the time-travel flaws in Frequency, but these are slips that the writers obviously knew about; it's assumed that the viewer will take a leap of faith fairly early on, and thus the movie is able to build an interesting plot from the premise of a "magic" radio.<br /><br />Consider on the other hand, the latest Star Wars flicks, where Lucas tries to explain the Force coming from tiny organisms in the bloodstream. Bleeehh. What a way to kill the magic and distract from the plot.<br /><br />All in all, Frequency is a fresh movie with an engrossing plot. I give it a 7 / 10.
