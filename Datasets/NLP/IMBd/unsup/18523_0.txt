Hannity and Colmes has been a staple of my news intake for several years now. I find their debates interesting and their guests even more interesting.<br /><br />The large amount of viewers garnered by most Fox News prime-time shows allows for some interesting guests to appear on the show, from both sides of the aisle. But Hannity and Colmes takes the cake, numerous appearances by people like Ann Coulter or Al Sharpton can be seen, along with the intelligent debate from the neo-conservative Sean Hannity and the Liberal-minded Alan Colmes.<br /><br />If you want the news in rapid-fire fashion, this show is not for you. If you want to understand the news as both sides see it, then I highly recommend it.
