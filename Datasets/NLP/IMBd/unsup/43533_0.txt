Dil Se was a huge set back for Mani and it seems that he hasn't come out of that disaster. Yuva doesn't reveal the excellence of Roja and Bombay. Songs in the movie are highly irrelevant and irritating. Ajay Devgan is one of the most improvised actors in industry esp after Company. Vivek was more like a side actor. Abhishek suits in anti role and should continue as a villain. All the heroins were simply pathetic. Rani had some role to play, but she didn't look good. Esha has a short career as neither she looks good nor she acts well. Kareena, like her mother and unlike her sister, overacts. Om Puri is a world class actor. Overall, a below average movie !!
