I was stumped at the video store - had basically narrowed the DVD search down to 2 - Sphere (yeah, I know..) and Savior, this interesting looking title on the bottom shelf.<br /><br />Thank goodness I chose this one.<br /><br />What a brilliant, gut-wrenching, agonising movie...<br /><br />Other comments have said it was a low budget job, but the DVD version I just saw didn't even make you think about the mechanics of the movie - just the characters and events that this film portrayed.<br /><br />The cinematics - beautiful scenery etc (to show that man really has no sense at all - he can be surrounded by some of the most amazingly beautiful surroundings and still turn the place to hell) and sound (the gunshots / ambient stuff etc were very well done) were all spot on..<br /><br />For the actual plot, the other comments posted are a lot more lucid than mine, so I won't bother trying to explain the premise of this flick.<br /><br />I really don't know what else to say - some of the scenes containing brutality were brilliant (in a really horrible way) - none of the usual hollywood (tm) bad guy finally gets it in the end type stuff - cliche - it really just showed how pointless these kinds of conflicts are. cliche<br /><br />Oh man - this film is going to stick with me for quite some time. And I kind of wish it didn't. I was after a throw away movie (should have rented sphere) and instead got this thing that I just cannot stop thinking about.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid was amazing in it, and the rest of the cast were excellent, too.<br /><br />And yes, I cryed like baby Vera..<br /><br />PS: I actually registered just so I could vote & comment on this movie..<br /><br />
