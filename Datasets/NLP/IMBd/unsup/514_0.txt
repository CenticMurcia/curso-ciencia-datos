The beginning: a young woman walks into an empty campus and gives out an award winning scream which probably scares everybody that watches the movie.<br /><br /> The plot is great, four students go into a "hole" four three days in the middle of nowhere. What could be scarier? The movie has a great psychological plot which could make it a horror movie that could compare to the great Hitchcock movies. But unfortunately it fails.<br /><br />The director just fails to deliver the tension the movie starts with. It keeps you guessing what really happened but as soon as you begin to see what the true events were, the movie fails to be a horror movie. The events are displayed without any dark atmosphere and although the idea of what happened is scary (I wouldn't want to give away the ending) it appears just plain.<br /><br /> However I thought the acting was great, which pretty much saves the rest of the movie. Liz Dunn (playing Thora Birch) gives as a great performance if you ignore her terrible accent, from her great scream at the beginning to her "evil" look in the final scene.<br /><br />If you ignore "some" of the flaws in the script it still comes out a pretty good psychological horror movie.
