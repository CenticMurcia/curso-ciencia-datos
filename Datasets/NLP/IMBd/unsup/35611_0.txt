It was the worst movie I have ever seen in the movie theater. I was going to a lot of movies when this movie came out and I noticed in the paper a listing for Bad Moon. So I decided since I had aready seen every other movie playing in the theater to give it a try. It was opening day of the movie and I notice that only three other people in the theater had come to see it. This was a bad sign right off. After two hours of sitting through this debacle out of morbid curiosity, I came away from this movie with only one good point; The dog's acting wasn't that bad. So as the day passed so did Bad Moon, right out of the theater. It only played one day and left town. To this day I have never met another person who has ever seen or even heard of this movie.
