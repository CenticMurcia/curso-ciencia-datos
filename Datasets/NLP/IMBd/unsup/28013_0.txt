While Harbour's character is too virtuous to quite be believed, his generosity is matched by the director and screenwriter. This is an artfully-constructed film--the acting, the direction, the cinematography--but more than that, it is a touching one. I am struck and saddened by how judgmental many of the other commenters are--I'm not saying that one should simply turn off one's moral radar when watching a film. Yes, it's very, very wrong for Wilbur and Alice to sleep together--but the film _asks_ us to consider what sorts of desires drive people, desires both for love and death, and to suggest that they might actually love one another (as Wilbur and Alice love Harbour) while still betraying them. And instead of giving in to the melodrama of confrontation, etc. it lets the mix of guilt and understanding linger while still bowing to and honoring to a desire for life and intimate human contact. I'm sorry that many others were unable to allow themselves to entertain that possibility, if for understandable reasons. In any case, I would think that the scene where Alice reacts to the news of Harbour's cancer (when they get back into the bookshop) would have been more than the price of admission/rental--one of the most powerful scenes I've seen in a while.
