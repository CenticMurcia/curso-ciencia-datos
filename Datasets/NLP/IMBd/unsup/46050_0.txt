Although I know that our well-known dinosaur superstar IS campy and cheap, this particular exploit really falls flat on its face. From the unexplained stills of constellations and stars to the ultra-cheap 70s "animation moments", this movie is filled with painful scenes and appalling execution. But, perhaps the worst part of the movie is the atrocious trumpet music that plays whenever Godzilla throws a temper tantrum. It did have some unintentional amusement, however, like when the huge mirror weapon powers down and the general (using very poorly dubbed lips) spouts "Dammit, why is everything going wrong today!?" out as fast as possible. All in all, this movie was a real stinker.
