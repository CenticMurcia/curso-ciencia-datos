before this film i usually used to say 'no' to his films, i saw solely this one because of Nicholson, i was not too sure this film amusing me as im a guy whom films normally dont impress but also i do not have a critic's eye, i'm like a normal film viewer. but i can say now, this is one good film i have seen in years because of its light comedy. but here i would also like to add, if you are a normal film viewer with no intense standard towards films then you probably should see this one but if you reckon yourself a critic who watches a film from inside out or every thin line comes on the screen then may be you must wait till you hear about it from a mate like yourself, all in all i generously hereby allow 8 marks out of 10.
