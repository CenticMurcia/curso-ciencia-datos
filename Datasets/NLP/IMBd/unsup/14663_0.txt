I'm not sure what the people behind this bomb were on, but whatever it was, I want some. A shark movie that begins with alien spaceships fighting should be warning enough that you are about to have 90 minutes of your life sucked out your rectum with a straw.How do you get a budget and a cast to even do something like this? If you're fond of Ed Wood, you'll want to see this and get an idea of what Ed could have done with an actual budget. But then again, Ed Wood movies are so bad they're watchable over and over again. With RAGING SHARKS, once is twice to much. If you're in the mood for seeing rehashed Discovery Channel and National Geographic shark footage, this one's for you.
