When I saw all these positive comments and talk about different movie I was expecting something similar to what Scream did for slasher genre or something like it. Boy was I disappointed.<br /><br />Granted movie does have and interesting and unconventional opening but then it falls for every horror clich√© around. Location, obviously. Middle of nowhere, woods. Characters are your typical group of teenagers. We don't know why they choose to camp there, we don't know who they are or practically anything about it. And you have your typical tight girl, your "friendly" girl, stoner/funny guy and so on. And of course the typical "I know there is something weird going on around here but instead of turning around and running away I'll keep poking around so I'll find bodies and body parts." While first such case is somewhat understandable the second one is beyond dumb.<br /><br />Then we have death scenes. Not that gory but between dumb and impossible. When you think about them a bit you realize this is just not possible.<br /><br />The ending is interesting, I'll give them that but one good moment simply can't fix overall bad impression this movie makes.<br /><br />Avoid if possible
