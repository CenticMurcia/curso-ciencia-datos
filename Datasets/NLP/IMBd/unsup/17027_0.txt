Very good rhythm, pretty picture, wonderful actors, a lot of humour and some sweet and beautiful moments. So yes, it's a great movie and it's worth to see it! I'm not at all a fan of Claude François (I'm more into rock and jazz) but this movie gave me the will to discover this singer...it's quite weird... Anyway, Benoît is fantastic, very moving. Julie is sublime. Jean-Paul is perfect as usual. And there must be some future cult quotes ;)<br /><br />Well done to all the cast, the crew and Yann Moix!<br /><br />Rad ^__^
