overall, i'd say that this movie could have been worse. the scene where they kidnap & tattoo the rapist is worth it. the music was really lacking; the band's name was awful and the music was awful. drea dematteo (sp?) was the best part (Tracy) because she had the most authentic rock & roll lady thing going on...she must have done her homework on donita sparks (L7). there is (obviously) a rape in the movie, but you don't really see it--thank gawd. there is some awkward violence right before hand, but where most films would show the actual rape, the director cut to a black screen. there were a lot of predictable moments, but it was fun nevertheless. i believe it went straight to video, and i understand why.
