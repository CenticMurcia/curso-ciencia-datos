What a stupid pretense for a show. Set in the present in Los Angeles, we're supposed to believe that four gay men who are very secure with their sexuality and have a strong support structure of friends and family, are too cowardly to ask a man who is obviously comfortable around gay men, "Are you gay?" Please...in the real world, of course they would ask that very question, to hell with all the juvenile shenanigans portrayed in this show. But then, you'd have nothing left to make a television show about.<br /><br />This show is hardly the progressive step it pretends to be. It's a step backward, and the core audience to whom this show is intended will see it for what it is in just one episode.
