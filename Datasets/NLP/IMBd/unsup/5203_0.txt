This is clearly Hawn's attempt to shake off her stereotypical image. Strangely enough she isn't the problem. In fact, she does okay without her usual smiling and giggling. The problem here is the ridiculous plot. It makes no sense whatsoever. At first sight it may seem complex but the truth is it's just not well thought out. I'll refrain from going into details but suffice it to say the story is very uneven and incoherent. Also, John Heard is terrible as a murdering psycho. It's easy to see why; he was completely miscast. His lines, which are supposed to terrify viewers, are laughable. The standard scares in the film are effective but very cliched and worn out. It sounds like a B-movie and that's exactly what it is.
