The very fundamental premise of this mockumentary makes no sense. Anyone who knows anything about history should know that the CSA intended only to withdraw from the Union, not conquer it.<br /><br />Yes, the South invaded the north in 1863, leading to the Battle of Gettysburg, but they did this only to force a cessation of hostilities. They wanted to be left alone.<br /><br />I'm not trying to defend the idiots who wanted to keep the practice of slavery alive, what I'm saying is that this film is not even intelligent, much less funny. Real comedy takes kernels of truth and builds on them so that what you see ultimately in the film is both funny and cutting. Chris Rock's skit on how not to get beaten up by the police is a perfect example of this.<br /><br />In terms of movies with this approach, "Borat" did a superb job of exposing real prejudices in real people in a way that was hilarious. Borat played the part of the idiot, but it was American culture which ultimately looked foolish.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is nothing funny, or intelligent, or accurate, or even worthwhile in this movie. And I think the box office numbers for this film underscores my point.
