This is simply a terrible film. I noticed it was from the producers of saw and although it was a straight to DVD film I thought it couldn't be terrible due to the quality of the production team. How wrong I was... terrible actors who seemed to not have read the most basic of scripts which gave no background to the motivations of the killer but made it obvious that one of the main characters was the killer's brother!!! Wow, really original!!! Just on the whole a terrible, terrible, film which claimed it was trying to be a film like the old 80s slashers but the only thing similar was the minuscule budget. In my opinion the producers stole eleven pounds from me and I just hope it doesn't go towards a sequel for this seemingly improvised pile of mistakes.
