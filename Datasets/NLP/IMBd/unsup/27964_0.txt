Yes, Indigo is a movie that falls short in terms of being a polished film experience, but it was never touted as being a top notch Matrix-like super deal. If you zero in on that, you miss the point. To salvage the mess this planet is in, we need to pay attention to each other, thru the drug deals gone wrong, thru misguided money grubbing values, thru all the life experiences that bring us down to the ultimate reason we are on this planet--> to love and support each other through our hearts--that is what this film is about. Our children know this. It is high time we as adults begin to see it, feel it and LIVE it. Yes, maybe you see this as a syrupy sweet pap view of the world, but guess what? This planet needs more of these messages until we get it. As for the commercialism for the Spiritual Cinema, again, we need a place where people can create films that laud the values of Love and Acceptance and Compassion. My fervent hope is that each and every one of the people who took part in this community event took away just even a hint of what we can be to each other if we just put aside all our bravado of what this world should be and get down to what it needs to be--> a circle of LOVE. Happy Valentines Day to you all.
