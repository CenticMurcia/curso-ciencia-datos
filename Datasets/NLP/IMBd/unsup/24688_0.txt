Missing this film at the theater, I grabbed the dvd when it was released. After viewing the film 5 times I have to say it is brilliant. Bits of Lars Von Trier, Robert Altman, and Mike Leigh surface as its story and images stream across the screen. The cast is tops: Gina McKee is a star in the making. Her performance is haunting. It's almost as if she is not acting and is this character. Her sadness and frustration at dealing with her search for a life mate is painful and absorbing. The beginning shots of her on the streets leaving a blind date behind at a bar gave me goose bumps. The Michael Nyman score is stellar and adds so much to the film. The music swells as the images flash by. But the real star of the film is the city of London. The shots of the people in the pubs and on the streets confirmed that no matter how large the world is and how many occupy its vast space -- we are ultimately alone. It's been years since a movie has invaded my head like this one. What could be seen as a simple story of a family at unrest is so much more. So universal. It's a compelling film.
