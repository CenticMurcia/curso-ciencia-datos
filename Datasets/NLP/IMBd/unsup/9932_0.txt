This movie must be viewed with an open mind - realizing it is a spoof, I believe - and not to be taken seriously. Carrie Barton (as Sadie Pray) in the blonde wig was just too funny and completely looked different than her pix on this website. I believed her and wanted to see more of her. Even though Carrie's part was small, she continued to be impressive with her subtle portrayal of a character difficult to portray, in that it was a character that could easily be "overdone." While the movie does have some disturbing scenes, overall those scenes were not so objectionable that I turned away. It was funny. I look forward to following her career planned for the future.
