I'm all for independent filmmakers trying something new nd I think its great that new video technology makes it possible for more people to make movies. But come on, this is just taking the Mickey. You make allowances for shooting on video, but you expect the cameraman to at least know how to hold it slightly steady or keep it in focus! That's the least of the problems. These come in three main areas.<br /><br />1. The film is obviously a fake. Brian Herlzinger clearly isn't interested at all in Drew Barrymore, and he's obviously got some vague contact with her to set the thing up. It's no spoiler to say that there is no date, just a brief blinkandmissit cameo arranged by her PR people. It's also a bit dubious because he seems awfully fey about it all. I kept on thinking the only reason this wasn't called My Date With Liza was because Liza Minnelli got a restraining order.<br /><br />2. Brian Herlzinger has made a film about himself. He loves himself. He fawns over himself. He gazes lovingly at his own reflection. It's really a bit scary.<br /><br />3. There is no entertainment value. Just padding, a few interviews with sad ex-celebs he's conned out of PRS and a lot of talking about how he's a great guy who should go for it. FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF! 4. It's really badly made. My wedding video is technically better, and my brother was drunk when he shot it.<br /><br />So points for Chutzpah but none for the film. Somehow he managed to sell this to Blockbuster, but that's no reason for you to see it. It's like being stuck in a lift with the world's most boring man. FOR AN HOUR AND A HALF!
