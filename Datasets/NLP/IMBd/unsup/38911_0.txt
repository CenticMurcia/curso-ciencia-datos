While I enjoyed the plot, and especially the cars, the film had some glaring continuity errors, two of which I note here. 1) The Jag is seen approaching the starting line with no race number, and in the next shot it is still approaching the start bearing the '55' that had been allocated. 2) From the start of the film, the Jag boasted wire wheels. During the race the car had pressed steel wheels most of the time, yet occasional shots showed wire wheels again. Why change the wheels - or was it a different car?<br /><br />There were also some technical errors that should have been picked up during the editing, the most obvious being the microphone boom reflected in the car's windscreen at one point. Maybe it was too late to re-shoot.
