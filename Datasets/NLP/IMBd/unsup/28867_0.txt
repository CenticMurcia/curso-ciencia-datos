A film dealing with greed and envy. An all-star cast gets us through the plot.<br /><br />With breathtaking scenery, Susan Hayward, as Leah, secures the aid of Cameron Mitchell, Gary Cooper and Richard Widmark in trying to free her trapped husband in a mining cave.<br /><br />As the husband, Hugh Marlowe steals the acting in the film. He appears to be ungrateful when freed and lashes out at Hayward for bringing him into this situation.<br /><br />The remainder of the film deals with the group trying to get back to civilization and away from the Indians who menace them. Of course, the bodies begin to mount.<br /><br />A very young Rita Moreno appears in this film in one scene as a bar room singer.<br /><br />Everyone seems to be aiding everyone else in the cause to survive. Interesting film but haven't we been down this road before?
