This film is absolutely lovely! I watched this film a few years ago with my little brother, who was 8 years old at the time and only watched Disney. However, he was hooked on this film. It shows everything that is good and pure about Ireland. It is a bit similar to 'Fairytale, a true story' but is so pure and lovely. I have just spent an hour searching for this film (as I'd forgotten the name) just so that I can buy it for myself, and I would recommend it to people. I challenge you not to feel touched by this magical film! The girl (Fiona) is sent to live with her grandparents in a remote part of Ireland, which overlooks the deserted Islad of Roan Inish. There are legends relating to this island which she learns, including the fact that her baby brother disappeared. She see's a small boy on the island, and is sure that the seals are bringing him up as their own. This begins her search for the truth.
