Gwen is a totally unsympathetic character who goes from ballistic to sweet and back in just about every scene she is in. He father is lazy and drunk most of the time and only her mother is a fully functioning person. It seems Gwen's sole motivation is to screw and screw around, but she has neither sense nor sensuality. Lise has a mother who goes to pieces when her ex-husband dies, motivating Lise to run away to see Gwen. Lise, thus far not experienced in the ways of the flesh, has a crush on Gwen that is not returned, and then punishes Gwen for spurning her interest by sabotaging Gwen's "romances". A much more rewarding film is "Lost and Delirious (2001)" where the girls have full-fledged and sympathetically drawn characters and the angst is real and realistic.
