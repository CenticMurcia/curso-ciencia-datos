well lets start with Kajol. OHHH GOD i love you She's soooooooooooo GREAT.(like always) she must be the only actress in front of whom all the other actresses look fake. she does her role of a blind girl so good so believable even more believable than RANI in Black. cuz kajol doesn't look up and hey blind people don't always look up. ya JUST SPLENDID Great comeback of Kajol and in many ways KAJOL doesn't make her role look miserable. like we usually see in movies like Blind people don't have life or something. SHE does a good role as a Happy Blind girl.<br /><br />now for AAMIR no words can describe this man's awesomeness. he is the only actor in India who looks REAL and "NOT FAKE". he's so SOOOOOOOOOOO GREAT like always. he nails down his role very easily.<br /><br />AS for the movie well the first half was Normal AND Believable but the second half got a bit abnormal for me. well however the movie does have some emotional moments. thanks to the GREAT DILOGES by the director KHOLI and the actors.<br /><br />as for direction it is NOT SO GREAT(Kunal Koli can do much better). for me i guess it would have been better if ADITYA CHOPRA would have directed this movie(and then maybe it would have that "dilwale dulhaniya.." GRACE) the story has many LOOP HOLES.<br /><br />this movie could have been made in a simple way. and then i would have been much happier. but unfortunate with the story not so appealing well what can we do. anyways THANKS TO THE GRACE OF KAJOL AND AAMIR. ya they look good together. the first half scenes between them are well HANDELLED.<br /><br />well for the second half I GUESS they put too much effort on the second half.<br /><br />anyways it's the SCREENPLAY that doesn't work.<br /><br />all in all a GOOD movie but not a GREAT one. kajol fans and aamir fans must watch this movie. also recommended to those who want to see real and Believable and emotional performance. 7/10
