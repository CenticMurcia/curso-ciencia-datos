Even if you weren't born when this series aired, you have to see it.<br /><br />Watch is all. It's the gold standard...Period.<br /><br />There is no equal when it come to sophistication, timeliness or relevance. Mary Yyler Moore is genius...just watch and you'll agree. It's not that she invented the genre, giving that credit to Lucille Ball, but she embodied it like no one did and no on one has ever since. The characters are so much more defined and dimensional than any that have been written since; not that there haven't been some able attempts (Murpy Brown and Designing Women come to mind).<br /><br />Mary, Valerie Harper and Chloris Leachman top them all....week after week, consistently superlative (credit to the writing staff as well as the actors who embody the scrips.)
