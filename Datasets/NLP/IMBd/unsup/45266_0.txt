Arnold Schwarzenegger stars as Mark Kaminski, a sheriff who asked by an old friend (Darren McGavin) to infiltrate the mobsters responsible for the murder of his said friend's son. And of course wipe them out, the stakes are that Arnold can be in the FBI again. Raw Deal is a disappointing feature in Arnold's filmography, it's one of the few Schwarzenegger movies that DIDN'T become all that popular. I think the main reason is because the story is too mediocre and the movie didn't have any fresh twists on the vigilante genre. The action sequences are okay but generally they don't come frequent enough and the story is far too dull to make the action sequences worth pursuing.<br /><br />* * out of 4-(Fair)
