Sure, Neil Connery is a bit of dud both as an actor and a character. The rest of the movie, though, is a hoot to watch. That isn't something you can say about "real" Bond movies like, say, _The Man with the Golden Gun_. Even Sean Connery could be boring. Can you remember anything about _You Only Live Twice_ aside from a few action sequences? Go ahead, I dare you. Nor is the plot of _O.K. Connery_ any less preposterous than most Bond movies'.<br /><br />If nothing else, it's got Adolfo Celi in a smoking jacket strutting around with a cigar and supervillainous music backing him up. More than worth the price of admission.
