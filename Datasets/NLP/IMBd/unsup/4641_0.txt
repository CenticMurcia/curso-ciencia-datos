First of all, I have to say, that I surf around IMDb.com a lot, but this is my first review here. The reason for that, is because I think that often the reviews for most movies on this page are pretty fair to the overall score of the movie. But this is not. And I feel like I should warn others from watching this, as nobody warned me. It is very bad, and I feel like people should know what "quality" they are about to see.<br /><br />At the time I am writing this, "Irina Palms" has a score of 7.2 out of 10. In my opion, that is at least 4 stars too many.<br /><br />Unfortunately this movie is horrible. The Idea behind the movie is okay though: the grandmother who feels forced to "jerk off" lots of men in the sexclub, in order to get the money it takes to save her ill grandson from dying. It could be OK, but it's not. Far, far from to be honest.<br /><br />Even in the beginning, all the establishing scenes to introduce the characters feel rushed, as if the director just wants to get to "the wanking part" as soon as possible. And when we get there, it's an odd mix of comedy and drama - as if the director wants it to be both, but without any success. All he succeeds in, is the comedy part, which is not even that good. True, there are a pair of okay jokes, but that''s not hard to make, since it's all "toilet humour". Most of the funny scenes are just funny because "it's an elderly woman wanking off men for money", and to be honest, I think a lot of directors could have pulled it off just as good, because this kind of humour doesn't have to be extremely clever to make people laugh a bit. In fact, I was waiting for some more clever jokes than what were in the movie, but they didn't show up... <br /><br />The dramatic parts of the movie are very bad as well: the acting is fair in some scenes, where Marianne Faithful (misspell..?) is on her own - that's OK some of the times. But pretty much everything else is rubbish - not only do most of the characters overact, they simply also act stupidly and in many cases with no logic at all. This seems to be more of a flaw from the director and/or scriptwriter though, and not the actors themselves. There are many times where you will guess EXACTLY what the actors will do because it is cliché, and other times where you will wonder how anyone could make a character act that way in certain situations, since it makes no sense at all. <br /><br />I would not recommend this movie to anyone, as it is completely rubbish, unfortunately. I wasted 80 mins or so watcing this and I regret it. It might sound interesting plotwise, when someone tells you the story, but it's not interesting at all. In fact, the few fairly good jokes and funny sketches in awkward moments don't make up for the poor acting, bad editing, and very, very cliché situations throughout the movie. It fails at being a drama, and only succeeds a few percent in being a comedy.<br /><br />But then again, I and people around me were literally (and I'm actually not exaggerating now, this is true) were laughing out loud in a handful of scenes from the horrible, horrible dialogue and embarrassing acting. So in that sense, I guess it kind of is a comedy...<br /><br />All I can say is though... Avoid this movie for your own sake. I have warned you now.
