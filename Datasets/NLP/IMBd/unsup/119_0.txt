La Femme Nikita (1990) was a great movie from genre director Luc Besson. The story is about a drugged out young woman (Anne Parillund) who's hung out with the wrong crowd one too many times. During a botched drug store robbery and subsequent shoot out with the police, NIkita is the only survivor. She's tried, sentenced and executed. But, she wakes up in a strange room and greeted by a quiet and subdued individual (Tcheky Kayro) he tells her that she's been given a second chance at life. But will she do what needs to be done in order for her to receive. Will Nikita take this opportunity at a second life or will she throw it all away? Watch LA FEMME NIKITA to find out.<br /><br />The always imitated by never properly duplicated chic thriller has become a fixture in pop culture. Not only was this film remade several times but it also spawned an unrelated television series. Anne Parillund is super hot in her role as Nikita. Watch out for Luc Besson regular Jean Reno as Victor the Cleaner.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
