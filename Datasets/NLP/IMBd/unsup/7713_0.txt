Hey, I know by far that Spain produces the best comedy series ever, perhaps even better than any American. I can't say the same of other kind of series, but we are GREAT at comedies. For example: "Aquí no hay quien viva", "Los Serrano", "Aída", "7 Vidas", "Médico de Familia", "Todos los hombres sois iguales", etc, etc, etc... Yeah, we might not be the best making movies, or making mystery series, but we are good with the comedy series. 7 Vidas? A very good example. And, it's not like Friends at all. It's just some kind of humor that makes it singular. The main theme it's not very much. There is a guy who had an accident and was in coma for 18 years. Then his sister, his best friend, his best friend's mother and his cousin try to get him into the world again. The most important thing of 7 Vidas are it's jokes and it's stupid stories, the singularity of the characters that make you laugh. The actors are so good, too. Javier Camera is a genius, Amparo Baró does it pretty well and Anabel Alonso (I gotta say, my favourite) is a great comedian. If you haven't see it yet, you have to see it.
