I love the film ASOKA because it was a very special film! King Khan's performance was excellent+! The songs and dances were exotic! King Khan really have the face of the king, and his name is the perfect name for him. Originally, I am from Kerala India and I really enjoyed watching Kallari because I haven't seen any films with Kallari since I have moved to Alaska. At the end, I was bursting into tears but I watched ASOKA several times. I do not understand why Asoka was placed second to Amir Khan's film. I watched that film too and I thought it was just an okay film. I am still curious about what happened to Asoka, Karwaki, Devi and the children. Is there a chance for Asoka II?<br /><br />Meena
