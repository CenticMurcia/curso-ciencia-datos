Watching this movie was very boring to me because it's very predictable. There is always one cop, one lady and few bad guys that are looking more funny too me, then dangerous (Michael Lerner and Kristopher Logan). And of course we all know that ending will be happy. It is obvious that we are watching solid B-film with Russell Crowe. Even Crowe had to pass through this kind of action movie so one day he could become an established actor. It is nice to see the beginning of the career for Crowe but the whole movie doesn't presents anything new. Only Russell Crowe's performance is on top, cause he looks like ordinary cop, he's funny and he showed us all that one day he will be star. But path to the stars is always rough.
