The narrative of this film is as follows:<br /><br />Good guys mess around a bit, then go to another planet to fight something.<br /><br />It becomes apparent that they are going to fight Broly within 5 seconds of him being on-screen.<br /><br />Broly looks stern.<br /><br />Good guys mess around a bit. Broly looks a bit angry.<br /><br />Good guys mess around a bit, give Broly a weak excuse to use his unsurprisingly mighty powers.<br /><br />Broly destroys EVERYONE.<br /><br />Goku wins.<br /><br />The film is utterly pathetic and only marginally redeemed by some stylish action, which is never varied or interesting enough to make up for an incredibly tedious build-up that lasts a good two thirds of the film. It's a shame, because had attention been devoted at any stage to actually having characters or making the (actually quite promising) story more engaging it could have been pretty entertaining - the fighting is well executed after all, even if it's entirely one sided. Sadly the whole thing is so painfully slow and laughably obvious that it's really not worth it.
