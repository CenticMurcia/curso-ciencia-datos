The cover looked very nice, artistic. That was it. I'm sorry but I stopped watching this film after about 30 minutes. Scenes were long and drawn out, entirely shot on built stage sets. Acting was not bad, it is just that it didn't fit the film standards. I believe this acting style belongs in a theater...but in a high school theater. I've been acting my whole life, and now I am a film student, production, at University at Buffalo. I am 20 years old and I can say I do have some experience under my belt. Hell I was in a movie when I was 4, in Europe. It's called Psalm and it is actually on IMDb.com. Given this I can say this movie sucked. Actually sucked would be a compliment.<br /><br />I just recently read the forum posted by Leigh Scott. He thinks zombie flicks are the last on the intellectual scale of movies. He might had some degree in film criticism or what ever, but he can not make a movie. Does he really think that DEAD MEN WALKING is on par with Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD, or NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, or the new low budget masterpiece FLIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD. I'm sorry Leigh, but each one of these zombie movies has a social commentary, and it's more than just zombies. Have you ever thought of zombies as the terrorists. NO, think about it and you'll appreciate them more. And no, I am not a single punk male with nothing to do other than writing reviews.I simply take a moment of my life to write a review and save people some pain and misery. I'm sorry but I now a good movie when I see one, and yours are not.
