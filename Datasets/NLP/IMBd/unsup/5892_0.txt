A sci-fi time travelling story or a romantic drama played out across many time shifts? The film never makes up its mind. And, as a result, is a failure. Time travel bits are used as a convenience for a slightly different take on a romantic drama. Every time there is a bit which is awkward, yahoo a bit of explanation (slowing the film down) or just bus along and hope the audience will go for the goo (I couldn't get back for a fortnight, so I missed Xmas, or I'm travelling more because of the drugs I'm taking!). It may be a great novel - I haven't read it - but the film is contrived - why bother at all with the time travel nonsense when you want to make a four hankie woman's weepie?! Sorry, but Eric Bana does not cut the mustard as a romantic lead, but he does his naked David Banner bit; the supporting cast apparently are important, but are barely used; issues of loss, responsibility for that loss, responsibility for other's feelings are grazed over. And plot non-sequiturs are babbled about at high speed in case anyone really starts thinking about what's going on (the hypothermia leg incident!!What was that? I haven't read the novel!) Some nice touches here and there, even if Rachel McAdams appears to be reprising her role from 'The Notebook,' and the performance of the daughter is quite delightful - and, I might say, far more interesting than the grown ups! I should have cried more but frankly this film had nowhere really to go for most of its running length - it passed a rainy morning.
