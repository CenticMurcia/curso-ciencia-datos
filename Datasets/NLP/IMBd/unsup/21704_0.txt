I've not read or taken any mythology classes since college (a long time ago) but remembered many of the stories/myths from my undergraduate days. What an excellent and powerful film (mini, if you want to be particular--but, hey... if you remove the commercials)... I'm slightly saddened that I didn't keep the tapes of both nights and erased over the mini. Excellent acting. Excellent effects. And quite emotional. A superb miniseries with messages that appeal, hopefully, to all persons who watch it--not just the Native American population. (And if I'm being politically incorrect, I apologize... labels are such a nuisance, honestly).
