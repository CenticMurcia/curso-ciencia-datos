Above title in case you purchased or rented this sorry excuse for a movie. Fortunately I watched for free on cable! Mostly because the original was an interesting movie. And I'm a sucker for late night horror shows, however bad. <br /><br />What's wrong with this? 10 things: <br /><br />1. Not scary. 2. Acting is bad. 3. Not scary. 4. The plot is slow and predictable. 5. Not scary. 6. The movie doesn't give a damn about its characters, and neither should you. 7. Not scary. 8. There are some logical howlers you can spot from a mile away. 9. Not scary. 10.The special effects are hilarious. <br /><br />In what other movie are vampires this easy to kill? Everybody's like, Buffy or Blade here. And the vampires are just sitting ducks. That's why it's not scary. And for a horror movie , that sure sucks.
