I just watched the movie and I felt I could really relate to it personally. I am engaged to a woman that is ten years older than me, (I am 22.)besides the outlandish first meeting and the night cap, my fiancée and I had much of the same trial and errors that they experienced in the movie. She didn't run away to New York though, but if she did I would have chased her down like Max did. Long story short,a great movie. The realism in the relationship throughout the movie was superb. Also I liked how Nora stood her ground during the Thanksgiving dinner, much like my fiancée's defensive attitude was towards my family. Definitely a movie worth watching.
