This is was my first feature film where I portrayed Alex as Salma's husband.<br /><br />It was the greatest experience I ever had working on the set of "Bong Connection".<br /><br />It helped me a lot to understand the procedure of film-making and to gain more experience from other actors involved. <br /><br />I would like to thank Peeya and Samrat for giving me the chance to spend some time with them during their time in Houston.<br /><br />My special thanks to Anjan Dutt, the director and Joy, the producer for giving me the opportunity to be in their film. Thanks for casting me.
