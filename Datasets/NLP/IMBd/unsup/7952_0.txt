This low budget, tacky, often crude...but absolutely hilarious movie is exactly what a lot of big-budget films miss - a clever, witty script. It will have extra appeal to anyone (like me) who has been a shop Clerk and has had to endure stupid customer questions like "are you closed?"! Warning, the acting can be annoying on watching it again so it is better to look at it as adding to the clerks questionable character. I have the soundtrack, mainly for the great version of "Go your own way". It also makes me chuckle at the sound clips from the movie. Smith's labour of love definitely made an impression on me - it was shown on Sky movies during an independent movie slot (used to be every Sunday night I think). This movie made me pay out hard-earned cash, mainly for that slot. Also, I seen Dogma in NYC the day it was released..there was a great atmosphere, almost like a big sporting event so obviously Smith's films have done extremely well from these humble beginnings. I think Smith may have decided to make his later movies more mainstream. However, they all share an interesting slice of life, his view askew. It's good to see a new release of this title, it is very hard to find. More Kevin Smith and Smith-esquire movies please!
