Masterful French comedy. Brilliant visuals, and fantastic use of music and choreography alone make this a joy to watch. But Delicatessen has so much more, which may only be revealed after repeated viewing. It is moving, funny and thought-provoking all at once, excelling in every aspect a film should. At least as good as Caro and Jeunet's next film, which is often put above this, the City of Lost Children. Exceptional viewing.
