People will rent this movie because it is directed by freddy krueger himself..... They will expect something as good as nightmare on elm st, and they will be very disappointed! This film is a bomb of gigantic proportions! The whole phone line to hell deal is never really explained, and the film is so boring, we don't really want it explained, we just want it to end! This truly will have you in tears! It is so boring! There is not one scary moment in the whole film, and it is a wonder why it ever got made! After reading this review, ypou will probably still rent it, thinking it can't be that bad, but I thought the same thing! After seeing it, warn others not to see it!
