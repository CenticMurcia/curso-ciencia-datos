I'm not sure what is worse  a bad film like the indie mess 'You and Me and Everyone We Know'  where you sit back and are in absolute agony and confusion; or a film like this one - where you are completely puzzled by how vapid and boring the proceedings are. Well, I do know which one I would vote for; still, I can't help but think how wasted the talents of Meryl Streep and Uma Thurman are in the absolutely dulling 'Prime'. And you could make a case I suppose, that for the money and star power wasted, maybe 'Prime' is more painful.<br /><br />The movie has little to recommend it. The lead actor  Bryan Greenberg  displays no charm or the personality necessary to indicate why a 'seasoned' woman like Uma Thurman would find him worthy of attention, let alone be compelled to rhapsodize on his penis. On the other side of the equation, Uma looks her age and then some, and why a 23 year old (with none of the maturity necessary to even appreciate an older woman) would be drawn to her is also baffling. Meryl Streep is invisible in a role for the first time that I can remember, and truly gives the appearance of phoning in her role.<br /><br />The film isn't terrifically bad  it's not an abysmal failure that will harm anyone's career. It's just a boring boring film, with pedestrian dialog, and perfunctory performances. Don't waste your time, but also don't go out and rent 'You and Me and Everyone We Know' either
