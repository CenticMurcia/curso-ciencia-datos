In early 1930s films, Warren William generally played ruthless, unscrupulous rich guys. Here, William stars as Allexander Stream, a wealthy, non-evil financier who is lonely because his wife (Mary Astor) is away for weeks at a time. A chance meeting starts an unlikely romance between Stream and showgirl Lilly (Ginger Rogers). After a time Lilly's manager, the very evil Lou (played expertly by J. Carrol Naish) wants to blackmail Stream using love letters. Murder and investigation ensue, leading to an unsatisfying conclusion.<br /><br />Rogers, Naish, Andy Devine, Sidney Toler, and John Quaylen (excellent as a corrupt witness) are very good. However, William carries the movie, in his usual elegant way. Mary Astor is not given much to do, despite her star billing. I recommend "Upperworld" for fans of 1930s cinema, even though I was extremely disappointed with the abrupt ending.
