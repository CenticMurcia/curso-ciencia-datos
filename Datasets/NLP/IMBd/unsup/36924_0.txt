when I read about this movie it sounded like it might be a little gem like Orgazmo (by Trey Parker). So I checked out the DVD. Unfortunately I found it to be embarrassingly bad. It started off pretty lame but left some hope for improvement at first. But I hoped in vain... Tracey Ullman hammed it up pretty badly, probably to make clear that nobody should take her role seriously. This gets quite annoying after a while. The plot gets dumber and dumber and after about half an hour my endurance was spent. I am aware that tastes are VERY different, but in my opinion this is one of the worst movies I have (partly) seen in a long time.
