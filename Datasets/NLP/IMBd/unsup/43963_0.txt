Each time I see a movie like this one,I think about the exterior conditions required for making a standout.When Pierre Grimblat made "Lisa",he did not lack,on an exterior plan,anything that Welles had when he made Touch of Evil ,or that Fellini had when he made Ginger e Fred ,or that Fuller,Kitano,and a few others had when they made their movies.It's not about budget,sets,etc.,external conditions,that is.<br /><br />"Lisa" is self-complacent and pedantic mediocrity.The director has nothing to say by this boring film.I am quite annoyed by the kind of stuff.Why make a movie that says nothing?<br /><br />Mrs. Moreau sings something in this movie,thing that reminds us of "Jules et Jim";the song is fine,but the resemblance does not go any further.The song here is very short,and the lyrics are average.<br /><br />Mrs. Moreau takes hold of every scene she is in,her strength is stunning.She DOES her scenes,which,unfortunately,are neither many,nor long.She struggles to make something out of this movie.The movie does not work at any other level,except Mrs. Moreau's appearances and very intense acting.<br /><br />I was turned off by the movie's story.Gradually,the movie became,for me,rather a source of unfavorable comparison with the GREAT Mrs. Moreau movies.She deserved better than this "Lisa".<br /><br />The dialogs are fake and conventional,the lines are insipid and displeasing.
