This movie has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen. This was a unanimous decision between my friends as we watched it the other night on itv1.<br /><br />Where do i begin. Poor character development, weak plot, uninformative dialogue, poor cinematography and the list goes on. Richard Benjamin's solid performance was the only positive to come out of this rubbish.<br /><br />Even more disappointingly was the fact that it was written/directed by Michael Crichton, of who i am a fan for his work with Jurassic Park. The movie was a poorly made, and left us unsatisfied with the in-continuity and inconclusiveness of the films ending.<br /><br />The 10 year boy in me though "hey that's a cool idea", but the adult film-lover in me thought "man that was a waste of 88 minutes". Without being a "spoiler" did it not seem to anyone else that the movie simply ended rather abruptly?? Also, the idea of "robot-prostitutes" so to speak was also a bit disturbing and lame.<br /><br />Lastly, the fact that the technicians provided no sound reasoning as to why the robots simply freaked-out was really the icing on a terrible cake. You should be ashamed Yul Brynner.
