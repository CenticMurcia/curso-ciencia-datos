I thought that _Simply Irresistible_ was the worst "teen" romance flick I had ever seen. But NO! Now this piece of trash holds that title; in fact it's the only movies I've voted a "1." It has the remnants of an original script, but butchered beyond all hope of redemption. Ummm, if you're looking for actual reasons not to see this movie, they include: zero chemistry between the leads, zero credibility as a relationship, more dumb white people dancing around to soul music they would never in a million years know, and of course, a plot so thin it is impossible to believe. And I am not a cynic. It really was that bad. I wish I had seen GalaxyQuest instead.
