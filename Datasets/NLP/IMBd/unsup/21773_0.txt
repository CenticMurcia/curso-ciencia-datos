well i saw the trailer... i thought it looked like a fun and interesting movie. But was i wrong! wow ... for a start.. the 3 main leads .. who i have liked on screen in the past..were given dreary dialogue .. The characters were all so unlikable, the story.. what story?!.. it just wasn't worth being made.. it told nothing. they had to stick a stupid funeral scene in for some visual effects OK i might be a little harsh .. it was well shot.. but thats all its got going for it.<br /><br />please avoid this pretentious rubbish.. i cant believe it got so many favorable votes.
