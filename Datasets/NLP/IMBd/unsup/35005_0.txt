Terrible, derivative rip-off of Rosemary's Baby features Joan Collins at her blandest, and Donald Pleasance at his moost boring (has he made a decent moovie other than Halloween??). Gee, can you tell that baby Collins is possessed by Satan? Does anyone really care? This turkey is also known by about 6 other titles, including "I Don't Want to be Born" - hmmmm, perhaps the moovie was trying to tell the producers something. MooCow says find a hole & bury this turkey. :=8P
