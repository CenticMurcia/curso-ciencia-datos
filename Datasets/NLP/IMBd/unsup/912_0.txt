I haven't seen it as much as everyone else posting here. But, remembered, none-the-less, most of it. Just wanted to say a couple things, about it. Aside from the thought of albert finney, as a action hero. It was out of necessity, of his characters' need to know the truth. And then getting in too deep. I thought he was great in it. And the idea of the manipulating with light flashes, was brilliant. I was never sure if this story didn't just come from a true experiment, some where. The gun used, worked sort of like, the bright flash of video games on an epileptic. Only instead of a seizure. You get a mental-pause. Seems to me, to be a completely plausible idea. Doctors are delving still further into how the brain works. For medical healing and understanding, of the overall operations. Only years away from being realistic. A mental anesthesia. Again, unless its already real, some where. spooky<br /><br />For, the person, who commented about the gun being useful in wars, and police procedures. Just think of it as a regular gun. In the wrong hands, it does, harm. I can see all kinds of crime being committed with one of those. As you can clearly tell from the movie. <br /><br />I wouldn't want it to be made to be real. But, it still would be cool. Good luck future!
