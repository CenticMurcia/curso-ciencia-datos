Good fight scenes. Deborah Richter looks pretty good, especially when she's at the beach stark naked. Also later when she briefly shows her boobs. If anybody but Cannon had produced this movie, it would have been better. The best thing that ever happened to the movie industry was Cannon going bankrupt. They ruined everything they touched (Superman IV, Death Wish 4). In this movie they also totally blew away any believability. The stupidest sequence was when Van Damme gets crucified (hanging by ropes with nails in his wrists). He hangs there for at least a day, then gets angry and kicks the cross down he's hanging on. It falls, Richter finds him and frees him. Then, they somehow catch up to the bad guys and he's in better fighting shape than ever. Yeah right. Fiction is defined as the willing suspension of disbelief. I don't think anyone can willingly suspend that much. I have seen worse movies, and I didn't fall asleep watching it. That and Deborah Richter's nudity are why I give it a 3 instead of a zero.
