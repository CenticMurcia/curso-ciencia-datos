Half the fun of watching "The Leopard Man" is trying to figure out the plot structure. If you haven't seen it yet, don't read the rest of this review. It's a good creepy little film, and that's all you need to know.<br /><br />For those who have seen the film, here are my thoughts on it: A symphony traditionally contains four movements. This is the structure of "The Leopard Man". After an attention-grabbing introduction, in which the main theme (clattering castanets) is introduced, along with the main characters (Jerry, Kiki, Clo-Clo, and the escaped leopard), we are treated to four movements.<br /><br />1st movement: Probably the best of the four parts, we begin with Clo-Clo playing her castanets while walking down the street. She picks a card to receive her fortune, and it's the card of death. This sets an ominous tone when we are suddenly introduced to a completely new set of characters--a poor Mexican family. The daughter is sent to buy some cornmeal, and we have a wonderfully suspenseful scene where she fears an attack by the leopard. The movement climaxes with her death, a perfect combination of visual, audio, and (especially) what's left to the imagination.<br /><br />2nd movement: We once again have a brief encounter with the main characters and a reminder of the castanet theme. Then we are introduced to a whole new set of characters--a young girl, her family, and her off-camera lover. Another creepy scene takes place in a graveyard, and it also climaxes with the young girl's death.<br /><br />3rd movement: We are again reminded of the main characters, but this time we begin to follow their stories to completion. The third movement focuses on Clo-Clo, and the castanets, though present, are used sparingly. This completely develops the death card story which was foreshadowed earlier in the film. Once again, this section climaxes with the woman's death.<br /><br />4th movement (the finale): Up until now, due to selective camera shots, we haven't been entirely certain whether the killings have been the result of the leopard or someone else. The escaped leopard's story is concluded by finding its dead body. The remaining cast's story is also carried out to the end. The true murderer is revealed--once again with the aid of the castanets--and killed. The climax of the entire film is the death of "the leopard man".<br /><br />In all of his films, Val Lewton played with the idea of life vs. death, and this film is no exception. The castanet music throughout the film helps us to experience the dance between life and death. The deaths are always shocking, and they initially seem to have the final word. But the final scene actually shows the victory of life. Jerry and Kiki walk off together, determined to make the most of their lives together.<br /><br />We don't know how long we have on this earth, so we should cherish every moment. And only through death can we appreciate the gift of life. This is the message of Lewton's and Tourneur's thrilling, beautiful, and sometimes unsettling symphony.
