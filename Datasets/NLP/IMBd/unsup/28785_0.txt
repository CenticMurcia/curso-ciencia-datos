I loved this film even though im not familiar with the first two. I had no idea of what was in store before watching this, except that the title itself projects a sense of violence. I love gangster movies and after seeing this i even loved it more. It's different than the average gangster genre given that it has quite a lot of comedy interplay with the story. The actors aren't familiar to me except Qi shu which portrayed the role in a hardcore tough yet so fine and sexy way.<br /><br />The comedy was very funny at times see for yourself. I liked the car chase scene it's something new, fresh, comic and a very sensual idea(you'll understand when you see it). It's cool to see interesting movies once in a while and this one is certainly the one you can't miss. Truly entertaining, overall funny, cool action scenes and a bit of that comic romance. Watch it, its worthwhile.
