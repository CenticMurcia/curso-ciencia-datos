You only care as to who gets naked, so here's the long and short of it: o Goth / Raver Chick: Yes! Mostly at the end, on video.<br /><br />o Old Blonde With Huge Cans: Yes! Throughout, in fact. Including a shower scene with another chick.<br /><br />o Bitchy Blonde Girl: Yes, however, the least number of times and the least quality of times when it does happen. Also passed out throughout most of the thing, if you're into that.<br /><br />o Brunette With Obvious Recent Boob Job: Yes! Spends most of the movie naked. It doesn't seem like it at first, but trust ole Zeke on this one.<br /><br />o Flat Blonde With Nice Legs: Yeah, you'll get plenty of her in this.<br /><br />o Director's Girlfriend: No, sadly! You warm up to her by the end of it, plus she ends up making some quality decisions as to who to really hang around which only increase her worth in this thing.<br /><br />I give this movie a 7 as the girls are nice and spend a lot of time naked, especially for a flick made in 2002. It's otherwise complete garbage and should not be viewed by anyone for any purpose.
