My German teacher got this from a former student who is living in German and we watched it in class (with the help of some cunning planning and working) and it was the most entertaining 93 minutes I have had in that class (and trust me, entertaining things happen in that class daily) My teacher, who commonly finds humor as the such in the movie (black eye - black guy (translated), Tupperware container for glass coffin and the like)hilarious. He was on the floor laughing. (well not literally, but oh well) There wasn't a dull moment in this movie..from the flash of "that night" to the man dwarf singing with a women's voice. I just need to find a version that will work on USA DVD players because I want to share the joy this movie brings with all of my friends and family.
