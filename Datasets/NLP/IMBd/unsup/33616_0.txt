"The Amityville Curse" is a seemingly misplaced installment in the "Amityville" series, which seems to consist of a whole slew of never ending, cheapie horror movies. This time around, it doesn't even have anything to do with the Amityville house, if I remember right the only relation is that the house in this film is in the same neighborhood. A group of adult friends decide to buy an old house with the plans of renovating it and selling it or something along those lines. Unbeknowst to them, a Catholic priest was murdered in a confession booth that is now stored in the basement, and the man who killed him hung himself because of guilt. So, the ghosts begin to appear to one of the friends who seems to be a little psychic, and it's up to her to put the "curse" to rest before her friends' lives are at stake.<br /><br />This film is nothing new, is fairly boring, and really has nothing to do with the rest of the Amityville movies. It's almost like "Halloween III" was in the Halloween series. The house isn't the same, so it's not really the "Amityville Horror", the film isn't even really linked to the others if you don't count the title. The acting is so-so and the effects which are supposed to be substantially shocking look very cheap and unscary. The story itself is weak, even more so because of the series it was randomly placed in and the unrelation to the other films. I enjoyed "Amityville Dollhouse", but this one is completely unrelated and failed to do much for me. Perhaps if it were it's own film and didn't have "Amityville" branded on it, it would've made more sense, but of course it isn't.<br /><br />If you like cheesy, low-budget haunted house films (which I normally do), then you might wanna give this a look. Although, it may just be a disappointment. I think I'll give it a four for trying, I tend to have a soft spot for films like this. But don't expect anything brilliant, after all, this is an Amityville sequel. 4/10.
