This is a text book example of how not to do a fantasy movie. Sorbo is wasted..and its a sad comment that the writing for his hit show Hercules is 20 times better than this dreck. From the cheesey rock music sound track at the opening credits you realize they are not going to give the genre any respect..and great movies like Army of Darkness..can make fun of the genre while still respecting it.<br /><br />Kull is nearly devoid of any intentional humor. Though you will find yourself laughing out loud at various points due to the incredibly lame dialogue and ridiculous performances. I think this is also a film that clearly had no art direction and it offends the chronological senses even worse than Hercules and Xena to the point at which you began to think the entire thing took place in a world of cheesey movie sets instead of some time in our distant past.<br /><br />No effort is made to build any characters or make us care about anyone..and no one is likeable or cool enough to care about them at first sight.<br /><br />I'm not even sure this would be good WITH the MST3K crew riffing on it. When its not being stupid ..it just drags.
