This shows there are some great directors and actors in russia. The most impressive thing about this movie is that it connects the reality in Russia not in the sense that those things happening in the movie is the reality but in the sense that it conveys deeply the feelings of Russian people. (Loss of love and commradeship between people). I really liked the male lead, he acts well just as if you are seeing a real person struggling in life. I was really moved when he tries to put a contract on himself, oh that sense of sadness and despair. I liked the two female leads as well. They are very sexy and shows me what Russian women are really like other than the hollywood sterotype of either big white mama or gorgeous but cold hearted soviet spy. This movie is very well written and flows seamlessly.
