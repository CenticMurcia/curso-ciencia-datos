Great action, great cast, nice special effects. I would have liked to have seen it on the big screen. One of the unique aspects of the Rough Riders was that the unit combined high society pretty boys, with rough, uneducated cowboys, and Indians. They throw in Black Jack Pershing and his Buffalo Soliders and it makes for a very interesting mix. Lots of good dialog. If you know who people like Crane, Remington, Pershing, and Hearst are it's even more enjoyable. Much of the parts dealing with Roosevelt seem to have come from the book "The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt". The battle itself is changed but but to good dramatic effect. If you like war movies, or are interested in history, this one is for you.
