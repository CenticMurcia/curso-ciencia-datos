It's too bad that here in the states we have the option of purchasing 2 LEGAL DVD sets (I have)or watching in 10min segments on YouTube. The only other thing offered in the past was, I think in the 90's a (then)full version for about a whopping $300.00 or $400.00. Even then, I had never seen a single episode but was sure I'd like it. I guess I'm going to get player with region 2 code and buy the UK version DVDs. Mid-Sommer Murders made me want to see England but LOTSW has made me want to MOVE THERE. I have even changed my next vacation from Greek Isles to Yorkshire. I LOVE LAST OF THE SUMMER WINE - what a shame that it is not shown (or available)more widely in the US. Thanks Roy Clarke!! Sally
