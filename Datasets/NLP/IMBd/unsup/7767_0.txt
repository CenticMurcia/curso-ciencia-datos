"Virus or something makes people zombies." This should be a separate category at the video store, right? I mean there are a million of 'em. Sadly, I own the worst one (compairing only to the others of course). I did however kind of like the whole 8mm aspect, but this was supposed to make it look like a 70's movie and it doesn't.<br /><br />The acting is really bad. The director obviously made a very common mistake many DIY horror film directors make, hiring your friends to be your actors. A very bad and bias thing to do. No one is an actor. I think like half the cast and crew worked at hardware stores, implies the commentary/featurette. They are not dedicated to the film at all, some of them lost weight, got haircuts, dyed their hair, etc without a care in the world that they completely changed the appearance of their character.<br /><br />The violence is pretty graphic for such a homemade movie. While the film does succeed at pushing the envelope, the violence is kind of hard to handle. This isn't good though because it's more shameless than horrifying. Maybe it all could have worked if the scenes were build-up more seriously rather than so juvenile like.<br /><br />This was probably made because someone said "Dude, wouldn't it be cool if we made a zombie movie?" I bought it because the cover looked scary. I made that mistake. Never trust the covers! I guess there's a supposed drinking game involved in this DVD so says the commentary... any jocks out there? A movie to avoid (or buy from me, hehe).
