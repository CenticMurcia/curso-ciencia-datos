this movie is good i liked it. you learn a lot about girls who live in the rich live and see how they react when they have to work at a factory to make up for something they did wrong. in this case a cow factory. well these girls manage to pull it off and have some fun at the same time. making of the movie they were having a blast as they say. the girls said to me that in the making of the movie is was a blast and working with the cows were unexpected, but cool at the same time. from my perspective the girls had fun and well they were having fun they were making a great movie for the audiences. overall this movie will be a 10+ for audiences that are well any age!
