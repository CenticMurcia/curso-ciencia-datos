Now I'm not really into olden time movies. I am also very picky about dramas. This movie wasn't the kind of drama I was looking for. I don't like movies that take place long ago before the twentieth century. I would however recommend this movie if you like olden time dramas. The book was very boring. I just read it and it just dragged along. Nothing much to it. As usual though they changed a lot of stuff in the movie which I hate. I confuses me and I'm used to the way the book was and it throws me off. I don't understand why they just can't keep it the same. There were some pretty good actors and actresses in the movie. This movie would be good if you like plays because it reminded me of one.
