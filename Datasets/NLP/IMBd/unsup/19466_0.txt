What in the world was this about??? I noticed early on that this movie was taking an deep plummet toward tastelessness when I figured out what was happening to the children! This is absolutely the worst movie I have ever, seen in the 35 years that I have been living in this world!<br /><br />I don't think I have ever seen a worse movie. At least nothing that would 've surpassed this this total waste of time and space! How was anyone able to convince a movie production company to green light such a pointless heap of cow dung is beyond me!! Please America, save your brain cells for something like Benjamin Button or some other good movie recommendations. I don't want to give to many details, so that you may have a chance to watch for yourself, If you dare. Ohterwise, you have been warned!!!!
