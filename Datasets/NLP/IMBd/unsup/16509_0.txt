Poor Tobe Hooper! Once proclaimed as a horror film messiah, the creator of the masterfully creepy 1974 classic "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (and the two mainstream delights "Salem's Lot" and "Poltergeist"), keeps making one bad movie after another. This is his latest attempt at reclaiming his title as a horror master. It is a remake of one of the most infamous exploitation movies of the 1970s, but you know that you have problems when you cannot improve upon such dubious material. It is a real snorefest, about a serial killer targeting the residents of an old apartment complex. It is a silly movie, which does not even qualify as a good/bad movie. The last third of the film is an improvement over the lethargic first two thirds, but the movie ends refusing to explain itself. Very embarrassing.
