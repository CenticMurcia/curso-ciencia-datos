Most commentators seem to like this, but I didn't. It seemed to me to be 90% of nothing happening and 10% denouement. The photography was laboured and unnecessarily monochromatic (mostly red/black). I guessed the identity of the disfigured man fairly early on and I think that most people will manage that. I love supernatural films but this was a real disappointment. I thought that there was no suspense and no character development. Also, I did not 'get' the ending. In fact, I couldn't engage with any of the characters at all. I've had to pad this out because of the rules but my summary would be: Quite boring with no resolution (yep - I'm one of those who likes a real ending! :-)
