Roy Rogers movies tend to be pretty lightweight, at least the ones I've been able to see within memory.<br /><br />But Roy Rogers himself is endearing.<br /><br />I think it was while watching "Dark Command," the John Wayne movie (though Claire Trevor gets first billing, for some reason), that I first realized Roy Rogers was really an excellent actor.<br /><br />It is likely that he rose to such prominence mostly because of his winning personality and good looks, rather than the movie plots, but in studying Western movie history, I learned that when he was given his chance to be the star of his own series, he set out to be good at his job. For example, he took riding lessons, and in my opinion was one of the best riders, certainly among those who hadn't been riders since childhood (such as John Wayne and Gary Cooper).<br /><br />And even late in life, he was still a good singer, having been a great one earlier.<br /><br />This movie gave us Rogers in really good form: He got to do just about everything he was good at, singing, riding, and acting.<br /><br />I was rather bored in the beginning, but by golly this movie takes off and becomes downright exciting.<br /><br />Of course, there is a great cast, with the Sons of the Pioneers getting to stand out, and stunts and action by the great Fred Graham.<br /><br />Each cast member is memorable, and I highly recommend this to everyone. Those who enjoy Hollywood history especially should watch and pay attention to the individuals performing. You'll find it fun and educational.
