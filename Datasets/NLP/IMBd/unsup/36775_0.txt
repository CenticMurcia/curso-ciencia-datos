This is possibly the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I once had Battlefield Earth as the worst, but now this movie has leaped far ahead. How this is ranked even close to a 5, I don't know. There were a couple instances in the movie (I saw it in a theater) where a good 2 minutes went by with no dialog during a seen where you just watched the characters. It was painful. Usually I hate it when someone talks during a movie. However, in this one, someone said "Did they forget their lines?" and everyone in the theater laughed. When you watch the movie you'll see this a couple times. This movie is only good to watch if you actually want to tell your friends that you saw the worst movie of all times.
