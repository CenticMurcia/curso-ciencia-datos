This was a wonderfully shot movie, too bad the acting, plot, and direction were below average. I have seen Kim Basinger do better than this. Her performance was horrible and the rest of the cast followed suit.<br /><br />The action is not linked and the characters just exist with no purpose. The movie doesn't even get interesting until the end. The watcher sits and waits through the whole movie for something significant to happen. Unfortunately, nothing really does.<br /><br />I urge people not to see this movie. It is a waste of time and money. Gladiator will crush it at the box office this week. Sorry Kim...<br /><br />I gave it a three because there was some effort put into it, just not enough to make an average movie.
