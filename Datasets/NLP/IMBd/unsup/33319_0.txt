The first review I saw on this site about this movie was someone calling it a masterpiece. This movie is as much a masterpiece as Friday the 13th IV isn't a masturbation piece. And that doesn't even make sense. But neither does this movie.<br /><br />Spoilers- I could sum up this movie by saying it's about a fruity looking Swedish kid who moves into a house with his parents and eventually watches them get murdered in the basement by some 1800's doctor with no eyes or mouth and one monster arm. However, I'll add a little more.....<br /><br />First of all this movie is crazy boring. Secondly, it involves some 1800's doctor with no eyes or mouth and one monster arm. Now those two sentences shouldn't be referring to the same movie, but in this case they are.<br /><br />From what I can piece together the family moves into this house out in the countryside so the dad can research the death of a colleague who also lived in the same house. The colleague basically hung himself as a result of living in a house haunted by an 1800's doctor with no eyes or mouth and one monster arm. Like in many haunting movies the colleague dude conveniently left a cassette tape explaining just enough about the bad stuff going on in the house to make the viewer decide not to turn off the movie yet. As you continue to let the movie play you'll quickly realize you made a mistake.<br /><br />So the family moves to the house and the Swedish boy starts seeing some 1800's-ish looking girl, but it's hard to tell since this movie was made in the 70's. Her clothing may have been normal small town 70's gear rather than 1800's gear. Also some googly eyed babysitter chick shows up and generally acts strange, but never does anything and is eventually killed. Which doesn't make a lot of sense because there's a scene where an 1800's doctor with no eyes or mouth and one monster arm (yes THE 1800's doctor with no eyes or mouth and one monster arm) kills some broad in the house and the babysitter cleans up the blood the next day to hide it. So if she's helping this basement monster out why does he later trap her in his basement and kill her? Maybe she didn't do a good enough job of cleaning up the blood and she was already on thin ice with him to begin with.<br /><br />General strange noises and what not happen in the house and at some point there is the discovery of a grave in the living room, which is obviously where this 1800's doctor is buried. Or is he buried? Well he might be. Whether or not he's the guy in the basement with no eyes or mouth and one monster arm is up to speculation, but it is mentioned in the movie that the doctor performed devious experiments when he was alive. So the doctor either created this basement monster or he IS him. Either way, the movie is so boring you won't care. All you'll care about is why this guy in the basement is 99% monster except for his one normal arm.<br /><br />In summary you could say this movie is about a family being haunted and eventually killed by an 1800's doctor with no eyes or mouth and one monster arm or you could say it's about a family being haunted and killed by an 1800's doctor with no eyes or mouth and one human arm. But no matter how you look at it, they all die and you'll also die a little inside when you go to google this house so you can stay there for a night and make your own bootleg ghosthunters TV show and try to sell it to the travel channel only to find out that you can't even find this house because nobody cared enough to put it's real location anywhere on the internet.
