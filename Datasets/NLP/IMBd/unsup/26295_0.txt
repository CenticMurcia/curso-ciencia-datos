You pretty much have to be Indian to get most of the jokes in this movie. That said, the movie is hysterical. Kris, an 'American-Born Confused Desi' leaves home for college to discover that he's been placed in a dorm room full of Indians; various hi-jinks ensue. He abhors his culture but is forced to learn to appreciate it for the sake of a girl. The romantic elements of the movie are a bit cliche, but on a low budget, it is well acted and executed, considering I didn't recognize a single name from the credits.
