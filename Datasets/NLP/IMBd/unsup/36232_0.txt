We've been here so many times before. A couple of tasty cock-er-knee lovable rogues, a mix-up / rip off with drugs and a nasty east end big man. To be honest it could be 1998 and the release of Guy Richies ode to all things east end.<br /><br />This film is like frankensteins monster, with its component parts ripped intact from older works and then sewed together to make a whole. The problem is that someone forgot that strike it with a lightning bolt and it's just a corpse decomposing on the table.<br /><br />Yes it's an early effort and yes the budget is low. These are things that can and should be forgiven, the acting is acceptable in places from the unknown cast and it's done with a sense of humour. The problem is the script which is so clogged with cliche and rip off that nothing else is given a chance. Ultimately the troubled children film makers are going to have to grow up and stop playing with other childrens toys.
