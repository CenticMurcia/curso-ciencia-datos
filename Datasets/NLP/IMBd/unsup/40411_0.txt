This is a god-awful film and I was shocked to see that the featured review gave it a score of 10. This is like giving a pig the crown for Miss America! Instead of a 10, I am actually feeling a bit charitable in giving it a 3, as it was a groan-inducing movie from start to finish.<br /><br />The film starts in Heaven. It seems that somehow Heaven has screwed up some paperwork and this necessitates the angel Michael (Bob Cummings) taking a trip to Earth to convert a soul! It seems that the evil Brian Donlevy is soul-less and Michael needs to point him towards God.<br /><br />There are so many problems with this sappy picture, I don't even know where to start. The script is full of religious clich√©s and never once seems genuine in any fashion. It will most likely irritate or offend many religious folks who watch it was well as atheists--one of the two times these groups will agree! And, to top it off, on top of all the hooey, the film is so deadly serious and earnest that it was just very, very hard to take. It makes GOING MY WAY seem very gritty by comparison! Preachy old nonsense is the best way to summarize the film. Just plain dumb might be another.<br /><br />By the way, though it was probably NOT intended, in the scene towards the very end of the film my family and I laughed because by the way the dialog was written there sure seemed to be a gay subtext. Think about this as you hear Donlevy and Cummings give their lines--they sound more like lovers than friends.
