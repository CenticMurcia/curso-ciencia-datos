while i applaud the effort to make a "mainstream" horror film with a gay "edge", i have to honestly warn others of the absolute horribleness of this movie. the cast is compiled of D-list porn actors (no, really. it's true. check for yourself) with almost no known acting abilities other than getting my on their marginal good looks. there's even a part of the movie (i can't tell if this was an intentional joke or not) where they casually drop their age (22) but the actors are obviously about 30. if this movie had played up its camp value (ala Die! Mommy, Die!), this could have been a funny film. but since it takes itself seriously as a horror/slasher film, it just comes across as amateur. the video production is pretty bad too. i don't even think it is worth watching on video. for free. it's that bad. and i had really, really high hopes...
