Why is it that so many sequels come out this way? Presumable because most of them are about money, pure and simple, rather than an interest in saying or doing anything new with established characters. The original 'Hills Have Eyes' was a genuine classic, was frightening because of its realism. Part 2, however, just jumps on the 'Halloween/Friday the 13th' bandwagon. Due to the fact the music of 'Hills 2' is composed by Harry Manfredini (who composed the incidental music for most of the Friday films), you could often be forgiven for wondering when Jason Voorhees is going to pop up. That's not to say the music's bad. In fact, the climactic tune is one of Manfredini's best.<br /><br />For what it's worth, 'The Hills Have Eyes 2' concerns a group of bikers who take a short-cut across the desert and break down. Among their number is Ruby (now called Rachel), who has become part of society. Before long the bikers are being killed off one by one in typical slasher style. The main problem with this film is that most of the characters are so stupid they're unbelievable. The bikers are stereotype no-brain teenagers. Michael Berryman is still good as Pluto (though the character is nowhere near as scary as he was in the first film). Then there is Papa Jupe's conveniently never-before-mentioned brother The Reaper, who is just too dozy to take seriously. If you're a fan of slasher films, then this is fairly entertaining - though maybe for the wrong reasons.
