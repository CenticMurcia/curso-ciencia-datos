There is way too much wiener in this film. I get the whole male full frontal equals street cred for an independent film, but come on. Wagging a penis in a woman's face for laughs is infantile.<br /><br />This movie worked as a mockery of art school, it didn't work when it turned dark. It is as if two different movies were crammed into one with some wiener sprinkled on top.<br /><br />The stereotypes of the art students were great, but what is with the gay fashion student roomie. How exactly does he fit into the plot? Oh that's right, he doesn't. The character is only there to make fun of gay fashion students. <br /><br />If you are a fan Malkovich avoid it. It is not as smart as most of his other films. If you are a fan of wiener, dig in. This movie is for you.
