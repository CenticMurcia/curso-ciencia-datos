If nothing else, "I Call First" (retitled "Who's That Knocking at My Door") is a before-they-were-famous relic for Martin Scorsese and Harvey Keitel. The somewhat convoluted plot has young J.R. (Keitel) feeling that he has to take charge when he learns what happened to his hubby (Zina Bethune). This is one of those movies taking a rather gritty look at the world of Italian-Americans, before it became a clich√©.<br /><br />So, overall this isn't a masterpiece, but Scorsese was definitely showing the sensibility that he brought to his later movies. I'd recommend it.<br /><br />Not that this is really related, but why has Martin Scorsese still not won an Oscar?!
