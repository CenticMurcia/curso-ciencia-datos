God this is terrible journalism. I can't see the point of discrediting actual issues by mixing them up with spiritual goofs and use eccentric fanatics as front figures for let's say global warming. When you get so many hurricanes in one year that you run out of names, there's something going on. The last show I saw, they tried to wave away the dangers of passive smoking. I'm curious about who's really paying for this show. I get the feeling that there is some hidden lobbyism in this program.<br /><br />I used to consider Penn & Teller two funny magicians (except for the lousy acting in "Sabrina"). Nowadays I think they are sellouts who's obviously not doing well with the magic business (cause then they wouldn't have to take part of this crap, would they?). I mean, who listens to a magician when it comes to global warming and long term problems with genetic manipulation?
