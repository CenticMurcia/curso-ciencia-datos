Well the movie's idea or theme was unique but the movie itself was not found satisfying in my opinion. I like some of its ideas about how Nicole Kidman's character was shown through her actions, as well as some of the times when (she was watching a movie with her fianc√©)her mood changes slowly as she is trying to get over a shock by pretending to be watching the movie.<br /><br />But for every occasion that comes up in the movie, it is extremely long. Makes you think they wasted a lot of the movie time on mere extension of the situation. The way they wasted so much time was ridiculous (this includes the very beginning part of the movie when a man wearing black is running). They were trying out something new, something different, but to me i found that whatever they were trying to do didn't work out quite well. I really didn't like it and i found that i wasted my time watching this movie that centers around only one idea...
