Have you seen Billy The Kid and the Green Baize Vampire? Little Shop of Horrors. Think back to Rocky Horror or Lisztomania. Even the new Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is of a similar mould. Off-beat musicals. These little gems that people once had the balls to make.<br /><br />Captain Invincible or 'Vince' is such a film. After winning WW2 for the red, white and blue, our super hero is subjected to McCarthy type interrogation and accusations. Excellently edited pathe news reels bring us up to date during the opening credits. Vince runs away down-under and drinks himself stupid for 30 years. Then an APB is put out for him to save the world from the outstanding Christopher Lee and his baritone voice. At the end of the film Vince regains his patriotism and saves the world, singing a few songs along the way.<br /><br />A great parody of the hero genre, songs of all styles and well written. My favourite is the US President putting his advisers straight with a single word. That word repeated and repeated at speed to a little ditty keyboard number that'll leave you in tears.<br /><br />Don't study the film too deeply, it's not that type of film. This is simply a visual and musical experience to enjoy for those with a sense of humour and who appreciate the people who make these movies without a care in the world.
