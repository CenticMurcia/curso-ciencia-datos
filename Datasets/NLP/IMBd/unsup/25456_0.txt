The first time I watched this movie in high-school, I instantly loved it. It has pretty much all the aspects of a great book, lots of action, special FX, lots of humor and what-not. There were some minor flaws to this epic show cast though, with the most obscene one being the fact that the character introductions are pretty much absent, seeing as everybody seemingly just pops up and goes away after a few scenes, to return later again. The personalities weren't too great neither, it was the basic 'Good guy' and 'Archetype nemesis' thing. But this movie really isn't about the characters, it's about the epic story, great acting, great action, lots of drama and laugh, and most of all, Mudkipz.
