"August Rush" is a masterpiece! It is a journey of life, loss, music, miracles and love. From the very beginning I new this film was going to be great. <br /><br />The storyline was beautiful in many different ways. The composed music is amazing. The acting is superb. The camera work is right on key. And the direction was flawless. When I left this film a still had tears in my eyes. I am truly touched. <br /><br />This is a film for all sexes, ages, and races if you have any love in your heart. I am a musician so I was extra moved by this film! <br /><br />I give it 10 out of 10 stars. This is a film that is very close to my heart. I will remember it forever!!
