...in describing the events leading towards the invasion by the US, the description of people being "melt to their weapons" and "cut in half" by "lasers" and killed by "poisonous darts causing massive bleeding" given by "eye witnesses" raised serious doubts about the truth content of this "documentary". While I don't doubt the reasons for the invasion given (Gen. Noriega becoming increasingly uncooperative to his CIA employers), the description of events seems, lets say, a little imaginative. Furthermore the accounts of former Panamanian officials are a little dubious since the people removed from power might actually not be telling the whole truth either. It's a shame that this kind of concoction might give historical documentaries a bad reputation.
