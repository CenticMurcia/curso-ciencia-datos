I like everything with Burt Lancaster and Burt in a western is that much more enjoyable to me. If you like "Revenge" movies like "The Crow" or Death Wish" then you'll probably like this. It also has a great supporting cast which is mainly the "bad guys" and when they make Burt mad he makes them wish they didn't. Good shoot em up flick!
