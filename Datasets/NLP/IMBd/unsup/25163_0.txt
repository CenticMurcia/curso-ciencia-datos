Its a real shame that egyptian cinema's still produce such rubbish until now. Egypts biggest star adil imam has been responsible for producing most of the rubbish in the last 30 years, but this is probably the worst ever.<br /><br />the story revolves around a newly appointed minister, and how he has to deal with a visit from a danish women and his four sons who he raised on his own. the film is filled with unfunny jokes, plenty of sexual references that are just there for shock values.<br /><br />Adil Imam should probably stick to theatre plays where he has produced some great ones in his life, if he continues to do films like this one he will just embarrass himself.
