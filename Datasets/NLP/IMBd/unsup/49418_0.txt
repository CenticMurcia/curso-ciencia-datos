I guess we can thank Michael Moore for reviving the documentary, but it's unfortunate that I was sucked into paying to see this film.<br /><br />Did you realize that a corporation's primary goal is to, above all else, make money? Did you know that corporations do cost-benefit analyses for everything, and make decisions solely based on the results of those analyses?<br /><br />Is there a problem with that? I own a small company, and, yes, we are in business to make money. If we weren't making money, we would shut down the business.<br /><br />The agenda of the film is to inform, and possibly shock, viewers about the deeds of "evil" corporations. It didn't win me over. There's nothing new or shocking here. Save your money, or, rather, use it to go see the interesting and revelatory "Going Upriver: The Long War of John Kerry".
