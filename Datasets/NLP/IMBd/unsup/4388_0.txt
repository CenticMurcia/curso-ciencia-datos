I really enjoyed Why We Had to Kill Bitch, perhaps I am a bit biased since I saw it with someone who was in the movie. It isn't really like any other movie that I've seen before, so It's a bit difficult to describe. If I had to describe it, though, I'd say it's a mixture of comedic-reality TV, 80's teen movies (like ferris beullers day off), and clerks. The highlights of the film were definitely the acting performances by the main cast, as well as the use of comedic flashbacks. The film starts off a little slow and takes the more direct slapstick humor route, but changes into a more plot-driven/ironic comedy style. The characters also get more developed towards the end, which explains some of their behavior early on. Check out the movie if you get a chance to, make sure to watch the end credits.
