I will try to be brief about this film because I can't imagine anyone will ever really watch it. The only reason I even rented soemthing like this is because the woman I am dating thought it looked good and she recommended it. She has excellent taste so I agreed. Oh boy were we in for a shock. She hated it even worse than I did and she ended up fast forwarding a lot of the dialogue in the film just so we could get to the big secret. The problem with the movie is that it took so long to set everything up that by the end you can't wait to find out what it is just so you can turn the movie off and watch Sportsdesk. The young boys problem becomes annoying. Sure, at the end we can empathize with him and all that he went through but that does not make the film a good one. Trauma is a weird thing and I guess it affects everyone in different ways but I just didn't buy into why the young kid became unable to talk. Hey, here's an idea; if you are threatened by the local sheriff that seems to do everything the wrong way, tell someone. His backward ass tactics would have gotten him busted long before this movie does. <br /><br />When the film is boring and moves at a snails pace and you don't really like any of the characters in it, then you have a problem. Locked in Silence should have stayed that way. It never should have been given the green light. This is proof that not all true life stories need to be told and made into a film. <br /><br />Absolutely terrible! 0 out of 10
