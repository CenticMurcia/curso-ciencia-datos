I just want to know how this movie happened. I didn't see any references to Troma in the credits.<br /><br />I had previously considered Astrozombies the worst movie I had ever seen, but it was bad-funny. Lots of long boring scenes that dragged on for no apparent reason. Cheerleader Ninjas looked promising mostly because of the title and there was not a girl in her underwear on the box. I thought maybe they would go for more of a ninja-type thing. I was very wrong. <br /><br />I was honestly shocked at how bad the acting was - I've seen community theater that was exceptional compared to this. I did find the use of a body double for the main character somewhat funny because I can't imagine how the stand-in could have been a worse actress. (I kind of feel bad criticizing others so harshly, but it was like they weren't even trying.)<br /><br />Actually, I don't want to reflect too much on how bad the movie was, just try to warn others so that they might not suffer the same fate as me.<br /><br />On second thought, it might be worth watching for young teenage boys who can't afford to rent porn and really feel the need to see naked women - no, I think they would even be disappointed.
