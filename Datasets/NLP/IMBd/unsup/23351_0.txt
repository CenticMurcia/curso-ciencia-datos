I saw this film at the New York festival last June and was impressed by the intensity of the narrative: with a small cast and a small budget Ms. Sinclair draws the viewer in and never lets you rest as the heroine has her life destroyed and then is thrust in a circumstance where she has to confront the monster who has made her life a living hell. It takes a side trip into ghost story that, while unexpected is right on in keeping it from being just a take on M.D.Game. Her low budget works for her in keeping things tight and paranoid, it never feels cheap, only focused. It is one of the best woman in jeopardy films Ihave ever seen.
