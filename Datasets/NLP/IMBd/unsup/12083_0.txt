As an admirer of wild horses and a female who happens to love westerns it was great to have a movie with those qualities.<br /><br />Not having to worry about the language or subject matter was awesome just hearing some of the children in the theater comment on things happening on the screen was incredible they were actually watching the movie not up running around. They made a joyous noise. A real family movie so make it a family date, don't forget the popcorn.<br /><br />This movie prompted me to learn more about history not just of the west but of the wild horses especially HIDALGO and the meaning behind it. It is a great search but I'll leave that up to you.<br /><br />
