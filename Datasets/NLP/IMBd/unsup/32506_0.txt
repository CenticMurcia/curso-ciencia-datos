I found this film to be severely irritating and tacky. Flash Gordon resembles a zealous fitness fanatic as he traverses space dressed in lycra and using what appears to be some sort of treadmill as his main form of transportation. Also, the flying monkeys/humans, which I am supposing must either be a complete yet poorly done copy of those in "The Wizard of Oz" or the missing links between chimpanzees, humans and bats. Sadly, "The Wizard of Oz" despite being made nearly fifty years beforehand had higher quality special effects as concerns flying primates. The costumes are atrocious, really, I hope whoever designed them got stiffed on their salary.
