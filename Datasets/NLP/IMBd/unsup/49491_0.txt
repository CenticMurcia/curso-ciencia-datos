This movie was terrible. The plot was paper thin. The highlight was the first 2 minutes with Neve showing us all the goods. It was hard to follow what the point was. Were we just supposed to learn not to sell our girlfriend or she will pay back the two male fools that forged this agreement. I felt like it was a waste of 90 minutes of my life. The performances are very weak. Neve never really sells you on her devious side. Weller is so clich√© that it makes his role almost cartoonish. They spend almost half this movie trying to explain what a con man he is. They miss the development of any depth of all the other characters. If at all possible don't waste any money or time on this film.
