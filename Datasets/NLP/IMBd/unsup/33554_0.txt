A movie with fair acting abilities and yet keeps your attention. This film was labeled 'Castle of the Creeping Flesh' in some countries. While watching the film, one can expect to see things such as zombies but instead this has a new twist on horror. It contains mystery as well as a vengeful statement. With a taste of Frankenstein, this film also shows characters who show little or no change of attitudes at all. Considering this film was made in the mid to late 1960's, the special effects is weak. The storyline has an excellent twist. Things that can keep you interested is the rape scenes and the characters that have been hurt in the movie. When you think you see a flaw in the movie, be careful, it could have been intentional. For example, a young and beautiful lady gets a cut across the forehead from hitting a tree branch while riding a horse. Hours later, the cut is completely gone and the lady is back to being full of life and still beautiful as ever. Paying attention to details like this will help understand the movie as this was intentional and if you want to know how it happened, all I can say is watch the movie.
