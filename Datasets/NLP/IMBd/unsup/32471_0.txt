This is the worst writing I have ever seen in a movie. Watching it leads one to wonder if it is meant to be a spoof. But, it isn't. The acting is like a bunch of 8-year-olds who have no sense of reality. Roughly two minutes of this movie was frightening. If you like bad movies, this is for you. It is absolutely hilarious because it's so bad. But, I would not recommend spending the hour and a half on it. Gary Busey is in it for roughly five minutes. Strange and twisted, he seems to be the comic relief, but I can't tell.<br /><br />There is also no resolution at the end. It ends abruptly and frustratingly does not answer some of the key questions. Most of the dialog gives background information of all the different characters which is rather pointless and shallow. <br /><br />A few gratuitous bloody scenes and sex scenes, but again they're hardly enough to be considered interesting and worthwhile.
