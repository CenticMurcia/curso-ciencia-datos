It's been more that 7 months since I've watched it for the first time and posted a comment in IMDb. Today I've had the oppotunity to watch "Go Toward The Light" again and the feeling it brought me weren't much different than the first time. Death is always something hard to deal with, and the way this movie shows it, we notice the way a fearful fact can interact with all the happiness and joy in our lives... It makes you feel like you're dying too... very sad, compeling, amazing...<br /><br />
