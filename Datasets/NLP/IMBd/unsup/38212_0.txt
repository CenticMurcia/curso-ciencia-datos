In a movie with all these phenomenal stars, the audience should be able to expect a riot of comedy and charm. Unfortunately, the talents of Howard Keel and Kathryn Grayson tend to burn rather than smolder as the plot develops. Some scenes between the two main characters become absolutely tedious. That aside, Marge and Gower Champion are superb in this film, and Red Skelton with some help from Zsa Zsa Gabor adds several funny sketches to the overall production.
