this film is so bad, there are adverts for local shops in it and it must have been filmed on a video camera.... ....its so bad its actually funny. There's a guy who is supposed to be Bruce lee, looks nothing like him, just is Asian..... It looks like they could not afford real actors so they used children as drug dealers.... I think its a production for a local community in America, how com i can buy it in pound land in the UK though!!!??? You have to see it to experience how rubbish it is, watch this film but don't pay anything more than a dollar, or pound or a euro... try and see if you can last till the movie ends...I couldn't the first time and missed the ending the second time, it now sits proudly with the rest of my DVD collection as it should with everyone, so you can say, I own the worst film eva made
