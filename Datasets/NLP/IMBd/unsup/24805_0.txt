I see all these very favourable comments and high marks and I can't help but wonder what all the people saw in this movie. I mean, yeah, it approaches pedophilia in a very direct way, the performances are good, the directing is good, but most of the film was utterly boring.<br /><br />One could see the ending of the movie from a mile away and I stood through all the story to find out exactly what the twist will be, but there was no twist, only a sudden closure of plot, a total stop.<br /><br />My guess is that if the subject of pedophilia would not be such a scary and fascinating taboo in American culture, this film would not have been received in such a (in my opinion) over positive way.<br /><br />Bottom line: be prepared for some shocking images like pedo, homosexual sex, even rape, and a lot of boring stuff in between. The entire child abuse part is really well detailed as well as the psychological trauma, but that's about it.
