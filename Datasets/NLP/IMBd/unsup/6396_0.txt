I had looked forward to seeing 'A Clockwork Orange' for a long time before my opportunity to see it came. It's one of those films like 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Fight Club' that young men like me have been trained to look forward to. Unlike 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Fight Club' I did not find it stimulating, thought-provoking, revolutionarily groundbreaking or, for that matter, remotely enjoyable on any level. The reform scenes sickened me, as did the rape scene, the dialogue, the costumes and even some of the sets. I have never seen eye to eye with Kubrick's visions but this films is far and away my most heavily disliked film of all time. I do not pan it with a complete lack of stars as I found Malcolm McDowell's performance to be one of the most unique I have ever seen and that deserves credit, but I can say without a doubt that 'A Clockwork Orange' will be far displaced from my viewing screens for a good few years until I am up to the challenge once more.
