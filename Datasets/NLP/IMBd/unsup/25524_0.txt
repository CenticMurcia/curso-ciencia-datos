Although this was a good movie with a decent storyline, they made a large flaw, I could not overlook.<br /><br />Her boyfriend which is part of the Police Department, and working on the case, is trying to keep her from being arrested and accused of this crime. Half way through the movie, he takes her to the scene of the crime, because the evidence keeps mounting against her. While there he tells her how they believe things happened. According to him, they believe that her ex was tied and bleeding to death, while he laid there and witnessed his soon to be new wife's rape and murder. Read that last sentence carefully. Does the word RAPE stand out at all. This is a woman who RAPED and left semen behind, after she over came her ex, with the other woman present. Ties and left him bleeding to death, and then went to work raping the other woman, and then killing her.<br /><br />Something just a tad bid wrong with this whole picture, don't ya think?
