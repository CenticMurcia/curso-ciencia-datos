Not a very good movie.<br /><br />Van Wilder 2:The Rise of Taj is a movie that almost completely relies on gross out laughs and unfortunately doesn't succeed.<br /><br />There are a only 2 or 3 giggle moments.<br /><br />Some people might be tricked into watching because its called Van Wilder. Don't be fulled ladies and gentlemen Van Wilder isn't even in it.<br /><br />Taj(Kal Penn)leaves college to continue his education he goes to a college in england where he wants to teach a rich bitch student(Lauren Cohen)not to be so serious.<br /><br />The actors did a OK job. That is what kept this movie from getting below 3/10. Kal Penn was funny. I didn't even know Lauren Cohen was in this(i know her from supernatural)but it was a nice surprise.<br /><br />This is not a very funny movie and at most times just plain stupid. The actors are the only thing that make this being worthy of even being called a movie. <br /><br />I don't recommend this. But if you want to watch a Van Wilder movie without Van Wilder in it then go ahead. They should have only called it 'The Rise of Taj'.<br /><br />3/10
