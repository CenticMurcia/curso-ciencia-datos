For such a low budget movie and from PRC as well, The Brute Man is quite good.<br /><br />As a result of an experiment going wrong at university, Hal Moffat becomes disfigured and some years later, starts killing people. His victims include a grocer's delivery boy and a jeweller. He makes friends with a blind woman but nearly kills her after shopping him to the police and is arrested in her home after she set him up.<br /><br />The Brute Man is shot well in black and white and is certainly one of the better efforts from PRC.<br /><br />I've never heard of any of the cast in this, with Rondo Hatton in the title role.<br /><br />This is worth checking out. A good way to spend an hour one afternoon or evening.<br /><br />Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
