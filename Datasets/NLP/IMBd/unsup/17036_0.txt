I love the newer version of the series versus the old one. It was a lot more detailed and I loved Ben Cross as Barnabus more too. He looked more like a vampire and so did the others. And they should details when they fed on people too. I like attention to detail like that. Though I wasn't even born yet to watch the original series when it was on, I did watch it in reruns on sci-fi a few years ago before they took it off the air. My mom was a big fan of the original, so she taped the new series when it aired and I loved every minute of it.They need to put it on DVD now so everyone can see it that hasn't watched it or wants it in their movie collection like I do. Maybe we'll all get lucky and it will be out on DVD in the near future.
