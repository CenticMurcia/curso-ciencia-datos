I just rented this movie because of the video cover. It's very similar to the one on the IMDb site.<br /><br />An awful film with some hilarious scenes, like when the family is on the table and enjoying their breakfast together, while the coffin of the dead Uncle is in the same room. I just waited for the family to take their food and chairs to carry it to the coffin for taking breakfast on the coffin. Unfortunately it never happened.<br /><br />The actors were incredibly bad. The mother was always p issed about her son when he did something good and she was praising her son when he was doing shenanigans. The scriptwriter must be a beaver or a donkey or something and the director seems to be a six year old child. There wasn't even a second of plausibility in this picture.<br /><br />In the end sequence, when Uncle Sam gets shot you can clearly see thick wires on his back reaching to the house. Everything about this film was just stupid. Everybody in this film was stupid. This director should get hung up on a flagpole.<br /><br />1/10 with no comment.
