I bought this in a box set with "The Phantom Empire". I watched Empire and liked it. First off, these two movies are pretty similar. Each serial has one main hero with a child or children as the sidekicks. Next they each deal with a hidden kingdom (or empire) right under our noses. Each kingdom or empire is destroyed in the end with only the "ones from above" surviving. And finally, each serial uses the "cheat ending" way too much. With that being said, this movie felt more like "The Phantom Empire"-lite. It seemed to move slower than Empire and the story wasn't as good either. Personally I liked Gene Autry better than Crash Corrigan. Now I'm not saying that this movie is bad, it's just not all that good. I gave it an "ok". I've only seen four serials and this ranks number three. If you like old serials, I recommend it. But if your new to the serial genre, I'd try something else.
