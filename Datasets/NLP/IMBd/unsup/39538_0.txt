You need a score card to figure out what's going on with "Bad Seed."<br /><br />A woman confesses to her husband that she has been having an affair. Just then the other guy calls. Her husband storms out of the house and returns to find her dead. After the funeral, he finds a letter with the guy's address. He goes there and he thinks he has killed the guy only to find out that he murdered his retarded brother instead. Speaking of retarded!<br /><br />The movie dissolves into a one big chase thing. Our "hero" finds detective played by Denis Farina. <br /><br />Wait, if that's not enough the retarded guy who was killed actually killed the girl after all.<br /><br />We've got a fire by suicide to deal with. Complex! More mishuga to me.
