I love period movies and this one captures the time and place as well as it is possible. The humor is gentle and very touching. The scene of the 4th of July morning, when all the young boys come out with their firecrackers never fails to put me on the floor laughing.<br /><br />Wallace Berry's delivery of the one word line "soup?" is almost worth the price of admission by itself.<br /><br />I heartily recommend this movie to anyone who has a heart. It will be touched<br /><br />
