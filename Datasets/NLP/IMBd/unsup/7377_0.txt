I saw this at the Waterfront Film Festival in Saugatuck Michigan.<br /><br />The Flyboys is a wonderful adventure film starring two young talented actors Jesse James and Reiley McClendon. Kyle (McClendon) is the new kid in town and after a little trouble on his first day of school, he befriends Jason (James). Jason's uncle works on and flies small airplanes, and after Jason and Kyle get a little taste of flying in planes, they want more.<br /><br />Soon, Jason and Kyle unexpectedly get on board a plane that is carrying a bomb. This is just the set up of the very entertaining film. The whole cast is great, Tom Sizemore and Stephen Baldwin are great together, and the side characters are also very impressive. There were also some very exhilarating moments throughout, even a simple scene involving kids being chased by a bully was made into a thrilling moments. The score is perfect in the film adding to the acting and excitement. And I particularly loved the use of sound during the final action sequence in the film.<br /><br />After having seen over a dozen films at the Waterfront Film Festival, this was the final film I saw and it was definitely my favorite one. The entire audience was having a blast watching it. There were numerous bursts of applause for many scenes and a lot of laughs throughout. Everyone had a great time.<br /><br />The Flyboys is sure to please everyone, it's fun, funny, and an overall great picture. Be sure to check this one out. See this film then spread the word.
