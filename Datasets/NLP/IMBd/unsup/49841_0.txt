From start to finish, the most boring film imaginable. You keep waiting for something to happen, but nothing ever does. Michele leads a very boring life, he is the kind of person I would never wish to make the acquaintance of. The film is a typical product of a certain left-wing so-called culture rampant in Italy in the Seventies, of which Nanni Moretti is a leading exponent. One thing puzzles me: why does Moretti so often cast himself as a person named Michele? Take a look at the list of his films! There must be a Michele in his past who left a lasting impression on him, After all, there is no lack of male first names in Italian; why not Mario, Alberto or even Dante?
