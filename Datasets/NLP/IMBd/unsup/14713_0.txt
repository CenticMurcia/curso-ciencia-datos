Why does it happen in Bollywood? If a person is successful, what is the surety that his kid will be the same? Exceptions, like Hrithik Roshan, do exist but in most cases, the kids are awful. Here, I am talking of Aditya Chopra. He's burying his father's hard-earned name with a series of senseless movies which is bringing Yash Raj Films to an all-time low. They have already started cutting down on movie promotions. Except for Chak de, all YRF movies this year- Tara Rum Pum, Jhoom and Lagaa chuneri have bombed. We say- once bitten, twice shy. But even thrice shy is not working. Now, Junior Chopra comes with another Dumbo- Aaja Nachle.<br /><br />As far as Madhuri is concerned, the dhak-dhak lady has not lost it. She still looks charming and can dance unbelievably well. And as a mother of 10 year old, she looks great in the role.<br /><br />The problem is script, direction, music and the wrong selection of cast.<br /><br />The script is predictable, boring and spontaneous. By spontaneous, i mean that whenever some event happens in the movie, it is solved in the next 5 minutes. Also, the play in the end was below average. I could hear some emotions and applause in theater during the play but that was only from the audience in the movie itself. Moreover, the overall story is not strong. And if you add an average direction to a predictable storyline, the end result is definitely gonna be boring.<br /><br />Another problem is music which is just OK. For a movie revolving around dance, you need to have a breathtaking music but there is hardly anything there in that department. The songs are equally boring.<br /><br />When we talk about good actors not being given enough opportunities, we mean give them movies which lazy star-kids are ruining. If you want Konkana Sen Sharma and Kunal Kapoor to form a Dancing Couple, you have gone nuts. They are best suited for demanding roles which involve strong character. As for other actors, they don't get much of screen presence. But, i did like the little girl who portrayed Madhuri's Daughter. Looked an original NRI kid.<br /><br />Anyways, watch this movie on a boring weekend if you have nothing much to do or wait for it to come on the idiot box. Just to cheer you up, it is better than the torturous Jhoom Barabar Jhoom.
