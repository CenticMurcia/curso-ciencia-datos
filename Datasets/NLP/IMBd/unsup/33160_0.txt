If i wasn't in the middle of a blizzard and had nothing else to do, Id demand the last 2 hrs of my life back.<br /><br />Since you people generally like reasons for why stuff was crap: No plot line, pseudo-self discovery in what was supposed to be a romantic comedy, the self-discovery fell on its face hard, and in one scene stacy and barb start dancing around a room for NO reason. This was BAD. I wouldn't have finished it but i always see a movie through to its (in the case) incredibly craptacular end.<br /><br />What I'm guessing was the point of the movie: Buy a palm and get Carly Simon cds.
