This is so far the third movie based from the Bosnian/Serb war, that I've seen. It is so far also the best. Dennis Quaid did so well a job, I'd almost think this is the best movie of his career. It does seem a little confusing though towards the end, but overall I give it sadly a 10 out of 10. Saying sadly cause I wish it never happened at all. The way the serb/albanian war is going on as well. This movie gives a whole new perspective on the war.
