Yeah i just saw this movie, and like the summary says, i REALLY think it was crap! I don't think i've ever seen actors act worse. I don't think i've ever seen a movie that is this sad.. I don't really know what to say here, but all i can tell you is- this movie is NOT worth spending your time watching.<br /><br />DON'T READ ON FROM THIS POINT IF YOUR GONNA SEE THE MOVIE, SOME INCIDENTS IN THE MOVIE Reveled..<br /><br />I mean, there are these college students or whatever, and they follow this guy in his quest, if you want, to become a killer like Mike Myers (Haloween), and he's a completely normal guy in the whole movie (maybe a little psycho). And then, all of a sudden he goes to boobietrap a house where about 6 kids or so are gonna have a "party".. And then he just kills them all.. And they tape how he sets all of his "boobietraps".. so basically you know everything that he's gonna do when he's gonna kill them, as he first shows everything on tape. (Still the random college students filming here..) And he's all normal. And then he just ends up killing everybody, all the guys filming, too, because they decide to stop him, apart from the girl, of course, that is one of the two, i guess, main characters in the movie. Anyways, i think this is one of the most stupid ass movies i've ever seen, but hey, if you think you might like it, by all means.. Only reason i didn't give it a 1 in rating is that i wont do that until i see myself on the screen flying in a movie, or something like that.. Haha (I mean, until there's a movie that's so stupid it's unbearable...) Alright, that's my thoughts.. Thank you for your time.
