Gosh i love this movie! It seems i catch the best movies late at night on movie channels and it's so upsetting that these kinds of movies never get the exposure they deserve. Watching this movie just make you want to get up and jump right into the scenes and start singing. The songs and numbers were so different and interesting. Seeing this movie has had me singing the like "Hey! do you wanna come out, and play the game, it's never too late" for like a year now. Its the only line i knew and i would catch myself randomly singing it in my head when i was doing boring work or just walking around. Then last night at 3:30 or so i decided to head to bed and i flipped through the TV channels out of habit and found this movie was on again. Of course i stayed up until 5 watching it. if anyone has a chance to watch this film i strongly suggest it. Then go out, buy it, and show it to all your friends. The characters are really entertaining. Their oh so familiar teen struggle to fit in, be loves, and please everyone makes you feel part of the story. Like ... I've been there. Anyway... 2Thumbs up for this movie. I wish there were more pictures like this available on a larger scale. I'm a bit sick of watching over budgeted, under-talented, lack-luster, "Hollywood Blockbusters". Watch Camp!!
