If you like game shows, I don't know if you'd like this one, it's hardly the same as any normal one. There are ten contestants brought into a dark studio to answer many questions. The rules are when a question is asked if they answer correctly they rise a stage with money, if they answer incorrectly they start again. However if they say bank before a question the money is safe. The reason this show is not like a normal game show is that the contestants work as a team, but they can get rid of a member (The Weakest Link). But the main reason for the game show being different is the host. Normally the host is nice, but Anne Robinson purposely acts nasty and the contestant leaves with nothing but the words "You are the Weakest Link, Goodbye!" Anne Robinson was number 25 on The 100 Worst Britons (for being mean), and she was number 46 on TV's 50 Greatest Stars. Very good!
