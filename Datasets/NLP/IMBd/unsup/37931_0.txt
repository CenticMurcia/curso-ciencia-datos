The Intro. reads "not as others told it; not as she told it; but as it really was". WRONG! It doesn't even get her early hair color right.<br /><br />It depicts Marilyn as a complete naive airhead, who did not enjoy sex, and whose life (other than her eventual success in movies) was one of neverending abuse. She is depicted as really the same as the studio-pushed persona she later often had to use - a dumb blonde with that airhead voice. There is something of the Cinderella story here, as her early life was rough. The real basis of the film is the "revenge" theme. There is quite a man-hating aspect to it. It is not graphic, but the heroine endures repeated abuse, including rapes, forced lesbian sex and oral sex (in this movie it might be called "the casting floor"), but gets her revenge by eventually becoming a success as Marilyn. Some poor films and most soaps are watchable because of an attractive cast; this one lacks even that, other than Preston Hanson and Patch Mackenzie.
