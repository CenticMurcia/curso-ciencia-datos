Hello everybody! <br /><br />I see that I'm not the only one taken away by this great series. <br /><br />I simply love it and I think it's a great, down to earth movie. Every movie is about teenager issues, finding great love, a lot of things that people only dream of, makes your heart run faster, you wish you were young again. All the issues, series focus on the same age-group, but as we get older shall I say "wiser" our problems and lifestyle, life patterns change. So we need something that is close to our age, lifestyle.<br /><br />This is what I missed about SEX and the City...love this one too. Single life, single life's issues, fun and attraction....they hold on to their single status but as we find out...everyone is looking for the same thing, wants the same thing:LOVE, that special SOMEONE. They find it...so what then? Life ends? <br /><br />NO...and this is when Lipstick jungle comes into the picture. Don't we have issues and problems and fun and all that when we are in a serious relationship or married?? I loved lipstick Jungle and I really hope that I get to see season 3,4,5,6,7,8....and so on. ACtually this is the reason for writing this. I hope they haven't shut down production and I get to see the next season. We need not only SEX and The City in our lives but Lipstick Jungle( or some king of Sex and Marriage/Relationship):))<br /><br />THanks, hopefully someone will read it, who can help in this department:D Enjoy life:)
