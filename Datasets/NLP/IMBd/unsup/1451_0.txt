I didn't expect to rate this movie more than a 4 before I saw it. The director has taken a plot which looks boring and trite and turned it into a unexpectedly good movie. Lots of clever lines(ala Neil Simon)and excellent performances by all actors. I gave this a "7" rating and should be watched whenever one wants something just fun to watch.
