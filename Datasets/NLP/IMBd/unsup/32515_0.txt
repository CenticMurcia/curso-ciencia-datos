After all the fuzz and compliments about this movie I thought it was going to impress me big time...it did, but in a negative way. Okay, I can't say it fails completely at making you feel some beauty of life, but it's way too superficial, childish and pretty unbelievable...besides, "The Father" is simply too annoying doing his pretending game. It's just too much sugar in this movie...diabetics rather stay away.
