This extraneous aside from the Four Daughters series is said to have been made by popular demand, and to have defied the rule that sequels or spin-offs are never up to par. I don't know about the first part of that, but I strongly disagree with the latter conclusion.<br /><br />The Four Daughters/Wives/Mothers series ranged from "not-too-bad" to "really-quite-bad" (4 to 2 on the IMDb scale). This entry was far below the abysmal standard set by the others. They should have left Garfield dead instead of resurrecting and renaming him. He was the worst feature of the previous films and perfected his obnoxious character in this one. Rains was as close as anyone (except cook/housekeeper Robson) got to being a sympathetic character in Daughters Courageous, and he barely rises above detestable. Even his noble gesture at the end doesn't salvage his role or the film.
