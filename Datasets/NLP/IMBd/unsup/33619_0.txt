There's not really much to say about this movie. It does contain one good scene that has a couple of good scares but that's about it. The rest of the movie is peppered with bad acting and boring dialogue. This may be why the climax is entertaining...you've been waiting so long for something to happen! <br /><br />This movie could have been a bit better if the house itself was more interesting. Had the movie been shot better this may have been accomplished but as far as haunted houses goes this one is just dull. <br /><br />As far as the backing story goes...apparently there's a ghost wandering about the house but the reason for it is so flimsy that it almost becomes pointless...that and the fact that the ghost doesn't do very much. The rest of the story involving the mystery of a priests murder is just as banal. As it is the story just isn't interesting so you are left hoping to be scared a couple of times...well a couple of times is about all you'll get.<br /><br />Overall a flat story with a couple of scares in the first half and a moderately enjoyable ending will leave you wondering why you bothered with The Amityville Curse. The Amityville Curse rates a 2 out of 10.
