Not everyone likes this movie but I see why. Its very stupid but oh so funny. I laugh a lot when I watch this movie because the lines are hysterical. Farley and Perry steal the show in this uproarious movie but all the actors have funny lines to dish out. Like these for example. <br /><br />Higgins: THERE'S AN ANIMAL NOW! everyone except Edwards and Hunt starts firing at the animal Higgins: We can't kill it! We're all dead! God save us! Hunt: Hold your fire! Hold your fire! everyone stops firing. Hunt looks closely and sees that the animal is just a squirrel nibbling on a acorn. Hunt: It's only a squirrel. Pratt: He's got something in his hand! Guy Fontenot: Something in his hand! then they continue firing at the squirrel <br /><br />Bidwell returns to camp after a bear has bit off his leg. Bidwell: Sir, I've been to hell and back. Edwards: Yes, I can see that... Bidwell: I suspect that you'll want to lead a hunting party to slay that terrible beast. Edwards: Well, yes, that thought did cross my mind briefly. But now I have a better idea. Bidwell: Yes, sir? Edwards: I shall fashion for you the finest wooden leg you've ever seen. Bidwell: But what about the bear? Edwards: Rest assured, Bidwell, in 20 years or so, the ravages of old age will deal with the bear far more cruelly than we ever could have. Bidwell: Revenge is sweet, sir.<br /><br />So if you like movies that are stupid yet funny this is a great one to watch.
