The movie seems to be good but only from the outside.The story has definitely been weaved around amithabh bhachan.The comparison with the character ekalavya of the Mahabharata is too fanciful.I could not find any resemblance with the real character's touchy position. The movie's settings could have carried it off as historical movie but there was a modern tinge to it for no apparent reason.The performance of the characters was up to the mark. The royal guard is given so much importance and it is strange to observe that there are no other servants in the movie. Overall there is a lot of confusion as to whose dharma is right and what is dharma and what generates it.
