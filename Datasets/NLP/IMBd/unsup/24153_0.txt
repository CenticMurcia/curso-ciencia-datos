Without comparing this too much to the first Butterfly Effect, the storyline was what made me watch this time waster. Always will is about as good as the 2nd Butterfly Effect.<br /><br />The acting in Always will was passable at best, Baglini didn't seem to do anything with his lines. Nor did any of the other actors.<br /><br />A dug up capsule of students school items is the ridiculous item that allows Will to travel to times in the past and change them. In The B E Kutcher remembers parts in the past that have been blocked because they are memories best forgotten, with more tragic consequences when the events are changed.<br /><br />The storyline of Always Will is interesting, the movie needed decent acting and a better idea of how he could change his life. See Back to the Future or any number of time travel movies for something better.
