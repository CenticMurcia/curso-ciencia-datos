I'm not sure this has a true 'spoiler' in it, but I put the check mark in "just in case." I really wanted to like this movie because I love "period" flicks based on fact, I love older cars, and I love Jeff Bridges. Early on I wasn't sure about it, however. Jeff Bridges' eternal smile and optimism was starting to grate on me, but I stuck with it. From what I can tell, the movie was amazingly accurate. This is a film for someone who might be interested not only in old cars with futuristic ideas, but also the inner workings of big business and the government of the 1940's. This is a David vs Goliath film without a true fairy tale ending.
