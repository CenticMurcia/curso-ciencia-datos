I have read the book by John grisham and i was not greatly impressed by his work . But the book was a worth read, it had some nice moments and the mood throughout the book was good. I expected a good adaptation of the book in this movie even though the rating was below 6. But what i saw was the opposite. Right from the start there has been many changes in the plot. I do understand the movie would have been more boring if adam and sam had been just talking most of the time but it made sense in the book and the movie is senseless. A few characters in the book were totally missing here and some new characters have sprung up from nowhere which r not in the book. I didn't like the casting of sam as well. <br /><br />If u liked the book, so be it, don watch this movie.. Even if u din like the book, don watch it..It is no way near the book..
