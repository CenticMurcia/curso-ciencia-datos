This is just another mediocre action flick with bad dialogue, bad acting, an iffy plot, and lots of gratuitous explosions.<br /><br />Plenty of "what the heck were they thinking" material here, too. Like, Rod Steiger playing a Latino (or maybe just a white guy with a Latino accent). Which, I guess, makes Eric Roberts' character Latino. Roberts is, of course, reliably unlikeable--the kind of character that makes you count the seconds wishing for his death scene to just come already.<br /><br />There's also a laughable scene showing intercut shots of Sly Stallone doing some ballet aerobics (or something) in his house while Sharon Stone just stands in the middle of her own living room doing a Marylin Monroe in front of her open breezy windows.<br /><br />Stallone and Stone's love scene, which shows plenty of Stallone's icky spider-web shoulder veins, is also pretty strange. It's got Stallone curling up in the most feminine way possible, like something out of a deranged Victoria's Secret catalogue. He makes Sharon Stone look masculine and very unsexy just by being in the same frame with her. Pardon me for a moment, but... eeeeyeck! I think I need a shower now too.<br /><br />Two more criticisms: 1) This has one of the cheesiest moments I've ever seen in an action film that's supposed to at least have high production value, if nothing else. 2) What the heck happened to the cat at the end? He was the only character I cared about!<br /><br />Like I said, James Woods is the only thing this movie's got going for it. He gives a great performance as the villain.<br /><br />Stallone should've stayed away from trying to play macho tough guys and stuck to playing likeable underdogs with tough guy tendencies, like in "Rocky" and "Cop Land"--it's the only time he's ever been good.<br /><br />3/10 stars (mostly for Woods).
