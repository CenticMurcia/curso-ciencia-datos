It is sad when critics reach the point where the name of the director automatically insures a positive review. Genius that he is or was, the last 2 films are by any standard poor. Here again despite the appeal of Cruise, is a movie that lacks any cohesion, sensitivity, vision, or logic. There is no "minority report". Rather there is an echo. There is no sympathetic character, only a world devoid of any redeeming characteristics. Craft maybe high but the story is totally lacking. Why is Spielberg so fascinated by the loss of children? How do you justify motivations covering 6 years? Why do the plots have to be transparent? Why does the movie drag on? Watch it without the thought that this was done by the same man who gave us Jaws, ET, Indie etc. Even the best directors often run dry, Kubrick for one. Here is another.
