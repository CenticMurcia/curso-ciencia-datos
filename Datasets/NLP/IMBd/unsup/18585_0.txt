I still can't figure out why any self-respecting person would ever attempt to make a film that is as stupid as In The Woods. Or better yet, why any decent person would ever rent, let alone buy, this piece of utter garbage.<br /><br />I think the writer should win the award for the dumbest storyline ever made into an actual movie.<br /><br />Everything about this movie just screams of stupidity. The acting is very mechanical and fake, the special effects (if you can call them that) and the "scary monster" seem like they're from an old 80's PBS tv show.<br /><br />Well, the list goes on and on. I won't bore you with all the details, if you want to be super bored you can go out and rent this movie!
