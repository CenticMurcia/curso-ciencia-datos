This is one of the finest and lowest budget indie films I've seen recently. The comedy is far better than that of the over-acclaimed Napolian Dynamite, I recommend trying to find this at a local theater. Its showing in Rochester NY at the end of June. Much of the film was shot in the director's home town of Rochester, its worth seeing if you live there because of all the recognizable land marks. Drivers wanted defines itself with a distinctive comedy style, very character based, very easy to relate to. Anyone who has worked as a delivery boy would love the film, it touches on every sort of ridiculous moment that you've probably encountered on the job.
