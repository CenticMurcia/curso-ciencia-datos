It does seem like old times when you watch this movie. I think this clever script, & the casting are perfect in this film. Goldie & Chevy Chase play off of each other well. Robert Guillame (TV's Benson) is well cast in support of the straight man who along with the rest of the cast are used to hang a good funny film together well. I think there are only a couple of films where Chevy Chase & Goldie Hawn worked together in as good a situation as they did here. Too bad it didn't happen more often as their chemistry in this one is really great.<br /><br />Now, if only a moose & squirrel showed up in the film & scared old Ira out of his wits, this one can only get funnier. Seems like there are not enough fun times like this film. The technology is now dated in it but most older films have that problem.
