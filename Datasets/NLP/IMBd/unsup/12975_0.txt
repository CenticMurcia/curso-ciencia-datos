I watched this film with no expectations!!. That's the key to enjoying movie's like these. Really enjoyed it and so did my friends. It's a Bachelor Party Movie (no donkey snorting coke this time). So you would think it's in the same spirit as a National Lampoon Movie. If you want to watch a film where you don't have to think, just RELAX and Laugh this is the film for you!. Seem's to me a lot of people being hard on it, or did they expect it to be a documentary of Bachelor Parties?. Too much Reality Show's on already In my opinion. I would watch again and will purchase. I liked seeing some familiar face's and some new face's that did a good job.
