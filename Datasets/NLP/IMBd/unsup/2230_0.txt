I've seen Suddenly a couple of times now and found it quite gripping.<br /><br />A rail worker receives a message telling him that the President is to pass through Suddenly at 5 pm. A bunch of crooks find out about this and terrorise a family, whose home overlooks the station, giving the terrorists the perfect vantage point to assassinate the President. After all this, the President's train goes through non-stop and the crooks get their comeuppance.<br /><br />The cast in Suddenly includes Ol Blue Eyes himself, Frank Sinatra and is joined by Sterling Hayden (The Asphalt Jungle) and Nancy Gates (World Without End, The Atomic City).<br /><br />Suddenly is a must see for all old movie fans. Very gripping.<br /><br />Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5.
