I am a huge fan of Stallone.. but this movie was ridiculously bad.. seriously.<br /><br />Like I said.. never question my allegiance to the Sly movies.. but this movie was terrible. Bad acting all around (accept for James Woods at parts) bad plot. bad writing. bad screen play. bad character development. bad SEX SCENE (INCREDIBLY long, drawn out and totally unnecessary!)<br /><br />I'm not gonna rip on stuff like how completely unlikely it is that someone (especially in 1994) would have as complex of devices as they had in this movie because lets face it, this isn't Stallone's first unrealistic movie nor is it probably his MOST unrealistic movie.<br /><br />I did get a laugh at the hotel/bomb/water scene though... no spoiler there :)<br /><br />Anyway, that's my opinion, take it or leave it.<br /><br />Fox-x
