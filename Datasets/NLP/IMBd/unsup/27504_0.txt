I sincerely love this movie. Its well made, the storyline and script are both good, and the acting and singing by Bette are truly divine!<br /><br />Bette's vocals and charismatic acting ability shine through in this movie, which clearly shows the star she really is! After viewing this, I ran out and bought it, thats how good it is.<br /><br />10/10
