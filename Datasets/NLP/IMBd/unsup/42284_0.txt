Unintentionally hilarious..<br /><br />This was about as well written, violent and emotional as an episode of Grange Hill and only slightly less realistic than Green Street Americans.. I mean Green Street HOOLIGANS - sorry.<br /><br />There is only so many mockney "YOU CAAAHHNTS" you can take.<br /><br />The scene with the two dyslexics was the only good bit.<br /><br />Dyslexic 1: Can you smell gas? <br /><br />Dyslexic 2: I can't even smell me own name, mate.<br /><br />That bit was genuinely well written and had gravitas.<br /><br />Actually tell a lie, the other good bit was when the woman went to the Chinese restaurant and got served chicken soup, but she wasn't satisfied with it so she call the waiter over. Then the waiter asked what was wrong and she said "this chicken is rubbery!" and then the waiter says "thank you very much". <br /><br />The humour in that scene arose from the fact that "rubbery" was interpreted by the waiter as "lovely", a clever play on words arising from the (maybe) myth that oriental people mix up there R's and L's.<br /><br />All in all, WORST FILM EVARRRR
