Hey yeah, this is for Tina...I read your comment, with some degree of sadness. I'm sad for how delusional you and the others who make similar comments about these people are. Hate to break it to ya, but we're not jealous. Do you really think we are jealous of people who are spoiled and bitch out their parents, are obsessed with material things and are in for a very RUDE awakening when they hit the real world? Don't think so. Would I turn down a chance to win the lottery and upgrade my digs? Heck no. But if it meant turning into one of these shallow brats, heck ya. But for now, I'll take being dead broke and happy, if means my ego is in check.<br /><br />You and your materialistic MTV friends need to get out of fantasy land.
