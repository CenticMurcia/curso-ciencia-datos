All right, bring on the pain. Now let's start right off the bat with no nudity. I happen to know that those side show strip shows showed skin, if not they wouldn't be popular. I mean it was 1967, Ed Wood even had nudity in his films by now. Now let's look over the action in this movie, there isn't any. Most of the movie is just Jade with long speeches about how bad her life was and long speeches about how she's going to change that rotten luck and long speeches about how much she hates the freak show. My God, we get it. You're a gold digging skank and you want money in order to make your life better. Another thing, they act like the owner was rich, if he was rich he wouldn't be living in a big house not acting like a bloody nomad wracking in the little money from rubs like real carnies do. Ownership of a Carnival or Fun Fair isn't worth killing over, which she does near the end and the freaks get together for revenge. They turn her into a freak. None of the "freaks" has supernatural powers, so how the hell could humans to that to a person. It's impossible, as a TALES FROM THE CRYPT episode, it might have worked. 30 minutes and that includes a speech about her crappy past and how she's going to do better. Plus, they might have explained how she was turned into a freak. Long story short, bad characters, bad ending that makes no sense equals a really bad movie. THE RASBERRY.
