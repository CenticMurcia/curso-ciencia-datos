"The Bachelor"1999<br /><br />Starring: Chris O'Donnell, Ren√©e Zellweger, James Cromwell, Hal Holbrook, and Brooke Shields<br /><br />Directors: Buster Keatonand Gary Sinyor Running time: 101 minutes Rated PG-13 (for language and some sex-related material) 1/2* 2 out of 10<br /><br />Reviewed By Matt Doolittle<br /><br />The Bachelor was a cheap imitation of a comedy that was ongoing and boring. It wasn't boring in a sense of nothing there; it was boring in a sense that you didn't know what was going on. The characters were never introduced and the plot was very uneasy because they weren't introduced. <br /><br />	About the plot, it was uneasy because the film had no emotion. The actors/actresses said their lines with no charisma. They basically had a script and read it. In a good movie you can't do that, if you want viewers to like it they have to feel it. I think "Buckley" (played by Brook Shields) was a very good character. It's sad when the supporting roles are played better than the main ones. As a viewer I didn't know the names of characters and I didn't care enough to know. This whole movie is supposed to take place in two days but within two days Anne goes to Athens and back then goes away again with her sister. He asks 16 people to marry him in a matter of a couple hours. Mariah Carey really messed up upon taking the role of one of the woman. She had no personality or a sense of character at all.
