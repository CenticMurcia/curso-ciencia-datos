Deadwood is an amazing show. The only knock I could have against it is that you have to be really careful who you let watch it because it is not for family/children viewing at all. There is more swearing than I think in any other show I have ever seen, also there is nudity, sex, etc. Of course there is violence as well. The performances in this show are amazing whoever did the casting for this show hit the nail on the head with every single character they cast for. The actors are all totally believable in every role on this show. The writing is also very good it is simply a great show that mature audiences will probably really enjoy as long as they don't mind all the swearing etc. Not for everyone but great for those who can stomach the violence, swearing and so forth.
