Having seen the Broadway musical on the New York stage as well as several touring companies and local productions, I fell in love with the music, characters, costumes and choreography. I have the 1959 film version on VHS and DVD. While I was disappointed that some of the songs from the stage version had been deleted like "Love In A Home" and "Progress Is The Root Of All Evil" with one added that was written especially for the movie, it's still one of my favorite musicals. Peter Palmer is fantastic as "Li'l Abner"! Edie Adams is replaced from the Broadway production by Leslie Parrish as "Daisy Mae" Unfortunately Charlotte Rae was not cast as "Mammy Yoakam". Paramount finally released it on DVD April 19, 2005. About time!
