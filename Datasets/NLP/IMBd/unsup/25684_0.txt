This movie really opened my eyes to the world of nail gun slaughter. I really had no idea that you could die from being shot in the arm with a nail gun. Totally blew my mind. And they had a song in this movie about the game that had the bible belt up in arms, we know it as FOOSBALL. They were so cheap they used it twice in a row on the radio they had on. This movie also revealed to me the fact that if you have snow camo on in the spring, a motorcycle helmet with black tape over the face mask, and a nail gun with a bright yellow air hose, you can still sneak through the woods. Or just stand there in the open and not be seen. Oh yes, did I mention that the killer rolled in only the best of vehicles. Thats right, a crap colored hearse that screamed more that it was a grocery getter, than a body transporter. One thing I will say is that the Construction business should be up in arms over this one, this totally portrayed them as rapists and idiots. I for one would not stand for it. This is definitely one of those movies where somebody comes onto the screen and you have to ask, Now who the hell is this guy and where did he come from? Backstory is not this films strong point.<br /><br />In the end, was it fun to watch, of course. Would I watch it again, only if I had a six pack of killians and my friends with me. Let's check the scores...<br /><br />Body Count - High<br /><br />Nudity - LOTS<br /><br />Gore - sort of, nothing fulci would put his name on, EVER. To sum it up, chocolate syrup, ketchup, and rubber nails. Thats about it.<br /><br />Acting - Great, if you like bad acting from old folks.<br /><br />Fun Factor - Excellent, a movie thats so bad that you can rip it apart is always good in my book.<br /><br />I say, check out this movie if you're just out to watch something goofy. Chances are you'll be able to rent it for a buck.
