A pile of pompous, pretentious c**p. Oh, wait, it must be "artistic" then. <br /><br />There is no story as such, just some lame, shallow claim that two brothers are con-men. The only evidence of which is at the beginning of the movie when we are subjected to a long and lame story how they tricked some kids out of $30. Those painfully boring 10 min are supposed to be intro to the story, and to set suspense into character building... It does that, because it prepares you for the rest of incredibly shallow, stupid and devoid of any logic "creation" (can't really bring myself to call it a movie). <br /><br />This thing doesn't have a story. The writer is not intelligent and/or educated enough to put together more than 3 sentences that relate to each other. Oh, wait, then it must be "art", right. <br /><br />As for characters, most cartoons have more believable and explainable characters. It all goes something like this: "he is a con men... never mind how and why, just go with it because I say so, I'm not clever enough to think of a good con to corroborate the story... just go with it or else I don't have a movie!" The same applies for any other character trait you can think of. <br /><br />Logic and story flow... oh, wait, this "art", you are not suppose to have that. The mere fact that I'm mentioning those things must mean that I don't understand "art". This whole thing is so mind bogglingly stupid and shallow that you can just hear all those "artists" oooh-ing and uuuuuuh-ing about it. As for me, all I see are pathetic throws and twitches of a doped idiot who is trying to make a "deep" movie and is as good at it as a chronic alcoholic is at running 100m race. <br /><br />The mix of places, clothes, behaviour etc is another gem. The gang is going to Europe on a steamer (!) and our heroine arrives in her Lamborghini. And she lives a castle. In New Jersey. Ooooh, so deep and artistic. <br /><br />The trip from USA to Greece leads you pass the many snow-covered mountains. As we know, the ocean is full of them, as is the Greek coast. <br /><br />Our heroine is also very beautiful, incredibly rich, and lonely. As you would be, when you are young, beautiful and rich. <br /><br />The title suggests that the brothers last name is Bloom. Yet one is called Stephen (or something) and the other is called Bloom. So what is his full name - Bloom Bloom? Apparently it was too much of a mental effort for the writer to come up with another firs name. Oh, wait, it is artistic... <br /><br />The whole thing is just a slide show of mind flashes of some idiot who doesn't have enough imagination, education and life experiences to make it even mildly entertaining. Imagine your 50 year old spinster aunt showing you postcards of places she would like to have gone to and romances she would like to have had. <br /><br />Etc, etc, etc... one could write about how stupid this thing is for a long time. But that would be just more waste of time and life, discussing somebody's pathetic, impotent attempt to be "creative" and "artistic". Compared to this, even certified c**p like Paris Hilton movies is more entertaining and logical. Scarry thought, I know, but if you manage to sit through this pile of brown stuff as I had to, you will see what I mean.
