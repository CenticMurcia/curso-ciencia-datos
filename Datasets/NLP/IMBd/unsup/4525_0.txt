Judging by the user ratings, which generally seem to me to reflect a very young taste, this movie should have an age warning. However, as a person over 50, I found it delightful, charming, and touching. Jeffrey Tambor is a brave and always interesting actor, and Jill Clayburgh is one of the best American screen actresses - and still sexy at 54. Bill Duke is as cool as it gets, and Sandy Duncan leads a solid supporting cast. The film is better when it plays it straight than when it goes for laughs (the final scene is a bit strained), but there is one extended bit where Clayburgh attacks a dildo - which is hilarious.<br /><br /> If you're, say, 35 or over - see this! Otherwise, tell your parents to see it.
