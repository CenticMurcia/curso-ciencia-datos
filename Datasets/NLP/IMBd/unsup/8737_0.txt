I too have seen the movie many years ago and my husband has actually said that it was a great inspiration to him and has created the man he is today. I have been searching for a copy for many years as well and have been severely disappointed that the archives won't copy the one that they have and sell copies of it. Wouldn't you think that if you were part of a movie and people were specifically asking for that movie to re-released then something could be done.There were other movies of equal Australian bloke etiquette value like The Odd Angry Shot and The Last of The Knucklemen and it's a shame that one of the mighty lot is missing.<br /><br />If anyone does get a copy I'd like one too so please contact me.
