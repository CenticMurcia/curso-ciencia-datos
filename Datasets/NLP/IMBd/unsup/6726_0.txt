When first looking at the trailer, I did not have much high hopes for this film. I was thinking maybe a cross between Antz and try to be cute bugs life. However, the second I popped in the DVD, I realized that this movie was different. The story tells of a bee named Barry who questions what he wants to do as a job. As the pressure increases, he decides to leave the hive and meets Renee zelwegger's (sorry for the spelling) character, who actually shows him true friendship. Despite some little boring moments in the film, I found that it was humorous and a nice ride as you join Barry and his fellow bees soar into the sky. So don't take negative reviews to seriously, this movie is actually worth the watch, maybe even with your kids or little brothers, sisters, and or even relatives. Its fun, interesting and even provides a positive message that some people underestimate. If your still thinking of watching it, think like a bee.
