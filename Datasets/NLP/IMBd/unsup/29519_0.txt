Is this a bad drama, or is this brilliant satire? Yes it was stupid, on the surface, but as I watched this and muttered about how badly they're acting, and what cheesy dialogue, it made me think of Serial Mom. Serial Mom worked because we knew what we were getting into when the film was released, but since there was no real clue in the promos, it was baffling - and I love that. The audience was being teased.<br /><br />Best part of the movie - Shannon Lawson as the picture-perfect neighbor from hell - fake self-effacing humor, constant quotes, big smiles, while her daughter skulks silently in the background. We all could sense the opening ticks of a time bomb, but when Janis's ex-husband drops their daughter off at home, Janis pulls up in - WHAT ELSE - an SUV, charges at the two of them at the gate and just goes off on her poor ex, while yanking the kid and practically throwing her back in the van.<br /><br />The macho soccer coach broke me up, too. The scene where he's accused of having sex with team members' moms had me rolling on the floor. Of course it's a TV-movie clich√©, but it was still fun to watch, just like this whole movie is. Now, would I clamor for a Criterion Collection edition? No. I would, however, love to see the outtakes, the "making-of" footage. The cast must've had a wild time on the set.
