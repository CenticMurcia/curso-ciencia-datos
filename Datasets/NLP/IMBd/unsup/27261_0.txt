This is my favourite DVD among the three "work of director" series, which also include Spike Jonze and Chris Cunningham. <br /><br />Michel Gondry is truly a genius, as inventive a video artist can get. I always saw him as a child in an adult body, and that's a compliment because only children can come up with such vivid imagination while exploring their world. But somehow, when we grow up, we loose that instant creativity, the kind of naive curiosity that drives children to filter Reality. Life simply gets the best out of us with its endless routine and repetitive patterns. How many times do you get to see some old cartoons you adored when you were little, and somehow you get disappointed and tell yourself "It sucks!"<br /><br />Michel Gondry is one the most awarded music video and commercial directors, he is a gifted artist who's never afraid to try new things. He has such an avant-garde view and creativity, the kind of videos you just stare at in awe and wonder "How the hell did they do that" (e.g. the Fell in Love with a girl video.) Some of his techniques are truly brilliant, yet when you look closely, every bright child could have come up with the same ideas.<br /><br />This is a must-have for every Gondry fan, as well as those who are looking for many hours of creative inspiration & fun.
