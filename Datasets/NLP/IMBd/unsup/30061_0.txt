First, i´m not Leo`s fun. I think he is one of very talented young actors, but after Titanic had no chance to prove it. Earlier i saw the movie, only after that i have red the book. What i like in this movie is that everytime i watch it i feel like Richard. It could be so funny to escape of civilization, find your own paradise island and live there until the end of my life /but only with a girl like francoise/. I also love exteriors of this movie, great work of camera, absolutely perfect soundtrack and acting of some of the actors/Robert Carlyle, Tilda Swinton - she is exactly as Sal in the book/. My dislike of this movie is that it doesn´t know what it want to say. Is it lookin´for a real life ? Or to show how interests of group are more than life of its member ? Eight stars is very much, but six for movie and two for beauty of Thailand and Virginie Ledoyen sounds better. You should certainly see it and make your own opinion.
