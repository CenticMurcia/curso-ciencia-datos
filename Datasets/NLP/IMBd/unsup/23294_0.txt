Although Catherine Deneuve is not the star of this film, anything with her in it is surely worth seeing. The main actors -- Sandrine Bonnaire, Oleg Menshikov, and Sergei Bodrov, Jr. -- acquit themselves quite well in this tale about a Soviet emigre (Menshikov) who commits<br /><br />the terrible error of returning to the Soviet Union after World War II, bringing his French wife (Bonnaire) and their young son. The rest of the movie is largely about their difficult life and her all-consuming desire to return to France after they quickly discover that life in the Soviet Union is grim and that they are suspect. Deneuve appears as a fellow-traveling French actress who eventually makes it possible for Bonnaire to return home after she's spent six years in prison for helping a young man she befriended to escape the country. Bonnaire is startlingly good and Menshikov as the deluded doctor who brought his<br /><br />family back to the Soviet Union is also excellent.
