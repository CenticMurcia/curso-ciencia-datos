It goes without saying now (but of course I will say) that I and many others don't merely enjoy, "love", are engrossed by, adore, are awestruck and stunned by, etc. etc. etc., the writing, the directing, the staging, the performance, the concept, the amazing dialogue and soliloquies by Al, Bullock, Jane, Doc, Farnum, Utter, et al., and on and on. If you haven't seen "Deadwood" (I find it hard to believe that anyone who has come to this site hasn't) you MUST.<br /><br />The comparisons to Shakespeare are accurate, and "Deadwood" is in the nature of that era's play cycles. The spicy, descriptive, and even florid speech is accurate in its spirit, as was Shakespeare's in his day. I am old enough to have had, and been intimidated by at close quarters for many years, a quite "proper" great-grandmother who lived and taught English on the frontier (in Nebraska in her case) - born 1867, died 1956. Her (and my genteel grandmother's, and my refined mother's) frequently used expletives included the likes of "Judas Priest" Â– indicating that the most dire and terrifying consequences were impending. Other invectives and exclamations similarly invoked the deity, or were inspired by classical literature, the Bible, and popular song, and are now incomprehensible to us. These have simply been "translated" for us, where necessary, or conveyed to us "as is" when they still make scatological sense today.<br /><br />This could easily be one of, if not THE, greatest accomplishment in Modern American Theatre (it IS theatrical), and even in contemporary Literature. (I predict the scripts and performances will be studied in future college-level English Lit, Theatre/Drama, and Humanities classes.) But "Deadwood" will go out with a whimper, flawed and disappointingly ended due to HBO's (and Milch's) failure to see it through as projected and called-for by its very Art.<br /><br />Though "Deadwood" has become probably the greatest experiment (note the "ex" in that word!) in TV, it will unfortunately soon pass into the world of "might have been" without a satisfactory and worthy end. As most of you likely know, the sets have been struck, and the cast and crew will not be returning (at least as of this date) for a fourth season, as had been promised and anticipated in order to bring the cycle to an appropriate close. While as a portrayal of a moment in time, time and the world continue after the show ends, no matter when that is, the end of this third season will conclude with only the vague prospect of maybe (and that's a BIG maybe!) a 2-hour movie, or maybe 2 2-hour movies, sometime in the uncommitted future.<br /><br />If you care, please register your protest with HBO. You might even look up "Save 'Deadwood'" to see what's up. Enough from minuscule me; just watch, appreciate and try to save the incredible, always amazing, phenomenon (and justly so) that is "Deadwood". Please, please, please.
