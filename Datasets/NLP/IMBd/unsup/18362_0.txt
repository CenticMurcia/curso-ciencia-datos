August Rush may have the happiest ending in movie history. See it and judge for yourself.<br /><br />While far from a perfect movie, it is perfectly entertaining for folks like me who don't mind getting lost in the film's world.<br /><br />The script goes beyond belief at almost every turn but when we're talking about the world's greatest young orphan musician being reunited with his parents- who cares? The only distress I felt was the dreadful appearance of Robin Williams, I think it has gotten to the point where the only character he can plausibly play is himself.<br /><br />I almost never see films twice but will definitely see this one again (maybe even again today) as it is about the music and the spirit, not the plot or the performances.
