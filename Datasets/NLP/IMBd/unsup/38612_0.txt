I give this show a 3 for what they are attempting to do. I watched this show for a full season every night. It was my job to watch certain t.v. shows and then write a synapses for my film class. I would sit by my t.v. every night, boot up my Tivo and begin watching. I went through the semester and finished the season. I would be forced to break down the plot lines (when they existed) the humor which was being pushed upon everyone. but i had to do it in a neutral view. In the end I received a high A on my paper about the show. after class my professor asked if i enjoyed the show. At that moment I was at a loss for words, though I had watched the show night after night, and I fully understood it, I couldn't truly say I enjoyed it. There where some parts of the show occasionally that would make me laugh a little, or might make me stop and think for a moment (public access part) but most of the time I did not even care that I was watching TV. To me it wasn't something I could enjoy. I honestly dislike the show so much now that I can't even let my TV be on AS while i am doing something else. I know there are some die hard fans of this show out there, but don't think just because someone doesn't like the show doesn't mean they don't get it. once you have been in a play of the bizarre. There isn't much comically that you can't understand. My comedians are Robbin Williams stand up, George Carlin, Lewis black, and some Emo Philips, so attack there if you will. I think this show is horrible, I hope I never see it again, and i have lost faith in adults swim for putting it on.
