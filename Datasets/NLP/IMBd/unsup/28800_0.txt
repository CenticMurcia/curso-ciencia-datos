A rather uninspired but harmless enough movie that goes around the world and back again to establish its goofy premise. Even for movies from this time period this one stretches the boundaries of credibility. Cary Grant gets many chances to show off his flair for physical comedy, Shirley Temple is no less grating as a young adult than she was as a child, and Myrna Loy (who I watched this for) is in the movie a lot, but never given very much to do. I've long since decided that Myrna Loy was one of the most underused actresses of her time. I'm still looking for a film that really allows her to strut her stuff ("The Thin Man" is the closest I've come to finding one).<br /><br />Grant fans will probably enjoy this one because there's really nothing to dislike exactly, but fans of Loy may be disappointed.<br /><br />Grade: C
