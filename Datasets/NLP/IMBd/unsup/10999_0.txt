Having read much of the criticism and praise of others commenting on "Get Real", there really isn't much that I can say that hasn't been said elsewhere.<br /><br />I would like to comment on the criticism that the dialogue was poor. Teens never talk in most films like they do amongst one another. Here, to a good degree, they do. The actors weave brilliantly between the awkward clumsiness and bold cockiness that most teens display. It isn't tiresome at all, it's refreshing and interesting. There is also a great amount of communication that isn't purely driven by dialogue and it's exceptional between the two main players. <br /><br />If you'd like to see a super film, with flawless acting all around, this is a delightful portrayal of two boys at very different places where self-acceptance is concerned. It certainly raises the bar on gay genre films to something that should be enjoyable to the general public.<br /><br />My only criticism is that the music is rather standard fare.
