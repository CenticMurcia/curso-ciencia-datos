Which is to say, it's not high art and doesn't pretend to be. This film is like McDonald's. You know the food isn't going to be all that great and it isn't going to be good for you, but you still leave satisfied. The Cannonball Run is pure entertainment and, in the end, isn't that all you really want in a film is to be entertained? If you want a film to change the world then keep sending Michael Moore your money. this film is about star power, laughs, and car chases. Most of all, look at the fun the cast is having. It clearly shows on screen that the whole cast is having a blast and nobody is taking anything too seriously. If you have any doubts, just watch the bloopers that run during the closing credits to see how much fun they had. If you doubt me, I'll have to stick these rosary "bleeds" up your nose.
