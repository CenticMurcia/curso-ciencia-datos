This Movie is a piece of musical and youth history, it shows the age of musical and personal discovery that the youth of the time embraced as they threw off the yoke of their parents morals and duty to country.<br /><br />As they found they had a voice that mattered. much of it is voiced in the music of that era as it too was new and so very fresh.<br /><br />no one played a guitar the way Hendrix or Alvin Lee did with Ten Years After. Just wait till you see Alvin Lee's stage presence, it's magical. The movie shows a time that opened the door for all the 'Pop,Rock Blues' music we all know. The movie is an example of a formative time we almost lost.
