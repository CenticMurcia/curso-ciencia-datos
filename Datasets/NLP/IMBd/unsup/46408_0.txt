Uhm...... this is to horror movies what blair witch was to credible journalism.<br /><br />I don't mind these guys taking a camera and goofing off... bringing copies around the office, but when you go to this extreme to b.s. people into watching your day off with a video camera... I just *hope* no one buys a copy of this. <br /><br />Cool... they even put themselves on this website. <br /><br />I miss the days when IMDb wasn't bastardized by this kind of b.s. But I guess integrity is as rare as talent. Compare this to a near zero budget indie film like "In the woods" by Sam Raimi.
