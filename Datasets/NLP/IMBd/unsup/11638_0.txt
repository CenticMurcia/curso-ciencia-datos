This is the very last film included with the GRIFFITH'S MASTERWORKS DVD set from Kino Video. And, after seeing 22 other shorts, I noticed a lot of the previous films in this 30 minute film (that's very long for one of these shorts, by the way). It was highly reminiscent of both THE BATTLE OF ELDERBUSH GULCH and THE LAST DROP OF WATER--two other Western shorts he made in 1913 and 1911--as they were all about Indian massacres of White settlers. Plus, like both these two films and DEATH'S MARATHON and THE MOTHERING HEART, it's about what happens AFTER a woman is pursued by two suitors and marries one of them.<br /><br />In this film, we are treated to the obligatory "will you marry me scene" with the two male leads. And, after choosing one, the other becomes a Cavalry scout who just happens to be involved in a raid on an Indian village. The Indians are understandably ticked and attack the nearby settlers--and guess who is among them?! Yep, the lady and her new hubby. While a very derivative film, it's final scene in which practically everyone is massacred is very unique and worth seeing. Not a great film, but still pretty good.
