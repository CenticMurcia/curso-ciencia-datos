This movie is horrible. I have never seen a more boring film in my life, and I know that boredom is the draw for many horror purists to examine this film and dissect it for some level of substance that the short attention span-having trash-lovers may have missed. Yes, this is a zombie film, but it's a thinking-man's zombie film, I guess. But I must be ridiculously stupid, because I missed the point.<br /><br />This film is just seriously a bad time. The first few minutes are good enough, with a good film score. From the start, you begin to sense that this is an atmospheric film that may lose you in its boredom sometimes but still maintain enough of an edge to hold you for the near-2 hour running length. Fulci gets a lot of credit for "atmosphere", and I have to agree: Even when his films lacked a plot or a point, movies like Gates of Hell were just amazing because they gave off this weird, uncomforting feeling. Being able to get away on just feeling and not actually substance is one of the greatest achievements I've ever seen. You manage to make your film good, even if it isn't good.<br /><br />Well, indeed, this film is atmospheric. However, that hardly makes up for the sheer boredom of the whole thing. When you look at the box of this movie, you expect something in the way of zombies, zombie action, at least some mention of zombies. However, there is approximately two minutes of any zombies being in the movie at all. Sure, there are dead bodies, but hardly any zombies. I want ZOMBIES! I think that perhaps this film is some kind of experiment to make the viewer feel like a zombie. Watching the immense amounts of talking and little else, I just stared on and on and on, waiting for something to happen. And people kept talking and talking. Uh... yeah. Horrid.
