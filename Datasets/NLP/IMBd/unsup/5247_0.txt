Wing Commander was one of the first real interactive movies when the third installment was released in 94, it pushed the boundaries for graphics, acting and storyline into uncharted heights for a video game. Critics argued that the game was just a movie in disguise, now 5 years later the movie is finally here.<br /><br />I had fairly high expectations for this movie, since Chris Roberts the creator of the original game series, spearheaded the project. The storyline of the games could have easily been adapted to fit a full length movie, but instead they opted to change almost everything. <br /><br />The acting isn't great, although it's not downright awful - it's close. The characters are very stale, making it hard for viewers to relate to them. A central character could be killed off and you wouldn't really care, the emotional flow from the screen to the viewer is virtually nonexistent.<br /><br />As almost every one else has pointed out, the ships! they look like WWII fighters, and the carrier looks like a submarine - what's up with that ???<br /><br />I can only think of one positive thing in this movie: the state of the ships, no chrome and gloss, they looked beat up and worn out, kind of like the millennium falcon in Star Wars... but that's it.<br /><br />Wing Commander stands as one of the few epic computer games. As a movie on the other hand, it's not worth remembering.
