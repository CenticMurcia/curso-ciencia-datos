A story about a grown-up pair of Siamese twin brothers - one does wonder. "Twin Falls Idaho" is a quiet yet possibly disturbing film (only if one is uncomfortable with the idea of looking at a pair of conjoined twins' physical features, which was actually only subtly featured). It is thought provoking and calmly sentimental. Well-written, acted, and just the right dosage, I felt. <br /><br />It's a tender story about brotherly love, man and woman young love, sons and motherly love - full of humanity. The natural delivery of everyone in the movie, including Penny's friend, the doctor who gave a routine check up on the twins - there's a casualness and ease to his brief performance. Michele Hicks somehow fits perfectly into the role of Penny - there's just the enough measure of beauty and heart demonstrated by her acting. There's also her low voice, the way she talks; her lean figure, the way she walks. Along with the ever fascinating to watch Leslie Ann Warren, 'tis blessed casting. The Polish brothers are themselves remarkable. How they delivered such poignant sensitivity about a pair of attached Siamese twins, when they themselves were not, is amazing. Michael Polish directed this script that he wrote with brother Mark. <br /><br />It's not Hollywood, not action movie. It is independent film flavor. It has no glamour - it does have some artistic camera angles and a dreamlike flashback sequence. But it is an intriguing film to experience, at its own pace, without rushing anything. The tone and mood, and the dim photography might suggest otherwise, but there is suspense and a secret to unfold. It all comes together naturally, with its slow dance. Its ending? Go see for yourself - it's an experience that would worth your while.<br /><br />Applause to the Polish Brothers and everyone involved in the production of this film.
