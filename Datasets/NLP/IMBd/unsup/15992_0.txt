February 14 isn't any different from the many sappy love stories that have existed in various cultures for centuries. and this movie is no exception. In this modern-day,the movie is set in in the hill stations of India, a fictitious decaying urban location.<br /><br />The action really starts when hero falls in love with heroine who is a abroad born girls where she never likes to stay in India... hero tries to keep her in India as to convey his true I've to her The most brilliant aspect of the movie is the urban landscape setting, the lighting, and the cinematography. The movie is also funny at times, and director's direction is excellent. The acting is mixed: hero and heroine don't generate any chemistry on the screen, and further, they appear to have fundamental problems managing the love dialog. In fact, I thought many of the performers were unable to deliver the dialog effectively and convincingly and I think this is the biggest flaw in the movie. It is as if the performers themselves don't understand what they're saying and are just reciting lines from memory.<br /><br />The best performance is by hero who uses the dialog in a convincing manner to make the audience laugh and to generate empathy when he is crying. <br /><br />this is movie can be called as one of the best romantic movie and its great movie and a must watch movie
