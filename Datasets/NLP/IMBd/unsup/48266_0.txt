For lack of better things to watch, we stumbled on this movie the other night on cable. Wow! If action is your thing, this film will be for you. There must be killings every five minutes. In fact, we are worried when there are no shootings in the background!<br /><br />Charles T. Kanganis wrote and directed this movie that has a woman detective at the center of the story. Vickie, is a tough cookie (no pun intended). She might look blonde and vulnerable, but just don't mess around with her. The fact that Vickie is basically standing up as the film ends is a testament to Tracy Lords' masochism.<br /><br />The bad guys come and go, yet, Vickie is able to avoid being shot, or have her hair messed during the worst of the action. The action is too intense at times as the Latin gangsters show to be ruthless in the way they settle disputes.<br /><br />Watch this film for the pure fun of watching the action. Otherwise, don't bother.
