This movie is finally coming out it the US!!!!! I have been waiting for this movie forever. The first Goal movie was one of my favorite movies of all time. I love football(soccer) and after having to watch so many baseball movies I am happy to finally have a movie series about the sport that I like and play. It really is an inspiring story about believing in yourself and triumphing over adversity. The characters are developed nicely and the love story is even handled in a very good way and does not feel tacked on like it does in so many other sports movies. <br /><br />Santiago comes from Los Angeles to Newcastle and then plays at the world famous Real Madrid. My favorite player David Beckham is in this movie too. We were not lucky enough for "Zidane a 21st Century portrait" to come out in the US so this is your only chance to see Zidane in film. Come on and support proper football in the US and see this movie!!!
