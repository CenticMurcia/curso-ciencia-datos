This film is noteworthy for two reasons. #1. Maggie Q is topless and looks smoking hot. #2. The film was shot by Cinematographer Derek Wan (Fist of Legend) in High Definition using the Sony 1080p High definition cameras. Numerous films are shot this way now, including the last two Star Wars films, Once Upon A Time In Mexico and Sin City.<br /><br />The script for this film is problematic and there are gaping plot holes and scenes that will cause you to roll your eyes, but it is still watchable because of the photography, the genre and of course, Maggie Q, who will be seen soon in Mission Impossible 3. She is super hot and is turning into quite the actress.
