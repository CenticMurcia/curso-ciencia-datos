1950's Sci-Fi had a bunch of movies based on the notion of giant insects that creep us out in the small version scaring the bejeebers out of us in the large version. There were some good examples of this, most notably "Them", about Giant Ants from the nuclear test ranges.<br /><br />This was one of the less successful version. Essentially, the guy who played Jock Ewing on Dallas sends a queen wasp into space to see what atomic radiation would do to it, and it lands in Africa, where they grow to be as big as semis and promptly kill everything in their path.<br /><br />So what follows is stock footage of African Wildlife as filler, bad stop motion animation as filler, endless trekking through the imaginary African Savana as filler. And in the end, the giant wasps are killed by a stock footage volcano that just happened to go off at the right time... Good thing those giant wasps could FLY like real wasps, eh? <br /><br />What a total waste of time.
