Even my low expectations of just another predictable self-serving, gay-for-gay's-sake, "comedy" weren't met. Astoundingly bad in pretty much every way. Yet not absurd enough to be unintentionally-funny on the order of Uwe Boll films. Other than exactly 3 genuinely-funny moments, and a surprisingly-hot sex scene, there is pretty much nothing to enjoy about Eating Out. It manages to be neither a good romantic comedy nor a good porn.<br /><br />Some Falcon and a copy of Roman Holiday will serve for a much more fulfilling evening.<br /><br />Like any minority, we gays tend to latch onto things that cater to our group. Let's not further taint that already-questionable process with schlock like this.
