In a nutshell - the movie is bad. For example: M.Bison is a Blondie and not even a menacing one - i still wonder who has been hired as the casting director of that crappy movie. I'm talking about Transporter 3 bad. Chris Klein is even more annoying than that red haired chick from T3. From the very first scene you see him you either think he is drunk or in the "zone". This movie is not even worth watching on DVD, let alone on basic cable. To give you an idea how awful it is - i rather watch a movie with Paris Hilton.<br /><br />plot - bad, screenplay - really bad, acting - contender for all Razzie Awards...overall i'd like to give it 0 out of 10 stars. Unless they get John Woo or Tsui Hark behind the camera don't bother producing another Street Fighter movie.
