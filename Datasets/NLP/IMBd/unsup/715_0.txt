This is an *excellent* movie!!!!!<br /><br />It's a Billy Crystal movie so I knew I would like it, but this was wonderful!!!!! I would recommend to anyone (17 or over)!!!!<br /><br />It was one of those movies that you just don't want to end.<br /><br />I'm sorry to those of you who didn't like it because of the language but it is rated R and it has Robert De Niro, what do you expect?? I've never seen a De Niro film that didn't have F*** in it.<br /><br />Anyway, Billy Crystal is the FUNNIEST MAN ALIVE!!!!! And De Niro was PERFECT for the part!!!!<br /><br />
