I am so much surprised when i see that this movie takes 7.7.It deserves much much over it.It is certainly in my top 10. Excellent characters, flawless scenario and a wonderful end. It is my first comment on this page and this movie is actually the reason why i am registered...You will for sure question your life after u watch it. This movie is not only to have a nice evening but also to question your life. The center of the movie is "Carpe diem" (sieze the life), which a few of us can achieve in these days. When i feel that my life is not going on as I wish, I am always re-watching this masterpiece. It always works on me. I suggest you, whatever your age is, to buy and watch this movie. You will not be regretful. Believe me. This movie is just PERFECT
