As someone who has been dancing all her life and is now a dance teacher and a writer for a dance magazine, I must say that this movie SUCKED!!!! What a joke!! Doug Varone and Desmond Richardson, two incredibly respected artists, what are you DOING involved in this crap?? Patrick Swayze and the woman are so unbelievably over the top, their acting is just ridiculous. And the dancing isn't even good, the choreography is hysterically bad, and the cinematography leaves you unable to even see the movement.<br /><br />If you are a dancer, get your dancer friends together, get wasted and have a great laugh with this unbelievable joke of a movie. Especially if you are anti- a lot of contemporary modern crap that's out there right now, you'll die laughing.
