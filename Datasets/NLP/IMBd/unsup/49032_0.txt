SPY HARD starts with an in joke of having Mr T pilot a helicopter and that`s about as sophisticated as the film gets . It`s a spy spoof with refferances to IN THE LINE OF FIRE , SPEED , PULP FICTION etc and even includes a sly nod to FELLOWSHIP OF THE THE RING years before that movie was filmed ! . Leslie Nielson does his Frank Drebin routine under the surrogate name of Dick Steel . It`s entertaining enough but does get very silly in places and never gets close to the hilarity of THE NAKED GUN series
