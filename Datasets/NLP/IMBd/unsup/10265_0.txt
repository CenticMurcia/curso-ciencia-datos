I was 16 when Then Came Bronson was broadcast, but I still vividly remember moments from 6 or 7 of the episodes.<br /><br />Maybe it was that I'd never seen that kind of delicacy and sweetness in performance before--and rarely since--nothing "thrilling," nothing forced, nothing fey, nothing indulgent--just careful observations and filled moments. At least, that's how I describe it now. Nothing was underlined; I never felt like I was being told how to react.<br /><br />Over the years, I'd think, is it possible that show was really that good? Nice to know some people agree with me.<br /><br />And some of you really have all the episodes on DVD?
