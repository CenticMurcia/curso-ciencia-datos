The sequel to the Steeve Reeves version of Hercules, Hercules Unchained starts where its prequel left off. Hercules, Ulyses, and his new wife, Iole, go on some mission to settle a dispute between two brothers who wants to rule Thebes. However, on the way, Hercules drinks the so called " Waters of Forgetfullness" and forgets who he is and is seduced by this queen,and she falls in love with Hercules. However, Ulyses helps Herc regain his memory and escapes the island where the queen subsides in (by the way, the queen commits suicide, but anyway). Meanwhile, Iole, Herc's wife, gets captured by one of the brothers and threatens to kill her. Hercules and his group finally save Iole in a battle to the death by both of the brother's sides. In the end, both brothers die, Herc is reunited with his wife, and they live happily ever after.Well not exactly, but they lived ever after.<br /><br />This is the second and hopefully, I think, last sequel to the Hercules series. The movie felt like an eternity. It took so long for Herc to finally get off that island! In fact, Herc was on that island for 40 minutes, long for an 1 1/2 hour movie. The song. Oh god that was awful. And one last thing. It was boring. There wasn't much action, and when there was action, it didn't last long, and it was fake.Thank god MST3K was there to make it enjoyable! I want to thank all of the people who made this B- bomb possible. Steve Reeves, the Herc. The other cast members. Pietro Franscisi, the director. Mitchell Parish, the person who wrote that dreaded song. And the two producers, Feruccio De Martiono and Bruno Vailati. Thank you all! P.S. If you're thinking of making another sequel, heres a tip. Don't!
