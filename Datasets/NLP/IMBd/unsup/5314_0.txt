A lot of films about subject of alienation were made. I imagine there is this kind of film that would be overtly depressing and boring for first 80% of the time on purpose, just to caliberate audience's mind-set, similiar to cleaning the palate, so the final 20% would really make some impression. <br /><br />Most of them failed. However for "all or nothing", after almost 2 hours of watching indifferently, near the end of the film I was crying with my whole body shaking (good thing it's an afternoon showing and only 10 ppl in the theatre). I cry like this only once 2 or 3 years, I think last time was in 1999. Yeah, I got chocked up every now and then, but not like this, this is weeping. And afterwards I felt as relax as just had s3x.<br /><br />The film was unfocused for quite a while, I personally think the teenager love stories can be cut at least by half. But again I am not sure since without the seemly depressing wandering "distractions", I might not be touched as deeply as I was.<br /><br />Your enjoyment is greatly depend on your experience, I suspect. To me some of the dialog is just like taken out of my family conversation when I was a kid. People worry about money and job and kids, so much so that they forgot each other's feelings. <br /><br />
