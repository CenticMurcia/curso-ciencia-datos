And I can see why. I just rented this on a whim, expecting it to be some funny cheese horror and it wasn't even that. What you have here is a stupid concept at an attempt at a goofy horror movie that doesn't even make one laugh.<br /><br />Uncle Sam Harper comes back from the dead (and we don't even know how) and starts killing a few town locals in his attempt to come back for his nephew Jody. <br /><br />Very stupid movie, effects suck, killings are pretty much ripoffs from other movies (hedgeclippers, Friday the 13th) burying alive, many others) anyway stay away from this piece of crap, the best thing about this movie is the holographic cover that the video comes in. I can only give it a 2 for one good butt shot, as a peeping tom on stilts stares into a window<br /><br />2/10
