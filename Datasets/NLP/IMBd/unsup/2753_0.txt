Good to play as a game but not very interesting storyline. Fun to play but if you want a fun storyline with great graphics and gameplay then you need 007: nightfire. Its weird because you don't get to meet the characters or know their personalities or anything. its just oh hello *bang* *bang* *drive* *drive* *kill* *kill*. nothing pretty much to do. its very easy as well. like when you have to defeat a weird clone you jut have to shoot him 2 times if you have a shotgun or "frinensi". The driving is weird too. its like you have all these weird gadgets which don't help you out at all with you mission. its like they are there for decoration. When i first bought this game it was a million miles from where i lived and so i brought it home and tryed to play it but wouldn't work and i couldn't go and take it back either. so i was stuck with it and so today when i bought it i played through the first mission and i was so excited because i thought that it would be like that for the entire first level but no it completely changed the level after. so i say if you wan to waste your money go right ahead but if yuor looking for a good game steer away from this one.
