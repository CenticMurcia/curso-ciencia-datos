Forgive an old westerner for the iconoclasm of comparing a Chinese movie to a Japanese cultural phenomenon. I'm round-eyed, I can't help it. But this movie reminded me of the good old days, when I used to read "Dragonball" the Manga - before the same manga became overly stupid and boring and went too far with the whole "there's always a stronger enemy" thing. Back in the day, Dragonball was a quirky, funny, cartoony romp through martial arts. And so is this movie. It's a pleasure to watch. Just don't expect realism... the movie had a strange impact on me - it seemed predictable in retrospect, but it was nothing of the sort, while I was watching it. In fact, it effortlessly turned corners I didn't really see were there, all the while regularly introducing new interesting and colorful characters for our entertainment.
