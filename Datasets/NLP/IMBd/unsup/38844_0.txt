The cinematography is spectacular and unlike many others I enjoyed the soundtrack, but this is a Titanically boring "adventure." A Man and a Boy, trying to outrun the Apocalypse, wander into danger, hide, whisper, cower, run, escape ... then wander into new danger (and repeat steps 2,3,4,5 and 6). Between dangers, the Boy cryptically asks the Man colossally significant questions ("Are we the good guys?" ... "Would we ever eat people?"), and the Man reassures the Boy with all the right answers. And they gaze into each other's face for hours and hours it seems at a variety of camp fires on their trek to the sea. After about a half-dozen mainly implausible dangers, uninteresting escapes, pretty camp fires, and lame father-son heart-to-hearts, plus one tableau of emaciated prisoners awaiting to be eaten, I was looking at my watch, preferring to stick a fork in my eye than see one more faux-frightening episode. For me, the only superlative for "The Road" is it is the most unlikable movie I've seen.
