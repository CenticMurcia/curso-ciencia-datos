If this film does not make you angry, then you have no feelings whatsoever. This is the first film made in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban. It shows the oppressive life of women under the Taliban. They are not allowed to go to school, hold jobs, or be allowed in public without a male escort. This movie tells the story of a girl who must disguise herself as a boy in order to get a job so her family can buy food. If she is caught, she would most likely be put to death for breaking the law. It is amazing that such things still exist in today's world. This movie is a warning that there must be no more regimes such as the Taliban in Afghanistan. I hope this film will prompt people around the world to demand that women have basic rights such as the right to vote, to go out in public, and to dress however they please no matter what country they live in.
