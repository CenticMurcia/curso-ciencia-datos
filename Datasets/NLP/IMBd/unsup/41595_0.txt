On the cover of my DVD it says: "Will make American Pie fade in comparison". What? No way. This is absolutely the worst movie ever. If American Pie is a 100, then this one gets a 2. Please don't go and see this, or the producers might think you liked it and make a sequel. And a sequel might mess up the way we watch movies for generations to come...
