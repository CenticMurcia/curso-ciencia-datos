I felt a gap between the movie itself, and the closing credits in which later history about the Madam Sata character is narrated along with film clips of Rio Carnival. That gap is a jagged edge for me, and yet I cannot propose a smoother ending or smoother inclusion of the personality of Madam Sata into the main.<br /><br />Other than that comment, I was caught into the excellent casting, direction and editing. The documentary seemed to be somewhat detached in time although we knew the inclusive dates as it covered multiple issues of race, prejudice, anger, bigotry, self-identity -- and all things that are experienced or tested by humans in sexual drive and satisfaction. <br /><br />It is in the latter that we definitely feel the struggle, violence, growth and pride of Joao Francisco dos Santos as a strongly driven heterosexual man that ultimately yields to his comfort in cross-dressing while maintaining a jagged, devoted relationship with Laurita and her/his child.<br /><br />Wonderful mosaic
