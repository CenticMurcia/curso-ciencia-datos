Around Christmas of last year I finally discovered the book It, written by Stephen King, and I couldn't put it down. It was one of the best books I had ever read. (I won't bother with the summary of the book/ movie because you've probably already read it.) I was pretty excited about the miniseries as well, which I had only heard about and never seen. I decided to rent It on Netflix in oder to get the best of both worlds, the silver screen and the book world. That proved to be a terrible mistake, as the miniseries was one of the worst adaptations ever made. Not only are the characters ill suited for their roles, almost every major plot point was edited out or completely changed. Most of the story was heavily filtered for TV, leaving little but the bare skeletal remains of the novel. When I say filtered I mean cut for time and for content - these changes were major errors, leaving the series with little support. Most of the miniseries is based off the creative writings of the screenwriter and not of Stephen King. What little there is left in this garbage they call a miniseries is a bunch of boring shots meant to be scary. The very material the director wanted to bring to a wider audience was destroyed, as was all decency of this movie. Even on a strictly miniseries basis, not even counting the disappointment of the failed adaptation, this movie flops. Shots are poorly filmed, there is little action or psychological terror, and the special effects are awful. Trust me, the book is amazing, but the adaptation is not, probably because Stephen King adaptations are almost impossible due to the mainly psychological aspects of the books. Save your time and rent The Shining, the only half decent adaptation of a Stephen King book.
