Guess Who was terrible. I guess I didn't expect it to be much better, having been almost dragged to the theater by some of my friends who seemed to think that the movie would actually be funny. <br /><br />I usually hate Ashton Kutcher movies but this one was the worst one I have seen. Bernie Mac was just as bad if not worse. It was just another movie to make fun of white people, (think Taxi). The whole movie was filled with jokes and only the tiniest amount of them were actually funny. The plot was so predictable and stupid.<br /><br />There is only room for a few good romantic comedies this year and this is not one of them.
