Serial Mom was witty funny and extremely exciting and suspenseful, along with being thoroughly entertaining. I expected to enjoy the film for many different reasons.; But after the opening 15 minutes of the film and breakfast seen. I knew this would end up being a film of high quality and laughter. The camera styles of the breakfast scenario made the scene go beyond capturing the reality millions of families experience in real time. just excellent.<br /><br />I found Kathleen Turner portraying the innocent, harmless killer, perfectly. The character came to life and seemed real. One of the best scenes thought, even I have to admit, was the very end scenario and expressions given between Kathleen Turner and Susan Summers for the closing scene which included Patricia Hearst; which only goes to show that even the most elegant and ravishing can not escape from bad fashion critics. Also Looking forward to seeing Patricia Hearst in longer more involved roles. A natural getting polished and learning to fly.<br /><br />I know I will receive many hours of pleasure from this film for I will see it again.<br /><br />D.A.T.
