Just saw "The Flyboys" at the Staten Island Film Festival opening night festivities. This film had an engaging story; it was action packed from the beginning to end; it was entertainment for all generations. What a great film - especially for families...no sex, no swearing, very little violence. Who missed all that stuff! The music enhanced the "drama" and theme of the various scenes. The acting by Sizemore and Baldwin was surprisingly good. Sizemore was the most likable wise guy since Tony "What's His Name." Major distributors would do well to pick this "indie" up for wider distribution. It's not often a family film has such wide appeal and solid storyline without being totally sappy.
