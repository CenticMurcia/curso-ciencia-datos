I had heard of this movie for quite some time, and had always been curious about it. The idea of watching the rock and roll legends in the studio, recording wonderful tunes, sounded intriguing. I finally got my hands on it, and I can totally understand why they only release the Let it Be, Hey Jude and Rooftop concert footage. <br /><br />From what I understand, this film was produced due to a contract deal that forced the Beatles into making five films, whether they wanted to or not. Following the disaster of the 'Magical Mystery Tour' film, it's no wonder the Beatles didn't take part in Yellow Submarine (which turned out to be a great film, second to A Hard Day's Night) I've read in various Beatle Biographies that Paul McCartney came up with the idea of having camera's installed in the studio. This turned out to be a bad idea.<br /><br />The Beatles are aware of the cameras, which puts them in a VERY awkward mood. Ringo Starr is silent for most of the time, John Lennon is also quiet and George Harrison seems to fuss with Paul when he speaks. Oh, I almost missed Paul. He speaks endlessly, and makes big broad gestures, pretending to be the genius that we know he is, but coming across as rather full of himself. Camera's are set up for him when he stages Let it Be and Hey Jude, where he is seen staring obsessively at the camera. The camera work is smooth, and very professional. However, when the other Beatles sing a song, the camera is less focused, and more candid. <br /><br />There is also constant, subtle bickering between Paul and George, and at times John. <br /><br />It is wonderful to watch, but very sad to see them act this way together, because I had such a nice picture of them in my mind before i saw this. NOW I KNOW WHY THEY BROKE UP!<br /><br />You'll enjoy the rooftop concert. That is the ONLY scene where all of them seem comfortable together. Well, there was a brief moment where Billy Preston showed up in the studio to play keyboards. They all behaved nicely at that point. I think it is mentioned in the Anthology video.<br /><br />Still, if you did music, you'll have a good time watching, even if Paul gets a little too full of himself.
