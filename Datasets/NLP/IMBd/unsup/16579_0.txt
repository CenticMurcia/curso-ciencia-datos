This is a delightful film about a Southern belle, Grace King Bichon<br /><br />(Julia Roberts), who chafes under the domination of her<br /><br />brook-no-dissent father, and is cheated on by her husband. Grace<br /><br />works for her father on his horse farm, and her suppressed<br /><br />resentment of his iron rule has likely helped derail her marriage to<br /><br />Eddie. In any event, the film is ultimately about the love and<br /><br />strength of family relationships and the power of forgiveness, as<br /><br />well as finding one's own path in life. All actors turn in great<br /><br />performances: Julia Roberts as the heroine and wronged wife;<br /><br />Robert Duvall as the family patriarch; Gena Rowlands as the<br /><br />beautiful and devoted spouse and mother; and Kyra Sedgwick as<br /><br />the transgressive sister. Dennis Quaid as Grace's philandering<br /><br />husband is very appealing, so it's hard not to be rooting for he and<br /><br />Grace to reconcile. Finally, good cinematography and a portrait of<br /><br />gracious Southern living make this film an enjoyable view.
