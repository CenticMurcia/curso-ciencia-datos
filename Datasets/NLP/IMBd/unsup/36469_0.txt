Country bumpkins try to find out what the hell has been causing all the recent accidents in town.<br /><br />With the help of several local dweebs, the dip sheriff reconstructs crime scenes but finds out nothing until a 'giant' gila monster stumbles back into the county looking for a midnight snack.<br /><br />Lowest point of the film is when one of the town's leading idiots tries to sing a stupid song while pathetically twanging a ukulele, first for a crippled little girl, then for a group of moronic teenagers. Too bad the gila doesn't eat every one of these slobs before the closing credits.<br /><br />Not worth the time... the U.S. Farm Report is more interesting than this.
