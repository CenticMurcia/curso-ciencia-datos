Is Don Cheadle a terrorist or an undercover operative? The suspense is killing absolutely no one. By the numbers thriller with predictable outcome. Cardboard characters, clumsy emotional manipulation, implausible storyline and clich√© twists weigh against decent production values, competent acting and a reasonably balanced portrayal of participants in the war on terror. Terrorist Thriller #0988047 should turn a moderate profit. Hey, Hollywood is a business so one can't fault the producers for not taking risks. Nevertheless, it'd be nice if they threw in a few curveballs so we'd know that the script wasn't written by computer. Steer clear of this poor man's 'Syriana' if you're looking for something new.
