Like the name suggest, music is central to this show. Instead of an opening theme you are hit with "Tank!" and right away you know it's about cool. The scores supplied by Kanno are phenomenal. The man is to jazz and anime what John Williams is to classical movie scores.<br /><br />The series has a hint of a 70's, retro, kung-fu movie / "Shaft" feel, particularly early on, driving home the cool feeling. This is just an undertone to the Western feel in which Clint Eastwood would be at home.<br /><br />From all of this, the aspect that truly makes this series wonderful is the quiet desperation. The three principal character are utterly flawed though superlatives. They are all desperately searching for pieces missing from their lives with a pain and loneliness that drives them together and makes them sympathetic to the end. Broke bounty hunters, barely able to find enough money to eat yet unable to be anything but compassionate stoke this sympathy even farther. The two minor leads, Ed and Ein, are geniuses at what they do, but a child without a care in the world and a dog that cannot speak are wonderful comic relief and consequently very endearing.<br /><br />This series is a tour of histories coming back to torment the characters, and the interplay of relationships is magic almost never seen - there is no need for expositions and out of place statements. The science fiction is neither overbearing nor unbelievable. Space is a fringe wilderness, and the Western feel is totally appropriate. In fact, it is a mix rarely seen so well - only the "Firefly" series comes to mind.<br /><br />This is definitely a series for a more adult audience - subtle character interactions, and no fear of blood, vice, or lack of action. At the same time, young teens to adults will enjoy it if for no other reason than the cool factor.
