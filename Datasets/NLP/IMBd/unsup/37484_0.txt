I saw Suspicious River at the director's home town, Vancouver. The director gave the audience a self-indulgent speech prior to the film and carefully noted that she was unable to stay for a Q&A afterwards. I now know why. Suspicious River successfully manages to be silly, stupid, anti-women, anti-men and anti-audience-with-a-grain-of-intelligence in them. The script and direction was uninspired and cliche. However, the only thing worth mentioning was Molly Parker's decent performance. I think the director was trying WAY too hard to shock our sensibilities with scenes of gang-rapes and sexual degradation. Unfortunately, none of these scenes had any form of dramatic impact on the story. I came into this film expecting a lot, and what I got out of it, was nothing more than despair, not because of the dark subject matter, but the waste of talent and celluloid.
