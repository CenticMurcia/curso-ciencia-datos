I had a feeling this was going to be a bad flick. I admit, the only reason I even watched the video was hopefully because Christian Bale would be in some scenes, but he wasn't. The link to the original is awful, I did however enjoy William Shattner's performance (I hope I spelled that correct) he was pretty funny and pretty goofy throughout.<br /><br />But the movie was just too darn spaced out to think anything good of. It makes you relize just how good the original AP was compared to this.
