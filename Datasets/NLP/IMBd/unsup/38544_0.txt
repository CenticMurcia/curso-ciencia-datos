This is probably one of the worst horror movies of the 90's.The story is dumb,the cast is mostly annoying and if you want scares...check better somewhere else.Even not enough blood to satisfy gore-hounds.Only one good thing about this horrible picture:quite well-made creature effects.In my opinion,due to such ridiculous films horror genre is slowly dying.So my advice to you is simple:avoid this dreadful piece of crap.
