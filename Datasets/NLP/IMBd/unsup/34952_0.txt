This piece of worthless rubbish could only be made in Australia. The humour is definitely aimed at the sort of man (I can't imagine any women watching more than 10 seconds of it), who thinks it hilarious to drop his trousers after drinking 15 pints. <br /><br />Not that the Australian film industry is devoid of humour. "Malcolm" for example, was both clever and funny and an absolute gem. "Fat Pizza" on the other hand seems to have been made in a couple of weeks by someone who's idea of a joke is to say f*** a few times and then bleep it out. There are loads of brain-dead jokes that a four year old would not find funny and if the makers of this film spent more than the price of a can of Fosters on the film sets, they were well and truly ripped off. Despite this, the acting is acceptable and there are some reasonable performances, despite the script. <br /><br />For the first few minutes I couldn't decide whether I liked the film or not. Sometimes a film can be awful, but work really well, but it soon became obvious that it was trying desperately hard to be funny, and failing. I am not averse to the "no brain required" sort of humour that Hollywood turns out on a regular basis, it's fun and and a bit of light entertainment. This movie, however, is awful and a real chore to sit through. The childish attempts at being (oh so) politically incorrect are just embarrassing. I can imagine that the actors and crew had a great time making this movie, but it simply doesn't work on the screen.<br /><br />There is nothing else to compare this film to. The closest thing I can think of is if a bunch of not very bright schoolboys trying really, really hard to be naughty, got hold of a camera. <br /><br />This is the first review I have posted, and that's because this is the only movie I have ever felt angry about wasting my time trying to watch. Don't waste your time or money renting it, just do yourself a favour and avoid this complete rubbish at all costs.
