Since Futurama was made by the guy who created The Simpsons, probably the greatest cult cartoon of our time, it had a lot to live up to. Most people I know enjoy it, but think it fails overall. Their problem is, they're comparing it to The Simpsons, in which case, OF COURSE it's not gonna live up to your expectations. If you let the yellow family go, however, and actually watch the show for what it is, you will love it.<br /><br />Basically about the adventures of Pizza Boy, Fry, who was frozen for 1,000 years and woke up in the year 3000, Futurama is a Sci-Fi spoof. To be honest, I find it funnier than The Simpsons at times, because it really plays on how society isn't much improved 1,000 years later. People have flown to the edge of the universe (literally; there's a billboard and everything), created robots that run on alcohol, and turned the internet into a virtual reality realm, and yet lonely guys still rent porno on Saturday night. The only difference is that the girls have multiple arms and antennae.<br /><br />Futurama is a hilarious program that shows us how stupid we really are, by making us laugh at even stupider people (or aliens, take your pick). If you let yourself go and just watch it without mentally comparing it to The Simpsons, I'm sure you skeptics will enjoy it. Because, really, shows can never be as awesome as other shows, but that doesn't mean they aren't awesome on their own.
