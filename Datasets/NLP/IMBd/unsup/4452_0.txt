We bought this disaster movie on video for our daughter when she was only two and "into" Thomas and Co. She loved it. It was frequently the only thing that would send her to sleep. After watching it about ten times, or more, it began to become something you could not tear yourself away from. It's hypnotic. It got to the point where we could recite the script to each other to relieve the monotony of long car journeys. It's almost like watching a car crash. You know you shouldn't watch, but you can't help it. One time we had a family party, had too much to drink and put the video on again. It was hilarious! My daughter is now eight, and thankfully hasn't seen it for a while. By the way, our son (who is a BIG fan of Thomas) hates it. Go figure!
