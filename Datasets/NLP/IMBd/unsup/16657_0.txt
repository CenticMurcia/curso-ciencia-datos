Woody Allen has made a living out of portraying himself as the world's biggest geek on the silver screen. How he ever got started I will never know. All he does is load up the Brink's truck and off to the bank he goes. The reason this movie is so much fun is because you know another laugh is just around the corner. I would love to see the out takes on this movie. You could see the other actors trying to hold back laughing. Diane Keaton loves working with Allen. She is quite a lady and a real looker. When Woody asks the stunning gal if she wants to dance and she says get lost creep and his answer to Linda is she'd rather not has to crack up any one who ever saw this movie. Over the years I have had a hard time finding people who like Allen. You look at him and you would like to tell him to get a haircut and get rid of those huge glasses. That I guess is his charm and appeal to his fans. This is a very funny film. If you like to laugh about fifty times during a movie, see this one. I don't like Allen and I love this movie. Give it chance. You will like it.
