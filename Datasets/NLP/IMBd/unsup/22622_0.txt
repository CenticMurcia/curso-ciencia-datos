Having missed the original television presentations, have long wanted to see this production, knowing the strength of the Goulet and Howes talents. (In the movie, Hollywood did a terrible job with the music!) Finally, a clip is available on YOUTUBE.COM of the full "Heather On The Hill" with Goulet and Howes. It is a delight -- but a fair warning: it whets your appetite for more which, sadly, is not available. But check it out and enjoy....... Goulet's and Howes' voices are certainly in their prime, and this particular number appears to be shot on location -- wonderful vistas combine with perhaps the most beautiful piece in the Brigadoon score.
