I feel a lot of horror fans expect too much from Tobe Hooper after Texas Chainsaw Massacre. As do fans of John Carpenter who always compare his work to Halloween, George Romero to Dawn Of The Dead and Wes Craven to Nightmare On Elm Street. What Tobe gives us here is a fantastic grim horror film that never lets up in pace and shocks.<br /><br />A masked killer who bumps off residents in an apartment block is about all this film has in common with the original. The film does have a similar feeling of decay and an ingrained, necessary violence that was present in TCM.<br /><br />The acting is top notch for a horror film: Angela Bettis is truly convincing as the paranoid heroine who investigates the strange goings on in the Lusman building. Rance Howard is also notable as the gentle old resident who gives Bettis' character hints along the way.<br /><br />All in all a highly recommended modern day horror film.
