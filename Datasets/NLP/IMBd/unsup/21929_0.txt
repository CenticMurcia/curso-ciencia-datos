Burt Lancaster is perfect as the aging town constable. He is a decent guy who is manipulated into killing a man in self defense. He tries to raise money for the dead man's widow and is told by the town leaders that they will match any amount put up by the big rancher who manipulated Burt into killing the man. He goes to see the guy and is beaten and has a wooden cross tied to his back. He is set free to walk through the desert back to town. He should die but whit a little help he survives. "Let Sleeping Dogs Lie" would be a good title for this film because Burt's past is that of a man who hunted Apaches. Burt was sleeping but now he is wide awake and woe to those who mistreated him. Burt's character packs a vicious bite. I love Burt in all his westerns and this is one of his top 10.
