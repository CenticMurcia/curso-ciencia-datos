The worst thing of all is that even a layman wouldn't believe that a guy who wants to be a pool hustler would get a tattoo of an 8 ball on his wrist, for whatever reason. Just plain stupid.<br /><br />This pretentious garbage has lines like "and on the seventh day, God created pool" and "if I'm lying...I'm dying." Numerous pool terms periodically flash across the screen meaning the screenwriter went into a pool players dictionary on the web and incorporated what he learned into the movie. They make no sense, do not move the movie along and are just dumb.<br /><br />At no point do you for one second believe that Freddie Prinze is cool or a good pool player, two things we are supposed to buy in this film. The direction is just awful, some music video director who thinks it's cool to keep having white flashes quickly appear on the screen (like the film is briefly over exposed). Lots of jump cuts, quit edits and boring characters reciting dialog that doesn't ring true, makes this one waste of film. Hearing Prinze in that stupid accent say "if you like dat...yo gonna love dis" made me cringe.<br /><br />My only real question about the production: What was Ving Rhames thinking?
