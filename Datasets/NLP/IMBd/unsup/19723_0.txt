My childhood memory puts this movie at a 10! I will admit I have not yet watched this movie as an adult/parent.<br /><br />I did however watch this movie as a kid, and it affected my life. This was a great movie for a low budget film in the 80's.<br /><br />As a kid I did not completely understand the plot other than a young disabled boy who befriends a man who everyone else hates.<br /><br />It's basically a story about the harsh judgments mocking Jesus went through, retold in modern day times through the eyes of a young boy.<br /><br />The simple act of watching this movie as a child made me hate the way people were treated and discriminated against simple because they were different. It also put into perspective the pain and persecution Jesus went through. It really did change the way I looked and the way I treated people different than me.<br /><br />Now if your judging this movie by the time and money spent on special effects, A+ actors, popularity, and publicization than you probably wont like it. But the warm and sad feelings I felt watching this movie as a young boy stuck with me my whole life. And I can not speak for the rest of the movie watching world, but to me a good movie evokes feelings: tears, anger, fear and love. The more a movie leaves you thinking or feeling at the end or even the way it changes the way you look at life or things in general is a great movie. Bottom line as a young mature boy I LOVED THIS MOVIE. As an adult? Yet to be determined.
