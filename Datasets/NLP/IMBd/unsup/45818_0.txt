OK, I've watched & loved, Highlander the series.... I enjoyed it more than the movies themselves. Adrian Paul is a really talented actor & though I feel their acting was dead on... the script for this movie was HORRIBLE.<br /><br />It was as awful as Highlander II... it just left me feeling like someone... wanted to revive the movie to make a few dollars. It was as if they threw this script together on a weekend & convinced some great actors this was a good idea.<br /><br />Highlander creators... we'll act like this didn't happen if you promise not to produce another movie to finance a new house.<br /><br />2 thumbs, way down.<br /><br />Such a cool series, such a bad movie.
