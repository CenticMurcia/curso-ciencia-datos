I am an enormous Troma fan as well as an independent cinema fan. Movies like Bloodsucking Freaks and The Toxic Avenger are among my favorite movies.<br /><br />So when I saw Rabid Grannies, the cover and title alone was enough for me. But watching it was worse than stubbing my toe repeatedly. This is extremely boring and contains very few scenes of "gore" that make the $9 budget films I make with my friends look like Guinea Pig flicks. The old broads turn into ridiculous looking monsters as oppose to just keeping their Granny forms and just being crazy (which would have been funnier). The acting mixed with bad dubbing just takes the badness too far. Stay away from this movie! Buy something better, like Gigli or something. If you like this movie I would also recommend: starring at a bottle of peanut butter for an hour and a half, listening to Michael Bolton, and/or just getting a better taste in movies. This was the first time so far Troma let me down this much. WHY'D YOU DO IT, LLOYD?! WHY?!
