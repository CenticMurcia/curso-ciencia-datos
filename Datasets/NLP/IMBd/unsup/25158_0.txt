It is very touching psychological drama. There is no blood and gore in it, so it is not for zombie-fan at all. But for me there is a true feeling of identification with the main character. Savage plays his role brilliantly. He is pitiful and sometimes I feel like I was trapped in this horrible situation instead of him. The masterfully shot sinister landscapes also made me real nervous. Maybe it seems strange, but in my opinion the atmosphere in the movie is the same as in Weir's "Picnic at Hanging Rock". And by the way the plot has a much more interesting intrigue than "Six Sense". It was real pleasure watching the film. Sadly it is the last movie made by Fulci. Maybe he had a presentiment about his death and he somehow put it into his last work. Anyway "Door to silence" is another example of his versatile talent. Must see (not only for Fulci's fans)
