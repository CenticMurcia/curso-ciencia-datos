This is a movie, that never enjoyed much popularity and is counted as one of Bogart's minor works, however, from the first time i watched it, it offered a certain fascination to me. So i pick it out of my collection time and time again, maybe once every 2 months. Yes, it has a complicated, multiple nested structure of flashbacks into flashbacks, but it is well worth watching even more. Bogart strong as a stubborn DA going after Murder Inc., not knowing such a thing exists, offers credibility. The list of criminals, however, has much more meat to chew on and does so, lead by the villainous leader Everett Sloane and his deputy, Ted De Corsia as well as all the others to be listed. One exception : Zero Mostel, who helps to break the case, but is really to small a crook to be involved here. And listen carefully to follow to the final solution, which is handled in a one on one shootout. Take a look at it, where you can get it.
