Hats of for SLB for making a different kind of movie, its very different from the other movies he made, and yet not as good as the others, but Sawwaria is still a good movie to watch.<br /><br />The love story is sweet and both Ranbir and Sonam Kapoor acted really well, and the direction was superb for the movie.<br /><br />A good advice for you SLB, don't spend 4 years on your next project, we love to see your movies and do experiment but keep the story-line strong.<br /><br />People who knows what real love is and have lost it, they will love the movie.<br /><br />Saawaria is much better than Om SHanti Om (eventhough SRK is still the King of Bollywood).<br /><br />Om Shanti Om is for the Front-seater, and Saawaria is for the Metro people..go see it in cinema you will love it.
