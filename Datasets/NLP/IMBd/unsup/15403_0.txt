When i first saw this movie i thought it was going to suck. but i was actually surprised at the effort that the people put into making this movie. although it wasn't a very popular nor original film i still liked it. another thing i liked is how it was filmed at my school Avon Old Farms. when i was watching it, i was in my common room where one of the scened was filmed in, it was cool to see the common room being used by other people besides the school kids. this movie was a lot like "the girl next door" when i say this i mean that it had the plot involving 2 kids, a rebel teenage girl and a not-so-rebel teenage boy. the plot pretty much consists of the girl turning the boy into a rebel and the bay turning the girl into a not-so-rebel girl. like i said, it was a lot like "the girl next door" just not casted with famous people. overall its a good film, i suggest anyone who reads this should see it.
