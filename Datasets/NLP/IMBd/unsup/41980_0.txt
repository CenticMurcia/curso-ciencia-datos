This movie absolutely deserves a 4. The premise is great any anti American activity results in death. The movie sticks to that for a little while. The major downsides were that Uncle Sam doesn't really appear until forty minutes into the movie, and like an hour in he just starts killing everybody. The best part of the movie was at the end when they fire the cannon at Uncle Sam and you can see the string pulling him back through the house. God that was soo funny. I couldn't stop laughing at that. The acting was kinda bad, but expected. The best character is the blind kid in the wheelchair. Bottom line if u like cheesy movies especially horror see this.
