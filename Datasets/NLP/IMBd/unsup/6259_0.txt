I saw this movie because of buzz I heard over the net and wanted to see for myself. The movie is very character driven rather then explosions and special effects rammed down your throat. It has a great plot and keeps you wondering about where each character stands throughout the movie. It almost has a twilight zone type feel, it has no problem keeping you on edge and guessing. The acting is top notch, Bill Cobbs is truly under rated as an actor and I believe this movie gave him the chance he needed to stretch his legs and take a lead role. Most of the other people in the movie I have not heard of but also impressed me throughout. This movie is one of the better I've seen in a while, I would check it out.
