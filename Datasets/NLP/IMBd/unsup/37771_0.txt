Full of flaws, stiff acting, bad effects, bad plot and very silly stereotypes of non-american soldiers. This is a bad movie but somewhat exciting a second or two with Gary Busey, excellent as always, in one role but this does not save this silly movie. Not even watchable for a laugh. Not recommended; 3/10.
