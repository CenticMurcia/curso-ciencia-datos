Joan Crawford is miscast as a wealthy American widow who relocates to London and mixes it up with the high society Brits. Lethargic comedy, previously filmed in 1929 with Norma Shearer, does have one plot twist, though many viewers may tire and tune out by the time it is revealed. First-half is so slow setting up the story, I could easily understand why this was such a flop in 1937. The second-half does improve, with jazzy supporting performances including Frank Morgan's as a befuddled would-be suitor (he's very funny). As for Crawford, she's too tough and inflexible for this kind of flippant character. Originally based upon a play by Frederick Lonsdale, with the material's stage-origins are all too apparent. *1/2 from ****
