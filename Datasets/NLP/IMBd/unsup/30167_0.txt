This was definitely an excellent movie and kept my whole attention the whole time. But their were also some other interesting things that caught my eye. Geographical errors: Like for example on the segment Honey-Getter when the two guys Edward and Preshant get off the train, right before the lady Humera starts chasing them. If you notice the conductor says R train to Brooklyn when in fact it's the S train which is the shuttle that transports you back and forth between Grand Central Station and Times Square. Example#2 Right after the part I just described in Example #1 when the train takes off, it keeps proceeding forward. But anybody who's from New York knows that at the end of each of those stations are dead ends and the train can only go the other way. I just really found two things very interesting and those things did not make it a bad movie at all. I actually feel like that's one of the things that makes the movie interesting and I would highly recommend anybody to watch it.
