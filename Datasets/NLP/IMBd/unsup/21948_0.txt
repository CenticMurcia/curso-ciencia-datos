Spacey, soon-to-be-divorced cop John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) is toying with his deceased fathers old HAM radio one night, when, through some odd twist of fate so common in sci-fi films, he contacts his father Frank (Dennis Quaid) 30 years in the past.<br /><br />Hold on, it gets much better.<br /><br />Frank, who is a firefighter, died in a flaming building when John was 6. So, John helps him change the past so he doesn't die. There's one problem - now John's mother has been murdered by a killer John has been tracking in the present day. They must now race against time 30 years apart to stop this killer before he can kill John's mother/Frank's wife, and several other women.<br /><br />A lot of people think this sounds cheesy, but this is actually one of the best film's of the early 21st century. The film is plot driven, and what a good plot it is. I couldn't say any more without spoiling it. Quaid is great, as is Caviezel. Some people thought he slept-walked through the movie, but that actually seemed right for the character. Honorable mention to Andre Braugher. I've never seen him turn in even an average performance.
