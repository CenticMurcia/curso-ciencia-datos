In a peaceful Indian (aka Native American) village, Owen Moore (he's Silver Eagle) courts squaw Lottie Pickford (she's Minnewanna). Inevitably, white conquerors arrive; at gunpoint, they force the Indian tribe to abandon their land. For nefarious reasons, the conquerors keep lovely Lottie for themselves, sadly separating her from departing sweetheart Moore. Must the Indian sweethearts remain forever apart? (Mary's sister) Lottie Pickford is a beguiling Indian squaw. Director D.W. Griffith's "The Red Man's View " scores points for its point-of-view; however, it remains a relatively weak and unimaginative drama. <br /><br />**** The Red Man's View (12/9/09) D.W.
