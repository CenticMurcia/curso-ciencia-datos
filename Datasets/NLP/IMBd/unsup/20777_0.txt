when I saw the trailer for the love guru I thought it would be a somewhat bad movie compared to what mike myers provided in austin powers, but I saw an early screening today (mainly because I saw my fav and one of the best stand up comedians out there, Daniel tosh, the dude with the cowboy hat) and I was impressed. I like when I go see a movie and expect something bad and come out pleasantly surprised and the love guru did just that. The intro took me by surprise with great jokes from mike. The rest of the movie was a fun ride filled with humorous names and puns and cameos from many many comedians and artists and actors. I was very amused by stephen colbert and jim gaffigan's (another great stand up comedian) sports newscasting, hilarious. If anybody gets a chance to see an early screening you should def go, if not then go when it officially is released.,
