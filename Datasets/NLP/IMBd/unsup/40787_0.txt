Imagine me saying that a Van Johnson, Deborah Kerr film was awful. It's true folks. This was one miserable film.<br /><br />In war ravaged England the two of them begin an affair only for Ms. Kerr to end it in thanks to the Lord when Maurice (Johnson) survives a bombing.<br /><br />The two of them engage in absolute endless talk. The film falls into a discussion regarding the lord and all other kinds of philosophy. Kerr gives an emotionally restrained performance in her usual sing-song diction.<br /><br />As Sarah in this film, there is no great chemical reaction between her and Maurice.<br /><br />As her suffering husband, an English civil servant, Peter Cushing is adequate but the dialogue is ridiculous.<br /><br />John Mills is real dead pan as an investigator.<br /><br />When a husband hires a detective to investigate a cheating wife, that can be believed. When a former lover does this, you have to wonder.<br /><br />Am wondering if Van Johnson was using this film as a pre-test to the much better "Miracle in the Rain" which occurred the following year. Two deaths coming during rainstorms is more than quite incidental.
