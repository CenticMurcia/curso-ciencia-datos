While I don't mind some deviations from the book, there were too many changes in this one which were unnecessary and reduced the impact of the story.<br /><br />As always, I enjoyed Geraldine McEwan as Miss Marple but in this movie, the annoying Raymond character actually detracted from many of the scenes Miss Marple was in. I think the writers thought this Raymond would be funny but he was irritating.<br /><br />Changing the House and Gardens tour into a Mystery Bus Tour was another problem, since I found it hard to believe that these people selected by Mr. Rafiel would willingly remain when they are visiting places connected to their past which they wanted to keep hidden.<br /><br />When I first read the "sisters" would become nuns, I was open-minded since it could have provided a way of tightening the story. Perhaps the Garden and House tour could stay at the convent and Miss Marple would meet the three sisters there.<br /><br />But I didn't realize they would stray so far from the story by having Clotilde murder Verity in such a violent fashion and eliminating Clotilde murdering the second girl to pass off as Verity's body. That was Agatha Christie's clever twist, and while I don't mind changes from the source when it made sense, not using the most brilliant part of the story was a bad move and made this movie a weak shell of the book.
