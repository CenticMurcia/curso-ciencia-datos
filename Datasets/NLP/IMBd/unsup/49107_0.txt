This episode seemed weak and far fetched.<br /><br />We follow Marge Simpson who have discovered an online roleplaying game called Earth Realms. Soon she discovers that almost every single inhabitant of Springfield plays that exact game, and that her son is a highly feared villain in the game.<br /><br />This part is absurd in many ways and bare very little resemblance to how real online roleplaying games are played. This makes a mockery of the younger audience, who can easily see that the script writers doesn't waste time on research. Of course you can say that since it is a satiric comedy primarily for adults, it does not have to be accurate. But I fail to see why not. They could easily have made the same story portraying a real MMORG (Massive multiplayer roleplaying game) without using every clich√© in the book.<br /><br />In this episode we also follow Lisa Simpson who have found a liking for football (soccer for you Americans). Homer Simpson steps in as a referee and all kind of hysterical comedy ensues... That is if you think that showing an stereotypical American who doesn't understand the rules of football is funny. This part is even more absurd. The only thing we get out of it is, that it is important to play fair and that European football is tainted by violent supporters. Brazilian football star Ronaldo appears as a guest star, but that is both unnecessary and not funny at all. One has to ask why he is there at all. He bares no real significance to the storyline, and he is so out of place that one has to wonder if the writers just wanted somebody famous to be in the show.<br /><br />The whole episode fails miserably to deliver on the comedy side, and all we get is a quaint and poorly written episode that portraits both online role playing games and football in an inept and naive way, lacking the usual finesse and relevance.
