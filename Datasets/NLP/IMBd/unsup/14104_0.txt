Okay, this is NOT a great film and the plot is quite silly at times (plus, the version of this film performed on the Carol Burnett Show is possibly better), BUT I liked it. Yes, Joan Crawford belting out the songs and dancing with her football player shoulder pads underneath her leotards are both silly, but there was a certain goofy charm to the film. It definitely was a last gasp film--a 1950s film that looked amazingly like a 1930s or early 40s musical except for the film being in color.<br /><br />Joan is the scheming woman bent on success as a singer/dancer. Despite having only marginal talent (my opinion, not that of the people in the film), she makes it to the big time only to discover she is all alone. Then, she discovers her blind pianist has secretly loved her all these years and the movie ends in a romantic clinch.<br /><br />Contrived? Yep. A bit over-the-top? You betcha. But, despite all this it is all good fun.
