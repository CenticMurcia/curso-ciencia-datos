A brilliant film from start to finish. Bob Hoskins performance in the last minute alone was worthy of an outstanding acting award without him uttering a word!!! Biggest moan is WHY the best British gangster film ever made is STILL not available on PAL VHS or region 2 DVD, I cannot believe you can only get it from the USA.
