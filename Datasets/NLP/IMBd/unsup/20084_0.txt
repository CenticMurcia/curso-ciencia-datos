Watched the movie through my free pay-per-view cable subscription. I would have definitely not purchased this movie. I needed to kill about 1 1/2 have hours but was only was able to stomach about 3/4 of the movie. Special effects were like 1950's Godzilla. The movie viewers were intoduced to the monster during a sequence where a poor copy of a Cobra Gun Ship helicopter, attacked a military convoy carrying the monster in a 55 gallon drum. Why was the military transporting an archaeological find? Why Am I so concerned by this? The acting in this movie was similar to low budget B movies. Got a big laugh when my son compared the ICE QUEEN Monster to BeetleJuice. The monster, to me, looked like a combination of BeetleJuice and the Monster from SPECIES. There was a little entertaining T&A but not worthy of the lousy dialog, lack of plot and cheesy special effects. Stay away. Please Stay away.
