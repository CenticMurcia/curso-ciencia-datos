I pretty much agree with glazedham's review. I will add the following...one of the things that I found most annoying is the fact that Arquette is frequently seen holding a camera while another camera is filming her holding the camera. I don't know why, but this was unbelievably aggravating to me. All in all, I was left with the impression that many of these "artists" have just taken way too many drugs. If their lives are so difficult, I recommend that they get off the stage and go to a part of the world where they can witness real suffering. Hopefully they will take Arquette and her hand-held camera with them. Maybe she will eventually use footage from the hand-held camera as it seems to have served absolutely no purpose in this film.
