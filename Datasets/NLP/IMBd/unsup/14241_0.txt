Yes, it is true that most of the people think that this movie contains too many visual effects, but this is not completely true. It seems so, because most of the watcher actually do not expect that from a Russian movie. But let me clarify where did they get the effects from. Most of the strange and a little bit animation scenes are taken from the Panorama of the Pleven Epopee - this is a monument of the Pleven Siege, which is the overturn in the Russo-Turks War(1877-1878). And about the monument - in there are the battle scenes and everything is made from wax and seems pretty much real. Because about 10 000 soldiers and citizens of Pleven have died in a small valley - about 2 square km surface. So, I see this movie as a modern admission of what had been done before - and of course paying salute to the tremendous people, who have been fighting for ideas.
