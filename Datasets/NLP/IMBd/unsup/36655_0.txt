The final surviving footage of Peter Sellers is played, then there's this "Inspector Clouseau has gone missing" thing, which is played out not with a missing persons search but with a TV reporter preparing a special on him, doing some strangely irrelevent interviews with Panther stock characters. Each of these interviews are merely excuses to play clips from past Panther movies.<br /><br />It starts out as a curiosity - seeing Sellers that one last time. This pleasure is hampered by the fact that Sellers was really struggling - he was close to death, after all. Once he "goes missing," it turns into a labour of love, with past Panther characters serving as the mouthpiece of Blake Edwards, getting very sentimental about Peter Sellers, through discussing the missing Clouseau.<br /><br />But then it gets decidedly ridiculous, and after a while you feel very cheated - Edwards has booked bums on seats in theatres without giving us any kind of movie at all. Sorry, but stringing clips of actual movies together with some really poor, unfunny and poorly acted linking material does not equal a movie.<br /><br />1/10. I don't even classify it as a movie.
