When this movie premiered on sky, I really wanted to watch it but due to a faulty satellite, I couldn't. The next day I looked for it on Amazon and couldn't find it. After a while I forgot about it, until last night, it was on again (the satellite had been fixed by then). I shoved a tape in and watched it. I had my doubts about this film, I've seen many Chinese films and I know when there bad, there bad but when there good, man are they good. This little gem happened to be one of the good ones, the editing, the music, the relationship between the two main characters made this film one of the most entertaining films I'd seen for a while. Wilson Yip did a good job of this (it's a film that could have been easily ruined), the film has just the right amount of everything in it, action, comedy, romance.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this film and hope they make a sequel, I'd give it a cool four stars.
