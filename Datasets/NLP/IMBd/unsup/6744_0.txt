"The Sex Monster" is a witty sex romp (naturally) that excels in its humor. And unlike some reviews have said, it's not just some male fantasy. In fact, all the males in the movie are made out to look like idiots, especially the lead character -- who finds that his wife "Likes p**** more than he does" after a menage a trois. Acting is great all around, and there are so many beautiful women in the film it is mind boggling. Women should enjoy it too, as it shows how men's fantasies can backfire on them and laughs a lot at men's ideas about women and lesbians.<br /><br />No gratutiutous sex, just a LOT of innuendo. Fun for the whole (adult) family. 8/10
