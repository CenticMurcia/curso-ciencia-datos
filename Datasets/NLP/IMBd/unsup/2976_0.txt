Barefoot Contessa is an amazing show. She is a perfectionist and her recipes are not always easy, but here's the kicker "they are always good". Many of her recipes have a French flair to them - old school cooking. This cooking is not always healthful - but in moderation is heavenly.<br /><br />I like Ina's low key attitude. She speaks clearly and intelligibly - not running off crazy bird. I would rather spend an hour on a good Ina recipe than 45 minutes on a bad Rachael Ray recipe. With that said - that is the difference.<br /><br />Ina Garten is a highly successful career woman - with a an amazing ability to cook. Her recipe for Roast Chicken is easy and amazing a favorite at our house. I also very much enjoy her ideas on table settings, decor, and party planning. She is a less abrasive version of Martha.<br /><br />I am from an old school European family. We love to make beautiful meals. I was taught from an early age to set a beautiful table - that you did not scarf down your food - you dined - enjoyed it. I know we all have busy lives but a return to beautifully prepared meals and great conversation is much more needed in today's society.
