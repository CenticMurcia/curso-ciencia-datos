On a boring day of constant reruns, i caught this crap on TV. At first it held my interest, until I saw the similarities to "Rosemary's Baby" up to a point. The elderly clan in the same house. I was waiting for Dean's character to change to lucifer or something evil.<br /><br />BTW, where did she get those cigarettes to set off the alarm? Why didn't she get that gun the first time she saw it? What were the motives of the elderly people? Questions, questions!!! To be honest, I missed the first 15 minutes of this..and should of missed the rest. I think Portia did a good job of acting considering the shortcomings of the script. I didn't know she had it in her.
