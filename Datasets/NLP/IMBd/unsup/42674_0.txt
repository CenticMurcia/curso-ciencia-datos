[SPOILER AHEAD]<br /><br />This film is my candidate for the most exact title of a movie (and will continue to be so until someone makes a film called "This is a Total Turkey"!)<br /><br />The absolute low-point comes at the funeral scene, where the kid throws a tantrum because everyone's crying at his mother's death (?!), so he runs off into the countryside, stops in the middle of a field and looks up weirdly into the sky. It's so nauseating it'll turn even the strongest stomach.<br /><br />A bogus movie? Definitely! In fact, to borrow the quote from most critical reviews of The Stupids, "Well at least they can't be accused of false advertising!"
