I didn't have expectations for this one. I watched it on LATE local t.v. But the cast really had me intrigued. David Schwimmer, Jason Lee, the beautiful Mili Avital, Vanessa Angel, Mili Avital among others deliver a great performance. The cast is really good and seems that they had great chemistry between them.<br /><br />The movie had the occasional funny situations and some smart dialogs. Then I thought I was watching an episode of "Friends". The acting, dialogs, and even direction made this look like a sitcom.<br /><br />Still I have a good time with this movie. It's funny and romantic at some points. Of course, with the typical American humor. <br /><br />Give it a try, I can see why it's considered to be an underrated comedy.
