A huge Troma nut since I was a kid, (thanks Dad!) I've grown over the years to better understand and appreciate the purpose that Kaufman & Co. stand for. And as always, I eagerly purchased another statement of antithesis from the rebel provocateurs of avant gore skinema, Troma's "Dogpile 95 Vol. 1". Call it totally crappy. Call it too extreme for the mainstream crowd. Call it anything but stupid. Because this is truly independent cinema at work! Although the double feature's selections are about as "Indie" as you'll likely find. "Wiseguys vs. Zombies", at least in my opinion, really isn't much aside from a statement. With home-brew indie films, I feel the budgetary constraints and lack of resources that come along with the territory should be made up for with a really good story or at least entertaining acting. Unfortunately, WVZ lacks it all.<br /><br />If you're able to get along with the acting, homemade gore, and home movie quality, there's still not much of a story or funny acting to be found. There are some chuckle-worthy moments in a pretty much watchable film. But overall it just doesn't leave much of a good impression outside of the whole "fight for truly independent cinema" mood set by the release.<br /><br />I would never recommend it to anyone outside of a good example for what YOU can do at home if you really want to. (Which is pretty well the point.) But as a movie, "Wiseguys vs. Zombies" is just kind of a dud. I hope they had fun making it though.
