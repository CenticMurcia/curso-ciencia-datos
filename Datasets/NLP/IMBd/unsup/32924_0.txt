Found this one during a routine late-night channel-surf. I spied, with my one good eye...<br /><br />Billy Zane: being held at gun-point, while some thong-clad Brian Bosworth clone orders him to remove his pants and then chases him around the dining room table. "Bart" keeps informing Billy Zane that he plans on making a woman out of him <wink-wink> ...if ya' know what I mean. And you expect me to change the channel?<br /><br />You know how you just *have* to watch "BeastMaster" when it comes on, even tho' you know you shouldn't? Well that's the deal with "Blood & Concrete: A Love Story" (full titles here folks!) It's odddly compelling, not unlike "Baywatch", the movie "Showgirls" or string-cheese. Having said that... I have no idea what it was supposed to be about. For no reason I can succesfully elocute, this movie reminded of "Vamp", which also seemingly took place in a strange hybrid of Los Angeles via Manhattan Meat Packing District. So there..I've just compared this movie to "Vamp". That pretty much says it all.<br /><br />I have graciously rated this schlock-fest a '4':<br /><br />-1 point for the smouldering indie-flicker James LeGros<br /><br />-1 point for the gay Boss Hogg drug-dealer who we get to see on the crapper<br /><br />-1 point for Billy Zane's 'House of Style' eyebrows & mostly believeable hairpiece<br /><br />& -1 point for a Brian Bosworth-clone who spends all his screen time running around in tight, white, nothing-to-the-imagination jeans... while he informs every male character of exactly where he intends to hide the pickle.<br /><br />
