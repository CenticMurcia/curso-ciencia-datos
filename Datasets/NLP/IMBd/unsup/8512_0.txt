A good character study (excellent rendition by Don Cheadle), a well crafted story, an action thriller film mingled with ingenious espionage and conspiracies. The greatest line of the film, perhaps the morale of the story, I think, comes at the very end: "The Qur'an says that if you kill an innocent person it's as if you've killed all mankind", but "it also says that if you save a life it's like you've saved all mankind". Any gospel can be used to justify anything, but all affirm God, as the one who gave us all, regardless of religion, ethnicity, political affiliation the most precious gift of all, the gift of life. And no matter how we imagine the "after-life" (Paradise, eternal life ...), we should respect and protect life, for as long or short it's given to each of us.
