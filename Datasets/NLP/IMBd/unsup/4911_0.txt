This was one of Howard's early directorial efforts (he even gives himself a Hitchcockian-style cameo in an alley kiss near the beginning), and one of his straight-out funniest. Many have commented on Keaton's top-notch breakout performance -- and it truly is one of the funniest supporting performances since Matthau's Whiplash Willie Gingrich. But, there are many other wonderful tidbits to enjoy thoroughly -- beginning with an incredibly clever script by Ganz and Mandell -- so many classic lines I almost don't know where to begin. Gina Hecht is also magnificently memorable in her supporting role as Winkler's neurotic girlfriend, and Nita Talbot is a gem as the domineering mother. Winkler is perfect as the understated nebbish lead, and the contrast of the low-income realities and the humor found in the script is marvelously unusual in American movies beyond "Little Shop of Horrors". In fact, the movie deftly blends reality and absurdity in a manner few have succeeded at. Finally, the ahead-of-its-time cast includes Shannen Doherty as a junior girl scout, Richard Belzer as a grotesque gangster pimp, Kevin Costner as a frat boy, Clint Howard (Ron's younger brother who starred in Gentle Ben and a classic Star Trek episode) as Keaton's first limo customer, Murphy Brown's Pat Corley as Hecht's father, and Ghost's Vincent Schiavelli as an obnoxious deliveryman. And, I do disagree with mainstream thought that Shelley Long was miscast -- she actually imbues her character with some underappreciated mannerisms that ring very true for me that transcend the hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold cliche. All in all, a funny and harrowing film much better than it is generally given credit for.
