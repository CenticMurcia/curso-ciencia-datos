This is quite possibly one of the worst movies I have watched in a long, long time. <br /><br />After reading some of the positive comments about it though I am really shocked that some people enjoyed this. I honestly believe that this movie getting a 3.7 is about 2.7 points too much...<br /><br />This movie was a complete waste of my time and just reiterated my belief that Burt Reynolds is officially an acting has-been. The acting is forced and rides along cameo appearances (and less notably, mentions) by Tony Danza (and Anthony Hopkins).<br /><br />Looking at these 'strippers' play volleyball can only bring about so much excitement, and it certainly does not warrant an entire hour and a half of your life...<br /><br />Stay away from this movie if you can, its not deserving of any of your money, or you time for that matter.
