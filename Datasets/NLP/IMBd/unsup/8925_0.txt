I'm loving this movie from the opening scene of rats under night vision camera crawling along the pipe-works of a building. Cut to the scene of our hero fishing off the pier and jogging thru his hood in his sleeveless hoodie. Enter his apartment building filled with the usual broken-down stereotypical inner-city schleps. Where "howyadoing" means hello, and "Leave me alone!" passes for good-bye. Every actor plays their roll with a meaty flavor that I'm sure the on-coming zombie hordes will find very satisfying. Yes this movie lets you know the characters lets you see what's inside of them before the zombies rip it out. Secretly several residents in the apartment have been attacked. But you'd never know they turned, with their unhealthy pallor and shuffling around aimlessly and disheveled in their every-day life.<br /><br />Or sleeveless hero and the rest of the denizens are waiting for his daughter to return from Iraq. The closer she gets the more you here about these strange attack on the sub-way. Suddenly a "YUPPIE" douche hits on a seemingly drunken skank at the corner bar. He drags her into the kitchen for some quick-sex and comes running out bleeding and screaming. She comes chasing after so do several other turned citizens. UH-oh the gig is up; whatever was attacking those people on the sub-ways is here! Run! Run! Zombies! Save yerself! Save yerself!!
