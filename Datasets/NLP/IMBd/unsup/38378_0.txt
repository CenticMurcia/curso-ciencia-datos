Honestly, I have no idea what Gregory Peck was thinking when he decided to make this incredibly awful movie. Now I have seen ALL of the Puppet Master movies and besides the first and third episodes the rest were pretty much crap.It's interesting however to see the Puppets start out as evil slayers for their master Andre Toulon, but then become more as heroes fighting evil in the 3rd & 4th movies. Still, this movie is just plain BAD. The acting is horrible and the little bit of special effects is below "B" movie quality stuff. I'm not even going to go through what the movie is about, as other reviewers have already explained it. So much more could have been done with this series. Instead of it advancing to higher standard, it has actually sank way below what we'd expect. Stay far away from this movie. If you must see it, definitely rent it for the cheapest price possible. You've been warned though.
