without being too detailed, this has to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my entire life. my partner got this on her Netflix and i was still upset to see it. watching this movie was like staring at someone who looks horrible because you cannot believe that a person could be in public looking that horrible. it was like rooting for the underdog with some hope that a win was possible. not only was it impossible, it was laughably impossible. even the little things were horrible. the police looked like security guards. the chase scene was downright silly. the only positive thing about this movie is that it gave the actors and crew some employment.
