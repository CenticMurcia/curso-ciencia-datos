I love the old movies. Although the frame story is - beyond all doubt - not excellent, the movie is worth 10 points in my opinion because it shows the wonderful skaters of the legendary Vienna Ice Revue.<br /><br />Austrian and European Champion Eva Pawlik who lost her Olympic Gold Medal only against CanadaÂ´s sweetheart Barbara Ann Scott is brilliant not only as a skater but also as an actress.<br /><br />There is no doubt that the other actors having learned how to act on stage and in a movie are not really better. It would have been more difficult for them to skate...
