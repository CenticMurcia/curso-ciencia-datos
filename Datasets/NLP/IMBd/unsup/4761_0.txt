I was a NJ resident when this case broke in 1984. I remember the story as relayed on the pages of the Asbury Park Press and the conversations around the office. When the Sunday article was published by Peter Maas, I felt a sigh of relief for the family. I later purchased the book by Maas and read it a few times. When the movie first aired, I was married with three children. All of the detailed portrayed in the movie was right on the money.<br /><br />I recently re-acquired my book (it was stowed in a storage facility up north, along with my DVD) and have re-read it. Domestic violence doesn't go away - it stays with you forever! In reading this book again, I realized that the "child" is now a young man of 25 - the same age his mother was when she was murdered. <br /><br />This movie is timeless, in so much as there are still women killed by their husbands in such a violent manner, that it begs one to question the existence of a "civilized" society.
