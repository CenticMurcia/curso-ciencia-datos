Extremely unfunny movie that utterly wastes the usually hilarious Hank Azaria (Huff, the Simpsons et al).<br /><br />The main problem is Simon Pegg. He's well pegged out and will soon reach Ricky Gervaise levels of tedious one note shtick. It's not that the comedy isn't juvenile -- (I mean, American Pie was juvenile) it's just that's it not very funny.<br /><br />Ealing this ain't. More like a blown up sitcom. The UK just can't make funny movies any more. Sorry, but it's true.<br /><br />Go see Knocked Up again rather than waste your time on this tosh, as did all the cast.<br /><br />Still, at least Hugh Grant wasn't it in -- the one redeeming feature.
