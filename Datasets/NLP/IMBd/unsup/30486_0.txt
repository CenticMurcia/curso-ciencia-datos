Totally awful movie. The movie started with so much promise. The opening half hour which shows nihal-deol in Panjab was funny, well shot and well acted but after that it was just too much to bear. Where do the bollywood directors recruit their "americans". Totally blah movie. Nihal singh or Sikhs are shown in a totally insensitive light and the portrayal is stereotyping. If such a movie was made in US it would be give rise to protest about such a portrayal. The movie was technically and story wise so shabby that it was embarrassing. As usual Sunny deol is the superman incarnate, which is okay but make the story have a little more sense. To be fair it had some moments of laughter but these were so far and away and were filled with banal plot in between.<br /><br />I love Sunny deol and prefer him to Arnold as the strong man in movies but this time the story writer, director and the editing team have totally let him down. <br /><br />Please stay away from this one :P!!
