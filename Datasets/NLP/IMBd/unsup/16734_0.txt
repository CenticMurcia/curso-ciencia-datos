This show is great! It has that zany "Simpsons" style of humor.To understand the characters and where the series takes place you should catch first the opening episode called: "Space Pilot 3000", which introduces you to the story. The series is just incredible, crazier than The Simpsons, beautiful animation, and innovative and touching plots - usually referenced from great moments of Cinema. Let me introduce you to main characters: <br /><br />Fry - The delivery boy, as stupid as his laziness.<br /><br />Bender - The lazy futuristic robot, that drinks alcohol all the time, and is practically evil...<br /><br />Leela - An "alien" captain who appears to be not lazy.... :) <br /><br />A great Simpson alternative! Too bad it was canceled - who knows, they might return.
