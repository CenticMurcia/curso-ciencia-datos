The makers of this film completely destroyed all the magic of Susan Cooper's beloved book. They turned it into a horribly made teeny pop movie attempt. The characters are weak with no development and the acting is just embarrassing to watch. They barely have any scenes from the actual books and the legendary dark epic feel is completely lost. The character of Will was the young boy who found out he was endowed with magic before Harry Potter was even created and I'm sad to see them throw away these books with a quick production to try to catch the coattails of the Potter craze. (Don't get me wrong. I'm a big Harry Potter fan.) Even the special effects and visuals are poor and the editing is totally disjointed. Ugh, I can't even list all the problems with this movie. Even the camera work is sloppy and seems to be desperately trying to make something out nothing. Suffice it to say I have nothing really good to say about this movie at all. I had to force myself to watch the whole thing and it was quite painful. I hope Cooper allows another remake in the future. I'd love to see these books done properly.
