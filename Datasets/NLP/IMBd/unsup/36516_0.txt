The thing that fascinates me in films like "Burial Ground" is the teeth. Do human teeth really grow that large? The masks in this film (and yes, they are very obviously masks) make the foremost pair of teeth in the human mouth out to be about three inches long by two inches wide.<br /><br />The minimal plot is as follows: a group of utter morons who wind up trapped at a countryside manor by some zombies that have been conjured up through some kind of occult experimentation. In a series of sequences I found to be really boring, they are systematically cornered and killed by the shambling corpses, who get around fairly well for crumbling bodies that have crawled out of the ground.<br /><br />I suppose the praise for this film comes from those who like their horror to be mindless, but personally this was a little too devoid of substance for me. Not only was there very little story here, it's also full of characters who do things that are so illogical that you wonder if they are alive. One lady gets a spike through one of her hands and she doesn't even try to pull it out with her other free hand. Another lady with a wounded ankle hears zombies hacking away at the door she's standing next to, so she sends her companion to "go get her husband", leaving her all alone. Why wouldn't she leave, too? <br /><br />The gore was quite aggressive, but not realistic enough to be of interest, and there were too many scenes that drag on. The director shows us lots of slow moving shadows, trails of blood that go on and on before the source is discovered, and slow-moving zombies that wander for so long that you wonder how they could trap anybody.<br /><br />Where the movie really fails is in its lack of appealing characters. "Burial Ground" features so many morons that I was rooting for the zombies. My favorite character (and apparently everyone's favorite character) was the one that was supposed to be a young boy but was obviously an adult actor portraying a child. Ironically, it wasn't even a child who dubbed the voice. I was less than impressed by the zombies, some of whom had obviously healthy eyeballs staring out from the bones of their exposed skulls. One sequence showing zombie heads being smashed and shot has them all break open just like clay pots, because that's basically what they are.<br /><br />The most obvious debt that the makers of "Burial Ground" owe is to Amando DeOssorio, creator of the "Blind Dead" series, which this movie bears more than just a passing resemblance to. Admittedly, there was one brilliant moment of absurdity: a notorious sequence where the little boy, now a zombie, rips his mother's breast off with his teeth. It's the age-old zombie clich√© where a dead loved one is somehow mistaken for living. "Burial Ground" gets points for taking it to such ludicrous....heights?
