Allen plays Emmanuelle. The beautiful woman who meets and falls for Haffron (PAUL MICHAEL ROBINSON). He is one good looking guy. And She is one hot babe. They hit it off well and continue to have great sex through the 7 part series. I think it will be a tragedy if this show doesn't come to america. They tried to rope the 7 episodes in an hour and a half tape. It didn't work out. I want to see all 7 episodes uncut. The sex scene choreography is great. And Kudos to Paul Michael Robinson and Krista Allen for being so great with nudity. They ARE NOT shy. Allen is already a rising star and we should start hearing more about her soon. As for Paul Michael Robinson he has the potential to become a great actor. He can act, he's great looking, and will show nudity (how many actors can you say that about). I read someone said that the leads lack charisma. It's the best charisma I've seen in these kind of movies. ATTENTION!!: LET'S START A GROUP STATING WE WANT EMMANUELLE IN SPACE BROUGHT TO VIDEO IN 7 PARTS UNEDITED!!!!<br /><br />KRISTA ALLEN RULES!!!<br /><br />PAUL MICHAEL ROBINSON!!!!!---YOU RULE!!!!
