I don't know if this has a spoiler in it or not but I'm not taking any chances. I am probably wearing my feelings on my sleeve with this movie, too, as I am an adopted person myself. Don't know why I have watched this film more than once because I always get so mad~~~which is pretty silly. I hated that Gail's parents couldn't bring themselves to tell her she was adopted, how Gail's adopted mother told the birthmother that her other two children "were their own", Gail's look of icky disgust when her birthmother was lower-middle-class (Gail looked at the woman as if she had leprosy), the fact that the birthmother was portrayed as common, and the snippiness of both the adoptive mother and the 16-year-old sister. Of course, the father was a complete idiot. Had I been the housekeeper, I'd have poisoned the whole bunch of them except, well, cute little Natalie Wood.<br /><br />Okay, so I'm a tad sensitive, so sue me. I know that few adoptees are as fortunate as I am to have found my birthparents and that they are wonderful people, and my half-siblings (well, most of them) are sweet and accepting. I have an adoptive mother I adore and who never kept my adoption secret; she is nearly 90 now and I worship the ground she floats above.<br /><br />Anyway, movie plots back then were a bit different (gross understatement). For those not adopted, I guess it's a cutesy-pie little trip, but I hate this movie and this is the LAST time I will ever watch it!
