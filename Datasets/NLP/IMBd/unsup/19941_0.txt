I saw the film in the Dutch cinema's and I liked it very much. It's controversial but that's exactly what I like about film, it does something with an audience. This film provokes a lot of different reactions. The movies feels like a extravagant soap episode and I can absolutely recommend this film to men and woman. It's funny, controversial and unique. I want to applaud Tom Six for this daring movie. I hope to rent this movie abroad and I also look forward to his next film about a lesbian love. I am sure it is gonna be even better than Gay in Amsterdam! Enjoy the movie and don't take it too serious like so many people do!
