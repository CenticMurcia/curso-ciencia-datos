Of all the made for television movies I've ever watched, this was one of them. Jamie-Lynn DiScala gave a performance worthy of this film. She showed her range, moving from the known quantity of Meadow Soprano to the sleazy world of satisfying Hollywood players. But even still, this movie was all about Jason Stewart. Slap another mole on that boy. "Ivan, Ivan! Just a couple, please!" When I heard that line, I truly believed he was a paparazzi. Now it doesn't even matter that I didn't really see any photographers themselves, so I couldn't point him out. But all I needed was to hear that line. Perhaps we are better off having not seen him, but the outside of that nightclub came alive when JStew shouted. Well done, phone-slap.
