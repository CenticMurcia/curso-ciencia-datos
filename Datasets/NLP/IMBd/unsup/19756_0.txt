Dialogue, anyone? Or perhaps people are satisfied that 90% of this movie contained lines such as, "ARRRRGGGHHH!!", "AHHHHHH!!" and "ROOOOOOAR!" And the real treat: 500 different ways to see sharp objects inserted into a human body! I don't care about extreme use of violence for the sake of art (or just good old fashioned entertainment!), but in Gangs of New York the violence neither furthers the plot nor makes us care about any of the characters. After viewing this movie I am left with the feeling that I have seen some crappy teen slasher film, only this time the characters wore period costumes and, instead of 90 minutes, the movie went on for 3 hours. However, if you cut out all the bludgeon/stabbing scenes, then this movie would only have 15 minutes worth of plot/ideas to work with, so I suppose the "filler" was necessary.
