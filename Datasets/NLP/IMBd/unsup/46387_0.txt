This movie seems to be just half way thought through and certainly made the writers jump through hoops to continue the story line. But what is incomprehensible is the ending. However screwed up the world was in 3300 or whatever year it was.....to have Taylor make the decision he made.....underscored that Dr Zaus was right about humanity. Certainly the worst of the 5 movies and what an incredibly terrible moral message.<br /><br />
