This film was a waste of energy, time and money. In a sense, this movie is interesting, but mostly intense. The four quarters of the film did a so and so job. The one I find the most disturbing is the part where a group of Hispanic youths decide to loot (a disgrace to Hispanics everywhere), along with all other riot scenes and junk. I find it hard to believe that one of the Latino kids would thank and praise Rodney King for this (looting). King didn't want this and he didn't say to riot. MLK Jr. would turn over in his grave. I can't try hard enough to understand this garbage (racism and riot). To Bse-1, it's OK to say your opinion, but try not to be racist you twit, OK. The Latino boy didn't suck, though he played the looter. I can't believe I wasted my time posting this, though it stinks. Some junk for your head.
