"Revelation" ended up in my home by a fluke. Boy is someone in the doghouse for that one...it was an innocent enough mistake (with "End of Days" and other millenial thrillers out there). "Revelation" though isn't just a millenial thriller. Its a millenial thriller produced by the religious right.<br /><br />Okay, its hard to review "Revelation" as *just* a movie without tipping one's hand about its religious point of view. So, to be fair, fundamentalist Christians are likely to be entertained by this film. If you happen to fall into the majority of the world's population that isn't Christian, or the even larger majority that isn't *fundamentalist* Christian, you'll get a glimpse into the eerie world of apocolyptic Christian prophecy (or, even worse, a glimpse into what happens when no gay people are involved in the making of a major motion picture).<br /><br />Its clearly good guy/bad guy, black and white, good vs. evil (not a problem in and of itself). However, I think most people are at a loss about exactly *what* they would do if given the choice between 1) surrendering to the authority of an evil anti-christ or 2) putting up with the self-righteous banter of the films' good guys. Isn't there a door #3? What happened to all the Buddhists?<br /><br />An over-the-top performance from a queeny John Lithgow-wannabe playing the anti-christ's right-hand man doesn't help. Amateurish elements pop-up periodically. Real life TV televangelists show up on the television throughout the film. This is where the film becomes truly unbelievable. Instead of hitting the remote control, the characters in this film actually *watch* them! Even more unbelievably, the televangelists are on the t.v. screen for more than 30 seconds without even once hitting the audience up for cash.<br /><br />The "Revelation"...this movie stinks.<br /><br />LeeCushing<br /><br />
