Shame on you!If you haven't seen this movie yet, and you're thinking it would be a good film to watch, I might have lost some respect for you.Overall, this was a terrible movie.The acting was horrendous, the special effects were complete crap, and the whole story line is absolutely ridiculous and quite laughable even.The "SCARY" parts are as bout as scary a cute little puppy dog, and the characters are as bout as believable as a magical wonderland full of fairies, goblins, and dragons.The only thing good about it, was that it was ACTUALLY entertaining, and it kept my interest, but don't think that means I'm telling you to watch it.By all means, avoid this film for as long as you can, and I'm sure you won't suffer TOO much of a loss.
