My fave Charlie Brown holiday film. Chuck is a cluck again, but Snoppy and Woodstock save the day - and Thanksgiving - when they prepare a beautiful gourmet meal.... for a beagle and a birdie, that is.<br /><br />After Charlie Brown gets himself into hot water for the zillionth time by inviting too many kids over for the festive holiday, it's up to his pet doggie and Snoopy's best friend Woodstock to pull a rabbit out of a hat, or in this case, a turkey.<br /><br />Super-fun movie with the beautiful fall atmosphere all around in the form of colorful leaves on the ground and the smell of hot food in the air. Happy Thanksgiving!!! :)
