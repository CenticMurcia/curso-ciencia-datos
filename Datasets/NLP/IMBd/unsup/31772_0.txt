I do not get it. Why are so many people rushing to call this film the worst film ever? If it was competing for an Oscar, I would say it was a bad choice. But this film is actually above average for the genre that it is in. It sort of reminded my of "Blue Velvet" only much better in my opinion and everyone went nuts over that film.<br /><br />If you ask me, the movie reviewers are giving this film low ratings because they are haters. Plain and simple. I fail to see how this film is "hillariously bad".<br /><br />The film is suppose to be funny in parts like the scenes where the strip joint manager comes off almost cartoonesqe. Were she not this way, the viewer of the film would not get the proper queues that this may or may not be simply a figment of the protagonist's imagination. But you are suppose to see the life of Dakota as story-like because you don't really know what is going on until toward the end of the movie. The plot, however, is solid enough to carry you entertainingly to that point when everything become clearer. It is a thriller and I must say it is executed with textbook formulaic perfection.<br /><br />One of the better films I saw in 2008, which is not saying much . . . especially when you consider that I sat through "I Am Legend". :(<br /><br />I am giving this film a 10 out of 10, simply because someone needs to balance out all of the falsely low ratings. If I thought everyone was voting thoughtfully, I would give this film a 4 or maybe even a 5. But I see several users have given this film a rating of 1 and, take it from someone who is a very skilled appreciator of film, even if you did not like this film, it at least deserves a 3. <br /><br />All in all, I would say, not as bad as some films that everyone says are great! A relatively intelligent film . . .
