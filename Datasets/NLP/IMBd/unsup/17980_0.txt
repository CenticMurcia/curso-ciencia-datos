I've loved this film since I first saw it. There aren't many films that have me in stitches with laughter, but this one sure does. Walter Matthau is perfect as Mr. Wilson and Joan Plowright gives a very heartfelt performance as Martha Wilson. Lea Thompson is great as Dennis' mother and Christopher Lloyd is so delightfully icky as Switchblade Sam - he looks like he's bathed in oil slick and then raided a mental patient's wardrobe. And those teeth! I just about fall of the couch during the sabotaged toiletries scene - the scream that Matthau let's loose upon using the 'nasal spray' is priceless. And don't get me started on the scene where Dennis breaks Mr. Wilson's dentures and replaces them with chicklets. One of my favourite kids films and one I'll no doubt keep coming back too.Highly recommended.
