"If These Walls Could Talk" is a disturbing and yet emotionally powerful film that's set in the same house on the same street over three different decades (the first segment takes place in the early 1950's, the second is set in the mid-1970's and the third in the mid-1990's...all tumultuous eras in which issues affecting females and their bodies have been brought to the forefront). It details what happens when three women of varying ages are suddenly forced to face the difficult and very personal choices that must be made concerning their unplanned pregnancies. Demi Moore, Sissy Spacek and Anne Heche are all nearly perfect in their respective roles as the three leading women at odds with family members, friends and society in general over the situations that they've found themselves in. Cher (who also co-produced this film) is wonderful as well in a small supporting role as an abortion doctor who in my humble opinion has the most clear-headed view on the troubling matter of almost any other character in the entire movie. Altogether, "If These Walls Could Talk" is a truly exceptional flick from HBO that forcefully deals with the mammoth topic of abortion which in all honesty is a very hard one to tackle especially with as much tact and delicacy as this film has!
