This is an under-appreciated Western, perhaps due to the unorthodox casting on a Tasmanian native as the lead. Nevertheless, Errol Flynn does a creditable job. With Guinn Big Boy Williams and Alan Hale supplying the comic sidekick roles, the movie moves along at a steady and enjoyable pace.<br /><br />Flynn is the cowboy finally willing to clean up the town after the death of a boy. He gives the "enough is enough" line, and takes over. Olivia de Havilland is the love interest. Veteran movie baddies Bruce Cabot and Victor Jory are the villains. Frank McHugh adds charm to his role as a newspaper editor.<br /><br />Director Michael Curtiz kept the movie well paced. The action is fast and plausible. Each time I see it I grow to enjoy it more.
