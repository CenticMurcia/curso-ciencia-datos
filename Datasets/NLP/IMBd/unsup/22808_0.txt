The story takes place in the Nevada desert Frank Bolger is a conspicuous man in the community who also happens to run a drug-smuggling ring on the side The local sheriff is in on it, acting as his hit man.<br /><br />After a hot scene with one of the local women, Bolger orders the sheriff to eliminate the Apache (John Milo), an Indian who has been cutting into their marijuana sales... The sheriff reluctantly agrees, takes the boss's woman home, and relieves his frustrations on her before trying to carry the Indian away <br /><br />Meyer does indeed have a fascination for very richly gifted women, and this film is no exception The scene where Bolger talks the nurse into giving him a body massage is a classic erotic tease Also, Meyer has very cleverly juxtaposed a sensual lesbian scene against a bloody battle between the sheriff and the Indian But much of the sex is unmotivated Meyer cuts so quickly, however, that it is more of a lack of respect tease than an exploitive treatment of sex <br /><br />Larissa Ely (Raquel) is wonderful as the steamy, sweaty, desert young woman Linda Ashton (Cherry) is delightful as the sexy nurse, but Charles Napier steals the show as the violent, explosive, cruel of a sheriff
