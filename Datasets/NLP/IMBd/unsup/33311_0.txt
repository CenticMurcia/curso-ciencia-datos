This movie was terrible in so many ways. I can't believe that the writers and directors got away with churning out this crap. What started as a love story between teacher and student turns suddenly and painfully towards a stay-in-school moral. Not bad if perhaps you were forced to watch this in school instead of studying, but not even worth watching on TV.<br /><br />But the music was filled with some decent typical 80s moments... especially whenever the music took over. And although you might think that JLo was in this movie after seeing it, you won't find her anywhere in the movie or in the credits.
