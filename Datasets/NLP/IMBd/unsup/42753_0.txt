Denis Leary and Colm Meaney headline the cast of Monument Ave. but the deadly combination was boring storyline and not one single character that the viewer could care about. Leary is a gambling cokehead car thief and works for Meaney's Irish crime boss. He is surround by friends and relatives that are equally as stupid and ignorant as he is, and he is sleeping with Meaney's girlfriend. When Meaney has one cousin killed and later another the story is played that Leary is torn between the code of silence and family loyalty. I didn't see any conflict at all. He made a decision and did it, but there wasn't any conflicting emotions. This movie looks great when adverstised on the back of its box, but it was deathly awful having to watch it.
