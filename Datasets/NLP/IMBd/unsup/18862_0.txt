I have to admit that when I was sitting down to watch this last night, I was skeptical. While I was never a fan of director Rob Zombie's brand of music, I did hold out hopes that his penchant for the depraved would translate into at least a B grade horror flick. I was wrong. What ensued was something that was perhaps as tasteful and visually presentable as a Rainn Wilson-fish. Now, in defense of the film, it set out its goal of being deliciously trashy (at least I hope that was the goal), but I found that after about 20 minutes, the poor acting stopped being funny, the porno-grade directing was beyond laughable, and the movie was not in the slightest bit interesting. I'm no movie snob, but this movie was much worse than my already low expectations. I was expecting a movie with no substance, lots of gore, poor acting, highly suspect character choices (you're driving away from a house full of crazy people! Why the hell would you get out of the car?!), and most importantly, plenty of startling moments that would make me jump out of my seat. This movie unfortunately contained far too much of the former, and not nearly enough of the latter. If you ever find yourself holding a copy of this at blockbuster, put it down and go rent some porn. You'll find a movie with higher production values, better direction and twice the plot.
