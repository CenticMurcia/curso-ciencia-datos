Brooks plays a neurotic screenwriter who's lost his writing "edge" and finds a real-life muse to put the spark back into his work.<br /><br />Speaking of "edge", it's evident Brooks has lost his with this film. He tries to poke fun at Hollywood, but its mostly very light-hearted, a bit disjointed, and only occasionally funny. Brooks has done some fine films in the past (Broadcast News, Defending Your Life), but this isn't one of them. Some interesting cameos from a variety of directors, and a good comedic turn by Sharon Stone just can't save this movie. For a better, more cynical take on Hollywood, see The Player.
