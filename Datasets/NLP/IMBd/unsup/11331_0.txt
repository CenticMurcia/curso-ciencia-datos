Gaining from five more years of CGI technology advancements, this movie is far superior than the original Dungeons & Dragons, even if still lacking the blockbuster status. The story is a good one, for D&D standards, and most of the peculiarities of the game are well inserted in the plot. From the choosing of the five heroes to return the orb, each with his/her skills put in evidence during the course of the story, to the villains - a lich, a necromancer, an undead skeletal dragon - to the use of D&D deities - Obadai. All the choices in the movies are well done, the casting is very good, with a good mix of races and male and female heroes, and the total effect is a good cinematic adventure, better than a more publicized effort like the infamous Earthsea.
