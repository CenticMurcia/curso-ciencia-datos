As with most Roadrunner cartoons there is not much of a plot just lots of failed attempts by Wile E Coyote to catch the Roadrunner for his dinner. His methods are amusing though; the best being the the pop-up barrier he installs in the road, of course it doesn't work when the Roadrunner goes past but a few minutes when Coyote is using "Acme Triple-Strength Fortified Leg Muscle Vitamins" which enable him to run so fast he literally sets the road on fire this barrier springs up just in time for him to run into it.<br /><br />If you like other Warner Brothers' cartoons I'm sure you'll like this although if I wanted to watch a few Roadrunner shorts I'd mix them in with other character's cartoons or they might seem rather repetitive.
