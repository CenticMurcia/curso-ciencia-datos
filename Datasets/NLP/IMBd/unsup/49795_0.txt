It was supposed to be a horror, thriller but disappointingly the only horror that occurred was the money I spent for the cinema ticket. The film was so boring with extremely terrible acting, the only good actress was Michelle Rodriguez and the film was watch able because of her but what is the use of having a good actress in a rubbish film? The story is a hundred years old about a few friends on holiday & something is after them. Films like that have been tackled a zillion times in Hollywood, what was the point in turning it into a zillion & one now? The most stupid thing in the film is that every time they kill one dog then two dogs appear out of nowhere maybe there is a Killer Dog factory around the place somewhere. It is not mentioned clearly that why these dogs are killing people without a reason probably because they see whipped cream & a cherry on top above people's heads. My personal advice would be to avoid this film because it will save your money & time. While I was watching it in the cinemas a few people just left the hall half way through the film and they didn't come back! Worth a miss.
