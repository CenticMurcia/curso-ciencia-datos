I'm sorry. I know that I'm going to get my head bitten off, but Halle Berry is not as great of an actress that everyone wants her to be. I have been extremely disappointed for years with Halle's performances. In this movie, there was no exception. It seems that if there is a sex scene, that is when we see her act her best. Spoken parts just seem not to be her strong suit. Michael Ealy is generally a powerful actor in movies he is in. But I was not feeling Tea Cake at all. It has always been said that: "The book is always better than the movie." And this is true, but sometimes the movie can be as effective as the book it is portraying. But this movie was highly disappointing. I'm a black college student and I read this book my freshmen year in college. I was moved by this wonderful piece of art and excited when they said that there was going to be a movie. While watching the movie, I was shaking my head and thinking of better characters to play in this movie. And I can name plenty. It might be a good movie to watch, if you are a Halle Berry fan. If you aren't really a fan, don't bother.
