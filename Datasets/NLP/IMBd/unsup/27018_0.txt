A good action movie that will hook you on for the entire ride. The story may not be that groundbreaking or unique, but the action is well-done and the pace is very fast, a true thriller. I also like the way boomer is constantly dragged into scenario that he is totally not accountable. You can say that he is extremely unlucky, but ironically, he survived miraculously many time whereas he should be dead. I like this setting even though it has been used before.
