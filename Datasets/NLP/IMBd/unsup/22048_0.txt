Well, there is nothing to tax the old brain cells on this one. It is a very straightforward plot of a young but poor Irishman who sees no sense in being perpetually cheated for the price of cattle and so dares to form a local cattle drive to bypass the local buyers by taking them directly to market some 40 miles away. But it is the beauty and grace of the characters of Mark and his friends who refuse to be bullied, the wonderful countryside and a haunting musical theme that entrance the viewer. Each obstacle is a test of character and irrational acts of violence never precipitate.<br /><br />How not to lose your temper might be the motto here. But the final result is a very endearing and moving experience.
