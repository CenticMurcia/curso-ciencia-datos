The Doom Generation completely blew me away, from the first kinetic moment, to it's supercharged and ultra-violent ending. Two teenagers, Amy Blue and Jordan White lie in their car pondering the meaning of love and life when Xavier Red jumps into their car and starts the first of a string of violent happenings. The three embark on an immoral road trip through America, driving wherever the road takes them, and punctuate their journey with brutal murders, and kinky sex. Eventually, they get what they deserve when they run into a gang of crazy nazis.<br /><br />The Doom Generation features some terrific performances by three very talented young stars, Johnathon Schaech, James DuVall and Rose McGowan (who was brilliant in Strange Hearts and equally enticing here). Generation X director Gregg Araki delivers a gruesome but entertaining look at what can happen when three potentially dangerous teenagers can do when they get very, very bored. The film is directed with a glossy feel and atmosphere, adding to it's overall fun. However, some scenes take it too far, and even I couldn't sit through it without wincing, and I wouldn't be surprised if a couple of people have threwn up while watching it.<br /><br />I give it 2.5/4
