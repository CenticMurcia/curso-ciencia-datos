Based on a thoroughly excellent novel of the same name by Stella Gibbons, this movie is grand. Kate does a lovely job as the Austen-esquire heroine who plunges herself into an uncivilized world for the benefit of its inhabitants. I cannot think of one poorly developed character in this movie. Mr. Mybug (Stephen Fry) does a grand job of 'that creep everyone's met at least once', and cousin Amos (Ian McKellan) is the best English spitfire I've seen on screen. Seth (Rufus Sewell) is an especially favorite character, and this is one of the most quotable movies in the house. While very tongue-in-cheek throughout most of the movie, the ending is exceedingly feel-good. If you enjoy British humor, or just listening to the accents, definitely check this out. "There'll be no butter in HELL!!!"
