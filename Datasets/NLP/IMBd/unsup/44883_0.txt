One expects a predictable plot in a typical exploit-what-a-demographic-likes- and-take-it-to-the-bank Hollywood puke, however, this film will be a shameless assault on your sanity. You know what characters will say and do at the opening of every sequence. At two hours long, it is a true endurance test, particularly considering that I would have gotten up and left after 10 minutes (or, rather, not gone at all) if I hadn't been dragged to it by someone else.<br /><br />The one thing that did amuse me about the movie (which I'm sure the rest of the audience missed) was the Full Metal Jacket homage at the beginning. Finding<br /><br />the lead character so irritating only a few minutes in, I was quite disappointed he did not receive a punch to the gut during his confrontation with the<br /><br />"sergeant".<br /><br />If you like drumming or whatever, then go see it. You'll probably like it. But if look for anything else in your cinematic experience, you will be bored.
