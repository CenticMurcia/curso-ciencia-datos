Dr. Frankenstein, meet your monster! Mike Binder wrote, directed, and starred as a husband who gets to make his own bed only to find that he is no longer needed to lie in it! Mariel Hemmingway steals the film as the wife who takes charge after giving into hubby's desire to expand her sexual horizons. She looks fantastic too, and is incredibly sexy without ever actually revealing her breasts.<br /><br />It is sweet justice watching the lesbian partners express the husband's insignificance by gently lowering their partner's head while ignoring his whines. Once he realizes how this has gotten out of hand, the results are surprisingly twisted and contorted to an hilarious extent. And the grand finale is priceless.<br /><br />If it doesn't embarrass you to watch a movie about sex, this is a marvelous escape from grim realities.
