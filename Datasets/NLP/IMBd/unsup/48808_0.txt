What is it about J.J. Abrams that he keeps getting bad shows (and now bad movies like MI:3 and Cloverfield) on the air? Alias is a study on what not to do if you want to make a good TV show.<br /><br />First of all, you need to avoid the J.J. "Plot Hole" Abrams way of not caring about whether the story makes any sense.<br /><br />Then you need to instruct your actors to act, rather than pose for the camera. Even when she is in danger, Jennifer Garner keeps on looking like she is making a spread for Vogue. That's not acting, that modeling! Finally, you need to worry a lot less about the hype and a lot more about real quality, although these days, Hollywood seems intent on committing Hari Kiri by hiring bad writer-producers like J.J. Abrams again and again to watch them fail again and again.
