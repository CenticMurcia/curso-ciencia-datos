Along with Point Break and Spice World, Doc Hollywood is in a three-way horse race for the title of worst movie ever made. This "film" induced so many boredom-induced migraines that I prayed for the sweet release of death more than once.<br /><br />Okay, maybe I'm going overboard, but this truly is one movie I hope I never have to experience again. What makes it so bad is that it is meant to be taken as a plausible movie, what with stars like Michael J. Fox and Woody Harrelson (worst actor ever) at the helm. Such a pointless story with no laughs, the one lingering highlight of the film is the breast-shot of the chick in the movie. The fact that they were no more than B-cups yet remain the most memorable aspect of this movie should say it all.
