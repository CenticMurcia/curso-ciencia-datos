You've got Humphrey Bogart, Barbara Stanwyck and Alexis Smith in a film and yet it stinks. Where did this film go wrong?<br /><br />Bogart stars as a crazed killer who has already murdered his first unseen wife and is well on his way to do in wife #2 played by Barbara Stanwyck. In a way, I thought Miss Stanwyck was using this film as a dress rehearsal for her Oscar nominated performance in the following year for "Sorry, Wrong Number."<br /><br />Ann Carter stars as Bea, Bogart's daughter from his first marriage. The child is precocious. She sounds like a 40 year old rather than a child of 8 or 9 which she is supposed to be.<br /><br />Nigel Bruce is somewhat effective as the doctor to Stanwyck who loves his "occasional" drink and obsessive talking about the burglar-strangler on the loose.<br /><br />The heavy rain and dark atmosphere adds to eeriness of the production. Problem is that the plot can be figured out in about 10 minutes.
