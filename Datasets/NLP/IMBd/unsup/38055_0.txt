<br /><br />Lousy is not enough to say how bad the script is. It doesn't really have a story and try to portrait this "surreal" environment on very slim intellectual background. It is a pure waste of time and money to watch it. Whoever are affiliated with this movie have made a terrible business and career mistake. Two thumbs down, way down. If the rating has -10, I will give it to this one.
