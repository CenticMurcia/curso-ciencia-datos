A poor movie. It's a bad Batman copy. Everything is going wrong. Not very exciting, not fascinating, not ... . Three Points. For Elfman's score, the nice directing but nothing more. As it is was over, I was happy that I hadn't seen it in the cinema, just only on TV. Raimi, Neeson and Mc Dormand can do their job much better. They have proved it. Please, not such a failure again.
