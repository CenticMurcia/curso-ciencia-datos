I just watched this episode today. And, it seems as though every time I watch it. I get chills. The ones that are saying this episode is too preachy. You maybe right to a degree. However, this episode makes a powerful, and chilling statement.<br /><br />Some who commented above said that he "Used" to think that this episode was preachy. But, no more. If you look around, especially with the Obama administration. We are seeing more, and more government control. And, the American people just seem to give in today. All, in the name of safety. And, also in the name of anit piracy. Obama wants to pass a law. That would give law enforcement the power to come in to your home without a warrent. And, confiscate computers that are suspected to hold illegal copywritten material. No, search warrant, only if they suspect that you have such material If this isn't' a form of nearly total government control. I don't know what is. And, no offense to the ones who say this episode is "Preachy". But, if I had any complaints whatsoever. it would be that maybe this episode wasn't preachy enough. Given, the fact that we are, where we are today. And, someone in the above post. Also illuded that perhaps this was a slam against Democrats. I disagree. I believe that Rod was say that any for of government can be like this. Rebuplicans, and Democrats a like.<br /><br />To, those who haven't seen it. Strap in, and be ready for an intellectual ride. In my view, this episode is by far my favorite.
