Firstly, I cannot understand the tired and cynical comments by 'Coventry' at the top of this page or the measly rating of 7.2 out of 10. 'An average war film' indeed  one has to wonder whether he/she actually watched it! You only have to read the comments by viewers on this page to see the truth  this is a brilliant and important film. It puts the typical 'Hollywood WW2 blockbuster' completely in the shade and shows them up for what they are  just entertainment for the unthinking masses and big profits for the film moguls. <br /><br />This film shows how real and ordinary men behave in extraordinary circumstances and fortunately is devoid of the Waynes, Mitchums, McQueens, Hanks etc. and their like. I have to compliment the Japanese actors for having the courage to portray their fellow countrymen committing such awful acts of violence. <br /><br />The film is very well acted and very thought provoking. The only criticism I can make is that (naturally) all the POW actors looked too well fed and muscular! The reality is that they were mainly skin and bone and disease ridden (shown briefly in black and white photos). I had a problem knowing which approach I would have taken under the same circumstances  the quiet forgiveness of your enemy or the burning desire to take revenge on them for perpetrating such hideous war crimes.<br /><br />This film should be made compulsory viewing for every man and woman over 18 years of age. Perhaps then people would get some idea of what 'going to war' can lead to.
