The perfect soap opera, Meerkat Manor has it all. With dangerous liaisons, mob family fighting, and internal family rivalries this show could easily pass for any prime time soap; the only difference is the players are 12" tall. Each half hour episode ends with a cliffhanger to get you back next week to see what happens. The first season ended with a huge mystery that they say will be explained when the second season opens. The shows main family is the Whiskers headed by Flower (the dominant female) and her current mate Zaphod. Zaphod's neurotic brother Youssarian causes mischief and is always on the lookout to mate. Three of Flower's daughters, Daisy, Tosca, and Mozart have mated without permission. The perfect son, Shakespeare, looks after his little siblings though it could cost him his life. This is just within the Whisker's family. The Lazuli family is always on the lookout to take control of the Whisker's territory, and meerkats fight to the death. Throw in the natural predators of the Kalahari and you never know who will live or die.
