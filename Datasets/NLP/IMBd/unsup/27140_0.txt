Esily, the worst of the Ernest line, but there are still lessons to be learned, and enjoyment to be had.<br /><br />This should have been entitled, "Ernest and the Magick Shoes," however, Slam Dunk will have to suffice.<br /><br />Ernest AKA Jim Varney, brings his usual charm and great redneck style to this work, in spite of the work's detriment of bearing ghetto-branded plot line, movie props, and message.<br /><br />But beneath all that, there is another message...one you're familiar with if you read my reviews regularly: Hold Onto Your Dreams.<br /><br />Ernest is a likable little fella, whose life is a noir work, and whose physical appearance is reminiscent of a living-breathing cartoon character. He enjoyed a rather large following while he was alive, and many still love him and his works.<br /><br />This is the worst of the run, and as such, rates a 3.4/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
