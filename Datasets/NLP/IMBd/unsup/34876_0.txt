If you love the ever burgeoning list of computer animated flicks, it's worth seeing "Robots" just for the superb visual design. In fact, that's the only reason to see it.<br /><br />This is a "schtick" movie, like the classic Warner Brothers cartoons of the 40's & 50's. I can handle that for 3 or 4 minutes, but not for the 91 minute running time of this movie. The folks at Blue Sky have failed to learn what Pixar has always known: Story. Story. Story.<br /><br />"Robots" treats us to a pastiche of set pieces stuck together by a plot that is so clich√©d it's virtually impossible to put a spoiler in here because you've already seen it all before: Evil corporation, valiant naive hero, funny sidekick, "you're okay just as you are" theme. And it's really too bad because "Robots" is a visual treat. The gleaming surfaces and rounded designs remind me nostalgically of my parents 1955 Chevy Bel Air. But even there it doesn't always make sense. Whether something is a robot or not depends not on the story, but on whether they can get a joke out of it.<br /><br />See it for the visuals. Skip it for the story. It's one of those "near miss"" movies that will frustrate you, because it could have been great.
