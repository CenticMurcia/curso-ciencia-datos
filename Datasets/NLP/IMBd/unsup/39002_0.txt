The whole premise of this movie is that the Cofederates had won the war the institution of slavery would have continued up to the present day. According to the movie the Confederates won the battle of Gettysburg with military intervention form Great Britian and France. However, one of the most important reasons why GB didn't add it's support to the Confederate war effort was it's opposition to slavery ! In the course of the movie we are also told that the Jewish population of America was decimated because of Confederate Aryan attitudes. In the 19th century in America the Jews were seen as being a "pest" both North and South, as well as the native Americans, the Mexicans and the Irish. In fact both Generals Grant and Sherman were rather anti-semetic. Nowadays these stupid ideas are mostly gone which would have also happened under a Confederate government. I have a ton of problems with this movie but I'll stop here at this last one ......the flag. We are supposed to believe that the old Confederate battle banner would be the national flag until the present day without the inclusion of the stars for the union states or any other new states !
