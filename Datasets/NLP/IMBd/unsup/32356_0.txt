This movie brings a whole new level to terrible films. Everything is heavy handed, and when it seems that the filmmakers couldn't think of anymore ridiculous action sequences they filled it in with over-drawn, slow motion explosions, slow motion scenes of John Cena running, or slow motion scenes of a car flying through the air. And then there's the "comic relief," which mainly consists of Anthony Ray Parker's character whining about having to do stuff or telling some lame story that makes "Who's Your Caddy?" seem hilarious. The music seems like a guy on a soundboard was just making it up as he went along. The action, when it happens, isn't bad, and it would seem that the only thing John Cena CAN do (because he certainly can't act) is beat the crap out of people while grunting and growling like a caveman. If John Cena ever wins an Oscar (presumably the same year that gravity is disproved) it would be for the best animatronics in a movie, although I think that he still has less emotional range then that talking tree from "The Lord of the Rings." In short, John Bonito proves to be a talentless hack of a director. I can imagine him looking at the fully edited film and saying, "Oh, that's how it turned out? Oh well I still get paid." But the films vileness cannot completely be blamed on him. The actors (with the exception of Robert Patrick, who is fortunate that few people will see him in this nightmare of a movie) could be out-acted by third graders doing a play about vegetables.
