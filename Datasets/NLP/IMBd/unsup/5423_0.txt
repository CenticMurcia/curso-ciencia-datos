Yo Puta is nothing more than a pretentious soft porn documentary about prostitution, that doesn't do anything else than making its male viewers horny. It has no depth or intriguing characters whatsoever, just dirty talk, nudity and uninteresting opinions. The '' fictive '' part is so bad that it makes you want to puke instantly. How on earth could actresses like Daryll Hannah and Denise Richards lend their face for a horrible product like this?! I can just name one thing that is more degrading, and that's starring in an adult movie...<br /><br />I was truly shocked by the way this movie actually glamorizes prostitution, knowing how much grief this degrading job brings to a lot of women. As long as there are still so much under aged girls and women that are forced to work in this business, I think it's completely inappropriate to glamorize prostitution.
