My dad was the third bigot in the credits. This laughable rendition of Mormon history was a patchwork lunacy staffed by local theater people and a shoddy productions company. At the time, the actors thought they were making an epic, they even were told the man who produced EL Cid was the brains behind the operation. The casting is way off. I mean, Richard Moll plays the founder of the Mormon Church, Joseph Smith. This was well before his fame in Night Court, as the tall bumbling court security guard, and the casting choice is hilarious. It would be like Wilt Chamberlain playing Martin Luther King. Any way, the joke in our family has always been to call our father the third bigot. Good Stuff for a campy night at the cinema
