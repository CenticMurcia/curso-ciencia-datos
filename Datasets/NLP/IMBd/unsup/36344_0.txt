It is a romantic comedy that is not that funny and not that romantic.<br /><br />The romantic couple never interacted that much early in the movie to dislike each other or to later fall in love. The secondary characters were generally obnoxious, which was the writers intent, but I never grew to like them. A dysfunctional family that stayed dysfunctional to the end. And two horny divorc√©es would not end up with Richard Dryfuss. There is nothing endearing about an old lady that steals constantly. It makes American's look bad. The premise that the owner of the company would make some of her customers miserable on purpose did not make sense. I just tolerated the movie because it was snowing.
