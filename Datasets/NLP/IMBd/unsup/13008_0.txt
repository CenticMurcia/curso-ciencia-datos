Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) is a graduate student doing research on an urban legend named 'Candyman' who is supposed to be haunting the Cabrini-Green housing project in Chicago. Unfortunately, she finds that this is no urban legend but the tragic truth...<br /><br />A horror movie that is authentically creepy and unsettling, making it leagues ahead of other movies of its ilk. Enhanced by Philip Glass's haunting music score and a magnetic performance by Tony Todd (it has now become his signature role) as the titular being. It's unfortunately mean-spirited (and very, very gory), and, like some other horror movies, this does not show a great deal of hope for its leading character.<br /><br />Based on the story "The Forbidden" by Clive Barker, which was originally set in Liverpool (the author was executive producer of the movie). Writer / director Bernard Rose appears fleetingly on screen as "Archie Walsh."<br /><br />Star Virginia Madsen shares two scenes with her real-life friend, actress Rusty Schwimmer, who plays the policewoman.<br /><br />8/10
