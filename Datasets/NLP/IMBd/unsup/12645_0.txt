No, it's not as good as The Thing, but then few movies are. However it stands on its own merits as a very entertaining and intriguing movie which captures the isolation and personality quirks of those drawn to it.<br /><br />I have to disagree with those who castigate Perlman in this. I think he plays the role extremely well. Jealous, aging, beaten out by a younger guy who is in many respects a better man with apostate set of beliefs, Perlman plays the part convincingly. In fact the acting is overall excellent throughout. There is slow tension building up in a remote setting with characters who are engaging, and a growing sense of doom and helplessness. What more could a horror movie ask. The 'monsters' aren't great but then they aren't really that important to the overall plot.<br /><br />Just put the absurdity of the eco-nut underlying theme out of mind and you will enjoy a creepy and well done dramatic film. And most likely learn what a Rolligon is if you don't already know.
