(spoilers??)<br /><br />At least this movie has a story to tell. The camera angles are better than that of the Blair Witch Project. ;) Hmmmm how bout the Erotic Witch Project? lol. whoops. Which reminds me, both films have a female with stretch marks. Any takers? But really, I think the director was intentionally going for the shock value. He says something to the effect on the dvd. It's a funny movie. Though if your a guy and paying attention to the humor and not the um a stuff. Something is a little odd for ya. ;) <br /><br />I find it interesting though that the actress playing Y is listed by IMDB as being born in 1984. When was this filmed? 1998-99? Did IMDB mess up or was the actress really 15 when the film was shot. I find it interesting that this movie made it into America then and Eyes Wide Shut (uncensored) did not. Oh well. If your bored on your Emmanuelle movies, want something a little less harsh than alssc*n. And your a movie fanatic in more ways that one. Hey jump at the chance to watch it.<br /><br />7/10<br /><br />Quality: 7/10 Entertainment: 8/10 Replayable: 8/10
