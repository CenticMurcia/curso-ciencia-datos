Weird Al was funny as usual in the intro, but that was where the laughs ended. This movie tries to recapture the humor of Airplane and The Naked Gun, but fails miserably. It seems clear that the people who put this movie together did not even understand this type of humor.<br /><br /> In Airplane, the humor lies in taking logical steps from peculiar interpretations of events. "Surely your joking" "I'm serious, and don't call me Shirley." Now that's funny.<br /><br /> This movie, however, merely has gags without context.
