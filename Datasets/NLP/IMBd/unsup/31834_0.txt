Judy Garland was incredibly talented and not in the least boring so how in the world this movie was made is beyond me. It was absolutely dreadful, boring beyond belief and in large part extremely poorly acted. The only character I managed to grow interested in was the father and they didn't develop him much.<br /><br />Andrea McCardle's voice could crack windows - I had to mute the numerous songs to keep the dogs in the neighborhood from howling. She was in way over her head for this role and didn't sound a thing like Judy Garland. Her horrid singing was only eclipsed by her equally atrocious acting, all her dialogue delivered in a flat, monotone manner. Andrea was simply awful so I'm astonished at the numerous accolades by other reviewers.<br /><br />It was free on OnDemand and this is definitely a case of you get what you pay for. Save yourself two hours and avoid this painfully embarrassing flick.
