Thank you Bruce for allowing God such unhindered access to your life during the filming of this. I don't think you will ever fully know the impact for The Kingdom that your willingness to be used by Him has had on this generation. It is an amazing piece of work. The joy that is evident in your smile told me more about Jesus Christ than anything else I have ever read or seen. Thank you for being the first Jesus to smile, to laugh and to weep with such abandon. Everybody needs to see this! Even if you are not a Christian this movie is the best adaption of the gospel according to Matthew that has ever been made. What is so brilliant is that there has been no interference from any scriptwriter. It was taken straight from the Bible - word for word and that's what counts!
