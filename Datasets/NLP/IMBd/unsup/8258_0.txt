Missed this Joan Crawford classic where she plays the role of Sadie Thompson, a woman of the streets who gets involved with a missionary and a soldier and sometimes plays the role of good and evil. There are plenty of drums beating all the time and the rain sure comes down in buckets most of the time and everything seems to be filmed in dark shadows. There are fishermen who are pulling in their nets with fish and they discover something very unusual and very large in their nets. Walter Houston, (Alfred Davidson), gives a great supporting role as the missionary who battles with his lust for Sadie Thompson and her sexual charms. Great classic film, but the acting at times gets boring and rather phony sounding.
