Great fighting! Extremely funny! Michele Yoh's performance as a drunken and jilted woman was perfect. This is one of the best examples of the hell for leather fighting film punctuated with lots of laughs. All the tricky stunts looked real. There was some wire fu. The story is based on a legend and the setting is atmospheric. A classic and two thumbs up.
