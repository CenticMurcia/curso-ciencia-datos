A mediocre movie. All through the film you get the feeling that there likely would have been much more interesting tangents to follow. Don't expect to hear much musical talent either! Jim White does add some thoughtful commentary along the way but not enough to make up for many boring sequences. I suppose if you are into offbeat and slow movies you might enjoy this one. Also this was not nearly as bad as "Last Days" which I could not even finish. If this movie represented the typical lifestyle of the Southern experience (which it does not) I would be scared as hell to go down that way. I give it four to balance out anyone who thought this deserved anything over seven.
