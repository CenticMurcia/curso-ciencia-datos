This is actually my favorite of the four Wilder/Pryor team ups. In the second of these match ups, Wilder and Pryor play a struggling playwright and actor in New York City. The two finally decide that they are sick and tired of just sitting around with their lives and careers going nowhere(we have seen this plot probably 100 times). They decide to take off in an a rickety old van across country to try and find some work and eventually end up in California.<br /><br />On the way to California, the two men get framed for a bank robbery at one of the banks they took an odd job at and end up in prison. This is where the real fun starts. Gene Wilder is especially hilarious as the more naive of the two who gets duped into competing in the prison rodeos.<br /><br />If the film did not run out of steam in the final act, I would probably rate this a nine. Still, there are some hilarious scenes here, including one where Wilder and Pryor try to look "bad" when entering the prison.
