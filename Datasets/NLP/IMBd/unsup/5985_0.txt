The late, great Robert Quarry is once again a vampire in an A.I.P. picture. The difference here is that he's not a dapper Bulgarian blood sucker but an enigmatic stranger with mustache, beard, and wig, who mysteriously appears one day and entrances a group of hippies. The philosophical musings that he utters are of great interest to them, but of course all he really wants to do is feed on them.<br /><br />"Deathmaster" wouldn't be as notable were it not for the magnetic presence of its star. Quarry is a pleasure to watch. His character is inspired by the notorious Charles Manson, and has a certain charm about him. One can see how easily impressionable people would fall for such a person. He really makes his existential dialog come to life.<br /><br />The picture serves as a good snapshot of the early 70's and parts of its culture. It looks good for its low budget ($110,000) and actor-turned-director Ray Danton keeps the picture moving along well.<br /><br />The supporting cast isn't too bad. LaSesne Hilton (in his only film role) has a very striking face as the vampire's familiar, prominent character actor John Fiedler is engaging as the unlikely source of assistance for would-be hero Pico (Bill Ewing), and sexy Betty Anne Rees, playing Esslin here, would turn up two years later as Quarry's girlfriend in "Sugar Hill". It's also a real hoot to see Bobby "Boris" Pickett of "Monster Mash" fame as one of the hippies.<br /><br />Makeup effects and gore are passable, and the music by Bill Marx is effective enough. "Deathmaster" may come off as pretty dated now, but that actually plays a part in its appeal. It truly belongs in its own time and place. It's a good dose of low-budget 70's exploitation horror.<br /><br />7/10
