Why did I rate it a 3 ?<br /><br />1) Because it's slow, and pretty boring. There's little effort from the production to create any suspense at all...<br /><br />2) Because although some of the technical aspects are rather accurate (the Dumpster Diving and all the Social Engineering) , most of them are truly absurd. *SPOILER*: the FREE KEVIN phrase, at the ATM ? Gimme a break.<br /><br />3) It's totally one-sided. It's even written by Shimomura.<br /><br />4) Pretty common to all hacker movies: quite shallow. Why didn't they even bother to depict the hackers' spirit a bit more in depth ? I truly believe the whole sequence with Amanda Peet could have been much more useful had they explored Mitnick's principles and beliefs, instead of bringing up the 1st amendment and how interesting scanning can be.<br /><br />Wouldn't recommend it to anyone. If you really want to know the true story, check out the documentary "Freedom Downtime".
