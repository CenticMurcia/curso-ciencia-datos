First of all, half of the movie is Dollman and Bad Channels. I mean, if we wanted to see those movies, we would've bought them. And what's with the 64 minute run time? What happened? Did they run out of film or something? And their are about 7 people in the whole film! Plus, some of the effects are crappy. <br /><br />Like when a hobo riding a tricycle hits a box and falls off. Then he hits his head on the ground and about 8 gallons of blood comes out. He didn't even hit his head that hard! The point is, the movie is kind of good. So if you're a fan of Demonic Toys, Dollman, and Bad Channels, rent this movie!!!
