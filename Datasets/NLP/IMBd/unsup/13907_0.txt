I have seen all of Disneys films; with Bambi as one of the tops of my list. Anyways, when I heared that Bambi 2 was coming out I rolled my eyes and thought that here goes another classic. I wont lie to you Disney, in the past has done some terrible second takes on films, ruining the reputation of the original. I love Disney animation (I also enjoy drawing drawing it to), but usually second takes to the films animation is terrible. But I looked at Bambi 2 in a whole new light when I heard that Andreas Deja (one of Disney's best animators) was on board for the project.<br /><br />Andreas Deja did not disappoint. He supervised the animation and they did a fascinating job, almost at par with the original. It does need some tweeking here and there, but over all it is a great movie. The animation, as I said, was well done, the voices were perfectly casted and the story line was fairly well written.<br /><br />All in all this was a one of a kind in Disney second movie films!
