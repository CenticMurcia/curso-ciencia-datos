Horrible. The dialogue was just bad as well as cheesy. I had to force myself to watch the entire thing. The acting was bad as well... almost as though he was reading everything off a teleprompter. Even walken couldn't save the movie, i'm sure he did everything he could but his lines were just bad. The lines and the formula were so stereotypical, the concept(pool) isn't too mainstream but the structure was. Coldfire gives this movie two BIG THUMBS DOWN! Maybe that explains why i haven't seen any of the actors since. It reminds me of that steven sigal film.... ONLY I COOK FOR THE CAPTAIN *punching and kicking ensues*.<br /><br />p.s. dialogue came up as spelled wrong? wha?!
