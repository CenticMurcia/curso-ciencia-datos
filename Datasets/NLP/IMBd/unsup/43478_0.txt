George Zucco plays the role as Dr. Josef Van Ee who has a strange past and lives in a house with his son and daughter-in-law. His son is having problems with his wife and the son wants a divorce but his wife will not give him one. Bella Lugosi, (Prof. Leonide) visits his cousin Dr. Van Ee after many years of not seeing each other and they both do not like each other very much. The story is hard to follow and the acting is unbelievable and the entire story makes very little sense. Most of the time you see Bella Lugosi and a midget going through various secret panels throughout the house. This picture is in color but really does not help this horrible waste of time.
