My university held an Indian Film Festival this past spring. My friends and I decided to be adventurous and try a Bollywood film. I could to say my initially low expectations were the main reason i left very satisfied, but that wouldn't be giving this movie credit. For the first time in a few months, I left this movie theatre feeling I had been entertained. I now consider this movie one of my favorite foreign films. As a testament to its greatness, I was able to show this movie to an entire suite of twenty-something American guys and they absolutely loved it. They found the club dance scene hilarious and were taken with the friendship and camaraderie that the three main characters shared. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a superior comedy, a heartfelt story of friends or a glimpse of some of Bollywood's better exports.
