Perhaps I'm just a cynical, unsophisticated knuckle-dragger and nowhere near as cultured as the film festival crowd, but I absolutely loathed this film. To me it epitomizes what is essentially wrong with the film industry in New Zealand; that being the fact that Kiwi film makers seem hell-bent on making boring movies designed to appeal to less than .000000001% of the population. Occasionally, someone gets it right, and every 8-10 years we'll get something like Sleeping Dogs, Goodbye Pork Pie, Ngati, or Whale Rider. But more often than not the local product ranges in quality from only just watchable to mind-numbingly dull, the latter being the case with Vigil. It's not a badly made film - in fact the acting is first rate, and the photography quite stunning - the major problem is the sheer drudgery of it all. Stunning misty landscapes, rustic sets, quaint old farm buildings, and close-ups of leaky taps do not save this stinker from a storyline that drags slower than a mini towing a b-train. Avoid this film at all costs.
