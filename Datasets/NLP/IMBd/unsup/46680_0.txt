Apache started off ok enough with some good action and an interesting story, but after about the midway point it declined into a ridiculous affair. I never really found myself too convinced by Lancaster and an indian and the whole thing just became less believable as it went on. I would just say it's your average fare except for the absurd ending. Without giving anything away I must say that it just didn't make any sense. I later discovered that there may well have been a reason for this: one of the producers insisted on a different kind of ending than the original one that both the director and Lancaster wanted. Either way I can't recommend this one too strongly. I gave it a 4.
