This effort attempts to be humorous via sheer puerility but fails miserably.<br /><br />The reason for its failure is at least three-fold:<br /><br />1) No scriptwriters were employed during this production<br /><br />2) Actors with ability were deemed entirely unnecessary<br /><br />3) The advert for the sound man appeared in the "Deaf Times"<br /><br />It would be an affront to all films ever made (independent or otherwise, and including Gigli) to label this plotless effort as a "film"; this "attempt" is truly dreadful. I shiver when I recall the crass manner of "acting" in this "thing"; please do not make the same mistake I made in watching this.<br /><br />Waste no money, no time or even bandwidth on this!
