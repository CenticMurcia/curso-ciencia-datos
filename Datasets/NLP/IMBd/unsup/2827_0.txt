After the failure of "Alien 3", David Fincher held his breath for three years and made a new start with "Se7en". His signature style of direction is all over it. This is one of the best serial killer movies ever made.<br /><br />The plot explores the extreme pitch-black side of the human psyche and was entirely the creation of one writer. Andrew Kevin Walker, conceived, a disturbing story of a serial killer who murders all his victims in the style of the seven deadly sins.<br /><br />"Se7en" is definitely the film that kick-started Fincher's career. Had he made "The Game" right after "Alien 3", there would have been no "Fight Club", or "Panic Room".<br /><br />Pitt and Freeman deliver great performances. 8/10
