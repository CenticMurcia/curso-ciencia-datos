Wow! What an intelligent film! Roger Vadim (director) and Gene Roddenberry (screen writer) take what could have been a teen titillation flick and mold it smoothly into a tense psychological drama.<br /><br />The film moves from innocent voyeurism to chilling unconscionable murder.<br /><br />Michael "Tiger" McDrew (Rock Hudson) is the school psychologist who encourages boys via sports and girls via sex. He is an ex-football hero who status as a national icon gives him a sense of invulnerability.<br /><br />His downfall starts when his female students want more from him than just sexual favors. One by one, the girls profess their love for him and their desire to be his wife. There's only problem, his off campus life includes a lovely wife (Barbara Leigh) and young daughter (Stephanie Mizrahi).<br /><br />So, one by one, his "pretty maids" start showing up on campus dead. Telly Savalas (Captain Sam Surcher) is superb as the investigator. Check out his lieutenant, Follo (James Doohan).<br /><br />The second story line, in which awkward student, and `Tiger' McDrew protégé, Ponce De Leon Harper (John David Carson) comes of age with the help of his teacher Miss Betty Smith (a GORGEOUS Angie Dickinson), is handled in a sweet and sensitive manner.<br /><br />The film is clever from start to finish and the ending suggests a sequel, which to my knowledge, never came to be.
