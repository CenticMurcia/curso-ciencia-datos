...why, it's almost criminal, I think! Brian "Bride of Re-Animator" Yuzna is at least a genre demi-god, far as I'm concerned, but if so, his powers have seemingly all but evaporated. "BSW" (and I like the acronym because it emphasizes the nature of this mess of a film) has none of the vigor or playfulness of his earlier films. Methinks he is suffering from encroaching ennui. The leads are mostly European teevee actors, no doubt appealing in that medium, with varying and mostly limited intensities of screen presence. It doesn't help that a good number of them were speaking a second language, and at that knowing they're going to be overdubbed anyway. It shows in the performances, which are often stilted, almost unnatural. Worse, of course, is the script, about which the less said the better; Sturgeon was right, as always. Things start off fairly well for a low-budget adaptation of some pulp-horror bus ride throwaway, and then the whole affair sinks beneath the weight of a tired plot, at times horrendous dialogue, problematic acting, disappointing production values at key junctures, seemingly indifferent direction--even the obligatory bare boobies and revolting gore couldn't save this turkey. Strictly desperation viewing only, sorry to say. Mr. Yuzna should stick to producing.
