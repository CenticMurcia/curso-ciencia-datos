Freaky Fairy tales just doesn't work as a film. When using a format such as this you need every story to be well written, but sadly things were lacking in that department. The first story is kind of weird and creepy, and has some good parts when the corpse comes alive. But that's about it. The second tale is about a werewolf and is only saved by the unintentionally hilarious lines from the old woman, such as when the man demands she open the door, to which she replies "I will not!" and then declares "I have a meat cleaver and I know how to use it!" I didn't see the third story because I was falling asleep by then and turned the TV off. That's how interesting Feeaky Fairy tales was. <br /><br />No self-respecting horror fan should bother with this, unless you're a die-hard collector.
