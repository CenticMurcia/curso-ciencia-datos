Seventy years after the young Wendy Hiller starred as Eliza Doolittle in "Pygmalion," it is stunning to see her act the part of an old woman in "All Passion Spent," a three-episode version of a Vita Sackville-West novel. She was still beautiful, still a splendid actress. I won't attempt to summarize the story but the TV program is filled with English actors whose faces you will recognize even if you don't know their names. Particularly effective is Harry Andrews, as a wealthy elderly eccentric who fell in love with Dame Wendy's character decades earlier, though they met only fleetingly. Also noteworthy is Jane Snowden as the great-granddaughter who is inspired to follow her own path in life by her great-grandmother's example. Although she lived to be 91, Dame Wendy was only in her mid-70's when this series was made; her character is in her mid-80's.
