The first half of this movie is a crime mystery. The second half is a love story. I thought that I would know what happened next and for the most part I was right. Thre were a few surprises and i admit i did not see the ending coming. Although once I saw it kinda made sense who the killer was.<br /><br />I just thought that the movie was repetitive in its dialog in some parts. Al Pacino is his usual self in one of his come back roles were he has picked up the deep voice and the dark eyes. Besides one scene in a Shoe store i think his performance is rather average. No where in the league of later works such as Scent of a Women and Glenn Gary Glenn Ross. In the confines of the script the actors did what they could so i give it a generous seven.
