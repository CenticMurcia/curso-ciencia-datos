This film is way better than Batman & Robin and should have been in theaters instead of B&R. This film was released straight to video to get people to watch the theatrical B&R, but many people think that this film is better which is hilarious. The DCAU Mr. Freeze, Batman, and Robin are way better than what was in B&R. There is no ice puns, imagery that looks gay, bad plot, bright lights, a super villain that shouldn't be a mindless thug, and fight scenes that resemble the 1960s series. This shows that a direct to video film can be better than a theatrical release if the people working on the film care about the characters and plot instead of selling toys and being over obsessed with making the film kid friendly.
