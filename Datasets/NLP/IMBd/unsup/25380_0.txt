Although The Mole People isn't the best of Universal's 50's sci fi movies, I rather like it.<br /><br />A group of Archaeologists discover a strange world while exploring in a part of India. They discover a race of albinos living here and they use a strange life form as slaves, mole men. They are afraid of light and a torch is used as a weapon to scare them away. As the movie progresses, most of the team gets killed and one of the survivors falls in love with a woman who happens to be down there as well, but this proves short lived as she is killed in the earthquake at the end in which the world is destroyed.<br /><br />The movie stars 50's sci fi regular John Agar (Tarantula, The Brain From Planet Arous) and Hugh Beaumont, Cynthia Patrick and Alan Napier.<br /><br />This movie is worth checking out.<br /><br />Rating: 3 stars out of 5.
