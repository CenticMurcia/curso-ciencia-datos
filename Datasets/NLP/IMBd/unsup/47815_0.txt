Well i have literally just got back from watching this movie and while i wouldnt say it was awful, i wouldnt put it up there with Lord of the Rings or any other great films!<br /><br />The stunts are mind blowing and its worth watching just for that! Though you cant help but think what did 'Charlie' beef the angels up with to be able to do all of those stunts :o)<br /><br />The script is corny and predictable! Nuff said.<br /><br />The ending, well i wont give it away but it does suddenly become very scrambled and all over the place. I personally got lost in the last 10/15 minutes and couldnt understand what had actually happened or why it happened, script again i guess.<br /><br />it is a sexist film, though you cant help but drool over the outfits (well as a girl I couldnt help, lol) but you do think were some of them really needed!!!<br /><br />John Cleese is appearence was great! and I think Pink was brilliant in her tiny little guest role as the Coal Bowl Starter! Though there are a couple of twins in the film i really could of done without seeing!!!<br /><br />Overall, if u need to chill out go watch this just dont try and make any sense of it!
