Starts out poorly, sort of like a below average TV movie about a plane crash. Drags on for about twenty minutes, and then the most incredible crew of drag queens, led by a terrible looking, punky Cheryl Ladd, invade the film with a coterie of the worst (somewhat) live actors, mechanical men and make up jobs the world has ever seen. Dialog is so horrible, that you literally cringe waiting for the next line. I literally became sick and had to turn it off because of the bad acting. Now I realize, none of us is getting younger, but what's the thing with Kristofferson's eyebrows? His acting is particularly wooden in this role, but Cheryl Ladd - good god, her performance (a la Pussy Galore in the film Goldfinger) would have stopped any other career cold. Strangely, the sets held up fairly well; the steaming turbines; the weirdly flat body bags, and so forth. But the cheap looking device that Cheryl and her tough pals are looking for - a device that supposed to turn this "time travel" joke of a story around - looks like a reject from a grade Z movie.<br /><br />It's really like two movies in one, or one inside the other. Whatever. Watch for both of these film and avoid it.
