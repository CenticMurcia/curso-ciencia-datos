The good news is that it was on broadcast TV - I didn't pay anything.<br /><br />The better news is that I was doing something at the same time so I didn't waste any time on it.<br /><br />I like Alyson Hannigan. And this movie shows she is game for anything.<br /><br />There is an attractive blonde in a bikini.<br /><br />That gives it two stars.<br /><br />I'm straining to dredge up a third star. OK, the cat diarrhoea scene gets a star for sheer bizarreness.<br /><br />My final comment is a complaint about the 10 line rule, because I have read other reviews of less than 10 lines and, believe me, I've said enough.
