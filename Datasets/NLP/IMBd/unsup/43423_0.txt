... because all I offer is honesty here, folks.<br /><br />I saw this with my wife and friends (and before you ask, she and they are Filipino). Afterwards, as we went home we were... laughing. Not at any of the funny parts. At the over-acting, at the storyline (the lead actress ends up with an Anglo fireman after years of self-imposed virginal solitude), at the gay subplot that could have actually made a better fim on its own. I really didn't care about the other characters at all, and oddly enough the only other white character was a Pinoy stereotype of American women (it's hard to take a film like this seriously when they can't even overcome the things they claim to find offensive in U.S. films).<br /><br />Having seen my share of Regal and Viva films, I'd say that while the production values were better than usual the director can't overcome the bad acting or maybe his own style of directing.<br /><br />Personally, I'd have preferred watching Ricky Davao shoot guys in the shoulder...<br /><br />Somebody should remake "Kabayo Kids" or something like that, gearing it to both Anglo and Pinoy audiences if they want to break in here.<br /><br />Oh, the film does have one good moment that I recall; one of the guests is admonished for speaking Tagalog in front of thier non-Pinoy guests. That hit home. I happens more often then they want to admit, and they never want to admit it's rude, especially since they know English.<br /><br />I'd give it a 4 out of 10. Maybe worth a rental, if only to compare notes with future Fil-Am films.<br /><br />
