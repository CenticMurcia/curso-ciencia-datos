"Rubber Johnny" begins with you asking yourself "what is going on?", and ends with you asking yourself "what just happened?".<br /><br />The positive that can be brought out of Rubber Johnny is simply that it is original. Now that being said, it is original in the worst of ways.<br /><br />A mix of cheap effects (however original), and a very poor foundation make Rubber Johnny a complete bust. One watching this for the first time, would think it was done by a couple of 10 year olds just fooling around and experimenting with a home video camera.<br /><br />But for the short amount of time it takes to watch it, check it out and see what I mean.
