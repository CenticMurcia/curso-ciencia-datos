I really enjoyed this comedy. It started with an excellent cast of characters both main and supporting. I can't think of anyone that could have played any of the parts better. Everyone had a great connection and really made you believe they were best friends. Each of the main characters was distinctive in their own way making it easy to relate to at least one. You never know what to expect from scene to scene. All you can be sure of is that your going to laugh. The ending is a major surprise unlike a lot of comedies where you know how its going to end from the start of the movie. If you like crazy, wacky comedies then you'll love this one.
