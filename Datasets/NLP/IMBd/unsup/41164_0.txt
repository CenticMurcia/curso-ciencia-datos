This movie was quite terrible - it shows the English as terrible snobs! Practically no British teenager speaks that poshly - apart from the royals. Not even the royals youngsters wear suits to discos! What normal guys wheres one of those riding jackets! The Olsen twins displayed their total lack of knowledge of Britain - and referred to every single wrong stereotype they could find. This film is stupid and childish - and will send all the wrong messages to the USA about us Brits. We do not dress up-tight to ALL occasions, we CAN dance, we do not all live in stately homes, we do not all have up-tight parents and we can have fun. The film does do us one favour however... we ARE integral and we DO have morals. We also DO NOT negotiate with terrorists. We can definitely give the Americans a run for their money like that.
