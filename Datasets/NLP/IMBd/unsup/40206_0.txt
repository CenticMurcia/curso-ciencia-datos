Tequila Body Shots starts in Los Angeles where Johnny (Joseph Lawrence) tells his two best friends, Al (Josh Marchette) & Paul (Nathan Anderson), that he has been invited to a Halloween party in Mexico by someone named Hector (Rene L. Moreno). The three friends decide to go & set off but Al & Paul become very sick on the journey, Johnny seeks help & meets Doc (Henry Darrow) who manages to cure Al & Paul with a couple of tequila body shots. The friends give Doc a lift into town & before they part company Doc gives Johnny a bottle of tequila of his own which gives Johnny the power to read women's thoughts. As Johnny, Al & Paul party the day away they meet three girls, Tamlyn (Dru Mouser), Angela (Jennifer Lyons) & Linda (Senta Moses). Johnny & Tamlyn seem to like each other but the mysterious Hector just won't seem to go away, from threatening voices to eerie hallucinations there seems to be something sinister going on...<br /><br />Written, co-produced & directed by Tony Shyu I have mixed feelings about Tequila Body Shots. The script is unique & has at least some originality about it but that's simply not enough when the whole concept & execution is so bad. For a start the film drags painfully in parts & most of it seems to be shots of annoying teenagers standing around drinking & cracking extremely unfunny jokes. The plot is bizarre, it contains magical tequila, hallucinations, ghosts, mind reading, reincarnation, possession, prophecies, a strange spirit world with the grim reaper, Nazi looking ghosts & a for good measure a few lame fart jokes. None of these elements come together that well & I'm not even sure what type of film Tequila Body Shots is supposed to be, is it a comedy? A horror? A buddy-buddy road film? An adventure film? It's a very hard film to categorise, it's something a bit different & the filmmakers must at least get some credit for trying something unusual but unfortunately that just didn't stop me from thinking that at the end of the day I had just wasted 90 plus odd minutes of my life watching total crap. The character's got on my nerves to start with but they sort of grew on me & I ended up quite liking them, also I couldn't but help think that if Doc knew what was going to happen why didn't he just stop Johnny & his friends going to the party in the first place & prevent the whole sorry situation?<br /><br />Tequila Body Shots is, at this point in time, the one & only film that director Shyu has worked on. I have to give him some credit as it's certainly colourful & has a garish look to it although all the Mexican stereotypical clich√©s come out like innuendo about sheep, everyone seems to wear sombreros & that all Mexican jails are full of gays... The film jumps into some sort of spirit world towards the end & it's all filmed in a blueish tone & it looks awful, the grim reaper ends up rowing what looks like a wooden box! There are no scares, atmosphere & the jokes are really unfunny. Forget about any blood or gore as not one single drop of blood is spilt during it's duration.<br /><br />Technically the film varies, some of it looks nice & colourful while at other times it's one of the cheapest, nastiest & most idiotic films ever. The acting ranges from OK to utterly awful especially Robert Patrick Benedict as Ted who is highly irritating whenever on screen.<br /><br />Tequila Body Shots is an unusual film to be sure, I don't think I've ever seen another film like it but as I've already said that's not enough to save it from being really crap. A bit of a mess & not worth wasting your time on in my opinion.
