Don't let the fact that this film is low budget put you off. I know it's annoying to watch low budget films with it's shaky camera action (which you don't see that often in this film just a bit at the beginning with the bike), but the story line and the dialogue in this film makes up for the fact that it's low budget. The film moves at a fast pace and at no point was I bored. Now on the other hand if they had invested more in this film and shot it at a better location, I'd say this would be a pretty big hit. If this was picked up by a major Hollywood production house, I'd definitely give this film a 10/10. Thoroughly enjoyed the action and dialogue.
