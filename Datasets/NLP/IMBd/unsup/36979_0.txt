Adam Sandler... geez. The simple fact that he makes money off garbage like this (everything else of his is just like this) and guys like Steve Martin and Bill Murray--who on their worst day beat out anything Sandler on his most inspired day--struggle with their films for the simple fact they make funny films with a concept, or you might even have to think a bit about the humor. Fans of Sandler are the same folks that let MTV dictate their lives and consider the Teletubbies "cool" just because it's hip to like what toddlers go for. Someone explain that fad to me: teens and people in their early 20's liking preschooler fare.<br /><br />Just like Farley and Spade, Sandler left SNL, where he actually was funny, and succumbed to making easy-laugh bile on film. The only SNL'er that left for the big screen and actually has continually made the most of it is Mike Myers. So far, out of his four films in which he was the star, each of them have truly been hysterical.<br /><br />Most Sandler fans are the type of people that would say, "If you don't like Adam Sandler films, you need to drink s'more." Exactly, because that's what it'll take to actually stomach one minute of any of his films.
