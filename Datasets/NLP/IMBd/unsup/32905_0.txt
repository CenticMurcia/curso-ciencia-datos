I am writing this review as a member of the same church as the people that made this movie, and as such I can tell you for a fact that this movie in no way expresses the views of our church or the vast majority of its members. Every Mormon I know who has seen this film, the trailer, or read the book upon which it is based, is disgusted by it.<br /><br />Some background: the book "Day of Defense" was written in the '60s by a lay member of the church, and is considered a prime example of anti-anti-mormon literature. In other words, it uses the same tactics, logic and style as anti-mormon literature, but it is turned in the other direction. It is no more convincing than the average anti-Mormon literature, and even the people that are amused by it would never take it seriously.<br /><br />The contents of the book consist of a context-less courtroom debate that goes something like this:<br /><br />Christian church leader: The Bible says here that your church is wrong. Wise Mormon elder: Oh, yeah? Well here's where you're mistaken. Leader of another church: But what about this passage? Wise Mormon elder: Here is another glib reply. JUDGE: Well, it looks like the Mormons proved their case. I will now join their church.<br /><br />It's entertaining, but ridiculous, and one of the most ill-suited books ever written for a movie translation.<br /><br />The film fills in the plot holes with a town of mindless Christian straw-dogs, and plenty of bad dialogue, bad acting, bad directing, bad haircuts, and a type of synergy that somehow makes the movie worse than the sum of its terrible parts. It isn't even as amusing as the book it was based on. It's just terrible in every possible way. One of the worst movies I've ever seen.<br /><br />If you're a Mormon, don't see this movie. It will make you doubt your faith because of the people that share it. If you're not a Mormon, PLEASE don't see this movie. It is the absolute nadir in the mostly embarrassing culture of LDS filmmaking.<br /><br />God's Army was a pretty good Mormon movie, but if the man who made that film knew what would happen to the genre he popularized, I'm sure he'd have burned his camera and taken a job at Taco Bell for the good of humanity. Avoid this like Rabies.
