The Movie "Anything to Survive" IS a real interesting movie for entertainment! please do NOT view this movie as being true! I personally knew the family depicted in this movie and as most things from Hollywood it has been modified to make it more entertaining. the places named in the movie are real but the Family was going from Craig Alaska to Ketchikan Alaska and had nothing to do with Prince Rupert British Colombia!!! Having Lived in that Part of Alaska for 30 years I am very familiar with the weather and conditions that one can find there. One last point to be made. That part of Alaska is not considered "the Arctic" it is almost 1000 miles from the Arctic.
