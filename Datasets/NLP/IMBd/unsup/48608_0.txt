The dance scenes were too long, the chansons didn't really match with the plot. The only cool scene was the deadly game with the mysterious club owner. Without the singing and dancing stuff it could be a wonderful movie about the story of the three women which are linked together in a special way.<br /><br />After half of the time I was the only one left in the cinema watching the boring movie. Even my french flatmate didn't like the movie.<br /><br />If you like to see a better (and typical) french movie then choose "La vie est une chanson".
