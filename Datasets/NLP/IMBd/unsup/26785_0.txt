I very much enjoyed the film, however it is mostly aimed at the Turkish audience, or viewers who are familiar with the University Entry Exam System in Turkey, in terms of understanding the emotions the characters dealing with.<br /><br />The acting was first-class. Everyone seemed to have blended with their role and the messages and jokes were delivered how or where they needed to.<br /><br />As mentioned in the very early trailers this film of both comedy and drama genre. Both aspects are implemented successfully, which is why it makes this film a must-see.<br /><br />The jokes are clever, the conversations are natural.<br /><br />There is an unexpected twist in the end. However, I must say, the ending has disappointed me in a way that it left us wondering what has become of the characters?
