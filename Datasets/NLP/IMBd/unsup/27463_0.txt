A leak of radioactive gas is Resurecting a girl that´s been dead for some time. Getting up she starts to kill of everyone in her way, as she finds her way back to her lesbian lover in a remote castle.<br /><br />A dark erotic and tragic tale of love and lust by the legendary Jean Rollin is very sad and does really get to you in the ending scenes.<br /><br />I Can´t compare it to any other movie I´ve ever seen because it´s so damn good and unusual.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
