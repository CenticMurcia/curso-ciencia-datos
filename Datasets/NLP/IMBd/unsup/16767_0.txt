Myrna Loy was never lovelier than she is in this surprisingly sophisticated and mature 1936 film.<br /><br />Though billed as a screwball comedy, the movie has much more than screwball comedy on its mind. Loy plays wife to Clark Gable, a successful business exec who spends much of his time at the office with his irreplaceable secretary, played by Jean Harlow. Loy completely trusts her husband until a seed of doubt is planted in her mind by her cynical mother-in-law (May Robson). The film examines the idea of trust in marriage, and it's honest about the nature of infidelity. In a fascinating scene that takes place between Gable and Harlow in a Haitian hotel, the film suggests that the key to making relationships work lies not in avoiding temptation (which it also suggests is impossible anyway), but in knowing how to say "no" to it when it arrives.<br /><br />Gable and Loy have as much chemistry together as Loy did with William Powell, her other frequent co-star, and Jean Harlow is as cute as I've ever seen her. I don't normally like her much, but I liked her in this as much as I've ever liked her in anything else. There are no good guys or bad guys in this movie; Gable isn't a cad and Harlow isn't a floozy. The three just play normal people navigating the tricky waters of male/female relations.<br /><br />This one's a winner.<br /><br />Grade: A
