I seen the pilot back in 1988 when the World Series finished before the seven games. It was O.K., movies was better and it was not as good as the book series, but I always wanted a movies made so I was glad when it came out. Was excited about a series and another one never came. :( This would still work today if they would try it again. with the actor of today and the fact there are over 130 paperbacks in the series it could run along time if they would just try it. As far as this episode and the movie, neither Chuin's were as descibed in the series, this was very disappointing. The Remo character did not fit the picture you get from reading either.
