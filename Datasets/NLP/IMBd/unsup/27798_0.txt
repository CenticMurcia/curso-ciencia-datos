90/100. This is one of Edward G. Robinson's best films and one of the best comedies of the 1940's. The supporting cast is amazing, Edward Brophy, Anthony Quinn, Jack Carson and Harry Davenport are excellent, but it's Broderick Crawford that steals every scene he is in. Look for a very young Jackie Gleason as the soda jerk. The adapted screenplay by Everett Freeman and Edwin Gilbert from S.J. and Laura Perelman's play (The Night Before Christmas) is outstanding. It moves along briskly and there is never a dull moment. Funny situations, great dialog and it is unique and different. I am very surprised this film is not better known, it's a fine classic.
