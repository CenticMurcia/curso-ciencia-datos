This movie is right out of reality. The portrayal of ABCDs (as us FOBs call them) is done well. The movie could have done with some more refinements but it was hilarious. Kal Penn did a great job at playing Ajay Panday , an American Indian who thinks he is an African american. He has done a great job.<br /><br />The movie has you in stiches and the whole audience was laughing aloud all through till the end. There is love, drama, emotion, action and comedy. What more can you ask of a movie.
