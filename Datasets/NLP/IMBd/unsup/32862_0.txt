I had some expectations for this movie, but it didn't take long to figure out that it was complete and utter garbage. Ed Harris is a great actor, but I hope the director Ed Harris, is someone else...<br /><br />Do not go and watch this movie. It has to be the most boring western I've seen since the old John Wayne and Elvis Presley crappers. The story is very choppy, totally without consistency. As someone has previously noted, its almost like its been written by an aspiring teenage filmmaker. Some scenes that are supposed to be serious, comes out like the first read-through of the script, except that they're actually on set wearing costumes. The performances of the actors are very sub-par compared to other films they've done. <br /><br />I watched through the movie only because I didn't pay anything to see it, and im sure glad i didn't.<br /><br />Stop directing, acting, writing, producing your own movies Ed, you're not very good at it. Ed-Harris actually sing in on of the songs in this movie, the tune was pretty good, but the lyrics were almost worse than the movie dialogue.<br /><br />:(.............garbage
