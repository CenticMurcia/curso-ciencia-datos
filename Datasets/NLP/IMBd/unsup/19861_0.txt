This feature accomplishes perfectly what GREEN GRASS OF WYOMING failed to do four years later - both deal with similar subjects: adolescents training to bring horses to trotting race success. This film however is filled with poignancy, beauty and self-assuredness. It was the first starring role for Lon McCallister, a young man who made 42 films but only nine after this one, retiring from the screen at 30. It was Jeanne Crain's fist starring role as well, being only her fourth film. Both are absolutely radiant in the leads and so appealing you want to adopt them. Lending able support are Walter Brennan and Charlotte Greenwood (doing a prototype Aunt Eller-like job). Willie Best and particularly George Reed provide additional fine work. Reed is a find and one wonders why he was not the choice for Disney's Uncle Remus. This is a film full of beautiful color cinematography (it earned a deserved Oscar nom in this category) that is also extremely accomplished in the difficult tracking shots that put us right IN the races. The Academy failed to honor Hugo Friedhofer's excellent musical score but it deserved a nom as well. This is a radiant film that is perfect for adolescents to watch, especially those in love with horses and racing. I am astonished it is not available on video. Do seek it out.
