Attended the first commercial screening of The Orphanage (El Orfanato) last night at FrightFest, London. <br /><br />Juan Antonio Bayona and writer Sergio G. Sanchez have delivered something really special for their first feature. <br /><br />I have never jumped out of my seat like I did last night, nor my partner, nor most of the audience it seemed. Apart from the terrific scares, there are solid performances from the whole cast, stunning cinematography, and the editing is flawless. If I had to criticise one element, it is that the music swells just a little too much a couple of times, but it is a good score nonetheless.<br /><br />See this one at the cinema.
