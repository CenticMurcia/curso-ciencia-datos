I love "The Prince and the Pauper" and Billy and Bobby Mauch. When they laugh together, I can't help laughing, too.<br /><br />I wanted to comment on their enunciation -- a charming idiosyncrasy.<br /><br />They pronounce every "to" with unusual emphasis -- like Bette Davis, who was at Warner Brothers, too! <br /><br />I was imagining -- sheer speculation -- that Bette Davis and the Mauch twins had the same vocal coach who encouraged them to over-articulate.<br /><br />I also was amused when one of the twins pronounced his family "TU-TOR" instead of "Tudor." <br /><br />Still --the movie is delightful.
