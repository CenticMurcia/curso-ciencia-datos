This is a bad film. Its not a good bad movie, its just a bad movie.<br /><br />The plot has something to do with the adult children of a family finding out that their mother hasn't really been dead, rather she was changed into a vampire and had been kept locked up by their father in a secret crypt.<br /><br />I've run across this movie a under a couple of different names and under everyone of them its a turkey. Nothing in this film works. The acting is more like over the top soap opera spoof than any realistic. The aged Grannie who plays the vampire is more laughable than frightening with the result that you may hurt yourself from laughing at it all.<br /><br />2 out of 10 for the occasional unintentional laugh, otherwise this is a movie to be avoided at all costs.
