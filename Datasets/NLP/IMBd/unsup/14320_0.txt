How can they be in the film if they are extinct?<br /><br />That is what a kid said, seeing dinosaur. The special effects were extraordinary. The fur of the monkey was moving with the wind. The integration of real life image with computer generated ones was perfect.<br /><br />The story was simple, perfect for the 6 or 7 year old. For younger kids, It depends on their sensibility. Some kids were had to stop watching the movie and turn around because they were afraid! It's not that the movie is too violent. (There is violence, but those are dinosaur!!!!) It is the way they show the "Carnosaurs" and the "Velociraptors" that is scary, in combination with the music. Also, younger kids may have trouble to focus their interest on the movie because there is a lot of dialogue. My daughter that is used to see movies and usually watch them could stop moving the whole representation.<br /><br />So it's a good child movie for 6 year old and older. Younger kid may be afraid or may lose interest. And for the adult? It's a cute movie, perfect for a first date.<br /><br />
