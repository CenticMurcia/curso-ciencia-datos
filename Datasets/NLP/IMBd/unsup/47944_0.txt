First and foremost. I HAVE NOT SEEN THE ORIGINAL. So this is an unbiased review from a person who has not seen or thought about seeing the original.<br /><br />Now. Lets begin. The Day the Earth Stood Still starts off well. It is pretty captivating and interesting. It hooks you and slowly but surely draws you in. For about the first thirty minutes I could not stop wondering what was going to happen next. The movie was moving slow but still holding my attention.<br /><br />But after that thirty minute mark I realized that the movie was going nowhere. Literally nothing was happening. The entire hour and a half that followed consisted of nothing more than a car ride to the woods, a car ride to the city, some cheesy looking orbs spawning up out of the dirt, and some bugs that ate stuff. If you throw all those things together blend it up with a p1ss poor plot and about two cool CGI scenes (that are both in the commercial) then you have this movie.<br /><br />And try as I might to figure out what was actually going on, nothing become apparent until about an hour and a half in when Keanu talks about saving the earth from humans. First you think he is a "bad guy", but then he says that hes going to save the world so you think he is a "good guy", but then he kills someone so you think hes a "bad guy" again. But then he revives him. At this point you basically are just thinking "WTF? This movie sucks. I don't have a clue whether I should like Keanu or not. I have to go to the bathroom, and I am going to have a hard time convincing myself to return to the theater if I leave to pee." <br /><br />The acting was okay. The only scene which I thought the acting was really good was the crying scene between Jennifer Connelly and Jaden Smith. It was done surprisingly well. Other than that the acting was decent at best. Evan Keanu didn't meet my expectations. His character was....flat.<br /><br />The first thirty minutes of this movie had me expecting something good. The next hour and a half left me with a sour taste in my mouth, bored, and wishing I was watching a different movie.<br /><br />The movie was simply boring. I understand that Sci-Fi doesn't always have to be explosive. But something has to happen. And in this case, nothing did.<br /><br />Final Word: Boring.
