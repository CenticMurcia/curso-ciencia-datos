Nellie Hill was a popular nightclub performer who appeared in this film and "Killer Diller" (1948) - it is not hard to see why she only made two films, she was an extremely bad actress.<br /><br />Editor (Bob Howard) needs a reporter to gather information on a nightclub singer, Lola (Nellie Hill), who is mixed up with some pretty shady types, including Mike (Bill Dillard) an escaped convict. Lola has one of those "new fangled TV sets" - pretty amazing for a grade D film of 1941!!! She and Mike view a musical number "Geeshee", set in the jungle and featuring a witch doctor and lots of dancing girls.It has a very confusing story as it is mostly told in flashback by the editor to an eager young reporter who desperately wants a job.<br /><br />Bill Smith (Ken Kenard) was once a policeman but is now a nightclub owner. He is trailed to his house by a reporter, who hides behind a chair. Smith and his date drunkenly exit via a window and the next minute Lola and Mike go to Bill's with a policeman claiming it is their flat and they have been burgled. Before too long the policeman is playing the piano and Lola is singing songs from her new show - "It Ain't Right"!!! If that is true why, in the next scene, is she auditioning for a spot in Bill's club??? Just when you are wondering - is there going to be a murder??? - there is - and then!!!<br /><br />The thing that makes this watchable are the musical numbers. The wonderful Noble Sissle (who has more charisma and talent in his little finger than all the actors in this film put together!!!) and his Band perform at a masquerade party in which only 2 people wear masks!!! They perform some very catchy songs - "Too Late Baby", "Hello Happiness", and "Running Around". A pity Sissle wasn't given the lead, he would have been the best actor in the film. There were also some pretty good variety acts, including another band "Skippy Williams Band", who were great. Marjorie Oliver was also memorable as Bill's sassy secretary.<br /><br />These films may have been crudely made but at least they were a realistic interpretation of the Afro-American way of life at a time when white America was still laughing at Stepin' Fechit.<br /><br />Recommended only for Noble Sissle.
