I can NOT understand why this Show was cancelled it was the greatest Show on TV at the time.<br /><br />There had to be a good reason to cancel it.<br /><br />I remember watching this Program when I was in Military Service in West Germany.<br /><br />I did not like it when it was cut off. <br /><br />There has to be some one out there that would know.<br /><br />I've always liked Andy he can play any part they have.<br /><br />Don knots would have been good in this show too. <br /><br />I guess this one was for the Science types.<br /><br />And Back then the science types were the called nerds.<br /><br />Great Show
