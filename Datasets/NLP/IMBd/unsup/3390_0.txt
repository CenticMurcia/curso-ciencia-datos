I have just watched the movie with my 7 year old. We both liked the movie. I tried to explain her couple of points about the story. She got little scared, but I told her that we get scared from the things we don't know. In my opinion, the movie is about saving the future. The people on the future are suffering from the pollution and their generation is about to come to an end. To save themselves, they are wearing the protective cloths. Emma's struggle and her one precious teardrop sent with Mimzy to the future, saved the future. Al they needed was a pure, unpolluted memorabilia (the teardrop) from the past that will help them save the earth from the pollution. At the end of the movie, we are given small toys of Mimzy, and we will cherish them to remind us about the future. We all have the job to save the future. Every little try will count, like every disrespect about the earth will harm. This movie was a very good source for me to teach my daughter the importance of being earth friendly. Thanks.
