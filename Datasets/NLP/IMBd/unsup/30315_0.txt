I can not begin to tell you what a horrible movie "Little Witches" is... but I also cannot tell you what a huge "crush" (I am censoring myself there) I had when watching Sheeri Rappaport. Good God! She is a true beauty... and, yes, this is a horrible "Craft" rip-off. Unlike many, I enjoyed "The Craft" and its black humor, but besides Rappaport, there is little to like here. *Beware viewers, here you get to see an obese, jelly-rolled young actress dance fully naked around a well* DONT SAY I DIDNT WARN YOU!<br /><br />Goth can be so much more sexy, so much more fun, and so much better. Half a star out of Four (the half comes from Ms. Rappaport).
