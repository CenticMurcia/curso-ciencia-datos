Harking back to a time when the Brits made decent thrillers instead of clumsy middle class comedies, Dead Man's Shoes is a real breath of fresh air. <br /><br />Surprisingly coming from the director of 'Once Upon A Time In The Midlands' and 'A Room For Romeo Brass' this is very downbeat, violent but also has moments of high comedy.<br /><br />The film also uses its Derbyshire locations brilliantly and looks fantastic.<br /><br />Lead actor and co-screenwriter Paddy Considine is terrific value as usual and is surely well on the way to becoming one of the UK's premiere screen actors and all of the supporting cast are terrific particularly Toby Kebbell who plays the intellectually challenged brother (the actual descriptions used in the film probably breach review guidelines) and Gary Stretch - who'd've thought he could act?<br /><br />Put it this way - your enjoyment of the film probably depends on your reaction to this one exchange of dialogue:<br /><br />Herbie : What you lookin at? <br /><br />Richard : You, you c***!<br /><br />Loved it.
