This movie was terrible compared to the sequel. The sequel actually made sense and was interesting. I never laughed so much in my life when Kate got what she had coming to her in the end of the sequel. But in this one, I thought I was going to die just watching it. Don't get me wrong, this movie did have some good moments, because why else would a sequel have been made.<br /><br />If you saw this movie and hated it, then you can redeem those two hours of your life by watching the amazing sequel on youtube.com. Just search for parsley days and click on "the return". It will not disappoint. If you haven't seen this movie and want to, then save two hours and watch the five minute sequel. <br /><br />-Parsley Days: The Return Fan
