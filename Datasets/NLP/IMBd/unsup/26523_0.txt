A good sci-fi prison escape story with great set design and effects. Kurtwood Smith is great as Warden Poe and Lambert plays his typical combat hardened ex-military agent he has portrayed in the likes of Mean Guns.<br /><br />Good supporting characters and few plot holes round the movie out. I'm a bit biased, I admit, as I'm a huge Lambert fan.<br /><br />Worth seeing.
