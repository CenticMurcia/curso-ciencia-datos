My honest opinion of "Scary Larry" is that I thought it was going to be better than it actually was. I guess it just wasn't what I was expecting. My first thought is that I cannot believe that he actually wore that wig. It looks like a Halloween wig that he bought at a local store, and thought people would think it was real hair, too funny. I would've liked to have seen the 'Karaoke King' more. Maybe singing at the Legion, with an audience, rather than in his garage. The reason why I did like "Scary Larry" was that I think it gave Larry a lot of confidence. The story should've told a little more about Larry's life, his background. Where is he from, why exactly does he live in the garage with this family, how did he meet them?
