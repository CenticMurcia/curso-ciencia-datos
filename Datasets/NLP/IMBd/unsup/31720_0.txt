What starts out as a possibly great opportunity to see some of the 1000 places turns out to be mostly a boring home video of two very boring people, the Ulles, Melanie and Albin. If you like to listen to interesting comments, like WOW, gee, cool, like oh my god or oh my gosh, amazing, and to top it off, incredible, etc., etc., then this is for you.<br /><br />If you want to actually learn something about the places they visit, forget it. I would estimate that there may be 15 minutes at best, of actual footage that would inform you about these normally interesting places. The rest is the boring home movie of Melanie and Albin. In fact this should have been titled: Melanie and Albin's Unincredible Adventure.<br /><br />If you have to watch this I would suggest you TiVo it so you can just fast forward through the Ulles adventures in banality in order to pick out the 15 minutes or so of what you tuned in for in the first place.
