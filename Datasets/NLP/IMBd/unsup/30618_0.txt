Will Smith is at his best. He never played a role like this one before, and he certainly does it very well, in my opinion it would be worth his first Oscar this year.<br /><br />It is a motion picture that makes you cry, laugh and admire this little guy who is just struggling ten times more than the others and still trying to handle everything...the story is full of feeling, and the father-son combo Smith is just as genuine as they could be.<br /><br />The only weak point in my view (maybe as an European): while the story is very nice, it seems a bit too optimistic and focused on the typical American dream scheme: just believe in yourself and you'll be rewarded.<br /><br />But in the end, a very nice movie you'll have to see!
