And it was only 3 squid me ol' muckersÂ…<br /><br />Pretty bad flick on all counts, Kal Penn holds it together as best the man can, he forges out a couple of funnies but the supporting cast who try hard must have been kinda cheap to hire...the dude with the Big Wang doesn't make much sense, the Irish guy does look a lot like his older bro from titanic, I wouldn't put the nerd in a starburst advert but I thought the English tart had balls spouting such filth...what would her mother say? <br /><br />Kind of looks like they made it in a couple of weeks so I appreciate the effort and I think it was worth 97 minutes of my life on planet earth...I didn't watch the extra features I'm sorry to say and I was kinda bummed the way the every 'hastings' scene had the cheapest possible activity, sword fight, paintball, dog show, bus ride, drinking competition....yet there was no stunts and only 4 breasts involved plus Taj's golf cart was super slow..........hey ho!<br /><br />On the plus side they don't need Van or even Taj to bust out a whole host of Van Wilder Chronicles. Funny and cheap that why national lampoons are a rock and i predict will survive the credit crunch.
