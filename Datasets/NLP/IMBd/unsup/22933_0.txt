Okay, so it isn't the Epic Finnish Movie Spectacle of 2003. It isn't Art with capital A.<br /><br />But who cares.<br /><br />Judging all measurements, this movie should be a turkey. The whole idea is so patently ludicruous that This Movie Just Can't Be Good. Shameless mixing of genres, unexperienced moviemakers, and, good heavens, Tony Halme.<br /><br />But surprise surpise - for some reason, this thing was watchable. *Very* watchable. Sure, it looks a bit cheesy here and there, might have needed some extra care at some times and places... but overall, the lasting impression I got was that This Isn't A Gigabuck Hollywood Movie But It Sure Looks Like One.<br /><br />But then again, I like movies that knowingly play with cliches of the genre, or genres in this case. Running jokes rule. And obviously the makers have had fun, which has to count for something...<br /><br />People seem to severely dislike the special effects - and I think this is unjustified, it's just amazing that they did it *this* good with *that* sort of money.<br /><br />And the plot wasn't *that* bad. Honestly.<br /><br />Cult classic material. Definitely.<br /><br />As a movie: *** As a parody of Hollywood: *****
