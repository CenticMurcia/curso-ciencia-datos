I saw this movie on the bus back from my summer holiday. I thought the bus driver was joking. I've seen better acting in low budget porn movies. Really. What were they thinking when they were making this movie? No one will ever buy this. The style is for 4 year old kids, but the language and violence is for adults. Neither will want to watch this. Really. Raspberry material. No wait. Even that award will give to much credit to this movie. Bad directing. Bad acting. Bad photography. Bad story, or actually, almost no story at all. This is the sort of movie that gives the industry a bad name. It looks like someone taped this with his own video camera. I think you get the point. Don't watch this, unless you've really got nowhere else to go. Like being tied up in your chair. Or on a driving bus.
