This is the worse film I've looked at in a long time. The acting rises from awful to alright. But the dialog is the worse thing its go going for it. Half the time it doesn't make any sense. The main character makes a youthful bad-ass mistake and gets punished for it. But Jersey sent the 15 year old up the river with the big boys. Insane. So, I think it good in that it got this kids story told and thats why I'm giving it ANY points. The script, the plot arrangement, non-scenceitcal errors in individual scenes and in producing, the cardboard cutout actors (check the gay dude - you canc't miss him - did I say the dialog? I''ll say it again, the dialog! This was all bad. I'm surprised Ice-T got near it, but he imight have had hopes for it. This kids got that is worth the world knowing about, so its a shame they've made such a bomb of it.
