It's a story about villagers bring back the souls of their love ones who passed away into scarecrow bodies. It's based on the horror manga story of Junji Ito. This is the 4th horror movie I watched based on Junji Ito's horror stories. Don't know if it's made by the same director... maybe not, but they seem to mess up every story and make them boring (long time till get to the point, fail to create the horror atmosphere). I was prepared to enjoy the movie when I first got my hands on it. But instead I was bored to anger. The only thing I haven't done is to get the cursing out of my mouth, which it would be pretty meaningless for cursing at the screen.<br /><br />Sums up: it's a movie to waste time and money.
