Well, special effects were quite good for the times. I had heard this was a porno film, but what I saw was much like Euro soft-core. Admittedly it seemed to be cut, but the version I saw was 1:26 whereas the DVD promises 1:30. So, 4 minutes of cuts get this down to an "R"? Anyway, the film, like many sex movies, aims for camp. It hits, sometimes. It misses a lot, too, or else I am missing the jokes. Quite possible, as I don't remember having seen any of the "Flash Gordon" serials. Overall, I can't recommend this one.
