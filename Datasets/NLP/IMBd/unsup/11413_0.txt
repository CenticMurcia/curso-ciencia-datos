A terribly conventional thriller that dilutes Dirty Harry with two parts Hitchcock and forty parts nighttime New Orleans. The story is so thin you can strain jam through it and is padded out with a couple of tension-building sequences. One, during evening Mardi Gras is partially effective but the others are simply padding, chase sequences.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood is as ever, although he seems rather restrained. This may be something to do with having two motherless daughters urging to him on with an indecent assault case worker, played above averagely by Genevi√®ve Bujold. In addition to Bujold, Eastwood has support from Lennie Niehaus' score and Den Hadaya as his colleague Molinari. However the first is overwrought and the second underused. There are too many non sequitur cuts to allow Eastwood to rush off alone and the subplot that someone may be trying to frame him for the murders that he's investigating is abandoned before it even gets going.<br /><br />The film's too short but not if you're actually watching it... 3/10
