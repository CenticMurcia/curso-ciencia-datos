Less importantly, I can't figure out why Sharon Stone is the number one credit when the story isn't really about her character. Other than that, this movie has good intentions and a great story. However, there were a few scenes that just felt overly tense, such as when--possible spoilers--Kevin begins choking on his food and loses consciousness, when Max learns of Kevin's death (which is more disturbing than emotional), and even the scene where Loretta is strangled (but not killed), which is otherwise understandable. This seemingly is supposed to be a family-friendly film, but with these scenes the filmmakers make it look more like a horror/thriller. If the filmmakers had not done this, I believe this film could very easily have been given a PG rating. -6 stars for the tension.
