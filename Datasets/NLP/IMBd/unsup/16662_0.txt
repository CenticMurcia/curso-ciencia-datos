This is an old fashioned Woody Allen film (in other words it's funny). It's got a much more coherent plot than any of his era--with a much more conventional format. While I like the extreme silliness of these earlier starring films, I also see this as a welcome change and his most personally engaging film--it really has a lot of heart.<br /><br />Woody plays a nerdy guy (what else?) who is obsessed with Humphrey Bogart films. He loves them so much that Bogie himself often stops by to give him advice! These moments are wonderful and the actor imitating Bogart is spot on! Well, for some odd reason, his wife doesn't like Woody and leaves (gee, he sounds like the perfect guy, huh?). His married friends, Diane Keaton and Tony Roberts come to give him support and try to set him up with various ladies (none of which comes even close to working out). However, over time, it becomes obvious to everyone except Woody and Diane that THEY would make a great couple. Even Bogie comes to tell Woody to make the moves on his friend's wife! Well, here is where the plot begins to look more and more like CASABLANCA--a natural considering Bogie's in this film, too! Well, I'll stop my review here because I DON'T want to spoil the picture. It's cute, coherent and well worth seeing.<br /><br />PS--a great scene involves Bogie having a showdown with Woody's ex-wife. It's a riot, though in general this movie has more subtlety and less laugh out loud laughs than his previous films but it all works together so well, it's not a problem.
