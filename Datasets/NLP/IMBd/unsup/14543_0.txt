I love this film! It's so wonderful. One of the funniest parts for me is when Lucy and Snoopy box with each other (Snoopy putting the boxing glove on his nose LOL). The Sherman Brothers (a great songwriting team in general) score may not receive a lot of attention by all viewers of this film, but it's terrific.<br /><br />Especially "Me and you/A two man crew/Side by side we're united" plus the title song and Charlie Brown's solo "It Changes".<br /><br />
