I picked up this movie thinking, "Hey it's got Leslie Nielsen in it"... I usually love the characters that Leslie Nielsen plays, but even he could not save this one. It was described as a "comedy" but I really can't remember laughing once. All I could do was sit there and shake my head and pray for a power failure.
