I suppose I'm somewhat biased, but, as someone who worked on the show during it's first season, I found it to be an absolutely abysmal experience.<br /><br />The DOP, while being a pompous ass, managed to turn out something that looked grainy and amateurish. If his talent could only have equaled his impression of himself it might have looked like something decent.<br /><br />Chris, playing "himself" (whatever) and producer, had little tolerance for your normal technical requests other than "find your light".<br /><br />The rest of the cast were quite pleasant to work with.<br /><br />Could have been a good show if the producers had listened to concerns expressed.... or had found something funny to shoot.<br /><br />I always refer to it as a "comedy". Like an updated version of the Monkees, but shot for cable with cursing and without the flying around high speed on wires... and without being funny.<br /><br />You only have so much lamp life on your TV. Save it for something good.
