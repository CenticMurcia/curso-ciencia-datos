I watched your documentary sir, and i can say I was very impressed by your skill to destroy a country like that. Sir, the country is not as poor as you depicted it, you've been here and you know that. You are quite aware of all the efforts the king is making towards the welfare of the people of the kingdom, but you decide to send a different picture to the world. WHY? True there are poverty stricken areas in SD, but Moneni was the wrong choice.First, because it's a township under the town council not Gov. secondly, the water you showed is not the water they drink, you just chose a dirty pond for livestock and that is evident in your documentary as you showed the cleaner water they use for their laundry. phew!!!!!<br /><br />Your documentary is not the true reflection of the people and the beautiful kingdom because it doesn't give different views so it appears that it is a tool you and your friends(lousy political parties of Sd)are using to spark violence in the kingdom. In the documentary, no one is speaking on the side of the king but he himself, who will believe him? We wanted to put our views on that doc. Eish!!! that was very undemocratic 'sir'.<br /><br />Sir, you need to know that the people who always cram the stadiums on the His Majesty's call are not doing that only because they love their culture but because they seriously love and support their King. Would you love someone who hates you? Would you listen to lying lips telling you they love you if you know exactly they don't? Actions speak louder than words, and never at any point will you hear the king telling his people he loves them - ACTION. But they just love him.<br /><br />Watch during Traditional ceremonies, almost 10% of the population goes there. Just last week, we had the people's parliament and people crammed the place to forward their views. Then watch during these rallies which are against the king, you will see the nation standing on pavements just looking at what is going on.<br /><br />Sir, you know exactly that the whole nation is in deeply in the king's heart. you have spent much time with him while making this documentary which HE allowed you to and innocently answered all your questions giving you perfect answers. I think He should be on fire if he does not do anything about this documentary because it is not an insult to him but the whole Swazi nation, so if he really loves us , he should protect us from such.<br /><br />Lastly, it is serious that the luxury the king is enjoying should be watched with open eyes but honestly speaking, it is not true that that Swaziland is poor should be seen in the king's eyes. That he should attend all international duties without food in the stomach because the Swazis are hungry. The people of the kingdom don't want that. Just like any other head of state, so should our king appear, period.<br /><br />Look I stay in swaziland but, Where is this fleet of limousines you are talking about?
