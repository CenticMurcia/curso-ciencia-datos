I think Game of Death shouldn't have went ahead with it's release, Bruce Lee would've been disappointed in it as towards the end of the film after fighting Hikim, you could obviously see that it was no longer Bruce playing the part of Billy Lo and it must've been a kid or someone drunk editing that scene showing Bruce with candles and a punch bag behind him and when it cut to his replacement, there was nothing behind him. The director of this film probably just went ahead with the release to make money and people that are fans of Bruce's work, including his family, must've been left disappointed as well, I certainly was.
