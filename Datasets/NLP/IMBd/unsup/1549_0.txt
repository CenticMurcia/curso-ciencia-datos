Produced and directed by the legendary Cecil B. DeMille. A rough and ready sea drama with very good special effects. Salvagers compete for the cargo of ships wrecked in the reef off the coast of Georgia. Some of the ships go down not by nature, but by the hand of greedy men. An extraordinary finale with an attack of a giant squid. A star studded cast sustains the interest in this stormy and mobile movie. Notable cast members: Raymond Massey, Paulette Goddard, Ray Milland, Susan Hayward, Robert Preston and a bland John Wayne. Yep, the "Duke" has an important role, but does not headline or carry this film. I've seen this at least six times since childhood and I still think it is great. See for yourself.
