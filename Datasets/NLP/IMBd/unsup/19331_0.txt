I won't even try to say anything nice about this horror of a flick, except that some of the chicks were attractive and sparsely attired. (Do women really fly dressed like that?) It pretends to be some kind of blend of Conan Doyle's "Lost World" and "King Kong" but misses by parsecs on both counts. Oh, and lest we forget, the location is kind of a jungle-centered Bermuda Triangle, where airplanes have been crashing for years.<br /><br />We have an ultra-fake giant gorilla; a few frames of a huge, but unarticulated, spider; some giant scorpions that are camera-shy (joke); and a bunch of flying dragon-like reptiles (maybe meant to be pterosaurs) that attack the gorilla like gnats, or maybe wasps. Then there are the indigenous peoples, whose facial makeup -- at least on the boss -- is extraordinary. Anyway, are they really indigenous, or just left-over from previous crashes since they speak English as well as their native tongue? These natives sacrifice the crash survivors (of which there seem to be many more in movies and TV than in real life -- oh, I guess that's why they call it fiction) to the flying beasties because their presence keeps "him" (pseudo-Kong) away. Why this quits working, as at the end of the movie, wasn't at all clear. <br /><br />The best character, and seemingly the castaways' leader, played by the competent Aussie, Rhett Giles, suddenly gets killed off by the by the fake scorpions, mid-flick. My guess is they could only afford to pay him for half the movie.<br /><br />The name player, Bruce Boxleitner, clearly has more name than talent. I can't believe this guy had the chutzpah to think he should have been selected to play 007 rather than Pierce Brosnan. He is along to defuse a nuke, lost in a previous crash, which has a 300 (foot, yard, meter? I forget) blast radius, and, apparently, produces no radiation. Why bother? Actually, that would make a good tag-line for the whole movie: Why Bother?
