I think even I fell in love with the elephant man. To be so disfigured and yet so kind. I cried when the Jerk let his friends "view" the elephant man at night when they picked him up and twirled him around and threw liquor down his throat. And yet he never defended himself. John Hurt was magnificent as John Merrick (elephant man), and Anthony Hopkins played his normal, calm, cool, and collected role as the Dr. I also like the head nurse, because although she wasn't thrilled about him at first, she grew to care for him a great deal, a must see movie.
