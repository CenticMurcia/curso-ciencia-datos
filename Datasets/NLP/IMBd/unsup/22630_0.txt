I watched the movie in 196?. I believe it was a Hallmark production. I immediately sent for the vinyl record which I still have. It was one of the finest musical productions I have ever seen. Is there anything that can be done to convince them to show this wonderful movie again and make it available for purchase? I fell in love with Sally Ann Howes after seeing that movie. The entire cast was magnificent.I would love to see it again.Perhaps if enough people were to contact Hallmark they could be convinced to play it again on TV.Strangely enough I have never seen the Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse version but somehow I feel that it would not compare with this one.
