Put aside all of the talk about technique and animation achievements (although these are done excellently) and enjoy the story for its triumph and splendor of the delivery of God's people. One comment about the animation needs to be said: The emotions of the characters are depicted splendidly, especially by the use of great breathing detail (watch for deep sighs and heaving chests).<br /><br />The sound track is worth having on its own merit. Excellent work by the composer.
