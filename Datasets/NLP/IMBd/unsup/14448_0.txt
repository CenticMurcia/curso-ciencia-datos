Having missed this on Film four UK I was delighted to purchase it off ebay recently. What was waste of time. I understand there is a homage to Seven and yes the technical side of the film is superb, but the plot, acting, pacing, length and direction leaves so much emptiness. I will be honest I have a problem of credibility with female serial killers, they are as rare as having the winning ticket to the lottery whilst being hit by a meteorite, but that could be over looked if the characters were interesting, unfortunately they are not. The whole film lumbers and creaks and when finally it gets to its first surprise ending, believe me it is not a surprise, it's pretence and over use of slow motion is irritating rather than dramatic. After this the audience is left bored and uninterested when the killer/victim leaves and lines up her next victim, imagine Basic Instinct on Valium. Who actually watches this, it was a huge success but I can't quite understand who it would appeal to.
