Just to say to all those who think it's not funny: My 16 year old daughter, who had not seen it before, thought it was hilarious from beginning to end.<br /><br />So did I - even though I had to look up a couple of period references. After all we all still enjoy Shakespeare despite not quite understanding a few of the 16c gags.<br /><br />Despite a slight yawn during Tenement Symphony, the musical numbers were also entertaining - especially Harpo's duet with himself in the mirrors.<br /><br />What one misses is seeing these films at the cinema - as they were intended to be seen - on a large screen with several hundred other people all enjoying the moment. That's why some of the gags seem a bit laboured as there is often a calculated pause for the audience laughter, so that the next gag won't be missed.
