I think someone let a group of college kids get a hold of nice camera equipment while on spring break in Europe. But then, some of my college friends made better flicks than this. The acting was blatant, and though I'm not overly-critical and can usually set aside a poorly-cast film, I couldn't even focus on the movie because everything simply seemed forced. Bad chemistry coupled with predictable lines round off a wasted wait in line at RedBox. The only reason behind even getting the movie was that my wife loves cheesy, happy-ending type films (eg. The Ice Princess, Ella Enchanted) which I stomach for marital peace. Even she was unable to get herself into this one and only finished the movies because, even though you know how it will end, you just have to see it... well, because. I mean, really that's the ONLY reason to finish it. Just because. Because you don't have anything better to do. Because you would just waste your time some other way anyway and laziness keeps you from finding the remote. This movie takes a 'Because' cake. Because I said so.
