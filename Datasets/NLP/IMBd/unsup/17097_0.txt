As far as Crow movies go, this one kicked butt. It was also one of the best movies I have seen in a while. It's a shame that it never really had the publicity it deserved (I'm not even sure if it was even shown in our local movie theatre). Although it seemed to have a slow beginning, things really picked up. In the tradition of the prior two movies, it was just loaded with action, where the newest incarnation (or avatar) fought his way through thick and thin to right the wrongs placed upon him, his girlfriend and her sister.<br /><br />Overall, I gave this movie a 9 out of 10 stars.
