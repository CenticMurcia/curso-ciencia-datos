you can past that the general conceit of the whole film, America turning into a barren wasteland simply because they used up all the oil, is a straw dog impossibility and if you push aside that character's this stupid and ineffective could survive when nearly 2/3rd of the population have passed on, then this certainly had the capacity to be a fun little flick. Now capacity and actuality are two vastly different animals. It doesn't help that the three best actors in the film, Robert Carradine, Micheal Madsen, and Vinnie Jones, are vastly underused. Nor does it bode well that the twists are inane. I didn't completely detest the film and had fun with it up to a point. And while it's among the top of the "8 films to die for", that's more of an indictment on how crappy most of those films were than anything else. This still ranks FAR below "Borderland" <br /><br />My Grade: C-
