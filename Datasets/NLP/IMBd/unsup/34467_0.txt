This movie never gets boring even though at the end it starts to feel a little long. There's too much conversation in it at times, often simple unneeded conversation which probably is suppose to be funny but fails miserably. The good thing about the movie though is that the story moves along quite nicely, even though there's a lot of conversation things actually do happen in it at times. <br /><br />I didn't really like the characters in it because they are stereotypical and simple, but I guess you have to make them like that because if you don't it would be difficult for the audience to get to know all the characters since there is a lot of them in this film. The acting in it is below average, the best acting job in this film I thought was made by the Scottish guy who seemed convincing in his part. Christina Ricci was a huge disappointment since she normally is a great actress but she didn't fit in playing her character. Her accent seemed really fake and phony.
