I first saw "Ceremony" after my friend and I rented it at Blockbuster. We were looking for a good movie to get and were torn between "Something About Mary" and "Ceremony". Now "Ceremony" had a very cool cover (gothic lettering, big ol' demon on the front), so we naturally assumed that it was an awseome flick, which led to us renting it. I wish we got "Something About Mary". After the first 10 minutes of this snorefest we were about ready to throw the VCR out the window. I won't spoil the ending, because I was too confused by the uneven plot to know what happened (I also stopped paying attention mid-way through. Maybe that's why). To sum up, A very slow-moving film with bad acting, bad dialouge, and something that looks like grape jelly being used for blood; that is "Ceremony". So if you are considering seeing this movie, beware! It is not what you expect. They say, "Don't judge a book by its cover," and for "Ceremony", it's true (except it's a movie, not a book).
