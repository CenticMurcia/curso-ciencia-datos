Silverado is a movie I watch frequently only because, like seeing a shocking accident, I feel compelled to review this horrible memory and ease my disbelief.<br /><br />Silverado arrives as a typical Western, with your typical heroes, villains, women, farmers, town in turmoil, obligatory ranch, saloon for the inevitable fight scenes, some evil-doing cowhands, personal vendettas, ultimate gunfights in front of a church no less, and oh yes, even a stampede.<br /><br />Silverado covers all the bases and zealously steals every Western clich√©' available. It has no teeth and its story fails to be daringly different. It lacks a serious lesson, other than good triumphs over evil only if evil gets careless, and it begs the question, "Why did you make this film?" <br /><br />The answer lies somewhere in the conceptual thinking of the writers, who tragically missed an opportunity to take a talented ensemble and make a poignant and meaningful film that actually had the potential to send a true message.<br /><br />I also found some irony in the movie's last line uttered by Costner's "Jake", where he simply states, "We'll be back!" <br /><br />I sincerely hope not, and so far, so good!
