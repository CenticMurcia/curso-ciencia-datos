I have heard so many people complain about the ending of this film. Now that I have seen it I am dismayed by what their comments reveal about the general lack of depth in society. Anyone who doesn't get it has either never been in a loving long term relationship or is just another person waiting for something on-screen to explode. Obviously, it is meant for a viewing audience over the age of consent. Definitely thought provoking and defintely worth watching.
