This movie is horrendous. If you ever have the opportunity to see it, run for your very sanity. Courtney Cox makes millions per year from Friends...what the hell ever possessed her to create this monstrosity. Not only are the acting and writing atrocious but her character is so completely unlikable and immoral in so many ways that I just wanted her to be hit by a truck or be slaughtered with an axe wielded by the David Arquette character. Never let your 14 year old go to the movie rental place by herself to pick the movie. Now, please excuse me while I go rinse my eyes out with bleach to try and cleanse myself of the festering tripe I just watched.
