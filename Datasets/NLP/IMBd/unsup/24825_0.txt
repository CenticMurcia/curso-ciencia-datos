"Mysterious Skin" is right on the mark. Araki explores ten years in the lives of two youths who were abused as children. Araki shows how each youth struggles to get a grip on some sort of normality in life. Importantly he also shows the abuser's self-justification process.<br /><br />We are given a hell of a lot of brain exercise during this film. It is by equal amounts compelling, moving, beautiful and shocking.<br /><br />We see that although the youths' parents were not directly to blame for the abuse, they certainly contributed through indifference or inaction. Hopefully viewers will be strongly inclined to take a proactive interest in the empowerment and protection of their children. Child abuse affects the victim for life.<br /><br />Mysterious Skin deserves to reach the widest possible audience, but I would caution that victims of sexual abuse may find this film to be very traumatic. They should go with a trusted friend, and have access to suitable counseling.
