If your a fan of lifetime, you will probably find this movie "touching", "inspirational", and "realistic". If you are a teenager like myself who once and awhile stumbles across a movie such as this one, you will find it utterly phony and predictable.<br /><br />The part that really annoyed me about this movie was the fact that when they would talk about girls doing slutty things in high school, or dress code violations, the girls would stand up and show themselves off while the guys whistle. Excuse me???? At least from my personal experience, that has never been the case. Yes the girls want to express themselves through clothes, but every time someone said "You look slutty in that outfit.", the girl who it was being directed to would blush or try to shrug it off.<br /><br />The whole film was predictable, and I found myself saying "How much longer till she gives the baby to the blonde teacher and her husband?" The only part remotely enjoyable about it was the actress who played Jacey (awful name by the way). For some reason, I could not stop staring at her. Perhaps its because of her deep performance or perhaps the striking resemblance to Lindsay Lohan ala Freaky Friday. Those were the good IL' days...
