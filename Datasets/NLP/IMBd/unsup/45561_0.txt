This movie does not know what it wants to be, is it a slapstick or romantic comedy?<br /><br />Michael Richards' character can't get away from the Kramer character. Is he this oddball or a serious actor? He flips back and forth between the two. And in the courtroom, one second, he is fooling everyone with his acting, then the next, he becomes a complete dimwit w/o the ability to improvise through anything.<br /><br />I'm not sure why the prosecutor would even phrase so many arguments so that it would be constantly objected, given that she has all the legal training.<br /><br />
