My students clamor for this version of The Miracle Worker, insisting that the modern filming techniques (like color) make it a better film. I insist that we read the original play and watch the 1962 version first. Most students are then quickly disappointed by the 2000 version. The only thing going for Hallie is that she looks closer to the age Helen actually was at the time, and she has a slight resemblance to Helen's childhood pictures. Otherwise, she is much too presentable to be believable as Helen. The remake also tampers with the original script. Too much attention is given here to the internal conflicts of James Keller---the jealousy of Kate and Helen and the need for his father's approval. The 1962 screenplay is more faithful to the original Broadway play, which is understandable since William Gibson wrote both. In short, the only purpose this film serves is to demonstrate, through comparison with the original, the power of the classic and the weaknesses of the remake.
