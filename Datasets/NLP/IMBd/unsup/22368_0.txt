I caught this on the Lifetime Movie Network and watched it because Megan Ward of "General Hospital" was in it. It's a pretty clever story with the device of showing the actions of a certain character, then showing a clock moving backwards and showing the actions of another character leading up to the same point. The movie has quite a few interesting twists.<br /><br />The acting isn't much, and obviously the budget wasn't very big - the biggest name here is David Dukes, who plays Ward's wealthy husband. He doesn't have much to do, and it's surprising that he took the role. Apparently this was a feature film, which I find hard to believe - maybe it went straight to video. It's a strictly TV cast, particularly Ward and Linden Ashby.<br /><br />If you see it's on and you like mystery and suspense films, you'll probably like it. Or you might want to rent it because the sex stuff is cut on TV.
