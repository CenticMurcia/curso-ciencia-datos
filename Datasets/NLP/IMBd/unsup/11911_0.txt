Sorry to disagree with so many negative reviews. I have not seen the original with Jack Lemmon and I don't doubt the original is much better than the remake, but I feel the obligation to tell everyone that I really enjoyed this movie a lot, that I love Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn, who are in the list of my favorite actors, and that this movie is really funny. Therefore, I wish to recommend this version and I can assure you that you won't regret it.
