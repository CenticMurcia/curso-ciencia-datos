I went to see this yesterday and I wish I'd saved my Â£7 and a precious 2 hours of my already valuable time...I'm just glad that I didn't buy any refreshments while I was there too!! I went to see this movie, based on the trailer and the fact that I like Jennifer Garner and I'm a girl who's a stickler for girlie/romantic films.<br /><br />I usually like these kind of movies, even when the majority of people don't...from movies like Sydney White, Princess Diaries, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days and 13 going on 30 to Mean Girls. Other than Mean Girls, the rest aren't hugely clever, witty or original, but nevertheless, they are movies that I enjoy to watch when I feel like a no-brainer movie-watching session.<br /><br />So, when I saw the trailer for this, I thought, "wow, maybe a slightly original twist for a change...might be worth a couple of hours of my time." So, I went and while only 20 mins into it, my friends turned to me and said, "This isn't very good is it?" to which I responded, "no, it's a bunch of crap." Usually by this point, we have walked out on movies, but silly me decided to continue anyway.<br /><br />The main worse parts for me, though the whole movie can just be summed up as a whole "worse part", were the crassness and crudity of it which I found completely unbelievable. Do women really continually swoon over a guy who generally treats women like they are nothing? If so, I think those women should take a look at themselves as I'm pretty sure they have issues. Every 5 minutes my eyes, ears and mind were polluted with derogatory comments, sexual innuendos, scenes of a sexual nature. One scene that I shook my head in utter disbelief was when the lead character just groped an older lady's breast at a bar, and yet she made no effort to slap him or talk him down...would women seriously let a guy do this?<br /><br />The only good parts or vaguely amusing were...and I'm really scraping the barrel here, were the times when Lacy Charbert freaked out in the way she does best a la Mean Girls. They were the only times I felt myself laugh a little.<br /><br />This movie in the UK was a 12a and as I work with kids younger than this regularly, I would not want them to see this movie...not only because it is really bad but it is littered with smut and vulgarity. In the cinema, there were a number of kids under 12 either who got in but clearly put make-up on to make them look 12 or they were with an adult. If I was watching this with a child by my side, I would be very uncomfortable and escort us both out! I had no feeling for the characters whatsoever. Jennifer Garners character didn't even come across as disliking the main character at all. He supposedly broke her heart, yet she continues to like him and even treat him with some sort of respect, despite the fact he never treats anyone with any respect - not even his own brother at times.<br /><br />I implore you to rent a movie or two instead of seeing this, or see something else at the movies - anything else.
