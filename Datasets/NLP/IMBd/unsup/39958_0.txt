I watched this last night. Awful, but sometimes really bad is really good. Low points: - Bad North American accents by British actors. You might fool Britons, but not North Americans. The Chief of Defense staff sounded like he had a stroke, and I loved the guy with the overacted Southern drawl. - Unrealistic. A whole bunch of scientists detected the comet at a number of different places, but only our hero scientist can break the news to the world. I could go on. - The U.S. government is relying on the scientific advice of two scientists, even though the end of the world is about to happen. Maybe ask a few others for opinions, you know? - After six weeks of evacuations, there are still people waiting at the airport when the big day comes. - Bad science and bad script. Could've used a scientific adviser AND a script adviser. Too many science errors to count, poor character development with weird dialog. - Poor U.S., taking one for the team. The comet hit near Lake Ontario, which would have taken out about an area in Canada that supports about half the population (works out to about 16 million people). Remember Canada? It's the world's second-largest country by area, is about half of North America, and shares a queen with England. Darn Colonials.
