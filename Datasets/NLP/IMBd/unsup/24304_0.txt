The quality of animation in some bits is inspiring, and the breadth of what they are spoofing is amazing, you know your truly geek if you can figure out most of even the most esoteric (look up word if you don't know what it means, because it actually is ) references<br /><br />Season 2 <br /><br />There are some gems in season two, however due to the fact that the DVD is uncensored, it makes it a bit more harsh, especially because most of the time we know what they're saying the overuse of the word douche seems to be without a doubt lack of a thesaurus in scripting, yes as immature as it can be, it's still kind of a funny word , but not used as a crutch the way most of the fart jokes come across, which there seem to be more in the second season than in the first, even though I don't think there really are in season two. Most of the bits go on longer than they should and push it farther than what's funny . . . aka, the Chief skit. <br /><br />Religious satire is great, I believe morel orel is a show dedicated to that ... however Jesus and the Argonots (Despite the fact that the name is funny) I think it's just over the top, and doesn't hit the nail on the head at all, especially because if you're going to satirize something you should do it in the confines of what you're doing. (Meaning if your going to spoof something, have the thing your spoofing act the way he should and write the comedy around it, don't use the name, and put a whole different spin on what it is ) I'm a Christian and out of all the religious spoofs in the show, this is the only one that actually bothers me, * that and Buddah isn't a god in the religion. (season one) <br /><br />"Take care of the environment or I'll F$*(#&ing kill you" - Captain Planet<br /><br />I work for an NBC news affiliate, and their are some truly sick things in this world I'm happy there's a show out their that can make fun of it. <br /><br />I think it is a truly amazing show,
