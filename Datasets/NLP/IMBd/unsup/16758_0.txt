I saw this movie for one reason--Bela Lugosi. He was not the star of the film, but Ricardo Cortez--a man, who like Lugosi, was in a very lean time in his career--being forced to appear in lesser and lesser films. Both of the men were a long way from their glory days but both dealt with it in a very, very different way. Cortez would soon quit Hollywood and establish a very successful career on Wall Street. Lugosi, conversely, left Universal after this film and began appearing in even crappier films for smaller studios--the so-called "Poverty Row" studios such as Monogram.<br /><br />This film is an oddity because it's both a crime movie AND musical! Cortez investigates various scams that go through the mail. Eventually his path took him to Lugosi and a pretty young singer that works for him (Patricia Ellis). None of it was particularly great--and I found myself dozing off again and again.<br /><br />If you are looking for a horror film or a movie that is going to offer some thrills, try another movie. The film isn't terrible...just not all that great, either.
