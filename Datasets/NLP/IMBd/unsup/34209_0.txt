Well during a girls night out we were looking for a good, scary movie, or a good chick flick, we were all in the mood for a scary movie, and from the looks of the cover this seemed to be what we were looking for. We rented it in hopes to watch it late and be scared enough not to sleep. Well it wasn't scary and there were no parts of it that were scary, although it was good for a few laughs. There were just some parts of it that were so stupid, that you would laugh at it. Me and my friends were having more fun making fun of the movie than we had most of the night. The camera shots are horrible, and there are a lot of cheesy scenes and cheesy lines. The first hint that it is prob going to be dumb is the fact that a room is haunted. It makes it seem like a first graders scary movie. I must say if you are wanting to watch a cheesy movie that you and your friends can make fun of, this works. I don't think someone should watch it alone because it isn't as fun that way. It would be a lot more stupid by yourself than with someone. If your into cheesy films this is a good one, but if you are not a fan of dumb things then I suggest not even trying it. The cover of the movie is deceiving. They did a lot better on the cover graphics than they did on the graphics through the whole movie.
