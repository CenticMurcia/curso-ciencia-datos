*spoilers* I will admit that I was unable to make it all the way through this movie. The two reasons for this were.<br /><br />1. Narrators voice was monotone. When you narrate a movie, it will pull the audience out of the experience, so you better have a really fun/sad/interesting voice to listen to. The narrator did not seem to care what was going on, no matter what happened it was always the same low drone voice. Picture Ben Stein.. "Bueller? Bueller? Bueller?".<br /><br />Some people had touched on bad acting, but I can live with a bad actor if the movie has a believable plot line. Which brings me to #2 <br /><br />2. So what made this movie soo unbelievable? The fact that, in 1998, a poor bunch of public access TV hosts had access to the internet in the middle of the woods. Even today we don't really have access in remote areas without expensive equipment. Perhaps I missed the explanation of how this was possible.. but I doubt it. I love IRC, so to see this movie use it as part of the plot line was laughable..<br /><br />In closing, I hope that everyone involved in this movie learned from it. The Blair Witch creators took this idea and made it better. 10x better and even The Blair Witch kind of sucked. So when you see this playing on Sundance or IFC, please take that into consideration.
