What a waste of film stock. Overly atmospheric. Dafoe and Walken mailed their performances in. Argento couldn't find a stamp. The dialogue seemed like improvisation, which I hope it was, because nobody should have been paid for it. Even the possible saving grace of sex and nude scenes were uninspired.
