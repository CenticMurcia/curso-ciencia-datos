This movie is one of the greatest ever! I like it very, very much. It's a great start for Dreamworks. Unlike some other people, I think it was a good idea to make an animated movie about the Bible story and Moses. Animation is great, music also and it's good they made some characters funny. I think it would be a shame to miss a great movie like this one is. So go and see it!!!
