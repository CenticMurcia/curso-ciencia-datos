There is rarely a film I ever give a bad review on, but in this case I'll make an exception. This film was truly horrendous. Maybe I approached it in the wrong angle, not at all used to the idealism of the 80's, but this movie represented all that was horribly clich√© and unrealistic about high school and typical suburban life.<br /><br />All the jokes were stereotypical, whether it was making fun of the freshman geek or the Chinese exchange student. The scenes that were supposed to be poignant and heart-felt were instead mawkish and completely fake. Who's to believe that a handsome high school senior, disillusioned by the party life, would ever take a second glance at a gawky sophomore? I couldn't even bring myself to feel sorry for the main character, whose constant 'woe is me' asides at the audience made me want to slap her and tell her to grow up.<br /><br />In all, a lot of eyerolling went on. I only watched it for some hope that the film would redeem itself. It ended on the worst note possible.
