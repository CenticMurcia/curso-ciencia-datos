To my mind this is just an average ordinary silly film. The entire film takes place in an hotel. This is just fine but by showing some shots of a Tokyo skyscraper hotel heaven only knows what Ms. Coppola wished to convey. May be she wanted to depict that as people live in high buildings their feelings,emotions become low. A word about the bewildered American in Japan oh no Tokyo. Bill Murray looks utterly lost as if he has not been paid his salary for playing the part in the film. Scarlett is fine but she could have done better. The worst thing about this film is that Japanese people were caricatured. It is as if all the Japanese people use very long sentences even for expressing simplest of ideas. For all those lost souls interested in Japan bashing, please watch Alain Corneau's film "Stupeur et tremblements".
