I saw GO after reading a number of very good reviews for the movie, and I cannot begin to express how disappointed I was. It left me with many unanswered questions: 1. What was the point of this film? If the film-makers were trying to make some sort of statement about contemporary society, their point certainly eluded me. 2. Why did I have to spend almost 2 hours with these characters? I did not like or care about any of the people in this film. They were presented without a shred of humanity, and I didn't BELIEVE any of them. 3. Why did the movie makers try to imitate so much of the style and structure and atmosphere of PULP FICTION? Tarantino's film hit all the right notes, and his characters - in spite of their amorality - all had a certain charisma. The characters in GO were loud and shrill and charmless. 4. Why can't the US film industry make films that tell intelligent, interesting stories with some appeal to people over the age of 17?
