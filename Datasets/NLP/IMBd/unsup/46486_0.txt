So... I was pretty excited about this movie.. then bad reviews kept me from seeing this movie in theaters. And again, when it came out on DVD. I waited for a month to give it a try. I finally picked it up for free using a coupon and now I regret wasting the gas to pick it up. I was expecting the worst and the movie was worse than even that. The screenplay and the dialogue was so bad that I couldn't help but laugh at it. It was so cheesy that I couldn't even bare it in fast forward.<br /><br />Here are the worst of the worst parts. Chris Klein tried to put on a serious face to play a bad ass cop only to have it come off as if my 5 year old nephew is pretending to be mad at me....<br /><br />There was a huge scene where Chun-Li, the heroine, is sobbing and whimpering before she leaves for Thailand (a temporary visit). She goes "I'm leaving everything I know... etc." WHAT THE HELL. Would "the bride" whimper and cry to her friends before she goes off to KILL BILL??? Did I mention the bad screenplay??? <br /><br />For spending her entire life in Hong Kong, Chun Li could not speak Chinese to save her life. <br /><br />The funniest part was when Chun Li's dad was being dragged away by Bison's Crew. Chun Li's mom comes running out hysterical only to get slapped down to the ground. It looked like a Marlon Wayans hysterical run from "Scary Movie". <br /><br />The script begs the question.. which idiot producer read the script and green lighted the film? And how desperate were the actors to take the role? I mean I've seen bad.. but this is just nonsensical.
