This rental was a surprise hit at my house. It takes a bit of time to get into, but each one of the main characters is well written and acted. The flatulent and nervous Charlie is a comedic turn by Liam Neeson like I've never seen him; Oliver Platt's psychotic Mafia hitman Fulvio (who just wants to grow some great tomatoes) is tremendous - the next-door-neighbor scene had us rolling. The gay drug lords, Sandra Bullock's Enema Queen, Fulvio's equally psychotic wife, and the men's support group are icing on the cake.<br /><br />You do have to pay some attention to this flick because the humor is character-based and until they develop it's slow. But the payoff is great as Charlie tries to hold together a deal between drug lords and Mafiosos who are all too ready to use guns to resolve their differences.
