Soft core movie from Full Moon's Twilight division. Basically Meredyth Holmes thinks there is more to life than sex but then thanks to an alien visitor (who of course is a studly guy) she realises she might have been wrong. Fairly entertaining, good production and score (by Reg Powell). Largely well acted and Holmes is much prettier than the the usual cast of such fare though her main erotic scene is a long way coming - largely due to the fact that all her friends have to recount their own sexual adventures and escapades in order to get her in the mood. These short tales are a little tedious but each is different with a western scene, some bondage and various other things.
