Cowboy Bebop is not just an anime. It's an experience. Most people might say that anime it's just for kids and things like that, but Cowboy Bebop it's life in a different time and place. If you like guns, spaceships and good music, this is for you. A group of Bounty Hunters looking for criminals, that is how you see the series the first time you watch it, but believe me: THIS IS A MUST SEE if you want to feel alive. In this anime, you'll learn about true friendship, love, loneliness, the consequences of the past, and life indeed... not to mention the super packed action scenes. You will never forget the music neither. The soundtrack is awesome and placed exactly within the series. Believe me, If you want to watch something beautifully crafted, meet unforgettable characters, laugh, think about life, cry maybe or just to watch something ULTRA COOL, It's your thing.<br /><br />See you later, Space Cowboys...
