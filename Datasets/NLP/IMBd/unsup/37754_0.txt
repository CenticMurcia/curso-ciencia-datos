****Spoilers**** This has to be one of the lamest, most predictable movies I have ever seen. The plot is predictable, the acting is barely passable and the fight scenes are marginal. I mean in one scene, where the hero is being attacked by foe after foe, ad-nauseum, you see some of the "dead" move out of the way of another falling foe! In another scene, it looks like the hero and the villain are trying to step on each other's toes! If that isn't bad enough, and this is a spoiler, (as if this movie was unpredictable to have that matter) the hero all but give up when he is lead to believe the great love of his life is dead only to be given renewed hope from a weed sticking up from a crack in the floor! Having said all that, I found myself staying up late just to watch the end of the movie! Bottom line...Not a good movie, but a fun movie! A 4 out of 10
