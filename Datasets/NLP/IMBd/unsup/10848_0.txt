I saw this series a long time ago when it was aired on TV. I really liked it. Especially the mix between drama, humor, cop stories and a attorney stories. All rolled up in one. The chemistry between the characters was good. And i also remember different kinds of interesting side stories concerning family matters. It is a pity that it wasn't successful. Because it stopped after only one season. Unfortunately, because i really liked it. So now i have a question. Because I'd like to see this series again. Does anyone know if it is available on DVD (or download) anywhere? Please leave a comment on that. √ç would be grateful. thank you very much.
