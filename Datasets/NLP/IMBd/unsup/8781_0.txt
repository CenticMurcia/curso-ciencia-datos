This is the best FPS game I have ever played. It has great graphics and excellent gameplay. The cutscenes are top notch but the accents were a bit too much. The bad thing is that the levels were too short. I think it was a level where you were playing as the British, that level took me 10 mins to complete. And the whole game only took me 6 hours too complete, I don't know about you, but that is really quick as top quality games like Prince of Persia or MEdal Of Honour usually takes me around 10 or 20 hours too complete. The controls for the level where you had to row the boat could've been made easier as it was virtually impossible to do. And they took out the air missions which were a bit disappointing, but all in all, it is a great game.
