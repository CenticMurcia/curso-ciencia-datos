I'm a huge fan of "B" movies. Especially "B" horror movies from the 80's but this one simply has nothing to offer. A complete waste of time. The story is lack luster and very unbelievable. The lack of a story line usually does not pose a serious problem for most "B" movie fans as long as there are other components of the film that make it fun to watch. This movie comes up short in almost every aspect of what I consider to be "B" movie magic. The only value I was able to find in this title was the numerous continuity issues. They gave me something to do while I was waiting for this movie to end. Don't waste your time on this one.
