This film is about the family interaction after a boy is found to have leukaemia.<br /><br />It is particularly striking that this film is able to detail the human emotions, and the bond between brothers so well. It portrays John and Joey as an inseparable pair of siblings, and they would do anything to make each other happy. John agrees to do the unachievable to make Joey happy, and this strive for success inspired by another person is something that is touching and remarkable. For a moment, I worried about sibling rivalry between John and joey due to the difference in ability, but fortunately this does not happen. The joy of the family when Joey walks again is so real and convincing. Of course, the final scene is so touching that sends me to tears.<br /><br />It has a simple plot, but it is so effective in provoking feelings. It is so real, so human and it portrays something that is so close to our hearts.
