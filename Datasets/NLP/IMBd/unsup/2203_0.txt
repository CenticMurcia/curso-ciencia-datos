Charlie and Rachael are on their way to Las Vegas to elope, but when they take a back-road. They are pulled over by a demonic cop who abducts Rachael and takes her back to hell. Charlie goes back to the gas station to the old guy who warned them of what could happen. He tells Charlie that Hell cop has taken her to hell city to be married off to Satan. The only way to get her back is to venture along hell's highway and to rescue within 24 hours or both of them will be stuck there.<br /><br />Who likes weird? I do! "Highway to Hell" is so unusual and extremely refreshing in its vision that I couldn't help but love its labyrinth of dazzling ideas and overall junky goodness. This fantasy-horror b-feature proves even with such a miniature budget that creativeness doesn't cost a dime. If you sport a gleefully, juicy script and a willingness to go-out there with an impulsively odd recipe (which this film definitely does), it can go a long way in the finish product.<br /><br />What keeps this film really buoyant has to be its sly sense of humour, which is so resourceful in its inspired strokes and interesting diversions that feature heavily in the foreground. Campy dialogues beaming with delicious in-jokes and an odd batch of characters (loved the scene with Hitler in it) add to the rollicking madness. Watch out as the blistering pace clocks over the speed limit with such ease and driving this is a seeping, novel music score and spanking soundtrack. Ate De Jong's direction is crackling with verve and unsparing thrills. While the cheap foundation shows up prominently, he manages to work around it superbly. Robin Vidgeon's stylishly soothing camera-work is another colourful contribution that has no has boundaries.<br /><br />A fine cast really do kick in here. Chad Lowe smoothly fits in as the gawky, but jittery, strong-willed heroine Charlie. The exquisite Kristy Swanson is very likable with a certain edge about her character Rachael. Patrick Bergin reeks of charisma and is very convincing in his deceitful role. C.J. Graham is very imposing as the hell cop figure. Look out for Ben Stiller who chips in with a hilarious performance/s. Making up the rest of the solid performances are Richard Farnsworth, Lita Ford, Adam Stroke, Pamela Gidley and Gilbert Gottfried.<br /><br />This spaced-out pearler is grand fun and features one hell of a romp.
