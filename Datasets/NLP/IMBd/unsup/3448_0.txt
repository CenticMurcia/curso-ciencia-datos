Being a HUGE fan of the horror genre, I have come to expect and appreciate cheesey acted, plot-holes galore, bad scripts, horrible lighting and effects, and cliches after cliches. But these things is what make me like horror movies so much. No other genre can get away with this qualities like the horror genre can. Unfortunately, Blood Lake barely does. It is an absolute desperate attempt to cash in on the success of the "camp-slashers" of the 80s's. A group of teens spend the weekend at a lakeside cabin and get butchered. Nothing new here folks. The movie plays out like a bad, bad soap opera and transcends into a laughable mess. The killer and his motives are like something out of a bad "Scary Movie" clone rather than something that is attempting to be a serious slasher film. With that said, amazingly enough I WOULD recommend Blood Lake to any SERIOUS horror movie fan, if only to see the good old days of the horror genre, when a films like this could get made.
