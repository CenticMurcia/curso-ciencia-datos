I watched Dae Jang Geum from DVD. I was more convince by my best friend Jory . i had always associate Yeong-ae Lee with a sort of saccharine , sweet piety but watching it showed a different side and made me admire her deep humility, a virtue that is strange to us now a days, Yeong ae Lee infuses her character with beauty , wit, and intensity. I personally enjoyed the period of settings, customs, " Cooking demo" colorful costumes, etc. as well as finding the character believable and engaging. I recommend this film to anyone of any age, who is looking for uplifting, true story , that will make you laugh and cry ones in a while..Mabuhay!!
