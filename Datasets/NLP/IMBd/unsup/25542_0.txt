This noir thriller has two of the biggest names in Hollywood in the 1940s and they are paired here in an interesting, if not too exciting, film. Humphrey Bogart, for all of the heroic roles during this stage of his career, is cast against type, and Barbara Stanwyck, always the femme fatale, is now a damsel in distress as matters spiral beyond her control as grave danger closes in on her. The role-reversals of the stars works well and the byplay between them is good. They are supported by Alexis Smith, quite stunning as the other woman who comes along to complicate matters for artist Bogart, who is, of course, hopelessly smitten with her. The remaining cast is good, as is Franz Waxman's somber music accompaniment. The camera work is also first-rate.
