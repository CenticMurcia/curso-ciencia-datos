George Bessudo rabidly joins the already flooded list of Nazi directors who are so predictable it boggles the mind. The vehicle for his Hitler worship is a mundane goofy chop up bodies for Beavis and Butthead viewers flick.<br /><br />Just another film which bends over backwards to show that dark haired women are meant to die. There just isn't anything more to this. And it is what we have gotten in 95% of action films since 1965 or so. Bessudo waves his swastika in the audience's face, and isn't a bit subtle about it. It was old 40 years ago, and produces bigger yawns today. Bessudo has absolutely no talent, and produces not one iota of creativity. He is what he is, and he isn't afraid to flaunt it.<br /><br />The science fiction channel whips out garbage like this way too much to be coincidence.
