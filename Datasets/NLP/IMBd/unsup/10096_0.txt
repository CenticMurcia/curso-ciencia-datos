Good, gothic-feeling movie. Richard Lynch, with his searing eyes, gaunt, handsome face, flowing blonde hair and sexy voice was a natural to play the vampire, Anton Voytek. Seeing him come up out of the earth, roaring in pain and anguish of being sealed up in his tomb of earth for nearly 40 years was a very creepy site. I highly recommend this movie for vampire movie fans and for Richard Lynch fans it is a MUST SEE I believe this was really the first time I noticed Richard Lynch. I am not sure if I saw him in anything else, previously, but this movie left me wanting to see him in everything he has/had ever done.
