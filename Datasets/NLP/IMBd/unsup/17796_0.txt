It's definitely the best Turkish comedy made ever. As there are lots of drama's made in Turkey, it is so nice to see comedy that makes everyone laugh till tears come from eyes. The problem about the movie, is not everyone would be able to understand all jokes. If you are a not a Turk and especially do not know anything about Cem Yilmaz (the actor), then it would even seem silly to you. The Turkey's best comedian ever Cem Yilmaz's one man show. He is just awesome that it is so surprising that Mazhar Alanson has been able to adopt him , and not pressed under the Yilmaz's wonderful performance. Alanson, who is a singer, is also starred in some other films, which were disappointments, performed well enough to made the film best Turkish comedy made ever. Thanks to both actors for shooting such a nice movie. If you wonder about Turkey and see how the middle-class life in Turkey in a funny way you should watch this film. I don't know, if some of the jokes would loose their meanings in English or some other language but I'm sure it would make you laugh even only with Cem Yilmaz's own acting.
