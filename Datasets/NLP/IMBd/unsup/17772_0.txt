Now we come full circle so to speak , we've made Baattle Galactica again , Star Trek in Dec , and more are coming out , Land of the Lost and V: The Second Coming , so why is Hollywood afraid of remaking Space:1999 , with today's technology and the use of more nuclear devices , doesn't it seem more real to remake Space:1999 with a possible return flight to the Moon , call it Space:2020 or Space:2112 the future is now people , it's here before us . They have the money and know how to remake Battlestar , why not Space:1999 , remake:) It's about time .<br /><br />You have the directors and stars , I would to see Sam Neill play a Barry Morse type character , or Tom Weller as a Tony Verdeshci type role and Zooey Deschanel as the Barbara Bain type character , haven't yet decided on the character of John Koenig , I think Christian Bale would be great as John Koenig .<br /><br />Please remake Space :1999 , it's important .
