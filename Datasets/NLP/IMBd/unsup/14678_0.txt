I learned things I didn't know about Fanny and I thought Julia Davis's portrayal of her was absolutely spot on. It was fun to watch and quite touching in places. Fanny became a much more human personality after watching this play/comedy/drama and I felt very sympathetic to her even though she was obviously an extremely difficult person to live with.<br /><br />I felt very sorry for her family as well. She obviously had quite a collection of personality disorders which were not being recognised or helped. For eccentricity read 'in need of psychiatric or psychoanalytical help'.<br /><br />Blue eggs with mayonnaise made us all laugh. I thought the lady member of the publics menu sounded yummy.
