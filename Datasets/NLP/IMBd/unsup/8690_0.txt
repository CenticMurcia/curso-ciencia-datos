Ever since I saw this on tv many years ago, it has been my favorite Sleepy Hollow. I've seen 3 other Sleepy Hollows, including the most recent one with Johnny Depp, and I still prefer this one. One of the elements I love most is its authenticity. I think it is very true to the original story that everyone knows, and so many of the actors and actresses are perfectly suited for their characters. Jeff Goldblum is excellent as Ichabod Crane; besides his tall and gangly appearance, he has an amazing ability for playing quirky characters. I have yet to see someone do a better performance. Dick Butkus gives a great supporting performance as the coarse, insensitive Brom Bones as well. This is a movie that I wish would be shown every year at Halloween; I think it could become a tradition just like The Grinch at Christmas. If you come across it in a video store, it's definitely worth seeing.
