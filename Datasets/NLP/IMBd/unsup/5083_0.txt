Part Hitchcock thriller, part Sirk melodrama and part Wilder cynical comedy, this far-fetched, and at times, absurd and overheated drama is destined to become one of my favorite Almodovar films. The film's plot is ridiculous, filled with unbelievable twists and silly coincidences (and a stupid happy conclusion to boot), but it is energetically directed by a filmmaker that never ceases to amaze me. It is as if Almodovar said, "forget logic, and let's have some fun." This attitude worked for Hitchcock, Argento, and De Palma, and it certainly works for Almodovar. Critics may complain about the film's lack of substance, but Almodovar's stylish direction is more than enough to make the production satisfying and interesting. I don't think it is as good as Almodovar's "Talk to Her (2001)" and "Bad Education (2004)" (my favorite Almodovar films, so far), but it is definitely one of the best Spanish films I've seen. It is wickedly funny, and very sensual movie, but not for viewers who demand realistic situations. Affonso Beato's cinematography is brilliant, and Alberto Iglesias' over the top music score reminds me of Miklos Rozsa in his prime. Give it a chance, you won't be disappointed.
