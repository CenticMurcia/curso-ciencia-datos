For starters, In regards to MICDI and claiming that American Gun was made before Crash is wrong ; Crash had already started filming in late 2003 and finished in early 2004. While American Gun didn't start filming until the summer of 2004. Just to clarify American Gun is a film about the lives and 8 people and how each of them are affected in different ways by guns in America. This movie is almost exactly like Crash with the exception of a little Bowling for Columbine mixed in. I did not enjoy this movie, it focuses too much on one type of class of people. It does not show how other classes of society are affected by guns in America. But I guess thats what you get with a movie that is just a little over and hour and thirty minutes long. Another thing i thought about this movie is it didn't have enough good actors (with the exception of Donald Sutherland and Forest Whitaker). So if you want a movie that shows emotion and depth the whole subject of the movie, I suggest that you rent Crash. And THEN see American Gun, you will notice a big difference.
