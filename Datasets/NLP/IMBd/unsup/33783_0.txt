First of all, I have seen only some parts of the last episode and also some small parts of other episodes (more then it deserves). I also read the novel. Where shall I start? The writing is just horribly ridiculous and unrealistic (for example: Valjean tells Cosette that Marius was wounded in the barricade, and all she seems to care about is that Valjean finally accepted him), the acting of ALL the actors, except for the guy who portrays Gillenormand, is terrible (especially John Malkovich as Javert and Depardieu (spl?) as Valjean, with his one face expression), the characters have turned into something very weird (Valjean is in love with Cosette?! 'Ponine sleeps with Marius?! Cosette turns into a spoiled brat who wants to dance?! I'm sure that Hugo is turning in his grave...), the whole thing is full of plot holes (Gavroche never ages, the Thenardiers wearing nice cloths, Javert hears the "Vive la republic" and does nothing) and why the hell is Gavroche Marius' best friend?! and 'Ponine tells the gang to rob Cosette's house? and why do everyone call her "'Ponine" for God sakes?! This is probably because their source materials were the musical and some sick fanfiction. This is probably the worst adaptation I've ever seen. The only good thing I can think of is the setting and the costumes (and Gillenormand, who usually is kept out of adaptations).
