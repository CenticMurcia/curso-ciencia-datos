This ride sucks. I love Star Wars and there is no Star Wars character in this one. It is mediocre when compared to other simulators like Back to the future and Spiderman.<br /><br />Star Wars deserved a better ride. I still can't believe they have created a Star Wars ride without a single Jedi Knight, Sith Lord or light saber fight.
