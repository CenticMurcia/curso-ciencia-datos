Way back then I remembered that after presenting a code to solve, the head man stepped down and walked down the aisle asking "When do we go home?" to which everyone responded "When the job is done." Continuing to walk he asked "When is the job done?" The response in one word; "Never". That main room had a James Bond atmosphere about it in my mind. Especially the elevated office with vertical shades if memory serves me right. This was my first introduction to the art and science of codes, ciphers, and such. No I didn't continue in it but it is an interesting subject. I agree with a previous reviewer in that one tends to remember this movie for a long time, or at least parts of it if my memory is correct and not corrupted by time. The movie is worth the time to watch and you will watch parts of it again and again in your mind.
