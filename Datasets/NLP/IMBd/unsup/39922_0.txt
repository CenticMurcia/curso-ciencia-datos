I just watched this movie, and it took me 10 minutes to realize that I already saw it before (but never made it to the end). It's that forgettable. For starters, its interminable, almost 3 hours. It's a huge production, with a cast of a thousand, all famous French actors and with James Caan thrown in for good measure. There is an unending cast of poorly portrayed characters, new characters small and large popping up all the time. It's like watching a French telephone book made into a movie. Trying to keep it straight? Take a load of this, they all play two generations of themselves, sometimes at the same time (OK, the James Caan with the graying hair is the dad, and the one who looks not a year younger, with the red hair is the son. Why not give them all name tags?). If you want to see Fellini meets Busbee Berklee, if you like a comic book history lesson of WWII with nicely tanned and brightly colored scenes of Auschwitz for instance (I'm not kidding, and it's not a spoof either), and if a director who can't tell a story and covers up with gratuitous special effects and lavish song and dance numbers is your kind of guy, by all means watch this movie.
