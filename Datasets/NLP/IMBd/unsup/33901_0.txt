We love movies of all kinds. This movie was filmed in Finland by a Finnish director who appears to be trying to imitate spy movies from James Bond to Mission Impossible...and they did a very poor job of imitating. <br /><br />Sadly, some really good American actors worked on this film. It was apparently made as a serious movie, but even Netflix lists this as a spy 'farce'.<br /><br />If you like the Scary Movie or Airplane type movies, you might like this one OK - no way you could like it that much.<br /><br />We really like Bill Pullman, but this movie would made you doubt his movie making decisions.<br /><br />The music is awful (retro) and the speaking volume level is way too low compared to the music volume.<br /><br />I'd say, get a different movie.
