Wow. I was glad I rented this movie. Actually it just so happens that my teen boys and I sat down and watched this movie together. We don't do that often, but "Animal" gave us a lot to think about. Ving Rhames' performance was his best, thus far! I like the fact that we see the side of the criminal that most films don't show, a person who really truly wants to change from what he used to be and into what his true purpose is in life. Terrence Howard, of course, always breaths life and realness into his characters. I felt sorry for his character as, again, we see the reality that young African-American men, although urged to grow up real fast in the face of taking the big responsibility of heading the household (forgive the run-ons), still have this little kid inside of them who thirsts/screams to be a young child, held and loved. All of the actors were great, the script was great, and Ving Rhames'crying scene in which he goes back into his childhood, is superb. I know my sons were so effected by "Animal" because we talked about 20 minutes after the movie ended about the Willie Lynch letter and the boys asked questions and I answered as best I could. I was so impressed with "Animal that weeks later I searched to buy a VHS version for at least one hour at a local movie rental house. I was disappointed I couldn't find it on VHS. Go see Animal, it's great.
