Being a huge fan of the game series, this was bar none the biggest let down of the year.<br /><br />Well, there isn't much that needs to be said about this film that hasn't been, except perhaps for: please, please, those of you who aren't into video games, do *not* judge the series by this movie. This movie gives the entire series a bad name.<br /><br />Maybe the most useful way to stress this point is by giving a few, hopefully non-spoiling examples of how this movies fails to live up to the standards set by the video games. I had honestly thought this was the movie that was going to change the way people looked at video games movies (has there been a good one), but the wait continues. Anyway:<br /><br />1) Characters -- Some of the most memorable characters I've ever encountered have been from Final Fantasy games. Vivi (FFIX) was a classic black mage, one of the most memory characters I've ever seen. Barret and Aries . . . how could I forget them? And not to mention the main characters, Squall, Zidane, Cloude, Cecil . . . all very deep, intricate characters, with mystery and compassion. I grew to relate to these characters a great deal.<br /><br />In the movie, apart from Aki, perhaps, there are nothing but cliched characters, who only fit a general description of a character rather than a true character. We have the wisecracker, the big black guy who likes guns (reminded me of Barret actually), the woman who's more like a man, and a villain who was just there for the sake of having a villain.<br /><br />2) Story -- The games are classic fantasy. They take you into another world and let you look around. Gaia (the life-force of the planet) is a common theme. Most of the stories revolve around somehow saving the life of the planet, although you don't usually realize that until a ways into the story. The stories build slowly and gradually the impact of the main character becomes more drastic.<br /><br />In the film, it felt like it was trying to prove that this fantasy was actually *our* reality (i.e. setting it on Earth, preaching about Gaia, etc.). Fantasy doesn't work that way -- you need to allow the viewer, reader, or player, to suspend their disbelief. I mean, who didn't cringe when they tried to explain away the force in "The Phantom Menace"? I just doesn't work if you try to explain it.<br /><br />The pacing wasn't too bad in this film -- it started slow and mysterious and worked towards something more important -- but it gets bogged down by some ridiculous explanation and debate scenes.<br /><br />3) Villain -- The games have, bar none, the best villains ever. I don't care what any of you say, with the exception of FVIII, those are the best villains ever. Mysterious, evil, powerful, manipulative. Kafka, Sephiroth, Kuja -- all very, very memorable.<br /><br />Um . . . in the movie there was a sort-of villain, one who was so obviously there only for the sake of having a villain that we can only shake our heads. He had no motivation, no personality, no intrigue or apparent history. . . he was just there. I've forgotten his name already.<br /><br />Anyway, please, don't just the games on the movie.<br /><br />Matty J
