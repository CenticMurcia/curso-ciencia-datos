This movie is by far the most original kids adventure film I have ever seen, and you don't have to be a kid to enjoy it! It's fresh and entertaining. Boys did an amazing job performing in this film. The plot contains elements we have all seen before: bullies, Italian mafia, single waitress mom trying to raise a boy; but it all comes together in a unique plot for an amazing adventure, during which our young heroes bond and grow together. I really admire the risks that the script writers took on, trusting these young boys to land an airplane and having them win the heart of a mafia boss. Nowdays, we are so busy overprotecting children, placing warning signs on anything and everything, we forget how capable kids really are. These brave protagonists leave no room for skepticism. I applaud the movie, the actors, and the makers.
