I can't believe this isn't in the top 50 thrillers of all time. Die Hard is a big budget action movie, with sophistication. Alan Rickman, who plays the film's German uber-baddie, really controls the part and brings in some blunt wit. Die Hard is the best and probably most violent of the trilogy. Endlessly entertaining and effortlessly rewatchable, Die Hard is a classic. 8.2 out of 10.
