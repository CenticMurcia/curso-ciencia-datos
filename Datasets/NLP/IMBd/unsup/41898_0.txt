Wow what a steaming pile of dung. <br /><br />While I enjoy low-budget gore as much as the next guy, this one was almost unbearable to watch. This was mainly due to the acting, if you can call it that. Every person in this flick had the same monotone voice coming from the same expressionless face. For a horror film there was a decided lack of screaming. I would expect some screams when one is getting hacked in half, or their chest ripped open, but I think there were a total of 4 screams in the entire film.<br /><br />I can't believe this thing won awards. It must have been the only entry.<br /><br />Can I have 90 minutes of my life back please?
