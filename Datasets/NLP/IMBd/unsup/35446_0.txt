After being unable to gain employment because of his criminal record, a young man fortune suddenly changes. A suitcase full of counterfeiting equipment worth millions comes into his possession when he literally walks into a shootout. Now the cops, crime boss and hit men are after him. Along the way he falls for a woman whose father is on the crime boss's pay roll. Everybody double-crosses everybody with gratuitous nudity thrown in for good measure. A cast full of top notch actors so it's a shame there's not much there to hold your interest. I saw this after Frank Gorshin passed away. He was a wonderful character actor. In this he gives credible performance as a man too far over his head in debt. Dennis Hopper is his usual bad guy persona as the short-tempered crime boss. Ice T makes an appearance as a rival crime boss. You pretty much can predict what is coming next all the way through the story. Not awful just not that great.
