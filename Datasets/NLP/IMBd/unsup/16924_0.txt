This movie is meant to be a comedy, but won't even make you smile.<br /><br />It is vulgar, not funny at all. I am still wondering how stars like Vincent Perez and Michel Serrault could make such a poor movie. The dialogues are not as witty as one might expect. One of the characters ends up stark naked in public and even that is not funny.<br /><br />One might want to compare this movie to other French historical comedies. If you want to see the difference, try to get hold of "Beaumarchais, l'Insolent" or "Ridicule", these are truly good comedies with a number of French stars.<br /><br />If you want to have an idea of how bad Le Libertin is, just check how many second hand DVD copies are sold on the internet and for what prices. A couple of bucks would buy you a brand new copy. At least you could use the DVD case for some other better movie.
