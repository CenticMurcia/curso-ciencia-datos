Is it really possible for a movie to be this bad? I only watched this because my friend attempted to rent part 1 but accidently picked up the sequel instead. This movie is beyond horrible. Our heroes are so stupid ("Today's the day of the time change!***I can't believe none of us remembered!(???) ***) you start wishing the cannibals would just hurry things along and finish them off, or the bus will run over a land mine and they'll all die at once or something. The only even marginally entertaining in this movie is an unintentionally hilarious bit in which the pet dog has a flashback to the previous movie; I almost laughed myself to tears after seeing that.
