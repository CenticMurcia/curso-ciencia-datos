I cannot believe how hilarious this movie turned out. It is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. I can barely contain myself from bursting into laughter at just the thought of it. The acting is superb, the direction impeccable, in fact the entire production is tres magnifique! I never had so much fun watching a movie. Each and every character is endearing and you get the feeling that each actor was born for exactly that role. I'm surprised there were no academy award nominations for Nathan Lane, Gene Hackman, Robin Williams and especially Hank Azaria, that entertainer-extraordinary wannabe, the "Goldman's faithful houseman", LOL...I am laughing as I write this review, you must see it to appreciate it.....10 of 10 EXCELLENT!
