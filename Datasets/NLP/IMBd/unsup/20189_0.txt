I just saw this movie at the Pioneer Theatre in NYC, and LOVED it. It's shot on digital video which takes a few minutes to get used to, but the story is definitely original and the ending is not-so-happy. The characters are 3-dimensional and interesting (and not your typical muscleboy lunkheads that you see in most gay movies!). There's also a really pointed sense of humor throughout, as you get to see how some people are just destined to be exploited and can never quite escape the vicious circle. I was surprised at how tight and cohesive the story was, too -- most indies aren't so well-put-together.<br /><br />Definitely catch a screening of this if you can, or rent the DVD!
