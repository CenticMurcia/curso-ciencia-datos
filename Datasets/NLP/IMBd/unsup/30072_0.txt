Brilliant!...Leonardo pulled off a stunning performance. A really good, mixture of category's, horror, mystery, drama, adventure... Although It was not too realistic at times. Good acting, good story, and a good setting. It was a real paradise, It made me want to stay in my seat and I could not move!<br /><br />But like all movie stars after one big film hit they get a funky haircut, put some glasses on and go shopping for clothes in the second hand store. This is what Leon' done... He now looks like Daffy duck with plastic surgery. Theres always one explanation: to get into a magazine!<br /><br />Although, this isnt the first crazy trend he's tried to start, he really did confuse me in the Beach, I liked him in Titanic better. But still a stunning performance in the Beach.\4****star rating/
