I gave this a ten in a futile attempt to up the average.<br /><br />It would be a shame if a 6.5 score put people off watching this film, I would rate it 7-8 quite happily. It is one of the few films released over the last few years that gives me belly laughs throughout, and after repeat viewings.<br /><br />Nathan Lane is especially good, and after this film I became a big fan.<br /><br />Perhaps the homosexual themes put people off. Yes, the characters are stereotypes, and it doesn't try to make many serious points, but I'd like to think that the open minded are in for an undervalued treat.<br /><br />How do I feel about the rating? I don't know, betrayed, bewildered...
