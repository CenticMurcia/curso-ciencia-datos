******POSSIBLE SPOILERS********<br /><br />Completely forgettable 90s giant monster film from Toho, which seems to be on its last legs. The army is fighting Godzilla, who of course is their only defense against Space Godzilla, a creature formed by a chunk of G's DNA which got stuck in space and was mutated. In the only praiseworthy scene, the annoying "Mini-G" is killed by the space mutants, giving papa G some character motivation for a change. Features the same effects and the same annoying psychic girl from other 90s Toho Godzilla flicks. One of the most pointless entries in the entire series.
