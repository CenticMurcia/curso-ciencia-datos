**********THE BEACH**********<br /><br />The Plot: Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio), a young American backpacker, is willing to risk his life for just one thing: that mind-blowing rush you can only get from braving the ultimate adventure. But on a secret, deceptively perfect beach, he'll soon discover that, as the level of intensity rises and the stakes climb higher, desire grows stronger...and danger grows deeper. 73%<br /><br />The Acting: Leonardo DiCaprio pulls off another winner, his performance is electrifying and powerful. Newcomers Virgine Ledoyen and Guillaume Canet also put in amazing efforts for their debut feature films. Tilda Swinton and Robert Carlyle are among the more known people of this movie, and they are ultimately impressive. 79%<br /><br />The Screenplay/Directing: John Hodge, who directed Trainspotting, has obviously decided to take a turn for writing. His screenplay is well-adapted from Alex Gardland's novel, and although it weakens near the end, he still keeps you wrapped up in all the brilliantly confusing plot twists. Danny Boyle, director, went to amazing hights to make this film successful, and he deserves praise. 80%<br /><br />Other: Some chilling sound and mind-blowing cinematography. 70%<br /><br />Overall: The Beach is an interesting, intriguing and different film, and although it is as times deeply flawed, it is still an immensly powerful and watchable film. Recommended. 74%<br /><br />**********THE BEACH 74%**********<br /><br />
