To many people another 48 hours is a like a remake of the original. I can see why they would think so. many of the scenes are just like the ones in the first movie. However I believe it had a new plot being to catch a mysterious criminal known as the Iceman. I thought it had a great twist on who was the main bad guy after all. The end shootout was one of the best in the action movie history. There were also some good comedy scenes between Murphy and Nolte. Andrew Divoff does good as Ganz brother. Murphy's scene in the bar however is bad and does not even come close to the original. In my opinion this was a good action/comedy sequel to a classic original.
