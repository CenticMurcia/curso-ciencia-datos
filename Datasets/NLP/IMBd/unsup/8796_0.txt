Watching Dark Assassin I was enthralled therefore, desiring more information I've watched the DVD extras, "Bonus Features/Making of" and read all that I could find on-line, related to the movie and Jason Yee. Dark Assassin is a very cool, low-budget indie action film. The $80,000 it's a minuscule sum for making a film, especially being shot on film. Comparatively, Hollywood spends millions to make a movie. The story is reality sad but compelling, peppered with surprising humor at times, intelligent twists, the driving element of love and a surprising ending that lets you wanting more. It features the sweet and wise Tony Todd (gotta love him), as the friendly, guiding ghost to Derek Wu in his nightmares. As a bonus, Dark Assassin uses topnotch, real martial arts fighters and champions such as Cung Le, Rudi Ott, Marvin Perry, and Yao Li with real combat skills devoid of wires and silly acrobatics. Camera skills and the post-production tie up the elements to deliver a product that could be a signal for new times in American martial arts movie making and style. Jason Yee who wrote, acted, directed and produced Dark Assassin, pays homage with this film to the 70's and to Bruce Lee, The Master and leading champion, who believed that anybody can be kung fu fighting. We miss you Master! Unlike a Hollywood movie, Dark Assassin is a labor of love for Jason Yee and those who believed in him. It is worth seeing and appreciated for what it has to offer in the present and for the future, while taking in consideration its meager means. By supporting Dark Assassin we might finally see some variation in the world of martial arts movie making, which are a bit stale and repetitive right now. Hurrah!
