Darna Mana Hai released in 2003.And yes, for me it was the film of the year.<br /><br />Some say its a copy of twilight zone...i saw one film on twilight zone,found no evidence that suggested that this film is a copy.<br /><br />Darna Mana Hai is not your usual commercial Hindi film.The first thing that you need to keep in mind when u watch D.M.H.is it is not a horror film.It is bizarre,it is different and yes it is wonderful.<br /><br />D.M.H doesn't scare you though the film has its moments.The film tells the story of 6 college kids whose car breaks down in the middle of a lonely road at night.They finally find a place to stay,and instead of playing some stupid game,they decide to tell each other ghost stories.That is when D.M.H actually picks up I wont get into the details of the story.Every story is interesting.They are scary ,they r weird,there is dark humor.<br /><br />The performances are brilliant.Boman ,Saif ,Raghuvir ,Revathi,Vivek,Nana,Aftab..all come up with great performances.<br /><br />The camera work and BGM is awesome.I have always felt Ram Gopal Varma and Mani Ratnam are the two best exponents of camera in Indian film industry.<br /><br />As expected ,the film did not do wonders at the box office neither it got any awards.But D.M.H clearly proved that Indian cinema is coming off age.<br /><br />D.M.H is one of the best films to come out of the RGV factory.I wish he would come with more and more movies like this !!!!!
