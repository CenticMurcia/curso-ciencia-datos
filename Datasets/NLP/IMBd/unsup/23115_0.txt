I saw this at the NY horror film festival and debated walking out many times. Its real slow. Its one of those movies that relies on scary sound effects to over-compensate for the fact that little is happening in the scenes. Gabrielle anwar and Forrest whitecker are good actors who are wasted in this boring and lifeless film. There are a few good special effects sequences, but even those scenes lack creepiness. The movie tries to build up suspense but doesn't really give us anything to be afraid of. quite frankly, it just lacks good scary content. <br /><br />Its production values are very good, but that just makes me angrier that the film isn't better. I saw other films at the festival (particularly "Fingerprints" and "Last Rites of the Dead") that were made for much less money and yet were a thousand times better.
