I have to admit that I have not read any of Lovecraft's works, hence I cannot include any comparisons between the stories to the film in my verdict.<br /><br />Although films based on books rarely meet expectations, there are those which are a great and sometimes they are even better than the books. I suppose fans of Lovecraft's works will be inclined to support the former case as I find it difficult to imagine any fan possibly enjoying this film. I was restless, constantly looking at the clock and tried my best to hang in there until the credits rolled just for the hell of it. This film is neither coherent nor interesting, but just loose tales cut and edited together with nothing that catches your attention or interest.<br /><br />I would like to keep myself short, but I advise anyone to stay away from this horrible film. It is not even good enough for time-killing! 3/10
