This films preaches, and how, that if you sacrifice your child as cannon fodder, no matter how strong your entirely reasonable native instincts against doing so, your seduced spouse will continue to be able to wallow in mink coats, so long as you burn the only evidence refuting her as the property of a munitions monger.<br /><br />All the glowing praise for the histrionic "performances" in the other reviews here ignore the message force fed a war weary population who knew well at the time, however much their heirs have forgotten, that European wars, if not all war, is nothing but procurement profiteering by peerage, the scenario presented so gushingly positive in this poisonous treacle.<br /><br />This mainstream filth opens with a celebration of Armistice in a chemical munitions plant's corporate headquarters. That tens of thousands of U.S. soldiers died or were maimed in WWI from such lucrative insanity, not least because such munitions never yield victory, only battlefront stalemate by temporarily denying enemy troops disputed territory, is lauded ever so abstractly as contribution of the homefront.<br /><br />Urging parents to rush underage children to the fray is the closing message, a necessary strategic goal in the late stages of WWII when this recruitment vehicle was released in 1946.<br /><br />There is nothing redeeming about this cinematic crime against democratic U.S. citizenry. Orson Welles prostituted himself as grandly as ever, and the remaining caste were never more than complacent geisha careerists.<br /><br />Thank fate for the 1970s when Hollywood finally got a social conscience that has yet to be fully interred for the sake of the interests of the National Security State myth.
