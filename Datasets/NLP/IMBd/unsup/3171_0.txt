Let me start off by noticing the obvious - Ray Liotta is still one of the most underrated actors there is. His each and every performance was really mad nice, going from stellar to above average, but never seeming to cross the borderline of boredom. Now...in mid and late 90's his career was kinda stagnating but he reinvented himself in Narc (one of my favorites...not so much as a movie in whole, but for the way it was shot, cinematic photography and Liotta's portrayal of Lt. Oak) and kept doing smaller independent movies really choosing his roles more carefully this time around...And I guess i was genuinely surprised to see him in ER. I don't even watch ER, but i saw his name on opening credits so I decided to sit through it...and i was stunned. That role itself should earn him each and every accolade he can possibly get. That was pretty much "acting in a nutshell", an Acting 101, really. I'm actually pretty calm and don't tend to get emotional...more of a cynical humor kind of guy...but this just left me staring good couple of minutes after the show was finally done. There wasn't even the usual sappy ER writing, even the script was remarkable and perfectly tailored for guest star(s). Maybe I'm not the most objective person to comment on it since I really like those complicated, layered, troubled-but-good-at-heart characters, yet, this one was amazing...it's just a shame that this gem will probably be slept on since it isn't any kind of blockbuster or even an indie movie that could shake some spirits. Just glad that Emmy "judges" didn't sleep on this one. Kudos for the episode, and for Liotta's stellar performance.
