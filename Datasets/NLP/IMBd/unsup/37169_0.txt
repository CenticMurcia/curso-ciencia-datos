I have seen several movies that involve "dinosaurs", and I have to say this movie had the worst special effects ever. Why would anyone waste their money on such a bad movie? I agree with several of the others who have posted their comments that the plot, the acting, the scenery and especially the graphics were so bad that it was worse than a B-movie. Don't waste your time watching this film. Usually what I have seen on Sci-Fi, has been worth my time, but this time I should have watched the news. Lorenzo Lamas was the only part of this movie with any redeemable quality and that was his good looks,not his acting. If they ever decide to try to emulate another dinosaur type movie, get a better CGI group to work for you.
