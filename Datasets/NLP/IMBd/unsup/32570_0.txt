Evie (Lili Taylor) is a quiet and seemingly simplistic small-town girl living in a small town becomes obsessed with an ostensibly "deep" local rock musician (Guy Pearce). After carving his name into her forehead at one of his shows, she becomes his #1 fan, good luck charm, and lover. Lili Taylor is an exceptional actress and gives a fine performance with what she is given to work with here. The supporting cast also stands out, especially Sara Rue and Shawnee Smith. Unfortunately, the story is completely absurd. The dialogue is painful at times, and you have to wonder whether Evie is trying to be comedic or if she really is that stupid. While the music is good and written by respectable songwriters, the trailer clearly states: "featuring actor/musician Guy Pearce." You have been warned. My Rating: 4/10.
