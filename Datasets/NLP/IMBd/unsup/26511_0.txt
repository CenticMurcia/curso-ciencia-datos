The only player who can act even marginally in this turkey is Kurtwood Smith but, of course, he had practice in the Robocop series. Loryn Locklin had no such experience, She wanders in a daze through the conventional plot, resembling a lost cocker spaniel. Christopher Lambert, on the other hand, never seems dazed, alternatively sullen or glowering. It seems clear that the producers spent all that money on special effects to divert attention from a cast that might be more usefully employed in a fast-food restaurant. If the producers really wanted to improve movies, they would send Locklin and Lambert to acting school. "Crimes does not pay"--neither do bad movies.
