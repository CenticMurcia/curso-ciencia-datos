I would consider it a crime not to warn potential viewers that this is the worst of an extensive range of sci fi movies that I have ever seen.<br /><br />Bad, doesn't even come close.<br /><br />I do not think there is a single aspect of film-making that is not violated by this movie. Poor plot, corny lines, appalling music, and acting are backed up by technical handling that leaves home movies looking good. Of particular note are the special effects. Marvel at the simulations of infra-red and the dazzling array of weaponry that has been designed for the film.<br /><br />I think that lastly, the cyborg deserves a special mention, for making me appreciate Schwarznegger's performance in Terminator 1. You would have thought bad acting was pretty close to a robot, but in this case it is more like the Village People.
