After a promising opening sequence, director Jack Sholder completely fumbles the ball and ultimately delivers a shoddy, incomprehensible mess that besmirches the good name of Wes Craven's original masterpiece. David Chaskin's poorly devised script completely ignores the rules laid down by Craven in A Nightmare On Elm Street, allowing Freddy to possess the body of teen Jesse Walsh (Mark Patton) in order to wreak havoc in the real world.<br /><br />With numerous unintentionally funny scenes (check out the exploding parakeet, the 'tidying the room' scene, and the attack on Coach Schneider by sporting equipment!) and plenty of homo-erotic moments (male bonding, S&M leather bars and the coach being whipped on his bare butt with a towel), I really don't think this is what fans expected from a sequel.<br /><br />Although the film may be enjoyed if one views it as camp trash, it is easy to see why this film is one of the most universally reviled horror sequels of all time; with its tedious pacing, lack of decent gore or scares, and a total cop-out ending that sees Krueger defeated by 'love', Freddy's Revenge is very disappointing.<br /><br />Fortunately, the franchise improved big time with the release of part 3, Dream Warriors, but part 2 will always be there to remind makers how not to make a Freddy Krueger movie.
