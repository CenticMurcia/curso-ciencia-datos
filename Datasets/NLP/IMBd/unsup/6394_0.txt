My opinion: the movie has got a very solid potential to be one of the most powerful sci-fi drama, but instead, it turns into a nasty piece of cinema. Couldn't this movie get along without that phallic statuette with which a lonely cat woman was killed? Couldn't be those disgusting human-like furniture be avoided? Couldn't the sex/rape/beat scenes be less showcasing? Sure it could. Those scenes don't make the movie better, but ruin it (at least for me). I have an impression that the director did not control himself and did not know where to stop. A real artist must have that feeling inside himself. "Mad Max" is art, while this movie is not.<br /><br />I can easily guess, that my opinion is not in the general stream but I have to point it out. I bought this movie on DVD (I trusted IMDb rating too much those days) and I think I will have to throw it away, while there are too many scenes which I want to skip. I repeat: it has very strong potential. If the initial material had been professionally cut, the movie would be marvellous sci-fi drama (like "Solyaris"). But it gets into a ditch with those dirty and low elements. Camera-work doesn't save it. Besides, anyone can use classical music. It is not a "plus". Use your own beautifully composed and that will be a "boost".<br /><br />To finish it all with a slash, I had the same unpleasant experience when watched "Caligula". Also a dirty movie but with great potential.<br /><br />Sorry to say, but it is a raw product: 2 out of 10. Thanks for attention.
