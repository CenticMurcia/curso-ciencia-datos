For the longest time, this film had been shown in the USA in an edited version with its title changed to "The Inheritance". I believe that when it premiered in New York, in its initial 1951 American screening, Jean Simmons had already become a major International star. It might have seemed risky, for the American distributor of the film, to advertise the lovely Miss Simmons as the star of a film called "Uncle Silas". Therefore, a genderless alternative title, "The Inheritance", was used for the American release. (Thus, showing Miss Simmons' character to be prominent as the film's main protagonist and inheritor.) Apart from the film's American title change, the print was edited drastically (and in some cases incoherently) resulting in an uneven and less enjoyable film than the one that those lucky audiences in Britain were able to see when the film had its UK premiere in 1947. Perhaps, because of all of the dissatisfied comments on this board (e.g. Film buffs complaining about the truncated version available in the USA), the Samuel Goldwyn Company has secured the original uncut British version "Uncle Silas", and much to everyone's joy, it has been shown twice on TCM. Seemingly, it belongs to the TCM library. Now, wouldn't it be great if the folks at Goldwyn (or TCM) would be nice enough to put this gem of a film onto DVD for us? Let's hope and see what the future holds!
