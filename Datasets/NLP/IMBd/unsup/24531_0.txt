After seeing "X-Men" today, I decided to check out some print reviews. Many critics liked this film, but some didn't. That's not particularly unusual, but what is unusual is some of their reasons for doing so (of the X-Men dissenters, I mean). Some say that the film is too serious. What...are they saying they would rather have seen another dim-witted, idiot summer movie filled with one-liners? We ready have that in "Judge Dread," Godzilla," and "Batman & Robin." When they see a mindless movie, they complain that it isn't serious enough. When they do see a serious movie they complain that it isn't campy enough. They're all a bunch of winers if you ask me. Do not listen to them. Go see this movie!
