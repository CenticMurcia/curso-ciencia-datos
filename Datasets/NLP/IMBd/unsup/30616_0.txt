With any luck, this movie will sadden you, depress you, anger you, make you laugh, and make you ecstatic. This is a great choice for pretty much anyone to watch.<br /><br />Will Smith plays a man whose life never seems that it can get any worse, until it does. Repeatedly. All that apparently separates him from a beggar on the street, is his unquestionable self-belief, a black suit & tie, and his obvious complete and utter devotion to his son. The movie never really stops to blame anyone, or anything, for this man's misfortune... no matter how frustrating it is. 'Que sera sera', and life carries on. This requires a lot of self-restraint, both on the part of Chris Gardner, and on the part of the viewer. :-)<br /><br />Realistic? Who knows. It seems to have been based on a true story. This life isn't what most people go through, which is why it is so amazing to watch. This movie will suck you in, and call upon you to feel what Chris Gardner and his son are going through at every moment. Hopefully, you'll be greatly rewarded. I would recommend for anyone to go and see it!
