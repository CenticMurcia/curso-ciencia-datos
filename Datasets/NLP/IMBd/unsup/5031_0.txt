An important movie in the 'New Hollywood' movement, 'Bob & Carol...' is an engaging comedy that still might seem daring today. The masterful opening scene (it is hard to believe that this is Mazursky's first movie) replete with nude bodies sets the mood well and tells us that what we're seeing is something different, something new. The film meanders and is full of great moments, in a way that often seems alien to contemporary movies. These are all multi-faceted characters - the humor is mined from their situations and their personalities, rather than being punchline driver.<br /><br />The performances to watch out for are those particularly from Gould and Cannon. Both are energetic and fresh - Culp is fine too, but weakened by playing opposite Natalie Wood. She isn't an embarrassment by any means, but the difference in acting from her studio experience, to the more naturalistic style of the late 60s/70s is apparent. She's never quite convincingly there, not inhibiting her character as Cannon (she and Gould deservedly were both nominated) does.<br /><br />The final sequence is uplifting and memorable, leaving the audience on a high.
