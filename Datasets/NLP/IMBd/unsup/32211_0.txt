I LOVE Woody! This movie states his great genius, his wonderful ability to play with characters, dialogues and situations. Each episode is a unique proof of genius, until the last one, which I could place at the highest steps of cinema just for the idea! A masterpiece. Maybe actors are not always particularly exciting and the directing skills are still under development, but it deserves a 10 for the pure display of genius!
