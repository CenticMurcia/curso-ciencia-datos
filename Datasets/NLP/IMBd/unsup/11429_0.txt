It's a shame that a movie with such beautiful pictures and a really fascinating insight into monastic life just turns out to be extremely boring due to endless repetitions and 160 minutes length! It pretends to be a meditative movie but in my opinion, seeing others meditate is just simply very tiring, especially after 2 hours or so...initially I thought, wow, there is so much beauty to be seen here (and I really love silent movies or movies with a slow pace) but this one just goes way to far. I caught myself at wanting this to finish, much earlier than it actually did. I had read about something at the end of the movie which I was curious to see, otherwise I would have left the theater much earlier. Really a pity!
