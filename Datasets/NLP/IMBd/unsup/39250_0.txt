This movie just falls flat. The action sequences are ok, but they quickly become boring and seem to drag on endlessly. Rodman is truly pathetic as an actor. One of this movie's main faults is that it forces you to watch him stumble through lines and pretend to have wit. The movie's premise is ridiculous and its portrayal of the "spy game" is preposterous. If you're looking for a good action film, go watch Face/Off or Ronin, don't waste your time with Double Team.
