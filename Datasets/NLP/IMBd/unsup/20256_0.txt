The only Harold Lloyd film I had seen was "The Kid Brother" at a film club about 35 years ago. I remember the theatre being filled with laughter but back then Lloyd was considered "the funny guy with the horn-rimmed spectacles" and not in the same class as Chaplin or Keaton. But back in the 20s he was far and away the most popular with films like "Girl Shy" and "Safety Last" continually topping the list of the year's most favourite films. I watched this today and don't know when I have laughed so much.<br /><br />It had me from the first title - "In Little Bend three things happen everyday - morning, noon and night". Harold is a tailor's assistant, who is painfully "girl shy". Girls turn Harold into a quivering mess - he has such a bad stutter that only a whistle can stop him (one of the funniest parts of the film). Little Bend's Saturday Dance is in full swing but Harold is far too shy to participate. He uses the excuse of having to get his book ready for the publishers - "The Secret Art of Making Love"!!! On his way to the publishers he meets the girl of his dreams and she is not put off by his speech impediment!!! <br /><br />The publisher and his staff find it hard to keep a straight face when they meet the author of the "Love" manual face to face and decide to publish it as a funny book entitled "The Boob's Diary" - unbeknownst to Harold who thinks he now has nothing to offer "the girl" (played prettily by Jobyna Ralston). She, in turn, agrees to marry a persistent suitor who has a secret - he is already married!!! The film is one big laugh from beginning to end - highlights include - imagining himself a great lover as he overpowers vamps and flappers with his charisma. Rescuing the girl's little dog and keeping it away from the train guard's prying eyes. The huge chase at the end where Harold leaps from car to trolley to policeman's motorcycle to horse all for the sake of true love.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.
