I saw this film in a room that's designed to play Horror films and that's all you can see there. This film was made with little money and Tobe hooper's skills show throughout the movie, his ability to play with us, to make our fear rise, our heart beat faster. I thought the atmosphere was great! Basically the story is: Every year thousands of people go to L.A. to pursue their dreams, some succeed...some not. Some end up in the Lusman Building.. The Lusman Building was once a luxurious building, with classy, rich residents. Today, it's an old, spooky and sinister building where you would not want to live and if you did live there, you would want to leave...but could you? It houses a supernatural evil. It's been subdued for decades - but when renovations start, a series of murders take place.<br /><br />This film becomes a mystery as our heroine Nell(Angela Bettis - see her in "May") tries to unravel the secret of the Lusman Building and its residents...it keeps us guessing cause almost everyone is a suspect and Hooper doesn't need big special effects to keep us interested, the story is fast paced and the killings are inventive and gruesome.<br /><br />It's not that kind of film that spends millions of dollars in special effects and scares us only with sharp and loud sounds and tricks like that, no! This film shows a great director, some good actors and a good sinister story that will really scare you in a way that only really good horror movies can...this is no cheap trick or horror movie for 16 year old boys with cheerleader type actresses that show off their assets...this movie is far more interesting and scary than most of the so called horror movies that go to theaters.<br /><br />Like I read in bloody-disgusting.com, " Toolbox is a strong film likely to boost Tobe Hooper back into the top rung of horror directors along with names like Craven, Carpenter, and Romero."<br /><br />Go see a master of horror doing his thing...you will not be disappointed!
