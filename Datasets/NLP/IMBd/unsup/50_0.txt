Jacob Wade (Jack Palance) used to be a celebrated shootist just stepping into middle age and mortally weary of having to be asked to leave every town he rides into To make matters worse, a few notorious outlaws, led by the vile King (Neville Brand), are also out to take him down <br /><br />Now he tries to do something for his boy Riley (Anthony Perkins) by catching and breaking mustangs in Echo Canyon, the best wild horse country in the territory <br /><br />Complicating the situations further is Jacob's bad relationship with a kid who hates him, and Ada Marshall (Elaine Aiken), a young woman whom Jacob met in a gambling hall, and shot a man on account of her<br /><br />Here is a thinking person's Western that deals with one ex-gunman who also is unable to shake his past and whose ultimate goal for taking root again is by lynching <br /><br />Levin shows a dark, depressing, and sadly realistic face of the west... In fact, the entire movie is a drama of characters But watching the film, you would be able to feel how Levin equates victory with redemption
