Available now on MGM DVD, full TV mini-series. The writer Ray Bradbury, saw this catastrophe coming, even he was embarrassed when "Martian Chronicles" was released.<br /><br />Utterly stupid dialog, childish plot and one dollar budget, how wrong can you go? Camp value, yes?. And those little plastic miniatures and chunky matte-paintings, talking about sore eyes! Slow, serious (unintentionally funny) and boring story, with some massive scientific mistakes. This makes the old Galactica series look waaaay better!!!<br /><br />I found this crap so ridiculously lame, that I just had to watch it. Don't expect it to be a mind blowing saga, but a low profile TV-series for idiots. <br /><br />See it only for fun, and if you're a sci-fi fan. <br /><br />Disappointed, yes, for buying the DVD.<br /><br />The martian contact lenses were nice!!!
