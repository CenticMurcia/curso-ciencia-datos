I bought this on DVD at Christmas without having seen it previously. I did the same with "The Grudge" and it was a great experience; my friend and I (23 and 21 at the time) were so scared we had to watch "Finding Nemo" to calm us down. I refused to watch "The Grudge 2" on my own, so waited for the same friend to watch it. Now, two friends (25 and 23 now) have never been less scared in their lives. I've been more scared by toy commercials than this film. It just seemed far too contrived and too similar to the first film. Bits of it were good, but instead of being scared we just said "That was good". This film is a big let down, let's just hope the 3rd one gets the series back on it's feet.
