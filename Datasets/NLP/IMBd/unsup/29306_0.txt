If you watch this movie expecting a gore fest in the likes of Gozu and Ichi, you will be very surprised. Compared to Miike's others, Sukiyaki Western is like Bambi when it comes to gore and dementia. While I expected something else, I was pleasantly surprised by the movie. When it comes to blood, Miike followed the old saying of "quality, not quantity". It is very tastefully done and certainly is one of the more original movies of our time. Miike really went the artistic route with this one. The entire movie utilizes a unique style of cinematography and uses colors that are symbolic to the plot.<br /><br />My copy of the movie was imported from Singapore. I haven't seen anyone mention the obvious flaw with the subtitles, so I'll assume it is unique to my copy. Like the other reviews said, the spoken word of the movie can be very hard to understand since the actors are speaking a language other than their native tongue, but when I turned on the subtitles, they turned out to be almost completely nonsensical! They read like a computer's bad translation mixed with Yoda-speak. The words related to what was being said, but they did not make sentences. It was very strange, and added a whole other atmosphere to the movie, probably unintentionally. Hopefully I stumbled on some sort of rare edition of the movie.
