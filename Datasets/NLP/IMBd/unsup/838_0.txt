I personally have thought this movie was fantastic! i am a huge fan of Naomi Judd and thoroughly enjoyed her part in the film. Gerald Mcraney seemed like a good match for her in the story. McRaney always seems to play a tough guy in all his roles. which is another reason i loved his part because Judd simply softened his heart and made him sweet. a first for Gerald. Alison Pill was simply wonderful! her voice was captivating and the love she had for her music teacher was enormous. Surprising to see Andy play such a hard core ex soldier. but he played the part of a stubborn old man very well. i was amazed at how greatly the characters clicked with their parts. the directer made very wise choices on actors.
