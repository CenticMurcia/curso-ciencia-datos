This is one of the most profound films of the thirties. Made from an extremely literate play by Robert Sherwood, it explores the mind of the idealist. Leslie Howard was born to play the part of the disaffected English writer. He speaks his poignant lines with conviction... Bette Davis shows her dreamy side and this film, and it's just as compelling as her bitchy aspect... and Bogart, well, this is the first film in which he really IS "Bogart". A good/bad man in an impossible situation, he is, Howard calls him, "the last great apostle of rugged individualism". SEE THIS movie! It's one of the great romances of all-time!
