Wile E. Coyote (Eatibus Anythingus) has a bad reaction after eating some flying insect but he's so hungry he'll eat anything, even an empty tin can on the road. The road runner (Hot- roddicus Supersonicus) races by and runs over the poor, starving coyote. Wile gives chase, showing amazing speed, but who can catch the ultra-fast road runner? So, it's back to Wile to try to use his brains, once again, and figure a way to get this delicious-looking bird-meal.<br /><br />Outside of some of the normal unsuccessful ploys such as falling boulders and TNT, there are several funny original thoughts, such as "The Burmese Tiger Trap," the automated steel- plated shield and the leg-muscles vitamins!<br /><br />This was fun, and part of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume Two DVD.
