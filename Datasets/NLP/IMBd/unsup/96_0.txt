I remember seeing "Firesale" on HBO in 1978. I was 15 years old. My friend and I laughed so hard we could not control ourselves. The details are so sketchy now which is sad, but I never forgot that movie. I don't understand why it never went anywhere and is now completely unavailable. This movie needs to be rediscovered. It would be awesome to see it again. Can anyone help? Can we contact Rob Reiner and get his copy? Ha Ha. There are so many ridiculously stupid movies. I have seen most of them. This is sad. Of all the movies to not be able to see, I wish it was'nt this one. Seriously, if anyone knows were to get a copy of this movie, please write to me. I would greatly appreciate it. thank you.
