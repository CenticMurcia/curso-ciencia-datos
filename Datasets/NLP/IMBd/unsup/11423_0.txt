As usual, Clint Eastwood gives an excellent performance as a detective in charge of finding a serial killer. This movie was made prior to the glamorization of "serial killers" in which the focus is on the weird, whacked-out antics of the deranged killer rather on normal people. Clint is also a single father of two young girls and the growing similarities between the haunts of the killer and the cop becomes a cause for concern.
