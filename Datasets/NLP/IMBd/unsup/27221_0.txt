This is without question an overlooked masterpiece--an expose and celebration of American industry, the entrepreneurial spirit, and the flaws and strengths of the capitalist system. Jeff Bridges and Martin Landau deserved Oscars (Landau was nominated) for their portrayals of Preston Tucker and his friend/manager, Abe Karatz--they show the intelligence, drive, and unquenchable dynamism of the American businessman in their quest to build the 'perfect automobile', only 50 of which were ever built but of which 44 are still on the road today!!! It is also an indictment of oligopolistic business practices and the financial and political power of big business that keeps innovation from the American consumer in this flawed system. It is Citizen Kane with--if not a happy ending, then at least an optimistic one. Kudos to Coppola!! SEE THIS FILM!!
