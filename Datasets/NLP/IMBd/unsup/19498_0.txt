British cinemas in the '70's were full of features based on popular television sitcoms such as 'Bless This House', 'Please Sir!', and, of course 'On The Buses'. When Benny Hill was asked by Thames to make a movie, he opted for a compilation of his top-rated sketch show. He had probably been inspired by 'Ten From Your Show Of Shows' which had been released the year before to great success.<br /><br />Unlike the Monty Python film 'And Now For Something Completely Different', 'The Best Of Benny Hill' showcased the original television sketches, not a single item was remade for the big screen.<br /><br />These included 'Tribute To The Lower Tidmarsh Ambulance Brigade', 'Garden Of Love', 'The Short Life Of Maurice Dribble', 'The Messenger', and 'Wishing Well' amongst others.<br /><br />Benny's old gang - Bob Todd and Jackie Wright - are in evidence, and the wonderful Patricia Hayes appears in several items.<br /><br />I saw this in the seaside resort of Tenby in South Wales and it perfectly rounded off an afternoon of fish and chips, crazy golf, sun and candy floss. Despite the fact that the material was directly taken from television, no-one felt cheated or left the theatre in a mood other than happy.<br /><br />My only complaint was that in the transference to the big screen, the picture quality had noticeably deteriorated, giving the movie a washed-out look.<br /><br />Fellow reviewer Theo Robertson wonders why the 'Sale Of The Half-Century' sketch was not used. Benny had yet to come up with the idea. 'Hill's Angels' were not formed until 1980. <br /><br />The movie's success led to Thames making similar compilations for I.T.V., these would be mainly be screened on Bank Holidays. Network has released all of Benny's early Thames work on D.V.D. now, so I could not really recommend purchasing this. Besides, the picture quality on 'The Annuals' is far better. <br /><br />Funniest moment - 'Tuppertime', Benny's spoof on 'Dee Time' ( a popular '60's B.B.C. chat show starring Simon Dee ). Over the course of the sketch, Benny's 'Tommy Tupper' struggles to interview a bored, pipe-smoking Henry McGee, the country's oldest man, an inebriated actress, and a vicar ( Michael Sharvell-Martin ) who has gone on air with his flies undone!
