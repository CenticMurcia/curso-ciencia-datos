this has to be one of, if not the worst film that i have seen. the story line makes very little sense, as the only power he seems to have is to scare people so they some how accidentally die, and to make cars fly. there is only about 5 sound affects used, and they don't match what is happening in the film. most of the time is spent on useless shots, such as a minute zoom shot on a shirt lying on a road. the actors aren't up to much, most look like they don't know what to do next, and are reading off the sheet.. totally unbelievable. the only positive side is that it had my family laughing at how rubbish it was... so unless your a fan of films that are so bad that they make you laugh for that reason.... i would stay away from "the psychotronic man"
