This one is a typical "doesnÂ´t hurt" comedy, like the other movies actor J.T.Thomas has done up to 1998. ("Speedway Junkie" in 1999 was the first change of direction for JTT) This movie is a must for JTT-Maniacs (like me), but not for normal people.There are many ways of wasting your time more enjoyable!
