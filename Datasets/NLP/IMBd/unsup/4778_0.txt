If you like movies, with a vintage feel, such as; The Village, The Others, An American Haunting, than this is a movie theme for you. Taking set in the mid 60's for one was something unique and refreshing. Right off the bat as the movie starts a 60's ballet sets the viewer's time period for the whole movie. The shots of the academy and forest were just alluring and magical. This is no doubt nothing ugly, fake, or tacky to look at. The acting was decent and Heather a strong bold character to watch as well.<br /><br />Plot wise, it was over all entertaining, it lead you steadily through the story without much stretch and pointless side-stories. If you also enjoyed movies such as Practical Magic, and The Craft I would highly recommend to see it.
