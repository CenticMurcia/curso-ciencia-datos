This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen. Besides not being scary it had bad writing and directing. I won't even get started on the soundtrack. The scariest part of the movie was when I knew there was going to be a ghost in the shower, that guy was freaking creepy looking. Me and my roommate laughed through the whole thing, so funny I am glad I started with this movie. It wasn't a complete waste of time I got a lot of laughs and lot of smart ass lines that I will use on my roommates. (You you you you you you) Alright what is with the blackouts they just didn't feel like writing that part. "The Making Of The Off Season" "Well we went to this small town in the middle of BFE and I had my sister's hand held camera and I handed my friends the napkins I had wrote the play on and we had a pizza and some beer and by the next morning I had a movie." Finally, I will leave this movie alone on this last note, please tell me that they aren't making a sequel and they just left the end like that for the hell of it. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. GO TO THE STORE FIND THIS MOVIE AND THROW IT AT THE OWNER FOR EVEN HAVING THIS MOVIE IN HIS STORE.
