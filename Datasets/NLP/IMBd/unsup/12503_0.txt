Don't get me wrong, I love Michelle Pfeiffer very much, but this is just a bad movie. The story is about this man, played (badly) by Peter Gallegher, and his teenage daughter, played by Claire Danes, and the mother of the girl who's dead. Michelle Pfeiffer is the dead mother. Peter Gallegher can't let her go, so he fantasise that she's still there, and goes to the beach to talk with her all the time.Then family comes to visit, and they find out that Peter Gallegher is a mental case. But it all ends with a happy, crappy, ending. This movie is a total waist of time. We've seen it all before.
