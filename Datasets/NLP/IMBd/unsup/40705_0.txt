It's a little disgusting how little people actually research a subject before they make a movie on it. It guess that some writers feel that fact just isn't important, and it's a shame the actual history behind Black Beard is far more interesting than this mockery. Very few things in this movie is even close to the actual events. It's a shame that North Carolina doesn't even have a single part in this, but i guess the people who shot the movie was more interested in shooting in different locations. It's not even closely accurate about where Blackbeard was captured... last time i checked Ocrocoke Island didn't have the mountains that were shown in the movie. Even worse that they cut out the Governor of Virginia altogether.
