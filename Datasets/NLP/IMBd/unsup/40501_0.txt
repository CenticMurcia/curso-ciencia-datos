To call this movie "bad" is to pay it a compliment. There are superlatives, however: the worst musical score everworst-ever wig for Marlon (runner-up: Rita Moreno)worst-ever ill-conceived kidnap plot and the list goes on. It's fortunate that this was not Marlon Brando's first role because it might have short-circuited an otherwise brilliant career.This movie was not a dream, but a nightmare. The only redeeming feature for me was that it was a free movie available on the Comcast cable network.<br /><br />The picture was so "European" that you get a greater appreciation of the abilities of the boys in Hollywood.<br /><br />This is a very short review, but it's more than the movie deserves.
