Avoid this one like the plague. Everything about it is awful. Special effects are poor, the "Bibleman" character is a hypocritical creep, acting is abysmal, dialog is inane, plots are painful to follow, and the only lessons being taught here are how NOT to make children's entertainment. Just because a show is meant for children is not an excuse for it to be poor quality. I would not want my children learning anything from a guy who spouts bible verses while hurting people.<br /><br />The only reason so many "Bibleman" episodes were made because some parents feel they need to get children's shows that are designed to teach Christian values and Bible verses. If you feel that way, then get "Veggie Tales" or other selections. Trust me, you don't want "Bibleman" in your house.
