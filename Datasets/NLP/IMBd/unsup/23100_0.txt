I really enjoyed this movie, when I originally saw it on Sci-Fi's Anime week on Robot Carnival. I was upset to NEVER see this movie again, outside of the fact I taped it. It's very difficult to find, and a definite Anime classic. The animation was good, the story was fun (a rip-off of Aliens? What? Not sure where anyone got that idea). I'll say that, yes, most of the characters get killed off, but the alien in this film is inspired and truly horrifying. The way the faces morph out of the side of the thing, implying the alien has eaten the crewmembers' souls - wow. You never know where it's going to come out of next, and the plot twist with the crewmembers' cat and LILY cat (the Companies' spy) is inspired. The ending is left with only two characters left - hopefully they're compatible (though I will admit the Blond was very annoying), because it seemed very much as though they were headed towards an uninhabited planet to start a new life as the only survivors. I jump every time I see this movie, and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys anime.
