This is the worst movie i have ever seen. i rented this after seeing American History X and almost laughed at how this movie attempted to tackle the race issue compared to the brilliant AH X.<br /><br />This movie was ugly to watch because of the poor cinematography and acting.<br /><br />The cover of the video had a caption from a review which said it was 'far better than the overrated American History X'. This film uses graphic scenes in an attempt to shock, but the film lacks any substance and makes such scenes just offensive. The reviewer must have been the brother of the film-maker, because the movie sucks.<br /><br />This movie is inferior to both American History X, and the groundbreaking Romper Stomper. While this review may seem scathing, if you see the film you will think i am going easy on it. Steer very clear.
