This is one of those films that is very misleading w/it's cover & even it's basic explanation of what it's about. I won't give anything away except that it shows a little boy on the cover playing the piano. That little boy is the star of this movie as well as the man (Bruno Ganz who played Hitler brilliantly in the 4 star movie "Downfall") that plays his grandfather. This is a terrific film in so many ways. It has a great story & is extremely heartwarming. If you haven't seen this or even heard of it give this a whirl. Ebert gave it 3 stars which is a little less than what I would give it. Even if you don't like subtitles (get over it already huh?) this is a film that you won't mind having them. If there is anything to complain about it's that it might be a little too dragged out in certain places. That is my only complaint in the entire film. I am keeping my eye on the people involved in this very enjoyable movie to see what will come next.
