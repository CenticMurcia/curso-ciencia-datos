This was the most touching movie, I loved every thing about it. I find it very hard to believe this movie has been taken out of circulation. I know its out there somewhere. My husband and children deserve to see this movie,and I've vowed to find it somehow. The actors,the music,the script were all exquisite and I can remember even as a young person the profound effect it had on the way I viewed and still view the value of life.<br /><br />
