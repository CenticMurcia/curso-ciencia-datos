I've seen better, I admit it. But, then again, I've definitely seen a lot worse. It is an interesting concept. Okay, so the animal spliced with alien DNA has been done to death. But this spider mutates and grows larger with every generation. And it reproduces itself, which you don't see in most movies. And at least the writer(s) put some effort into the script. The characters have some depth. Like Marcy, who is determined to find the truth, and Agent Murphey, who goes against his superior for what he believes is the right thing to do. All in all, if you're into cheesy sci-fi, like me, or enjoy the old black and white giant bug films, you'll probably find this entertaining.
