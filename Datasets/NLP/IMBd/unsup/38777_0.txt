The movie had good cinematography, some interesting back-story hints and what might have become an interesting plot competing with Children of Man.<br /><br />Sadly it was completely bungled and at the end of it you have a heartless action flick that makes no sense whatsoever because the back-story it was meant to be bolted on is not narrated at all. It is a great indicator if it takes you half an hour to recognize that this is meant to play somewhere in the near future and contains SF elements and is not just wacky James Bond stuff.<br /><br />You have some confusing hints at a Neochristian church trying to gain credibility by publishing an artificial Jesus figure they grew in a lab, you have indications of third world war scenarios where the use of all kinds of weapons has left most of the world in dire straits in which New York city has turned into an obscene city of decadence detached from the rest of the world and various groups vying to take control of things through messianic means.<br /><br />If any of this would have been touched on at all this might have become a decent action flick with some thought food given for free. Sadly it seems to me like someone wrote a script with a vast back-story, a director shot said script to best of his abilities (as said some of the cinematography is kind a cool) and then it was given to some cutter with the demand to cut everything but the action scenes.<br /><br />From the looks of those the movie was not meant to be about the action scenes because they are actually far and in between.<br /><br />Sad things as I kind of expected more of it but to me it looks like it got hammered by someone not getting the initial concept and just wanting a nice action romp ignoring the complex(and thus nonsensical if not explained properly) subtext going on all around.
