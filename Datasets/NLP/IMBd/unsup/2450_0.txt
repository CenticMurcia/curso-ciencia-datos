This goes closer to the original Terminator than any of the others do which is only a good thing. It has a kind of darker Mad Max feel to it by showing how pockets of people around the world survived judgement day and are now facing the struggle of survival against nature and most importantly SkyNet.<br /><br />The contemporary sharp cinematography is in the direction of Transformers and War of The Worlds with a bit of matrix in there for boot. Christian Bale brings a lot of credibility to the role of John Conner but surprisingly isn't the main focal point of the film. I would've liked to have seen him more in it. The rest of casting was pretty good with some good performances.<br /><br />It contains a lot of nods to the other Terminator films (except perhaps T3 but the less said about that the better), but keeps it's own individual identity as a brilliant Action Film following in great footsteps. Watch it!
