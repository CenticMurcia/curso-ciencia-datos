I remember anticipating a really entertaining, fun movie after I read the VHS box describing the story and then read the list of actors in here. Wow, very impressive: Anthony Hopkins, John Cuscak, Matthew Broderick, Bridget Fonda, Dana Carvey, Colm Meaney, Michael Lerner, on and and on.<br /><br />Wrong.<br /><br />"Bathroom humor" or discussing bowel movements, etc., didn't bother me. In fact, I can laugh at that. What disappointed me about this film was that (1) - it simply wasn't funny and (2) the acting - mainly by Cusack - was brutal (3) the story was not put together well; just a mess. Cusack's loud over-acting was extremely annoying. What was he thinking? Normally a fine actor, he was the worst part of this movie, just grating. As for the classy Hopkins to be in this picture....well, all I can say is look at his resume: this wasn't the first time he wasn't very discerning about roles to play. It is disappointing, though.<br /><br />As for the crude humor, you make the lines funny if you're going that route or you'll just turn people off, which is what happened to this movie. I actually gave this movie two chances, thinking I missed something.<br /><br />For those few elitist critics here who think the rest of the folks "don't get it," well, maybe it's you who are full of crap, in addition the people in this movie.
