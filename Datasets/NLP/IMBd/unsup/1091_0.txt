I'm a big fan of Jackie Chan. And this movie is my favorite Jackie Chan film! This movie made me a Jackie Chan fan! I saw it in 1996. This movie is great because, there's two Jackie! He is very funny and sexy in this film. There are a lot of action scenes and jokes. If you are a Jackie Chan fan like me, you'll like 'Twin Dragons'. The last fighting scene is one of the best of Jackie's. You must see!
