An imbecile, a liar and a coward for president. Someone who was so fetching afraid of his ally (Bulgaria) that Secret Service agents ORDERED the soldiers from President's escort company to remove the bayonets from their riffles which of course were empty of bullets too. He was so fetching afraid that even the police who were supposed to protect him were disarmed. This movie is so blatant propaganda it is shame for everyone that has created it. Apart from that, the enemies since long time ago are not the Russians. We all know who exactly they are and who exactly they were before becoming an US enemies. Right - they were friends and protected and working with CIA help and American taxpayers money. So don't give us bullshits for breakfast with this, excuse me, movie. 0 points from me.
