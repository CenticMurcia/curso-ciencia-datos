Great on location photography in Budapest Hungary, and surprise at the end (don't blink or you'll miss it) can't save this otherwise boring movie about a group of people, seemingly chosen at random, attending the reopening of an old Hungarian castle which has been closed for half a millennium, being stalked by an unseen killer. The killer turns out to be a werewolf. Or, maybe it was just a great big hairy dog. I couldn't tell, the killer was on screen so briefly. <br /><br />This one isn't as awful as the previous three sequels, but that doesn't mean that it's very good either ...<br /><br />*1/2 out of ****
