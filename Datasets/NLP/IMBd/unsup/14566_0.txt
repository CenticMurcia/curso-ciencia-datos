This is a Playstation game with 40 hard levels. I played it for 2 years finally completing it. You start off playing as a small dinosaur then you play as a raptor then a human then a T-rex and finally a human again. It hardest levels were Into the fire, edge of chaos and there were two. 10 out of 10. Chaos Island was a PC game.
