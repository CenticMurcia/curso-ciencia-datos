Well what can i say it's the best comedy show i have ever seen in my life. I was too young to remember the original series some of the early ones i was not even born to see but thanks to one UK TV channel bring it back i am now hooked. I never miss an ep (thank you digibox that records). I have never seen anything so funny. The guests they have are simple amazing. Ryan Stiles and Colin Mochrie are the best comic's i've seen in years and i think they make the show.<br /><br />I have started watching the US version but it's not as good because somethings i don't understand what they are talking about because some words are different in the US.<br /><br />I think this show should be brougth back and make new eps here in the UK as it will bring a new audience of people who missed it the first time.<br /><br />If you have not seen it you should go and watch!!!!!!!
