This is truly a very horrible film simply about a big glob of green mess that creates all kinds of problems for all kinds of people in a small town of Idaho where Jose Ferrer, (Major Gordon Lane) runs a big potato processing plant. We also have Martin Landau, (Garson Jones)who is a scientist studying nuclear experiments which he is very upset about. Dorothy Malone, (Marge Smith) is a woman who has lost her son and wanders all around this Idaho town and never seems to find a final conclusion. This is a film with great actors who are becoming elderly and looking for a pay check and it is great to see these great veteran actors performing and at the same time it is rather sad to see at what steps they all take to make a buck. Horrible film and a big waste of your time or money. Avoid.
