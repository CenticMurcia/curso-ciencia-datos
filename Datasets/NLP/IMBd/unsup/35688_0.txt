although main character mehmet ali is a talented actor, he has chosen the worst and easiest way to act in this film. he thinks that this is the right way to reach out to millions but no, not in this film and the last 5 films he has done. i think this is another film which is made just to earn money and pay for his gambling habit. if he goes on to produce these kinds of awful movies, he will be out of business soon. the other main character ozcan deniz is another poor educated actor. his performance was also awful. this movie is supposed to be a comedy but in fact it is just a mess. this guy mehmet ali is doing a comedy show at prime time in one of the Turkish TV networks, and he is making FUN OF DISABLED PEOPLE. this is the way he takes his business seriously. mehmet ali can do anything else than art just for money. i am so sorry for such a loser.<br /><br />baris unlu
