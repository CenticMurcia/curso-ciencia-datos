If you look at the credits, FEAST has 20 producers.<br /><br />20.<br /><br />TWENTY!!! <br /><br />And even with all these producers, none of them could have come up with a better film. FEAST is disturbingly awful. Disturbingly awful because there's simply no point to this aside from the fact that it screams "hey, we're doing a "horror" film here, folks". It's not scary or anything but just flip and showy.<br /><br />The characters, or I should call them types, are devoid of anything resembling human beings. They see people being killed all around them and most go on as if nothing happened. Limbs are cut, heads are ripped from bodies and most people, not all, but most just stand around, unfazed. Please. The basis of horror is how people react to what's going around them and what might happen to them. If the characters do not react in a remotely normal way (even for a supposed "horror comedy" like this piece o' crap), there's no "horror" just plain stupidity, which this "film" has in spades.<br /><br />I'm glad I didn't have to pay to see this piece of crap.
