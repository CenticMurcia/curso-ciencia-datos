A man in a bad suit runs around a house, fleeing something. He dies when he falls out of a second story window. The man was The Amazing Asimov, a Las Vegas magician. The house is in the middle of a cemetery (never really seen), and is haunted by a satanic warlock. The owner hoped to make it an inn, but wants to make sure people who stay there don't get killed by the witch. He hires a team of psychic mediums and cops.<br /><br />The actors are all pretty stiff, and they have to deliver huge amounts of boring dialogue. Not much happens in the movie. The brief death scenes are done fairly well, including a strange shower impalement, and exploding head, and a melting character.
