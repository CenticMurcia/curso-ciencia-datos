If you go by its individual aspects this movie is terrible!!!!<br /><br />The cameraman appears to be drunk during most of the shoot and the visual effects are shoddy and the "spider" especially so. <br /><br />As for the plot line I have no idea what is going on, the dubbing doesn't appear to match the the screenplay and the script is of a very poor English.<br /><br />Taking all this into account it is one of the funniest films I've seen in weeks, with one of the most unusual sound tracks for any horror I've ever seen and some of the most random but hilarious lines I've heard. <br /><br />If this is on TV it is a must see but don't go out of your way.
