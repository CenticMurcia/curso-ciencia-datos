While the film is most definitely not what the video cover would suggest (a farce), it does turn out to be a wonderful surreal comedy, with (gasp!) a point to the story. I understand why some may be to say the least disappointed however, I found it to be very entertaining art piece, which is not easily done. Recommended for viewers who enjoy something a bit off (not in a screwball way, but in an artistic way). Those who are looking for a good classic farce (and I love a good farce) are better off with "Clue" or "Noises Off", two of my personal favorites.
