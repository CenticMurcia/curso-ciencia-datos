This is the movie I´ll never get tired of watching. I think it´s perfect! Incredible dialogues to match incredible characters/actors. The cast is just perfect! There´s no possible remake of this movie! No one can replace Jack Nicholson as Melvin Udall or Helen Hunt as "Carol, the waitress" or any of the others for that matter! Like I said it´s perfect!
