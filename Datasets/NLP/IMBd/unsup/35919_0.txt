This movie is not funny or scary at all. It's just boring!<br /><br />I was intrigued ,when I first read the plot outline and saw the ratings here on IMDb , so I decided to watch it.<br /><br />I very rarely fail to watch a movie to the end but this time I couldn't persuade myself to watch it entirely. After approximately 45 min , I've started hitting the right arrow key. <br /><br />The idea is good and original. Zombie killer sheep sounds interesting. But, the story is bad and shallow.<br /><br />The acting is very bad if not terrible. Characters are really annoying in every sense. They're not funny or convincing at all.<br /><br />The director did a bad job here. I didn't find any scene to be interesting. Everything is predictable in this movie. There aren't any surprises.<br /><br />If you like comedies , skip this movie. If you like horrors, skip this movie. If you like bad movies , skip this movie 'cause it's "bad" only in negative sense.<br /><br />If you like boring movies then I suggest you to watch this movie. You'll be bored to death!
