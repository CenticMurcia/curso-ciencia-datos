Watching this again after a gap of so many years I was amazed at how much sex there was in it. I remembered the nasty little dog prick like parasites that get inside and cause the skin to undulate horribly. I also remembered the whole exclusive accommodation block concept (just looks really 70's now!) but I did not recall that this was a bit of a swipe at the free lovers and swingers of the time, most interesting. Much under rated this movie wastes no time in getting going, so far so fast in fact that with the knickers showing, then nude teen girl getting killed so vigorously before we know what is going on, a most uncomfortable start. Still, 'comfortable' and Cronenberg are not words that many would use together. This is a truly fine feature debut and whilst budgetary constrictions make a little of it look slightly amateurish this takes nothing from the overall effect and let us not forget that this much overlooked film was an obvious inspiration for Alien.
