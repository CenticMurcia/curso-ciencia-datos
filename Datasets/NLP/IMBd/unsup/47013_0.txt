True film about a volleyball team from Taiwan composed of gays, transvestites and transsexuals, who battled homophobia and hatred and won a championship. The film does advocate tolerance and (sometimes) shows homophobia is bad BUT those messages are buried under a ton of offensive material. The men playing gay characters all act VERY effeminite--too much so. They're all wearing makeup, screech and scream constantly (it's played so the audience will laugh at it) and are always preening and acting bitchy. Jokes are constantly made at their expense--THREE times we see one member go hysterical when he breaks his nails! Also three times we see his nails deflating balls (that's impossible but hey--anything for a joke). Also the film contained almost every gay verbal slur known--I almost walked out. As a gay man I found this film offensive and sickening. I'm giving it a 2 only because some of the guys were handsome, some of the acting was good and the climatic match was exciting. Otherwise, it's offensive trash.
