The best way to view this miserable excuse for a thriller is to bypass it altogether. But, if you must, watch the DVD and skip from chapter to chapter. If you've even seen one thriller in the past 74 years, you'll know what's going to happen waaay before it does. Remember, you will never again be able to regain the minutes of your life lost if you give in and watch the thing.
