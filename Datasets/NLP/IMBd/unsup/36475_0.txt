This film is total zero (nula, nada...): no story, no (sensible) dialogs (concentrate on dialogs just for a try!), no acting (just ever smiling Alan), no action, no nothing... Some directors can tell an interesting story in the usual 90 minutes, while Andrew Bujalski spends 110 minutes to tell you ... nothing. The film looks as if it was made by a group of high school students after they had got their first movie camera. Get a group of students and let them make shots of their ordinary life  and I am sure that such a film would be better than Mutual Appreciation.<br /><br />Maybe some people like such films  but then these films should be described and labeled as such - this film is NOT a comedy - this film is boredom (or should we call it "boredy"?), so that those who don't like it can avoid it on time. And before declaring this film a masterpiece, let me remind you on the Andersen's story about the emperor's new clothes.<br /><br />I don't like Hollywood's unreal, highly sophisticated, artificial films full of action, shooting, special effects, etc. I see that this film has gone into the totally opposite direction (maybe even as a protest against Hollywood junk)  but it went too far; I suppose the state somewhere in the middle would be just right.<br /><br />In short: unless you are doing a survey on the most boring films - avoid Mutual Appreciation.
