Whether it is the incredibly low budget Lost rip-off, retarded script, or just incredibly low budget-ness itself, this movie will destroy braincells. See this and feel dumber. It's amazing.<br /><br />I see these crappazz movies for Bruce Boxleitner. Well don't -- his role is pathetic and he dies anyways.<br /><br />The "special effects" are unwatchable. Worse than Mortal Kombat Annhilation (I know, unheard of).<br /><br />I am getting sick and tired of formula commodity movies whose pre-fabbed scripts are no different from commercials. This is one of those.
