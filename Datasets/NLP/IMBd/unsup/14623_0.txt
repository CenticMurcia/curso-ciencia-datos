Fanaa came, saw & well....did well! Aamir Khan & Kajol has shown once again that they're amongst the best in the industry with their performances. Rishi Kapoor, Kiron Kher & Tabu have also been impressive as usual. And the songs & cinematography were beautiful. The story is good but the way it was handled....I cringed when an intelligent actress like Kajol is made to do those heavy-duty unrealistic emotional scenes so associated with Bollywood that we thought its passe now. That's where Fanaa went wrong. Some of the scenes were so filmi and we truly thought Bollywood has come of age. Kunal Kohli's touch is like Karan Johar - loads of mushy stuff! Anway, a wonderful comeback by Kajol.
