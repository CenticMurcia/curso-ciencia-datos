When going to this movie we didn't know what to expect anything, and thats exactely what we got. Horrible acting (reading lines from an autocue would be the same as this acting), reasonable actors but the whole thing was a bad mix of a dutch try on 'American Pie' meets dutch B-film. I bet this movie won't make it through a second week of showing in the theaters, and the DVD will go directly to the 50%-off section. Too bad, it could have been a nice movie.
