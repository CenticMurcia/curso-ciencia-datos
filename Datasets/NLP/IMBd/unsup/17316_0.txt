OK, I understand that there are a couple of good fx in the film. A decent chainsaw kill, etc... but come on, this film was a complete bore. It lacked any tension. Yes, it is a prequel to the remake, so you pretty much know where it's going. By the way, I actually like the remake more than the original. But this film had nothing. Did they even have a script? Or did they simply say, these are the characters, and this is where they need to be by the end of the film... "Action"...<br /><br />Story, Story, Story!! What is it with screenwriters these days? Story development is the least expensive part of film-making. You're already paying for the actors, you have the crew, etc... now how about a decent story! We know these are bad people. We know where they end up. Now how about adding a few other family members with some backstory, that we can see. At least that would have given the "Family" someone to lose, so you don't go into the film seeing the main characters and knowing exactly what is going to happen. The outsiders will die, someone will lose his legs, and that is it. BORING! I am tired of horror films with no character development, no story development, and really no tension. I love the genre, but have hated most of the horror films made in the last 5 years... can someone please show Hollywood how to make a decent horror film?
