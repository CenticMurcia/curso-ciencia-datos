I watched this flick because of the acclaimed critics. Well, it was a big mistake, because this film lacks everything that makes a film "viewable". Not good, but just viewable.<br /><br />There is a good basic idea that could be the base of a great movie, but both the screenwriters and the director failed to attain it. The result is a very boring movie without any surprises. It's just another teen movie, packed with high-tech, trendy stuff ads (such as the XBox360 or the PSP - everything that a modern teenager needs), but beneath the glossy surface there is nothing.<br /><br />What is wrong with the movie? Well, a lot of things. First of all, it is boring, the prelude is too long when literally nothing happens. The acting is bad. There is no suspense or surprise in the movie, everything is what it seems to be.<br /><br />I definitely do not recommend this movie for anyone who is older than 14 years old.
