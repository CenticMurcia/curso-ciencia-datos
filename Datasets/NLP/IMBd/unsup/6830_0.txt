I saw this movie over 2 years ago, and it still sticks in my memory as one of the best, most shocking, most eye-opening movies I've ever experienced. A movie that makes you smile, and even laugh for a moment, and makes you choke with tears the next,a mesmerizing movie that shows how, even some Israelis, who choose to see the reality as it should be seen, turn against their government for its brutal and discriminating acts against the Palestinians.<br /><br />But, the more important point I could see is that how the atrocities of the occupation turn the Palestinian people from ordinary citizens into militants. Normal people who, after facing the unimaginable from the occupation forces, decided that the best thing they could do was joining the armed conflict against the occupation. I know many people would argue about how Palestinians are terrorists and some such crap, but the point is: Who started it all? Before you judge someone for carrying out a bombing, you have to first put yourself in his shoes, and picture yourself carrying a 10 year-old bleeding, lifeless girl.<br /><br />One of the things that stuck in my head is something Arna said at the beginning: There's no peace without freedom. No peace without freedom.
