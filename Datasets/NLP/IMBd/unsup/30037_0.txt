I'm a Peruvian person who has been living abroad for two years, and this movie came to me just a while ago. I would have to say that for someone who has not lived in Peru, it would be hard to understand the situations the character goes through, but for people like me who have lived all their life in Peru, and understand what the character is going through, it becomes an amazing experience. Pietro Sibille's interpretation of an ex-military who tries to live a normal life is simply amazing, counting that he had never had a lead before, and bringing realism to the movie. The director took the essence of real life situations and put them on the big screen, making the movie worth watching, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in independent cinema / foreign movies.
