I've only given this two stars because the romantic lead couple were actually quite good.<br /><br />I didn't think the script was particularly bad for a horror but it was about as scary a basket of kittens sitting on my grans knee.<br /><br />If they'd gone for the psychological horror angle rather than the gore angle this could have been a good low budget horror movie rather than a horror movie with really low budget crap gore special effects.<br /><br />And at the end after they'd killed the doctor and they were walking along a sunlit road................THEY DIDN'T EVEN HAVE THE DOCTOR DRIVING ALONG IN A CAR THEY WERE TRYING TO HITCH!!! Stupid f***ers.<br /><br />Guess they knew they weren't getting a sequel though.
