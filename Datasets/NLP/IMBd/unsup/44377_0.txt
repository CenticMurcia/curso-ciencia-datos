The film begins with a voice-over, explaining some kind of alien threat to Earth and a deal made between some earthlings and aliens regarding experiments on humans, and a few very short scenes that look like they were lifted from another film, all of which lasts for 3 or 4 minutes. This is about as sci-fi as this piece of crap gets; the rest of the movie we see an endless series of low-budget, poorly acted fight sequences. The fights are created by camera juggling, as it's clear most of the actors have no martial arts ability, which means the fights really stink. There's a story about an android working with Brit soldiers to find secret documents, but this is one awful movie. If you can sit through this you're already brain-dead.
