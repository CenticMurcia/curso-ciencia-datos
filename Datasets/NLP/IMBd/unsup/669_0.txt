The misleadingly titled Romasanta: The Werewolf Hunt is a disappointing pile of slow, plodding period serial killer rubbish. There are no real werewolves, only that which goes on within the title character's head, and because it's based on true events the movie is incredibly dry and uninventive in the story department. Add to this the fact that it's punctuated with moments of unnecessary tasteless violence, and you have a fairly unsatisfying product.<br /><br />I can't really understand why Romasanta's gone down so well with people. Yes, I admit it is at times atmospheric, and the actors are very good in it, but the honest truth is despite this, it's dull, boring and at times deeply unpleasant. I really could have lived without seeing a deaf child caught in a bear trap, then systematically have her eyes gouged out. Even in a GOOD movie, such a scene would force me to seriously question what the director was attempting to accomplish, but in a movie so ineffectual as this it just seems pointless, tasteless and sensational.<br /><br />Still, as I have stated, I could have stomached the violence given my history of watching a lot of violent movies, were the movie in any way enthralling, but Romasanta is like cinematic wallpaper. With the exception of Romasanta's horrific acts, which you never see him caught in the act of anyway, Romasanta really left me with the impression that nothing happened. Romasanta isn't at all sympathetic as a character, given that he kills and robs indiscriminately with immense cruelty throughout the entire film, so his pleas that he is insane toward the end of the movie, obviously supposed to be an emotional high point pass without event or interest, and without this the movie is robbed of any sense of climax.<br /><br />To be honest, I expected very little from Romasanta, but I did expect a werewolf, which it didn't produce, and I expected a plot with high and low points and obvious progression, which it didn't produce either. If you have to see this RENT it, don't buy it, and I'd recommend you don't waste your time either way anyhow.
