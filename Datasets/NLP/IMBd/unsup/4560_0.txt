There have been better DVD's from other bands, but this is enjoyable. This is mostly interviews with the band and a lot of talking. But it is entertaining, seeing all their music videos is a lot of fun, in my opinion Crawling was the best video out of all of them. The Making Of In The End is interesting, terrible music video but nice to see how they made it. Watching them on tour is nice, i just wish we could of seen full length songs live instead of just clips, like from their ozzfest days. One of the cool things is that toward the end we got to see the making of the tune Somewhere I Belong, which wouldn't be released until 2 years later.<br /><br />Overall, i think they could of put more music and live concert songs on the DVD, but if you're a fan of LP, this is for you.
