It's very difficult to write a long review for this film because there isn't much in it to talk about. Bratz was on the bottom 100 when it was on the cinemas but still has a very low rating, which is fair enough. It had a very simple story that wasn't even told very well and I only understood it by reading it on paper not on screenplay. It was boring with many daft scenes like when one of the four girls was changing her clothes while the other three were covering her. Probably it is specifically made for girls but my sister didn't even like it although she is a huge Bratz fan. The movie was quite bad throughout but the ending was good & saved it and that's why I'm giving it a 2 out of 10. I can't say that it is the worst movie ever because no film can be worse than Pulp Fiction and Jackass part 1 & 2. The food fight scene was creative at start then was very funny. Most users either gave it a 1 or 9 out of 10, which means that you can either really hate it or love it but 10/10 means perfect, which definitely isn't. Overall I didn't like the film but I absolutely did not hate it as well because it did not bore me to death and I have seen much worse films.
