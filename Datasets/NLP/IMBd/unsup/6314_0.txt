i just happened to catch this recently on a rainy sunday while eating breakfast.i thought i would warn anyone thinking of renting this (i saw it on cable) that there are literally only two items worth checking out this lame movie.<br /><br />the first is John Candy's hilarious cameo. the second is Jennifer Connelly's absolutely stunning and perfectly proportioned body. (the scene in which she's riding the coin operated horse is a particularly good scene in this respect.) she also possesses one of the best faces of any actress in hollywood. BUT since this is a PG-13 movie don't expect any nudity.<br /><br />lame and not funny, it's amazing this movie did as well as it did when it originally came out.<br /><br />rating:3
