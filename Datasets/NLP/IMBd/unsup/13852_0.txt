When "bkoganbing" (of Buffalo) calls Charles E. Wilson a "flannelmouth" it is clear where he stands, but he is sustaining a lie and a slander against Charles E. Wilson. Mr. Wilson was truly one of America's finest business leaders: not only did he start on the assembly line for GM but, even when he was CEO, he kept his Union card framed and on the wall of his office. He DID NOT SAY what that other poster said he said, during his confirmation hearings. He was asked about what effect some legislation or other (or policy) would have on GM. Wilson replied that "it would be good for America. And what's good for America is good for General Motors." The small, silly, anti-capitalistic journalists of that day jumped on the chance to rewrite that testimony and slander one of America's best. Pres. Eisenhower was a great judge of character, and he knew what a great man Wilson was. Shame on the previous poster for sustaining this lie.
