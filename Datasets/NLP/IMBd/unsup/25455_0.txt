I cannot give this family film a higher rating. Best viewed in racially mixed company, although certainly having homosexuals, African-Americans, or those of the Jewish faith would be preferable. On the flip side, there is the possibility someone in the room may become deeply offended, at which point they should leave and never return. At least for the next 10 minutes. Underlying themes, including the difficulties of being probably the only member of a minority in history, can be difficult to spot but with a keen eye these subtleties can be unmasked, leading to a fantastic theatrical experience.<br /><br />HIGHEST RATING POSSIBLE.
