Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) is placed in a foster home after the incidents of the first film had his mother committed. However Chucky comes back--he needs Andy's body to come back to life (or something like that). What follows is a boring, by the numbers, stalk and slash horror film with a killer toy.<br /><br />Dull and boring with a pretty talented cast (Jenny Agutter especially) giving their all time worst performances. There are ENDLESS sequences of a person searching for Chucky...only to have him spring out at them. This happens at least eight times! Also having a 9 year old boy seeing people murdered around him left and right is in questionable taste. Boring, stupid, not even remotely scary. I saw this back in 1990 at a theatre and I STILL remember how bad it was! You can skip this one.
