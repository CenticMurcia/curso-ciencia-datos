This movie has its artistic qualities. But, it is not definitely its purpose. Richet is an extremist obsessed by revolution. He tried to make a film inviting young viewers in "banlieues" to put everything on fire. For instance, cops are constantly portrayed as racist and violent, and are called enemies from beginning till end. The script tries to explain how their revolt is justified, and that true violence is the only way to escape their problems. The climax is the end: after a cop coldly kills a teenager, all his friends start to break public phones, burn cars, until a whole police unit come for the "final fight". So you might watch it to see how far violence goes, but it is dangerous to see for the minds it was made for. Richet could be sued for hate incitement.
