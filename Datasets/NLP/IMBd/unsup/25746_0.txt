I love this documentary because it gives a better image of who Bruce really was and how much of a great hard worker and perfectionist he was. The only thing that kills me about this documentary is when they talk about the tv series Kung fu. Everybody and their momma know that Bruce should have been playing that role instead of that worthless Carradine. This shows you what type of world we live in. But anyway, I loved the Game of Death footage because of the offbeat comedy between Bruce and his buddies. I liked the way in which Bruce is relaxed and how his buddies sit back and watch him save the day. I really appreciated the lost footage especially compared to that sorry crap they put together back in 1978. Robert Clouse should have his ass kicked for making that garbage. Overall I highly recommend for everyone especially Bruce fans like myself. 4.5 out of 5.
