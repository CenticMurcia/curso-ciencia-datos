Well, this sort of sneaked up on me.<br /><br />There I was expecting a terrible little b-movie, but what I got was something cooler, odder.<br /><br />I am a great fan of "The Faculty" and my husband, Terry and I have been David Decoteau movies off late, so maybe it was a relief not to have to wipe my brow over another homo erotic escapade.<br /><br />The story is a familiar one, but it is told with some panache. The dead bodies are very coo and the dream sequences are great.<br /><br />Terry and I really enjoyed it and I am excited that there is a sequel. <br /><br />Bring it on!<br /><br />Brian
