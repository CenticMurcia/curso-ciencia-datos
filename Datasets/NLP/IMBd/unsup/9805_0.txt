I've seen this awful trash 1 time. If you weren't clever, you would easily be taken in by the lies of this movie.<br /><br />The way so many people believe in this movie, without doing research themselves, really highlights how dictators like Adolf Hitler came into power.<br /><br />Funny thing though: the people that hate this movie all have much text to explain why this movie is flawed and full of lies. While the conspiracy theorists who love this movie, only have a few lines to say about the movie - nothing concrete. Really highlights both kind of peoples intelligence. A typical comment from The conspiracy theorists could be: "Me love, is good, against Bush, Against America, against Jew, bla bla bla". While the comments from people that hate sound like this: "This movie is flawed, because of these facts etc.". Also most of the conspiracy theorists who have commented this movie, only have commented this movie. Which makes me suspect that most of all the users that love this movie, is just one person, who wants to up-vote his favorite movie.<br /><br />But this is not a documentary, it is a political movie, with something that sounds like facts.<br /><br />But all the lies of this movie have been debunked, thankfully. www.911myths.com
