One of the more clever Disney television movies is definitely Smart House. This involves a family winning a contest to live as guinea pigs in a futuristic house that is completely computer controlled. But like HAL in 2001 A Space Odyssey or Colossus, The Forbin Project the super artificial brain starts to take over everything.<br /><br />Kevin Kilner and his son Ryan Merriman and daughter Angie Volding are the Cooper family and they win moving into a house that is completely computer controlled. It cleans up after itself, cooks meals, makes beds, etc. All with the cheery voice of that ultimate mother figure, Katey Sagal. It's even got a name like HAL, PAT in this case. It even helps Kilner organize his work so he can stay at home most of the time. Kilner has other needs however that Pat can't supply and that his kids can't understand.<br /><br />Especially Merriman who misses his mother and is jealous of computer woman Jessica Steen who runs PAT's support systems and who Kilner starts showing an interest in. Merriman downloads some old family television shows to give PAT an idea of what the ideal mother is like.<br /><br />It's a lot of laughs and then gets a bit frightening when Sagal materializes as a holograph and shuts the place down. <br /><br />Several centuries later all the kinks got worked out and the Starship Enterprise certainly didn't need a mother figure supervising the crew's every needs. Smart House was a clever idea for a family film, nicely packaged by the folks at The Magic Kingdom.
