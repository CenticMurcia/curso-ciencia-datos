This was simply awful. The production values were fresh out of 'Plan 9 from Outer Space'. The casting of an aging Linda Purl with young children was ill-advised. The dialog was contrived and the story itself had too many lapses in logic.<br /><br />What were these writers trying to convey? There is the environmental angle. There is the heartless hospital administrator. There is the greedy capitalist willing to risk lives for money. There is the ringing endorsement for organ donation. There is the dedicated doctor trading patient billing for patient care, ala HMOs. There is the clueless and narcissistic TV journalist. Oh, I forgot, the rock climbing young GIRL (we must erase the stereotype of the weak female).<br /><br />Please avoid this movie, it's awful.
