One of my favorite girls was Miss London! She was one of the only girls in this film that really appeared to be their true self. Every other girl seemed to be on their best behavior, and I thought that they really weren't being themselves. Miss London seemed to be the only one who said what was on her mind. I especially liked the ending where she was complaining about her hair on the final night. Jimmy was another good character in the movie, it seemed like he was the one who had to do all the work to put on the show. And through it all he was always so nice and patient with the girls. I thought the movie was really entertaining and i really liked the way it came together in the ending. It was nice to see a documentary that was informative as well as entertaining.
