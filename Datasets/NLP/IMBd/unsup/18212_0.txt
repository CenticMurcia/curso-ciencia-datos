I had not seen this film since its theater release some twenty-eight years ago. To my knowledge it has not been shown on TV in the L. A. area until the TCM presentation this month. I had forgotten every single detail of the film except for Marlon Brando's great line "Ah, Arthur, you are missing the point--We are the Arabs." The line says it all and is especially telling in light of current events and players. By some trick of the mind, I ascribed the line to a scene between Brando and Scott instead of Brando and Spradlin. Even in a walk-on I always relish seeing and hearing Wolfgang Preiss. Regardless of disagreements between writer and director, the film proceeded in a style I prefer, leaving me trying to hold on to the plot with my finger tips and trying to keep all the character involvement relevant. I will never understand the gaps in the story line--Scott surreptitiously slipping the secret formula to a total stranger? in some shop? , followed by some tenuously-connected dialog at some safety deposit boxes? Scott proved to be a better detective than I at discerning Keller's covert motives, given the facts presented on film. Perhaps all was made clear in the script. Berlin is a great place for intrigue on film, as we saw in "Company Business", and the plots, and cinematography nicely murky. Even with the story holes and without Travants and the Prater, I recommend viewing this film enough to begin to comprehend it.
