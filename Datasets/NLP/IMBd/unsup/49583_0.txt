I'm a big Jimeoin fan. Huge. But I think i've realised I only like his stand-up work. His first movie "The Craic" was terrible, and this may be worse. I don't understand how he wrote this, the same guy who writes his stand-up routine, yet the movie is so poor. I didn't laugh once. I went "ha" in one scene. Bob Franklin, Colin Lane and Shaun Micallef were totally wasted.<br /><br />The movie is about a movie extra who wants to get a starring role so he can become a big star, become famous and become important. Problem is is that he's a terrible actor and has lots of bad luck. Does he realise his dream? I'd say "you have to see the movie" but I don't want you to get mad at me for wasting a couple of bucks hiring the DVD.<br /><br />I admire him for giving the comedy movie a go, history shows Aussie's have been terrible at making comedies ("The Castle" is excused), but maybe stick to the gags Jimeoin.<br /><br />(I gave the movie a 1 for the fact it was shot in Melbourne and had some good shots)
