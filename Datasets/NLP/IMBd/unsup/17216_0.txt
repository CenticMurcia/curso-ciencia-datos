Probably the single greatest teen movie ever made!<br /><br />George Lucas' wonderful coming of age film that takes place one late summer night, is one that inspired several other films, including "Dazed and Confused", and "Can't Hardly Wait".<br /><br />Fine performances, superb directing, and wonderful writing make this one a winner that has endured over the years, and has solidified it's position as one of the greatest films of all times! "American Graffiti" is a film that can be funny without being stupid, and touching without being maudlin.<br /><br />This is a movie that should be seen at least once by everybody, it was a great film in 1973, and is even better today! A very intelligent and believable film that only seems to get better with repeated viewings, and after seeing it for the first time, you will want to see it again.<br /><br />"American Graffiti" is a wonderful film that has stood the test of time, and will stand the test of even more time! Thirty years from now, people will still be looking back on this and remembering how much of a superb film it was, and how many fine films it inspired!!!<br /><br />***** Five Out of five stars! (Outstanding!)
