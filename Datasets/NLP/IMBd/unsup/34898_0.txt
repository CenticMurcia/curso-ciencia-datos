David, a time travel movie? Come on... You were memorable in Divorcing Jack, unforgettable actually, hopefully that is not the case in this one. You did well in Basic Instinct II, a great story, but this SiFi drivel is beneath you. I trust you are not afraid of being type cast as a great actor, which you are, but more like this, and you'll achieve that status. I've said all I really want to say, but IMDb requires ten lines of text to post, so I'll natter on until I fulfill my contract; perhaps this flick was like that for you, who knows? I rented the thing against my better judgment, but went ahead on the strength of your being in it. I avoided Harry Potter for just that reason. You'll be a far better professional if you stick to adult films, and I don't mean porn, but films for people who can think. No more bubble gum movies, please. And no more American accents, either; others may, you may not.
