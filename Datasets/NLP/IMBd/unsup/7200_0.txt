Absolutely loved this film! I haven't seen it in 30 years but still remember the feelings it provoked. I still remember "I want me this cat I found"! I wish they would show it on television again. Networks show so many horrid Christmas shows over and over again, but an excellent film such as this seems to have been forgotten. I am going to Contact Carrousel Films to see if they have the movie in DVD now. From what others have said it's not cheap - but it's worth a lot to me to see this masterpiece again. Thank you so much to those who found where to buy this move. I don't know many who have seen this film so I plan on sharing it with those close to me.
