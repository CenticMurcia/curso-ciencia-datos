This is simply one of the most enjoyable films of all time. It is endlessly watchable because it understands what makes a film great. So many films in the eighties used the same template and placed wafer thin characters in the story which left them with a poor film. Midnight Run's strength is its ensemble of fleshed out, beautifully realised characters that make the whole thing so damn funny. You have interest in all of the characters, not just the main-men. Lets not forget the pacey direction, witty script and the raport between the two charasmatic leads Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin.<br /><br />Often overlooked by the general audience, this film probably should have been the action/comedy of the 80's, because in my eyes it is.
