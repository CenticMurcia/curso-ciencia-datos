Unbelieveably realistic. I had the same students in my school and they did nothing for four years except stand beside me at graduation. I have seen many teachers leave the profession under these same circumstances. But every one of them knows that in some way, large or small, a person has been helped because of them. Frankie Talbot was well played. The story itself was great. Hats off to all involved!
