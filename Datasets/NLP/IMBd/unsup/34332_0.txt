Forgive me for the lame summary, but it was all I could think of. First, let me give a BIG standing "O" to W. Earl Brown who plays Meat like a man possessed. This guy is a fantastic actor and I say that because I didn't know that this was the SAME guy who played "Warren" (Mary's "special" brother) in There's Something About Mary. He also was "Kenny" the doomed cameraman in Scream!<br /><br />I don't want to over do it with the praise, but when you can't recognize an actor from role to role, you KNOW he's good. As for the movie, all I can say is that I wish there was more to it. It was good, but it actually leaves you with more questions than it answers. To be honest, the VH1 Behind the Music gave more info. This appears to be a pattern with the VH1 bio-pics...<br /><br />I recommend this movie based on 2 things, the performance of W. Earl Brown (Deedee Pfieffer is great, too) and the great music of Meat Loaf that is featured throughout the show.
