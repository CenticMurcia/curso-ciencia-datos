I've just recently watched most of Season 1 and I must admit that I am truly hooked :P I loved the idea of the Sam's soul being sold to the Devil by his Dad as the premise for the series ;) Sam is told the truth on his 21st birthday and he must work for the Devil as a bounty hunter to capture 'souls' who have escaped from Hell. As morbid as it may sound, the show is really funny as the rest of the cast adds some real flavour to the central character.<br /><br />Sam's best friends 'Sock' and Ben are great sidekicks and as the series progresses so does the character development. The fact that they all work together at 'The Work Bench' (a home depot) makes things all the more interesting. Andi (Missy Peregrym) does a good job of shrugging off being typecast from her role in 'Stick It' and plays Sam's love interest very well.<br /><br />Even characters like Sam's boss Ted, the Devil and all the other demons have great individual personalities (great work by the writers). I can hardly wait for every episode to find out what the Devil gives Sam as the 'vessel' to capture the escaped souls - some of the them have been classic! Overall, I loved the simple characters, the style of the show, the humour (some scenes left me ROFL i.e. like the dream that Sock had about Gladys the DMV Demon) and not too much CGI. I eagerly await the next episode!
