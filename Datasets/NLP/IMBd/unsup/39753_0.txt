About what you expect of a TV disaster movie. Low budget effects, lots of flex hose and typical, ordinary dialog.<br /><br />Best watched for killing time and mental floss. At least it is not aggressively bad so that you feel cheated if you watched it.<br /><br />Characters are pretty standard, evil scientists taking short cuts, ex-lovers at odds with each other that must work together to save the world and so forth and so on.<br /><br />Disaster warnings start small and build slowly so that the "man" is not aware of the problem until almost too late and then must turn to the "rebels" they have been trying to suppress because they don't want a panic or interrupt the annual picnic or whatever. Fill in the blank type plot. Only the details change like character names, actual source of the disaster, etc. but the plot is pretty much a routine formula you have seen over and over and over again.<br /><br />Still for what it is, it is OK for a time filler and Paul is never hard to look at.
