I initially viewed the movie in it's theatrical release and thought it was an incredible production. Fabulous story, great music and wonderful cinematography. I was looking forward to adding this title to my collection, but no widescreen version! This is a movie that deserves to be kept in it's theatrical form. I hope the producers will re-release this as a widescreen DVD!
