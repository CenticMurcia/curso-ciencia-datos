I'm always a little bit suspicious of made-for-TV movies, but this is a good one. It's an excellent script and good directing--plus everyone turns in an excellent performance. Rudolph Martin is especially terrific as Vlad Dracula, and Christopher Brand makes Bruno a very striking character. Jane Marsh comes across as very delicately beautiful, and the kids are unusually convincing. Roger Daltrey does an excellent transition from middle-aged to old, and Peter Weller emits no clue to give away the ending. There's great support from the supporting cast.<br /><br />The producers have handled the subject extremely well, considering how much gore they could have spilled, and it turns out to be an intense, dramatic movie. It investigates the characters and suggests how they were warped by the times and politics, and also touches on the metaphysical implications of such viciousness. They've let up a little too much at the end, I think, and tried to skew the whole thing so it looks like a romance--would have been better to end it with just a shot of the castle.<br /><br />
