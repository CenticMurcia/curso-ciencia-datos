This is the most awful film i have ever seen!Are Mary-Kate and Ashley dumb or something?As if us Brits speak really posh like that?!that guy who played James in it wasn't even from the UK he's Australian!and the clothes that they were all parading in like arseholes pretending to be British really annoyed me.I love going on shopping sprees and believe me WE DO NOT WEAR THAT LOAD OF CRAP!So to all Americans out there do not be fooled by this stupid film because us Brits do not speak posh like that (only the queen does) we are not snobby n strict (us Brits are totally wild!) we listen to the same music you Americans are into such as rap r&b rock pop dance etc we do not wear them crap clothes we wear normal clothes and designer clothes such as Gucci and most of all we are not into the sport polo only nerds are and we do not like Shakespeare at all Shakespeare is utter crap that nobody can understand and we do not say Ta-tar or would you like a cup of tea only retarded ones do!And that is basically what I've have got to say about this DO NOT SEE THIS film!Keep on chilling!
