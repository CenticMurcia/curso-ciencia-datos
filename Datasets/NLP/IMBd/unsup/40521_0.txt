I have seen dogs excrete better material from their rear ends.<br /><br />Those who try to make the case that this movie is about America's obsession with violence or voyeurism miss the real point. One that I think the writer and producers don't fully understand. If this movie contains any useful subtext, it is the futility of pacifism in the face of those bent on violence and trying to negotiate with evil.<br /><br />The movie was full of plot holes and the ending unfulfilling and pointless. It is stunning to me that they could raise the money to make this movie. Did anybody read the script? Why was Naomi Watts drawn to this project? About the only redeeming part was seeing her in her undies for half the movie.<br /><br />I certainly wish that I had been warned about this stinker of a movie.
