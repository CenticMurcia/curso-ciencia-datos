Being a chess player myself, I really enjoyed this movie, probably more so than the average person. One of the funniest moments in the movie is when the grandmaster, who had murdered his Russian rival, is confronted (again) by Columbo during a chess simul (an event where a strong player plays matches against several players at once). He becomes so distracted that he gets checkmated by one of his opponents. But the really funny part of this is that you can actually see that the position on the board is the famous "Fool's Mate". Although not even a mediocre player would fall into this trap - much less a grandmaster, even when being annoyed - it really is a fitting position for the movie, for undoubtedly, any chess player who commits murder for fear of losing a chess match is a fool indeed!
