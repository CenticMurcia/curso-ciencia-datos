*** SPOILERS (I think) ***<br /><br />So not since Vampire Assassin have I come across something so....Vampire Assassin-ish.<br /><br />Much like the aforementioned movie, I came across it when different friends of mine attempted to discard a movie that they said they could not stand through the opening credits.<br /><br />Intrigued, if not morbidly curious, I popped the movie in to be taken to depths of the human soul I was not cognizant to.<br /><br />It was almost like watching something on YouTube, or one of those freak instances where people have a camera rolling and leave it on, whilst doing things in front of it. That in itself is probably the most accurate description I have on this movie.<br /><br />Sure, I could talk about the chiq-on-chiq faux-action, the wolvez barking at passing cars, the scenes taking place in furniture-less model homes (and then trying to explain it), the monosyllabic vocabulary, an interesting scene involving a guy popping a squat and so forth and so on, but it'd never really prep anyone about anything about this movie.<br /><br />BUT, because I enjoy movies like these to no end, I highly encourage those with a morbid and masochistic view on flicks to seek this out and indulge. It's beyond awesomely bad and it's just....there. Rarely do you ever walk away from a DVD questioning the meaning of your existence.<br /><br />This one was really a toss up between a 1 and a 10. Both hold a special place in my heart.<br /><br />Now I need to find Vampiyaz.
