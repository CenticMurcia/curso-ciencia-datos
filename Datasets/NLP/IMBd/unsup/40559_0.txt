This pilot was the biggest disappointment of the new season for me. I really wasn't expecting much, but I suppose its possible that subconsciously I had my standards too high after watching the pilot for Studio 60.<br /><br />Regardless... Heroes was weak (at best).<br /><br />I am hoping they venture to explain the massive coincidences in this pilot with some otherworldly explanation, but even if they do... it cannot explain the completely implausible scenario of a guy who THINKS he MIGHT be able to fly...lunging off a 10 story rooftop and hoping for the best. Give me a break.<br /><br />The characters in the show are all so annoying as to completely eliminate any sympathy viewers should feel for them. I could itemize them... but they are all annoying and unbelievable in equal measure. The flying guy seems like he would be the exception.... but when he spends every scene TRYING to remember to talk out of the side of his mouth (copying Jennifer Anistons manufactured facial tick???), his scenes become ruined by the fact that I want to shout "STOP DOING THAT WITH YOUR BOTTOM LIP!!!!" The two blondes in the show are attractive, but both so stupid as make a viewer wish for their death.<br /><br />The Asian guys bits were funny... but... he just DECIDES he is going to teleport??? Never having tried it? And ... ? ??? How convenient and unbelievable can you get!!! The Indian guy seems like he would be a likable character... but... his diatribe in the intro scene was so scatterbrained and pointless that I have no clue what class he might have been teaching. Then... we are supposed to believe that he is going to continue his fathers LIFELONG WORK with a single set a file folders that he was able to salvage from his fathers study? Then, it just so happens that the flying guy has a crush on a gal who is already seeing another mutant who can predict the future! There is nothing remotely believable about this show so far.<br /><br />"Lost" does similar things with chance/coincidence... but on Lost, that IS the premise of the show. That part of the mystery has been given to us in plausible doses. "Heroes"... seems like something a 15 year old wrote... in a hurry.<br /><br />I hope it gets better... I am not holding my breath.
