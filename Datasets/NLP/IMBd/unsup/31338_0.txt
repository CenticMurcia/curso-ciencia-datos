seriously out of all the t.v. that i watch, which seems to be a lot, ncis has to be my favorite. All the great actors including Mark Harmon, Michael Weatherly (hottie!), Sasha Alexander as the main characters. I think what makes ncis rise above the rest of the crime shows, is the in-depth personalities that each main character has. Every episode is something completely different and offers a great hour of enjoyment. Humour though, i think is the key to ncis's success. For a crime show to be funny, but still uphold it's great plots is something the directors should be applauded for. Mark Harmon is an asset to the show offering a familiar (not to forget hot!) face, as does Michael Weatherly who plays the womanizing, yet cutie Tony DiNozzo, while his partner Caitin Todd played by Sasha Alexander offers good competition and a down to earth personality. Not to forget the goth forensic scientist Abby and Autopsy's Ducky who top off the wonderful cast. Ten out of Ten, watch it on channel ten, 9.30pm Wednesday night!<br /><br />please, if your a massive fan of ncis, visit my website www.ilovencis.com it has everything you want to know about the show and actors!
