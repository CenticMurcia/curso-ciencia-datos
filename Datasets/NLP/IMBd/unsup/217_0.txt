Ringu 0 fills in a few of the blanks in the Ringu series, like, for starters, why she was shunned and how she came to be in the well. Young Sadako is part of a theater troupe, and a reporter knows who she is but the rest of the cast doesn't, at least, not yet. There are glimpses of Sadako's strange powers, which she can't seem to control when she's threatened. There are snippets here and there about her mother and her father, and her childhood, and it all eventually leads up to the Sadako that we all know and love, the one in the well. Now, she's also cast as an understudy (or as they call it here, apprentice) in a play, and somehow the star dies, horribly, while sitting right there in the midst of her fellow actors. Sadako then ends up with the leading role in the play but when the meddling reporter slips a tape in that isn't meant to be part of the play, it changes everything and Sadako's telekinetic powers are unleashed on the unsuspecting audience and cast, but stopped just short of harm to anyone....except, herself. After this point the film takes off but I'll leave that to you to find out what happens, if you like. Not the best of this series that I've seen but good for filling in a few blanks here & there. 7 out of 10.
