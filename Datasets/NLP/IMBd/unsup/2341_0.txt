I just watched the movie again and would like to restate how good it is! It's suspenseful! It's adventurous! Survival! The little "Justin" boy is the comic relief of the movie. But there also are some weaker parts of the movie, but it is still strong and great for the whole family! "Two Scoops!"-Daniel Busheikin, Part of Justin. David Charvet puts on an amazing preformance! The plot is about a plane crash! That's all I can say without ruining it!
