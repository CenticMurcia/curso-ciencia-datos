I am utterly shocked at how bad this movie was. I'm tired and don't feel like going very in depth, but here's why this movie is horrible. And there will be spoilers.<br /><br />We have a main character we hate because he enjoys raping and killing innocent people.<br /><br />We are then supposed to sympathize with him, which we don't, because we hate him. This goes on for a VERY long time. Horrible things happen to him, but we don't really care, because he's a bad person.<br /><br />The movie is extremely long and drawn out. It climaxes so many times that it's very anti-climatic by the ending.<br /><br />We are supposed to get a sense of irony out of Alex going from a sociopath to someone who is constantly being beaten and tortured while he can't use the very thing that got him in the situation, violence, to help himself. We do not get this sense of irony because the movie is CONTRIVED, some examples being: how Alex just happens to run into everyone he ever did wrong one day after getting out of jail (the bum, his droogs, the cripple), or how after Alex luckily is not recognized by the cripple, he goes on to sing the SONG HE SANG WHILE BEATING HIM AND RAPING HIS WIFE while in the cripple's house, as if he were the most idiotic person in the world, which he is obviously not.<br /><br />The fight scenes are silly and anything but "ultra violent".<br /><br />The atmosphere of the movie is redeeming and there is some cult/shock value. I give it a 4/10.
