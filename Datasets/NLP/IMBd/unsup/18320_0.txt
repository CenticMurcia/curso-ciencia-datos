I saw the first episode when it first aired in prime time back in September of 1970 when I was nine years old. And I remember really enjoying it.<br /><br />At the very end, I thought the MTM cat was the most amazingly clever thing I had ever seen (as a kid, knowing it was a take-off of the MGM lion). I kind of fell in love with Mary (of course we all did) especially as the series and episodes went on. Like I said, I truly believe that this was one of THE greatest shows ever on television (very likely the best). Everything clicked: the acting, the choice of actors for the show,the characters they were chosen to play, and most evidently and importantly, the incredible writing. And what wonderful, sophisticated writing it was. I really can't remember anything "dumb" or silly in this show. It never once insulted my intelligence (or attempted to insult anyone's). <br /><br />The characters in the cast became very much like old friends to me, and I guess to most people. Almost like family. Why couldn't we know people or work with people like this?<br /><br />An episode of special note regarding exceptional writing and direction: The one where Mary is so tired of trying to find a suitable man to date or have a relationship with, that on Georgette's advice, she asks Lou Grant out on a date. This was the next to the last episode of the series, by the way. I believe that most people who remember this episode will agree with me that it was one the best ones of the entire show. <br /><br />Unfortunately, there aren't any more sitcoms on prime time T.V. today that can compare to this comedic gem.<br /><br />And Mary, you'll always turn the world on with your smile!!
