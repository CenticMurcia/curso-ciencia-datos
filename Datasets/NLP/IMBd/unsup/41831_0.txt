Being a Nicole Kidman fan ("The Others", etc) I have looked forward to seeing "The Interpreter" for some time and the reviews in my local newspapers were very favorable. However, I was greatly disappointed. The romance never sizzled and the murders and assassinations were so numerous that I could not keep track of who was killed and who was doing the killing. I had to wonder why Nicole did not draw the drapes on her apartment windows and make it less convenient for the good guys and the bad guys to watch her every move. When Nicole talked to the important dignitary on the bus, I thought he was the one who was to speak at the UN. Later I found the real prestigious fellow came flying in and is escorted to the UN with the greatest over-the-top protection that New York City could possibly muster. It was actually comical. Far too many characters, both good guys and bad guys. And far too long. I found myself wondering if this thing would ever end. The best substance of the movie was the inside look at the UN building and how the interpreters do their job.
