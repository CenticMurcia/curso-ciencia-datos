While everyone praises this film for the fact it documented a town full of crazy nutballs, this was nothing more than a dull and lifeless film that glorified the conformity and stupidity of an entire city. This film was completely one-sided, never taking any issue with the wasteful spending the school placed on the football program or the "redshirting" (they didn't even call it intentionally holding someone back) many of the players participated in. All this film did was show how great it was to be a football player in Masillon and they could easily get away with anything they wanted while being glorified as heroes and political footballs (pardon the pun). I love football, and I love film, which is why I was expecting more out of this standardized film school, cineme- verite wannabe of a film. With little coming from the opposite spectrum of the debate, this is nothing more than a PR video for Masillon football.
