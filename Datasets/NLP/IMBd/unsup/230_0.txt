1st watched 04/10/2007 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Jamie Catto & Duncan Bridgeman): Thought-provoking musical montage covering almost every important subject in life disguised as a full-length music video from artists around the world. This movie is packed with ideas but doesn't expect you to buy into any of them it just presents them. This is the modern way and this movie has a very modern all-world perspective on life that is refreshing. We get to hear from Christians, Jews, Atheists, Buddhists, and a host of other people from different regions and cultures all over the world between and during the songs. In a nice touch, we're treated with the names and the places where all the contributors are from at the very end. It's nice to match up the names with the faces and hear where they preside from and we get to see how diverse the movie's contributors are. This documentary won't make a lot of money, because documentaries usually don't but it definitely keeps your interest from the beginning to end. For any movie, to me, keeping your interest is the mark for a good movie and this movie hits that mark.
