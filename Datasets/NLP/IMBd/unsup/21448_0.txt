'Ring 2' is not only much deeper than it's predecessor, it's also a scarier and ultimately better film.<br /><br />Rather than trying to emulate the original, Nakata & Co. opted to expand on the mythos and take it into new directions. It brilliantly explores left-over story arcs, turns previous ideas on their head and maintains ambiguity in all the right places. Naturally, this didn't sit well with many viewers...but if you keep an open mind and pay attention to detail, you'll see that everything brilliantly falls into place.<br /><br />See this (along with 'Ring 0') for the very best horror has to offer.
