I was going to give it a 2 for the computer graphics, which were the only redeeming quality of this "movie". But, it is just so bad, that I had to give it a 1.<br /><br />Terrible acting. Unappealing and ugly characters. Boring fight scenes where it was obvious the actors were waiting for the next move of their opponents. And the plot was less interesting than bowling.<br /><br />It should not get props just because it was an independent, low-budget film. It should be judged solely on its entertainment value. There are sketches on youtube made by 15 year olds with cheap camcorders that are far more entertaining than this pig slop.<br /><br />Darth Vader's voice was really good though. And the hologram effect was decent. Other than that, it was a major disappointment.
