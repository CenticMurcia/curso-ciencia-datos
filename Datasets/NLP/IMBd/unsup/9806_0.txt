This so-called "documentary", tries to "document" that George Bush and CIA planned 9/11, and that no Muslim would or could ever blow himself up in a suicide-attack (though they do everyday in Iraq).<br /><br />The documentary is SO full of flaws and direct lies, that the creators of this "documentary" have even admitted it. But they don't care if there is evidence or not, as long as CIA and Bush did it. <br /><br />The whole notion is paranoid and Americanistic - I.E. the idea that everything, good and bad, is caused only by USA, and that the rest of the world doesn't matter or doesn't exist.<br /><br />It is a retarded Conspiracy theory. It is total Paranoia. I hate when paranoia somehow gets viewed as fact. When speculation gets turned into fact. I am a conspiracy-basher. Ever since i saw a conspiracy-Mockumentary, by a french director, named "Operation Lune". TV told it was fact. As an idiot i believed it blindly: because it is was on TV. Then years later i found out that it was a fake documentary, to highlight how easy it is to make people believe any conspiracy with a documentary with made-up facts. And at that point i knew how Hitler had made his lies into fiction. I knew the horrible power of the Conspiracy theorists. And i knew that i had to fight it. Because if Conspriacy theories are not challenged at every given moment, then they turn into fact for most people.
