You know how you bite into a chocolate candy and expect a nice caramel or nougat center and instead get a mouthful of dates or macadamia nuts, the ones you hate? "Hangar 18" is like that.<br /><br />I was a young teen when I saw this but was still on a high from "Star Wars". Watching this film, I was excited by the spaceship and all the neat gadgets and doo-dads in the discovered spaceship in that mythical hangar. I was expecting something really phenomenal behind the controls.<br /><br />The men searching the craft come to the pilot's section and find....<br /><br />Two overweight guys in black leather and bald heads with glazed-over cat's eyes sitting in leather swivel chairs.<br /><br />I cannot tell you how huge a letdown that was. Especially for a teenager.<br /><br />The rest of the movie was nothing more than the government suppressing the information and hunting down the unfortunate men who found the ship, so they won't tell everyone "something is out there...".<br /><br />I have held a grudge against Sunn International Pictures ever since. How dare them.<br /><br />TIDBIT - Campanella and Pankin, who appear in "Hangar 18", also starred in "Earthbound", another movie on the same sci-fi tangent released a year later by Sunn International. They must have owed someone BIG TIME.<br /><br />One star. Trust no one involved in this movie.
