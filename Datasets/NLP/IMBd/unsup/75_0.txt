There are some exciting scenes in this movie but in general it is second-rate. The shoots are overextended, the characters are not life-like and some actors don't perform well either. I also didn't like multiple nationalist statements which have nothing to do with the plot. I guess the director intended to make his characters mysterious but instead they came out to be unnatural. We are supposed to see how different people successfully struggle with hard times in their lives. But two stories, the one of Carlos and that of Mikel, end up with nothing and the third, the story of Ana, makes a turn without any reason. The movie is very depressive but without any message that derives from it.
