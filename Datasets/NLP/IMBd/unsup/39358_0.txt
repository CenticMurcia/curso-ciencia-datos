Truly, a horrible movie. In the opening scene's with Ice T and Costas Mandylor in their *Cockpits*, they are supposed to be in A-6 Navy Attack Jets. ANyone that has ever seen the inside of an A-6 knows this movie was "NOT EVEN CLOSE!". The producers would have been better off just playing it like the actors were in a large Air Force Bomber. I like Costas Mandylor as an actor, I really do. This was not one of his better efforts. Ice must have been working on his own skills because I am sure this film is not something he brings up when discussing his past projects. And what was Ernie Hudson thinking? Were the Repo men being held off with baseball bats and Ernie was desperate for a payday? This is so beneath Hudson. Unless you are suffering from insomnia and you happen to catch this on FX, late one night...don't waste your time.
