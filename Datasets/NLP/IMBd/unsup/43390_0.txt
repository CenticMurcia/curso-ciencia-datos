X. A stupid film with a pointless title...in fact the whole movie is pointless, but there is no reason that the film should have been called X. Basically, while watching it with three good friends of mine, I forced myself to fall asleep. It worked for about ten minutes until my friend woke me up and said, "If we are going to watch this, then so are you. If we have to get through it, you do too." It seemed like it should have been on that show Mystery Science Theater 3000. Pointless fighting, with overdone gore. Someone cuts their finger it squirts everywhere. Limbs fall off for no reason and when they cut someones head off, they hug it, which is not as dumb as it is disturbing. Just a waste of time, breath, money, paper, life, and a space a Blockbuster. One of the worst anime's let alone movies I have ever seen.
