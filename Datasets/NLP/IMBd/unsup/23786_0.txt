Hmmm ... just saw this piece at the Horrorfest and I wish I had used these 90 minutes for more useful activities, like shooting myself in the head or something ...<br /><br />... but seriously, this is the dumbest plot since 'Slumber Party Massacre 17'. It shamelessly rips of 'Wrong Turn', and in a totally uninspired and lame way.<br /><br />My rating in detail:<br /><br />1 star for cinematography (ok, but barely) 1 star for the music (it didn't hurt) 2 stars for acting (sticks out because the rest of this film is so bad) -2 stars for the script<br /><br />The only positive: James Burns obviously has tremendous fun playing the sadistic Sheriff - it's a pleasure to watch him<br /><br />Makes for 2 stars overall - and that's generous. Save time and money and avoid this one.
