First off, I must say that this is a fun game show. Also, I haven't if I've seen every episode. However, I do know the show fairly well. Every time I've watched it, I've had a lot of fun playing along and watch. The thing I like most about it are the questions. Despite the fact that I don't know that many answers, I still have fun playing along. I hope the Game Show Network keeps it on so I can play along and watch again. If that happens, I will be really happy. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that I'll always remember this show in my memory forever. Now, in conclusion, I hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good.
