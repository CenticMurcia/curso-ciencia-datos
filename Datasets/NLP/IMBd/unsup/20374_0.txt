In Manhattan, the lawyer Liv (Kate Hudson) and the school teacher Emma (Anne Hathaway) have been best friends since their childhood. They both are proposed by their boyfriends on the same day and they plan their wedding parties in Plaza Hotel, using the services of the famous Marion St. Claire (Candice Bergen). However, due to a mistake of Marion's secretary, their weddings are scheduled for the same day. None of them accepts to change the date and they become enemies, trying to sabotage the wedding party of the rival.<br /><br />The deceptive "Bride Wars" is a mediocre and corny silliness. The predictable screenplay is imbecile and never funny, and wastes the talented Anne Hathaway and Kate Hudson in ridiculous roles. My vote is three.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Noivas em Guerra" ("Brides in War")
