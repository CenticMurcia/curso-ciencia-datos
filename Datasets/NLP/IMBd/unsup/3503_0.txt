Maggie Smith is the aunt in "Travels with my Aunt," a 1972 film also starring Alec McCowen, Lou Gossett Jr. and Robert Stephens, and is directed by George Cukor.<br /><br />The movie centers around an old woman, Augusta (Smith) approaching her nephew Henry (McCowen) at his mother's funeral and pulling him into her web. She's trying to raise money to ransom her current boyfriend, Mr. Visconti, from kidnappers as she is receiving his body parts one by one. Before stuffy Henry knows it, she's suggested he steal money from the bank (he won't), his mother's ashes have cannabis in them, and they are on the Orient Express shooting across Europe. As they travel, he learns more about his aunt's life as she tells her story in flashback, including when she first met Mr. Visconti.<br /><br />This is a beautifully produced film, with gorgeous color, costumes, and scenery. Despite the production values and the cast, there is something not quite there with the story. Part of it is because we have no idea what's true and what isn't. Something like the Chinatown she's my sister/my daughter, Henry is either Augusta's son, her nephew, or she just lied to him at the funeral because she needed someone with access to money. Her stories of men, her time in the convent school and as a high-class call girl are either true, embellished, or complete lies. Mr. Visconti is either Henry's father or he isn't. Given the timing of this announcement - when Henry is wavering about pulling a scam - one wonders. So while we may like Augusta and think she's funny, she can't anchor the story.<br /><br />Lou Gossett, Jr. plays Augusta's wacky assistant who's into everything from drugs to mysticism, with a personality that can change in a second. He is hilarious. Alec McCowen plays the uptight Henry perfectly, secretly loving the adventure and the worlds it opens up to him while being a nervous wreck at each new moment. Smith's real-life husband, Robert Stephens, is great as Visconti. He was a fantastic actor who should have done more films. Cindy Williams is very good as a young, free-living woman Henry meets on the train.<br /><br />Maggie Smith is one of my favorite actresses. I am so privileged to have seen her on Broadway in "Lettice and Lovage," in which she was side-splittingly funny yet tugs at the heartstrings toward the end of the play. She's a phenomenal stage actress. Maybe a little big for the movies. Personally, I like performances that take a lot of risks, and her characterization of Augusta was out there. After all, wasn't Augusta? If we go on the premise that she's exaggerating and lying when it suits her, I think Smith's take on Augusta is excellent.<br /><br />Katharine Hepburn was the first choice for this role. I frankly think the film, for all the faults it has, would have crashed and burned with Hepburn. She was a fabulous actress and as a young woman an expert comedienne with superb timing and rapid-fire delivery, but I think in this role she would not have had the necessary flamboyance. While Smith didn't necessarily pull off the youth in the flashbacks, Hepburn, 27 years older than Smith, couldn't have approached them or being a high-class call girl. I think seeing another actress do this role would make one appreciate Smith's contribution even more.<br /><br />All in all, a film with some fun moments and fine performances, definitely worth seeing.
