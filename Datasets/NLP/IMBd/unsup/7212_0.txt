Comedy about two guys (Ralph Macchio and Mitchell Whitfield) traveling cross country from NY to CA. While in Alabama they are (unjustly) accused of murder and need a lawyer--fast. Macchios' cousin Vinny (Joe Pesci) arrives from NY with his girlfriend (Marisa Tomei) to defend them. The problem is that he has only six weeks of law school training and the judge (Fred Gwynne) hates him...<br /><br />Huge comedy hit which made Pesci even more popular than he already was (he had just won the Oscar for "Goodfellas") and gave Tomei a Best Supporting Actress Oscar. The setup is familiar, it's way too long, not all the jokes work and some of the characters are unlikable (Whitfield got annoying quick and Gwynne was TOO mean) but, all in all, this is a fun movie. The parts that do work are hysterical--the verbal matches between Pesci and Gwynne, Austin Pendleton's opening speech in court (you can see Pesci, Macchio and Whitfield breaking up in the background) and just about anything Tomei says.<br /><br />Acting--Macchio and Whitfield sort of fade into the background--they aren't given much to do. Pesci is is just great as Vinny--loud, obnoxious, swearing nonstop and very funny. Tomei matches him word for word. A lot of people seem to think that Tomei doesn't deserve the Oscar she won--but comedy is much harder to do than drama and she takes a stock character is makes her realistic, sympathetic and very funny. Her testimony in court at the end probably won her the award. Gwynne is terrific (if a bit too stern) as the judge. This was a last film and it's great to see he went out on a high note.<br /><br />So, I recommend it. The only debits are its over length and the nonstop profanity may offend people. I give it an 8.<br /><br />Best line--"Oh yeah--you blend".
