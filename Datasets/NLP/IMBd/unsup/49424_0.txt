There are 8 letters to describe this show, H.O.R.R.I.B.L.E. It is not at all funny, and is just stupid. It seems like farm animals and 8 year olds made up this show, because it's really stupid and terrible. It's about animals on a farm that like to party and goof off when the farmer isn't around. Not a good concept, which is why I think an 8 year old is the director. I never, ever laugh at this show, unless I'm laughing for not good reasons because the show is so stupid and boring. You do not want to watch this show, trust me, unless you are stuck with one channel on your TV and this is what's on, and even then I'd just find something to do by myself.<br /><br />1/10
