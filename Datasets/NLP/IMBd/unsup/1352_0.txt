... or should it be 'Thelma and Lewis'?!?<br /><br />Basically this movie is mindless fun - something that may have you chuckling once or twice and rolling your eyes a few times, as well.... Nobody is on their best behavior in this light and slightly campy film. You've all read the plot summary - Rich brat kidnaps herself but gets more than she bargained for when her car is stolen from the garage and romance ensues.<br /><br />The cast is very good in all their places.... Silverstone plays a spoiled rich brat that wants desperately - DESPERATELY - for her father's love and attention. But daddy is too busy with his business life and dealings - some of which are not on the most 'up and up'... While he's no Mafia Don, it's hinted that he's not the cleanest business man in the world.... Walken is daddy's 'enforcer', who seems to help in some of the shadier deals that daddy makes. But, Walken has a decent relationship with Silverstone, and seems to be more fatherly in his relations with her...<br /><br />Del Toro plays a high end car thief who steals beautiful machines on order.... You want a Ferarri? OK, we'll get you a Ferarri...! Del Toro is a bit annoying with his slow dialect and dumb founded look. Harry Connick Jr. plays Del Toro's 'agent' in the car rip off ring. He does a great job in this role, that I think is one of his first.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is fun.... sure, it's not the greatest comedy (romantic or otherwise) on the face of the planet, but it's decent fare - a decent way to burn a few hours.... If you're a Sliverstone fan, you'll probably like this one.... If you're a Del Toro fan - well, he's just himself - with a bad speech pattern. Walken is his typical bad guy self, and shines.<br /><br />Overall, I'd give it a B....
