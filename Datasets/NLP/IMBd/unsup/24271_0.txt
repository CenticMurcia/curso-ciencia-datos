This is one of the few Sandler films that I actually really love. I'm not a huge fan of his comedy, but this movie has something else. It has a heart at it's core. It's funny, yes, very much so. I laugh really hard every time I see it, but at the same time, I love the love story. It's sweet, not gross. It's over the top, but at the same time, it's based on the characters. It's a movie that is made great by having an amazing cast making well written characters come to life, and this is in big part because Sandler and Drew have amazing chemistry. It's one of those movies that puts a smile on face, and a stitch in your side. Major A+ material.
