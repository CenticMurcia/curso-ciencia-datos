wow, was this film awful....<br /><br />$1 rental at redbox wasted.<br /><br />the only reason i watched the whole thing is because i'm paralyzed and when in bed i couldn't shut it off myself, lol.<br /><br />every scene was long and drawn out with boring camera scenes.<br /><br />the flashbacks were long and boring and very predictable.<br /><br />nothing was interesting or scary.<br /><br />you could cut out 45 minutes of this film and not lose anything to the story.<br /><br />the cast was awful, and i wanted the spirit to kill everyone just so movie would end.<br /><br />i'd watch my mother the car reruns before this film, hehe.<br /><br />the only thing the writer should feel proud of is she found a sucker to finance it.<br /><br />Stink-A-Roo don't waste your time.
