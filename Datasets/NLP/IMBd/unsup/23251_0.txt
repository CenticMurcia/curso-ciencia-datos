John J. Anderson (Robert Duvall) is an old man, who loves to dance, and lives with his beloved girlfriend and her daughter in Brooklyn. However, he has a second life, being a hit-man. John is hired and travels to Buenos Aires to execute a former general from the Argentinian dictatorship, and he is concerned with his stepdaughter's sooner birthday. While in Buenos Aires, his stay lasts more than the expected due to an unforeseen problem, and John decides to have tango lessons. "Assassination Tango" is a great deception. The story is very boring and slow paced and Robert Duvall is completely miscast, being too old for the role of John J. Anderson. It is almost ridiculous to see the romantic scenes of the 71 years old Robert Duvall, with the beautiful and sexy 30 years old Luciana Pedraza, or acting like a dad of with his 10 years old stepdaughter. The direction is also not good, and there are at least three scenes that the actresses look to the camera. The songs and the dances are good, but it does not justify to give a good rating for this movie. "Assassination Tango" is completely overrated and I believe just for two reasons: the first one is because of the name of Robert Duvall, but he needs to look to Clint Eastwood and learn how to get old with dignity and glamour. The second is the attraction of the beautiful and quite exotic Tango for Europeans and North Americans. Most of the favorable reviews are indeed for the dance and music in the movie, not for the film itself. My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "O Tango e o Assassino" ("The Tango and the Assassin")
