Let me start by saying that this movie was so bad that it inspired me to register as a user on this website and write a review.<br /><br />This movie is only entertaining for the sick and twisted. I've seen movies like Hostel and Saw before. I would agree those movies are far more gruesome, however they do offer a plot line, which offers the audience some intrigue and interest.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this movie is just disgusting. It offers absolutely no plot line, not even a piece of a story. The script was horrendous at best. There is also no resolution. On top of which, the killer is also a total incompetent pussy, which is contradictory to movies of its genre.<br /><br />The only good side to this movie was the acting, which was pretty good for this genre of movie. If nothing else, this is why I give it 2 stars instead of 1.<br /><br />How they got funding... I just don't know!
