I found this movie entertaining. From the reviews I've read thus far it seems I was one of the few who felt this way. <br /><br />Many of the reviewers on this site have been jaded by the big budget Hollywood epic. The funny thing is that these same reviewers are the first ones to lament about the dearth of fresh ideas found in modern cinema. <br /><br />I watch movies to be entertained, not to rush back to the IMDb forums to eviscerate the works of others.<br /><br />I don't normally post my comments on IMDb, but felt this movie to unfairly criticized.
