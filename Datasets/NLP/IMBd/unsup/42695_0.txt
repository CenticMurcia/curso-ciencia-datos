I didn't like this Episode at all!!!<br /><br />It was a good idea to make an episode with Kelso as narrator and the salt-bunny is hilarious...but...Why??? <br /><br />Why the Iraq??? Come on, did they really had to chime in??? <br /><br />It was nothing new, nothing that didn't appear in thousands of other TV-shows etc. before.<br /><br />I want the "poo-musical" back!!! I think the musical-episode was the best so far. So it's very disappointing to have this episode to follow.<br /><br />I'm really disappointed by this episode and i'm hoping that the next one will be better....which should not be so hard!!!
