"Daisy Kenyon" is a dated, totally superficial soap opera that not even diva Joan Crawford is able to make interesting. She plays an independent career woman who for some mysterious reason thinks she has to choose between an amoral married man (a strangely unsympathetic Dana Andrews) and a psychotic war veteran (Henry Fonda in one of his dullest roles) who wants to marry her the first day they meet (?). The movie is a total bore because Crawford's choice was obvious from the very beginning; run to the nearest convent and become a nun. I'm not a big fan of Crawford, but I truly believe she is a better actress than what people give her credit for and I think she tries her best to improve this ridiculous melodrama. She and those giant shoulder pads of hers are hard to resist, but this is an atrocious movie. The silly script and director Preminger's ("Laura") unimaginative direction sink this movie quickly. Ruth Warrick ("Citizen Kane") has a thankless role as Andrews' uncaring wife. Unless you need to see everything Crawford did, I recommend you to skip it.
