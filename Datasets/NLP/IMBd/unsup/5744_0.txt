I had gotten the impression from a fellow Marx Brothers fan that the Ritz Brothers also were funny, that "if like like the Marx Brothers, you'll like these guys, too."<br /><br />Are you kidding? The Ritz Brothers aren't even close to the MB in humor and entertainment. These guys were not funny; just stupid. I know humor was different back in the late 1930s, but this was just plain dumb. Maybe the Ritz's are an acquired taste. <br /><br />With a story that involves detectives battling sinister characters, an ape who had escaped from a carnival, secret passageways and hidden doors-in-walls in a haunted-type house environment, etc., this should have been a really funny and entertaining movie.....but these guys just aren't funny. They botched it up. The Marx Brothers, or the The Three Stooges, would have made this story hilarious.
