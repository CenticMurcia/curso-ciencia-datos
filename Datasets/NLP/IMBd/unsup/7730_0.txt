I don't know how many times i watched this movie when i was younger. Surely one of the most under rated B-Sci fi movies of the 80's. The special effects are decent enough and the story line is VERY good considering the type of movie it is.<br /><br />The story centers around Packard Walsh (Nick Cassavetes), Keri (Sherilyn Fenn), and Jake (Charlie Sheen). Only problem is. Jake is killed by Packard and his gang of misfits. (always wanted to say that) Thats when he comes back as The Wraith. With his mystical car and revenge on his mind, as well as the love for Keri that Packard wasn't able to take from him. This movie has probably been on the Sci Fi channel, USA, WGN, as well as others more than any other movie of its type. late at night of course.! its one of those that now a days you'll find at 2 or 3 am. But, its still just as fun to watch as it was when i was younger and watched it. Of course this isn't the best sci fi movie made. and it is by far the worst. its just a fun movie to watch with the actors in it that have made more of a name for themselves now than they did then.! of course, just like the other movies i review. grab a 6 pack on a rainy day, and you'll LOVE this movie for sure.!
