Polanski and his house writer Brach bring you the story of a couple (Grant and Thomas) that are celebrating their anniversary on a cruise to Turkey. On the boat they meet a beautiful woman (Grant's character immediately falls for her) and her crippled husband Oscar. The husband (Coyote) offers Nigel the chance to sleep with his wife Mimi (Seigner)but first he must listen to his entire story regarding his relationship with Mimi. The biggest part of the movie is one big flash back were you get to see how Oscar (an unsuccessful writer) meets Mimi (a waitress/ dancer) one day in Paris. They immediately fall for each other and they develop a very passionate but perverse sexual relationship. When Oscar realizes after a while that their relationship has reached the point of no return he tries to break it up. Mimi is obsessed with Oscar and she doesn't want to leave him. Oscar endures her presence but he makes her life so miserable (humiliaton, beating,...)in the hope that she will leave him. When this doesn't work he tricks her into getting on a plain and sending her of to another destination. He continues his sweet bachelor life in Paris until one day he gets hit by a car. None of his one night stands come to visit him in the hospital and one day Mimi walks in. He immediately realizes that she is the only one that can help him and now she's in control... Polanski and Brach once again bring you an excellent thriller.
