Good show. really good humor. To all of the people who are saying knock off of the office.. same show blah blah blah.. well.. i would just like to say how many more mystery/law/shows set in a hospital are they going to make? Seriously you never hear anyone talking about how annoying all those Law and Orders/ CSI.. they are all the same show but you never hear anyone downing those.There are obviously going to be similarities when watching TV shows so why not watch it for what it is instead of picking out the things that its not? Good stuff in this show. I think Leslie is so funny. He basically carries the show in himself. Even though this show probably wont come back i enjoyed it while it lasted and think that it had a lot of potential.
