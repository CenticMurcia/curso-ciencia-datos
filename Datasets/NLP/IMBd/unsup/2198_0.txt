I saw this enjoyable movie several years ago and it always sticks in my mind as a fun little flick. There are a lot of in-jokes that people who aren't b-flick movie buffs, like myself, probably won't get.<br /><br />My favorite was on Patrick Bergen's towtruck, the inscription reading "Satanic Mechanic" (an allusion to "Rocky Horror Picture Show"). I also got a kick out of Hitler and Attila the Hun playing cards together...<br /><br />The cameos by the Stiller family (Ben Stiller, Jerry Stiller, Anne Meara) are great fun too as well as the ever so lucious Lita Ford "Sex drugs and rock n roll, baby").<br /><br />I also enjoyed Hellcop, who's played by CJ Graham, who was Jason in "Friday the 13th, Part 6" and who is now a general manager at a local Las Vegas Casino. Also, be sure to check some of the carvings in his face...a lot of cute in-jokes there as well ;)<br /><br />A fun movie that doesn't take itself too seriously (so neither should you), though it does lag a bit in a few places.... 9/10
