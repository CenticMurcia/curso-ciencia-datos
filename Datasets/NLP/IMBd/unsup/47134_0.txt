nothing much to say about this movie really.. was really an OK movie..everything was expected ...i thought the acting was kinda bad,or let me say kinda dull..Jason Behr looked to me like he was reading off paper or something..there was no element of excitement or suspense or anything..it was just one of these ordinary movies that u would only watch if you have nothing els to watch . i personally wanted to watch it because i like tattoos and im into horror movies and supposedly The Tattooist was classified as horror movies,so 2 things i like grabbed my attention about this movie so i was certain its going to be very good BUT the only thing was good about this movie is to learn never have high hopes about any movie by just reading the title :)
