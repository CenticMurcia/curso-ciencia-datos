Creepy and unsettling Italian slasher that without being pretentious pays homage to American slashers and at the same time capitalized the success of the American style back in the early 80's.<br /><br />The Uncut version has raised controversy mainly because of two gruesome sequences including the cannibal eating a woman's fetus and the later being his demise when he tries to eat his own guts after being slaughtered. Two magnificent scenes for lovers of gore.<br /><br />Still, the movie is not all about blood, gore, or brutal death sequences. "Antropophagus" is a suspenseful movie that creates a creepy atmosphere based on an eerie Greek ghost town, an easy to follow but interesting plot, and believable performances (specially by Tisa Farrow and George Eastman).<br /><br />The score is also perfect and creates the other half of the movie's atmosphere and dark vibe.<br /><br />By any means a let down, I'd say it's a worth Italian slasher with excellent gore, perfect creepy atmosphere, and terrific art direction.<br /><br />A must see for those who enjoy good gore and tension.
