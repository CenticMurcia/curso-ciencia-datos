I bought Radioactive dreams because of Micheal Dudikof. I have liked American Ninja since I was a child and I wanted to see the lead actor in another role. In RD, Dudikof plays a Fool, bottom line. I was a little irritated by the annoying 80s music and singing, but I enjoyed being able to look back at the 80s art of B level crap. You don't see things like this anymore, this is unmistakable 80s and think that it is not a good movie, but a lot of movies aren't good movies. it is as many people say, if you go into it with the right mindset, a movie such as this can actually be entertaining. Basically, Two brothers are locked in a bomb shelter all their lives because a nuclear explosion occurred. The two brothers finally come outside into the world as teens / young men. What the want is to get with women but then they find themselves on a mission to save the world. There are many characters in this film, not great characters, but unique, one such as a gang of scary mutant biker chicks.
