So I went to Wal-Mart to pick out some zombie movies, the cover looked great (something like Shawn of the Dead ha ) bought it and my siblings and I watched it....absolutely horse manure! i regret buying this horrific camera viewpoint movie i.e. "Cloverfield" style. There was nothing going for me during the beginning the film. Although once they entered a secluded house that's when tension/suspense started to come in but then it just died a couple minutes later. I like the idea of making realistic as possible but the acting and camera movement is very b-movie like. Dialogue very poorly scripted. Don't even bother renting it I promise you that.
