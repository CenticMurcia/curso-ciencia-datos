This movie plays like a country song from the 70's. They didn't have a dog, but I'm sure it either ran off or died before filming started. Everything bad happens, constantly. This movie feels like it was created at a funeral home. The movie offer no hope. Even the ending feels uncomfortable. This movie is an onslaught of negative emotion. The only good thing that happens in the whole movie is the friendship forged between the little girl and the maniac. Then the maniac decides to dye the little girls hair black without the parents permission. Who does that?<br /><br />The movie starts at the bottom of a hill and goes down from there. Just when you think things have to get better, they get worse. This movie is a perpetual abuse of drama. This movie is a major downer! If you are feeling sad, please don't rent this movie. If you really enjoy other peoples misery, this is the movie for you! I sat through this movie because I rented it from Netflix. What a waste of a perfect summer afternoon.
