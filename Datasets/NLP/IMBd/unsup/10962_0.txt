Sidewalks of New York, is , as everyone has pointed out, an ersatz Woody Allenish comedy about a group of tangled relationships in New York. The only performances I enjoyed was Britany Murphy whose wonderful guttural voice is always a joy to hear.The movie has the typical Ed Burns slobby vulgarity(lots of talk about applying cologne to ones balls and not showering before dates.. Brothers McMullen had similar talk about defecating in front of other guys.) The movie is murkily photographed with a jittery hand-held camera that succeeds in making New York look as jejune as its unbelievable characters. Most annoying was a long closeup of Mr.<br /><br />Burns hairy armpit. That shot seemed to go on forever! I guess if you are the star, writer and director no one is gonna tell you where to put the camera and more importantly- no one is gonna tell you that your characters bear little resemblance to flesh and blood New Yorkers. Disappointing.
