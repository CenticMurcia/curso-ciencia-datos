The film begins as Harold is trying to see a lady's father so he can ask her hand in marriage. He agrees, but Harold comes back to discover that she's in love with another, so he sets out to kill himself. This is the same maudlin and uncomfortable theme running through another Lloyd short, NEVER WEAKEN, and I think it was not particularly funny (is suicide ever really a funny topic?).<br /><br />A lawyer finds Lloyd in this state and instead convinces him to marry a young lady sight unseen--because she must get married and live in a house in order to fulfill the conditions in a will. Unknown to him and his bride is the fact that some other family members are determined to scare away Harold and his bride--and thus get the inheritance themselves. This leads to a few laughs, but also some uncomfortable moments--as there were just too many scenes of intensely scared black people--a crappy stereotype from the era.<br /><br />Apart from this problem, the film is a decent but not great Lloyd short since it's so contrived and has some cheap laughs. He certainly did better, but it's still good for a few laughs.
