A young girls turning 18 and discovering her womanhood. Her older sister, willing to sacrifice her life in order to get her family out of poverty. Their father, an ill-tempered and drunken author with a severe case of writer's block. Their stepmother whose livelihood depends on closeness with an artist. One dashing American who can marry one sister and take the whole family out of its plight. The American's brother, who doesn't necessarily agree with his sibling's choice. Set the story in England in the 1930's and you've pretty much woven the tapestry for this lovely tale of poverty, hope, dreams and love.<br /><br />Cassandra, convincingly played by Romola Garai, is the pillar of this poor English family. A family that is constantly hoping and waiting for the father to publish a second great novel, the novel that will finally bring decent food on the table and acceptable clothes on their back. During this maddening wait, Cassandra writes her most intimate thoughts and feelings in her diary and brings us along the roller-coaster ride that is the passage from childhood to womanhood.<br /><br />The movie takes place in rural England, in an old castle. The camera work is fabulous. Blazing sunshine in good times and rain and clouds as life becomes more of a burden. The 1930's costumes are impeccable and make you wish you could have lived then, when men still knew how to wear suits, and women could look feminine and sexy without looking trashy.<br /><br />I haven't read Dodie Smith's novel, but I've yet to see a movie adaptation that was better than the book. By these standards, the novel must be a formidable read.<br /><br />I don't know what it is with English films. Being in North America, I've always heard that the English have a stiff upper lip and that they don't show any emotions. Yet, some of the most touching films and love stories I've seen were English (Sense and Sensibility comes to mind, here -- OK, Ang Lee isn't technically English but the screenplay and novel were; that's close enough in my book).<br /><br />If you like funny, emotional and touching stories, without the loud music, the fake emotions and the telegraphed ending, you will enjoy this film immensely.
