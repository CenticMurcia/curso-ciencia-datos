Who is Samir Horn (Don Cheadle)? The FBI wants to know that too, especially after a visit from Agents Clayton (Guy Pearce) and Archer (Neal McDonough). Is he an opportunist selling weapons to the highest bidder? Or, is he something more? Maybe he is a plant by some US agency. We really don't know.<br /><br />While Homeland Security is tracking down a bomb threat in the US, Horn is involved with Muslim extremist overseas. The interesting thing about this is that we visit the motivations behind the extremists in reaction to the American presence in the Middle East, and the racial profiling and religious prejudice in the US.<br /><br />Cheadle is perfect for this role. he presents as a truly converted and religious man who only wants to serve Allah. Is it all an act? The tension is ratcheted up as the massive and ambitious operation in the US is set in motion. Will he make it happen or stop it? Will they catch him in time? Sa√Ød Taghmaoui as Omar was also excellent, as was Pearce. The tension never lets up as the mission comes to the end.<br /><br />A great thriller that gives us insight into both sides.
