Still wondering if we need to compare this film with "Beautiful Thing".I guess because they're both british and coming of age? Actually Beautiful Thing had some cheesy acting and some dull moments; hey guys remember "Wild Reeds" hu?, that was a coming of age movie too, close to the same plot line as Get Real. Get Real was well directed, very good acting and script adaptation from a play. With some twisted moments and I'm sure that people, especially gay dudes, will find themselves relating and empathizing with the main character; a totally big + in a movie. But, Get Real had a few faults as well. Some of the scores were too contrived, the scene when they were slow dancing and "You are so beautiful to me" song plays; Aretha Franklin singing the words freedom after the coming out scenario, etc. I'm putting myself in the jock's place, and no way this dude will go for a 100 pound, pale, goofy gay guy; another thing is would you cruise a public bathroom for a quickie leaving your private school uniform on? If you want to be so discreet about your sexual preferences, hey get your butt across town, or if you are so in love with the good looking jock, man, you would do anything to keep the relationship. Some of the scenes contradict themselves in such obvious ways that through the flick you find yourself asking, what is going on? However, Get Real with all it's faults, saves itself because it gives you good insight of how others feel being alianated, estranged and how to deal with society for being themselves. A good moral in the end; an all around feel good scene; reminds me of "SLC PUNK", which I found myself totally relating to.
