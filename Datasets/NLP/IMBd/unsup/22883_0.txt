I have been haunted by this movie ever since I saw it at age 8. The baby sitter let me stay up with her and I was forever saddened by this movie. It wasn't until this night ( 8/19/05 ) that I decided to see if there was any information on this movie. I heard the John Denver song : "Sunshine on My Shoulders" and just had to look it up. I always wondered what happened in this story. I was too young to remember and I don't think it has been shown again on television. I'm not sure how many other people my age saw this movie, but it sure made an impact on me at the young age of eight years old. My parents were not too pleased when they came home to find me watching this real life sad story. I now realize it was the first time I ever heard of this terrible thing called cancer. Unfortunately, I was soon to see the very real effects of this disease.
