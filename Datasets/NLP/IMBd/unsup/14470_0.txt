While the lead actress is fine, the rewrites are terrible. Terrible. The story line changes. Political preferences or social concepts are introduced because, I GUESS, they can. Agatha Christie's writing apparently isn't good enough! Most of these stories can be dramatized very close to the original and still be very, very good for today. It simply has gone downhill fast in this iteration of the Miss Marple series.<br /><br />I have written PBS and explained my disapproval and they simply tell me that new ideas are refreshing. Makes me think PBS needs new people.<br /><br />Since so many people on this site and others have voiced how bad it is you would think it would be heard by PBS and others. Of course, in a world where you live or die by the number of viewers, such as in commercial TV, it would be heard. Not necessarily taken off the air because i don't know its ratings. But, to say it again, the rewrites of the stories a done with a chain saw and without regard for the original. They are instead written, it appears, to satisfy some political/social concepts of the owners of the stories.
