The viewer can decide what sort of leauge it is.First things first,some reviews have given the impression that the bad girls/innocent boy scene is more graphic than what it is.It's a scene that's more like 50% visual-50% imagination.The newspaper in the film states that the young man was attacked,it doesn't use the r word.Some reviewers are stating an act happened that the law says is not possible.At least that was the law when I was an adolescent more than 40 years ago and spent time researching important information like that,I'm still trying to figure it out. Knowing that Ed Wood is behind this movie can make the tough storyline easier to watch.The finger pointing at the parents may be hard for some to take.There are many parents breaking butt in life to provide for family and instilling religious values in them but they mess-up anyway(the family not the parents).Making the parents look bad in this movie may be touching a sore area for some persons.One comment that the judge lost interest in his own speech half way through it was very funny,I remember seeing the top of the judge's head and wondering if he was reading the script or falling asleep.Showing them off sweaters are popular in this movie even the older Sheila(Lee Constant)comes out with in-your-face lookers too.Being an Ed Wood movie though Sheila could be a cross-dresser.
