Despite a trite script, Stan and Ollie, like two jewels, rise above all and provide some great laughs. <br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who wasn't a fan of the great duo, but seeing it for the first time was a revelation after all the negative things I'd read and heard about the Fox movies. <br /><br />The direction and photography was of a high standard while the supporting cast was adequate if not in the same league as our pals.<br /><br />Of all the sequences, I have to vote the 'bird down the trousers' sequence as the most memorable. No other comic team could have pulled off that gag so well!
