I saw this movie in seventh grade on a free day in school, when I heard that we were watching it, I had heard that it did not do to well, but then I decided to just watch it. And then we did, I recalled that I was laughing so hard, no sound came out! I am telling you, I was laughing my head off when I saw this, this movie is hysterical, it has got really big laughs, it is totally a slap-happy time, you must see this, you will be laughing yourself silly! I was totally surprised about seeing this movie, I thought that it was not going to be very good, but I was wrong, I was laughing so hard that I was almost crying! Why did I like this movie, because it is just plain funny, that's why! There is usually a time where a movie based on a TV show isn't good, but I was surprised with this, I totally had a really good time! <br /><br />The gags in this movie are all very hysterical, they are typical in a usual slapstick comedy movie, there are gags which usually involve people getting hurt! But I was really surprised, it is not one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen, the funniest is Duck Soup, but this is one of the funniest that I have seen in a few years, I believe that you should see this, you will be laughing like crazy! Go ahead and think I am crazy if I liked this movie, but it is just fabulous! <br /><br />One more thing, I don't know why I really thought that this movie was funny, but I was really enjoying it when I watched it. I just that that is was totally funny, its one of the funniest movies that I have seen in a couple of years, but it is not the funniest movie that I have ever seen. But all the same, the movie is hysterical, you really must see this, you will be laughing out loud at it! <br /><br />10/10
