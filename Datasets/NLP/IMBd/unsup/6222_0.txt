Ah the British and their desires to get naked. First with Full Monty and now with Calendar Girls. Calendar Girls is a movie that delivers what it says it's going to deliver. This is simply a movie about a women's group that wants to make a nude calendar and donate all the money to a charity. That's the premise and that's the movie. There's anything fancy, nothing shocking or out of the ordinary. It's a funny, simple flowing movie that does what you expect and that's not bad. <br /><br />Two things I had an issue with and I emphasize here that these things are problems "I" had and may not be something that would concern you. The first is I watched this movie on DVD and found myself needing the subtitles and after I put them on I found myself enjoying the movie more. I can't really explain it, it was just easier to watch. The other issue I had was the situation regarding 'naked' calendar. (Slight spoiler) One scene in the movies had the woman comparing a naked calendar to the statue 'David'. That a naked calendar is art the same way 'David' is art. I'm not about to debate that, but it leaves me to the following question: Why if a naked calendar is art the same way 'David' is art, then how come no one was exposed in the calendar? 'David' is not hidden beyond fruit or buns or quilts or anything like that. The fact that the women were covered up or hidden left me kind of disappointed. I'm not saying I want to see 50+ year old women naked, not at all, please, but when the issue of nudity is fundamental to the whole story line, I think you need to deliver. When you have finished watching the movie, watch it again with your parents, you will enjoy them enjoying it.
