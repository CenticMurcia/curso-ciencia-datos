Belmondo is one of the greatest movie-actors all time. He is very good in drama, in action, and also in comedy. His character is always exciting and his charm climb down from the screen. I think, every man want to be a little bit Belmondo, and every women want to own a little bit Belmondo. Now, in this role, he is Stephan, the man, how loves woman. Loves his woman, his wife, but loves every beautiful girl all over the world. More girls, than day. But there is one rule: don't take home the chick.<br /><br />Once, when his wife fly away, he violate the rule. Met Sophie Marceau, and take the beautiful young girl home. But before the action comes funny noise from the elevator. Belmondo: this is my wife, this is my wife, the elevator has a specific noise, when came my wife. And what can a man do, when there is a young girl in home, and the wife comes home. Belmondo: this is. this is. this is my. daughter. And here begin one of the funniest, greatest french comedy all time, with memorable moments. I offer this movie everyone, who want to laugh a lot. Great points, great Belmondo, sexy Marceau, sexy wife. Have fun!
