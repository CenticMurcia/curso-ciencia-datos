I know that I am probably two decades older than the target audience for "One Tree Hill". I saw this particular episode by accident. I think the subject matter of school shootings is very important. I just wished that the treatment here was more imaginative and, especially the final plot twist at the end of the episode, not so contrived.<br /><br />The only bright spot in this episode was the credible performance of Colin Fickes as Jimmy Edwards, the distraught student who held his fellow students hostage. I felt that the actor was on an entirely different level than the others. The stars and the supporting cast were very bland and uninteresting.<br /><br />At least with this episode, I kept thinking about how "Degrassi: The Next Generation" did a much better job than "One Tree Hill". I noticed that the average age of the actors on "One Tree Hill" is around 23 or 24 years old while the actors on Degrassi is closer to high school age. Sometimes when it comes to television shows or movies about teens or young adults, it depends not only on the script but the casting and the talent of the actors.
