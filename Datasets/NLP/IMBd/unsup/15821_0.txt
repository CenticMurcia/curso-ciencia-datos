There is something totally lacking in this film. I think it is style. The characters are so unappealing and the whole being of the thing has a sick kind of sterility to it. It's what happens when the budget doesn't allow much editing or proper music for tension. The camera angles and close-ups are runny and imprecise. The plot is the same old same old. There's a guy with a military sword (I think) chopping body parts off people at a drive-in movie theater. He stabs and hacks. The proprietor doesn't care if this happens, even though it could cost him his business. This guy is really bad and totally unbelievable. There are two idiot police officers who are trying to solve the crime. There is no suspense. The conclusion is basically unsatisfying and stupidly manipulative. There are some that say this is a foundational film for the slasher genre. Well, they certainly had a lot to build on.
