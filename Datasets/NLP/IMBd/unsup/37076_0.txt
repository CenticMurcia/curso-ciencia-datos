Our society has become so sick. No more real movie stars or television stars. This man and I use the term loosely is an example of how far down we as a country have become. What has happened to entertainment, that must be subjected to this trash. Where has our self respect gone? Get rid for good of this guy and Springer, Cheaters, judge shows, murder, bad language, sex violence. Are there any real entertainers left? Please do something. Hopefully, kids are in school when this trash is on but what about people unable to leave the house because of illness? How much more can we stand of this depression so called entertainment? What a sad world we have become. Somebody do something and start by turning off the television and not buying the products that promote this junk.
