"Quid pro quo" is a phrase much like the word "requiem" which can be a dangerous thing in a very dumbed-down society. In other words, when intellectual Hollywood lightweights leach onto such phrases or words, without really having the cortical ability to get beyond your average video game, the outcome is never very good. This is certainly the case with this very ignorant movie "Quid Pro Quo". My overall reaction to this lame flick is one of disgust---disgust with the dolts who wrote, produced and directed this waste of cinematographic effort, and also with the fact that this movie is so incredibly insulting to those who are disabled. This movie is supposedly about people who fantasize about being disabled, about a guy who is disabled but really not, and a woman who will never feel complete until she is maimed to the point of being paralyzed and thus disabled. I do not think I could make up anything more retarded or ridiculous without the help of a pan full of psychedelic mushrooms or a partial lobotomy. The really bad aftertaste I was left with after watching this moronic movie was that the people who produced, directed and wrote the script for this movie are probably too vapid and dumb to realize how insulting it is to those who are actually disabled. I was also left thinking that the movie industry must truly be at the bottom of the barrel if a movie based on such an intelligence-insulting script was even produced and expected to be digested as actual cinema. On a final note, this movie was so bad, I am not planning to tell anybody I watched it just to avoid the embarrassment.
