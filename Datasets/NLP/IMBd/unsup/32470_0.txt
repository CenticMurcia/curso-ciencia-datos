Geesh this film kinda sucked. I guess what made it so bad was the so unneeded sexuality and the use of veteran actor Gary Busey. They made made as a deranged weirdo that had an obsession with chickens! How sick can one get? I don't like it when I have seen a great actor many great movies and in many great roles and then some director or someone has them in role that makes them a total joke and I don't care if the actor agreed to it or not it shouldn't be done in My opinion! And why of why was Rance Howard and Bo Hopkins in this? The only good aspect (I guess) of this film is that the killer kills everyone! That is something that rarely happens in a killer/slasher movie. Only watch this film if you have absolutely nothing to do whatsoever otherwise stay away from the film watch something else that's much more greater like Halloween!
