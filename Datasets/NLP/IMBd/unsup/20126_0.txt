Do yourself a favour on a rainy day and get out "co-ed call girl" on video - it has to be tori spellings most under acclaimed role to date -she just shines as the innocent college girl who falls into becoming a call-girl whilst starting a romance with a fellow student who wants to be a lawyer - consequently she is torn between her moral obligations and her feelings - very powerful stuff - I confound anyone who views this masterpiece not to be touched by her gritty performance. <br /><br />I know all those fans of Tori will have seen her as the enigmatic Donna Martin on 90120 but in this role she really shines. She leaves no doubt in the minds of the easily lead that being a call girl is no glamour job but nothing more than exploitation. It should be seen by anyone who thinks easy money is easy
