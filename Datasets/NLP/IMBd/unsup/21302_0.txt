I think this is the best of the four Jack Ryan films. After seeing Clear and Present Danger, it is clear and present to me that director Phillip Noyce learned from his few mistakes in Patriot Games. This movie is faster, stronger, and more interesting. Harrison Ford gives another solid performance. There is less of a character to Ryan in this screenplay, but he also strikes me as more heroic. We end up rooting for him rather than just watching him. So far we have seen Ryan take on the Soviet Navy and the IRA, this time he gets involved with a Columbian drug lord.<br /><br />There is one potential problem with Clear and Present Danger. The movie requires just as much from the audience as it gives them. There is entertainment to be had here, but only if you pay close attention. The plot is complex, and fairly easy to get lost in. I personally don't see what is so hard about paying attention to a film, but with the action genre, I think people prefer to be entertained in a mindless eye candy kind of way rather than a thought provoking-thriller kind of way (but that's just my bias).<br /><br />Clear and Present Danger is still a good movie. Whether you are into the Jack Ryan novels or not, I'd recommend it.
