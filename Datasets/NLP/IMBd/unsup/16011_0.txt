8 stars out of a possible 10.<br /><br />Maybe somebody somewhere in today's modern world (considering the type of mean-spirited reality shows that are currently on TV) thinks this film is funny. It gave me the feeling of being locked into a terrible nightmare from which I kept wanting to wake up.<br /><br />Not that the film is bad. Its not, its an excellent film, but there's nothing funny about what happens to the poor guy who is the main character in the film.<br /><br />It starts off slowly, nothing of much interest occurs in the first 20 minutes of the film.<br /><br />He goes to Soho to visit, late at night, an odd girl he just met in a coffee shop earlier that day. Once he leaves that loft apartment, however, then all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />The film then becomes very fast paced and the events that transpire in regards to the main character, a cute little guy with a weak chin and some eyebrows that need plucking, is terrifying to the utmost.<br /><br />If you weren't paranoid before, seeing this film will convince you go straight home after work, lock the doors, lock the windows, don't answer the phone, and just stay there with your teeth chattering until morning.
