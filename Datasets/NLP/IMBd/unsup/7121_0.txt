Set in the eerie, furtive realm of cult followers to a bewitching music score by Kays Al-Atrakchi, "Believers" is, in true Myrick style, a masterfully crafted thriller, reliant on an atmosphere of menace and suspense, as opposed to the ubiquitous gore of most contemporary film. Through the terrifying ordeals of 2 paramedics kidnapped by the Quanta Group, led by the Teacher, issues of destiny and its attainment, introspection, religion versus science, power of suggestion and gullibility are highlighted, enabling the viewer to evaluate and ponder what might be. Most notable, is the riveting performance by Daniel Benzali, who, as the Teacher, is at his insidious, evil best. His spellbinding, measured, haunting tone of voice crystallizes the mood of the whole film, making him, without doubt, the "master of creepy". Brilliantly counterbalanced to his character is that of young Libby, whose mind, like all the others, is anesthetized by the miasma of unconditional trust, innocently misplaced in that false sense of security of blind faith, so intrinsic to cult rationale. Believe it! "Believers" is a must-see.
