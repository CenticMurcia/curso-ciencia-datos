I love this TV series !<br /><br />The plot is great and the characters are fantastic !<br /><br />The rivalry between Tony DiNozzo and Kate Todd is just hilarious ! Gibbs is absolutely awesome in serious - but sarcastic - boss and the poor McGee is so funny too ! I also like Ducky and Abby, who are so strange and funny ! <br /><br />To sum up, it's a great show, which combine thriller and hilarious moments. Wonderful result ! I hope it will go on like this !<br /><br />A few bad things however: this show makes a bit too much the apology of the US Navy and it's a shame that Kate died at the end of Season 2... There isn't the same magic with Ziva David, who is a Mossad agent, which shows this series' position in the Israelo-Palestinian conflict... It's debatable... But these are the only things which aren't perfect !
