When I read the summary on IMDb I was very curious, I thought it would be an interesting movie. In the beginning I thought all this 'short shots' were some kind of introduction of the movie, but the movie never started. It was like they wanted to tell so much in just one movie, that they didn't take the time to let the viewer get close to the characters. Not even one situation was filmed long enough to activate any emotional reaction from the viewer.<br /><br />Maybe if you read the book, which I haven't, you already have compassion for them. But if you haven't read it, everything just goes way too fast for you to feel like you're 'in the movie'. Also I think it would have helped if they improved the clearness of the time-traveling aspect, so that you could spent the time you now use to understand the concept, on developing compassion for the family.<br /><br />As you probably already noticed; I was very disappointed.
