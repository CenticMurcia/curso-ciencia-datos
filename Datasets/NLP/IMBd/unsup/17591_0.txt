An all-time favorite past-time: Baseball! I've always loved the sport. With this movie, I love it even more. "The Bad News Bears" is a classic movie about the love of the sport. This team of misfits lead by the drunkard coach(Walter Matthau, 1920-2000) who whips the team into shape by having a female pitcher(Tatum O'Neal) to help them be winners. They have a young kid with a short fuse, and a foul-mouth. One named Abdul(Erin Blunt) who's not ashamed to say anything, but in one game, his "jewels" take some real punishment. In the final game against the Yankees, the foul-mouth team member said his stuff to them. Now that's team spirit! The comedy, the drama, and plot is all there. The cast are great. This movie to me is a home-run, you can steal bases, steal hearts, or even slide into home. You need to require more than just popcorn. You'll need all the munchies you can have. And a phone if you bust your gut! 5 stars! A homer!
