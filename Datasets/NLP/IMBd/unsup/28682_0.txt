The title is probably the most spot on title you'll hear. This movie is as good as it gets. This movie has flawless performances by Nicholson, Hunt, Kinnear, Knight, and Gooding Jr. The movie has a script that is so good it rivals scripts like American Beauty. As Good As It Gets is my second favorite movie of all time, just behind Jerry Maguire. That doesn't mean that it's the second BEST I've seen, but it certainly was the best film of the year, especially in a tough year. The Oscars were right on giving Nicholson and Hunt awards, I wish Kinnear had won. All in all this is a solid 10/10 film with it's charming humor and the times where you just want to hug yourself with delight. I recommend this to all film lovers.
