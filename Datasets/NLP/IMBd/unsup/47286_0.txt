This low-budget end to Ms. Mansfield's career is a curious mix of emptiness and hope that is hard to put your finger on. Dorothy Keller as Flo (who resembles Estelle Parsons) is sad and touching. Fabian Dean as Charley is Everyman, and Jayne Mansfield (in one of her best performances - a great listener) "plays" three roles and seems to connect with all of them. Beautiful work.<br /><br />A 4 out of 10. Best performance = Ms. Mansfield as Eileen. The final third of the story is the most interesting. The guy who plays Billy gives a heartfelt disturbing "performance" and Jayne seems tapped into something special and uplifting. Great closing shot and music. Decently directed with an average script - a bit morose, but empathetic to the plight of these trapped souls. The young woman playing Maria is very fetching, but it's Ms. Mansfield in her swan song that hits the bulls-eye.
