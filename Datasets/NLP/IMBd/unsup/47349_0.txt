I bought this movie without any high standards set for it. I originally bought it to see the ending that had so much hype surrounding it. To briefly put it, I got what I expected.<br /><br />The story was... well.. nonexistent. The story was, I believe, about an outsider who worked for the circus as the ticket sales-lady. The owner had fallen in love with her, and she wished to marry him. Assumably, she only agreed to marry him for his wealth, which is what caused the rest of the movie to fall into the pieces it did.<br /><br />After a good, hour, hour and 10 minutes, of absolutely nothing happening besides low- grade sex scenes, and persistent cussing, the "banned in 43 countries" violence began, which I can honestly say didn't satisfy my blood lust, but it did leave me saying "Eh, good way to end it."<br /><br />The sex scenes were very frequent, but they were very boring and plain. Honestly, the R. Kelly video where he pees on the young girl, is a lot more interesting than the sex scenes in this film. I could have made better sex scenes with just myself. <br /><br />The violence began decently cartoonish, and evolved into an Eli Roth styled partition.<br /><br />As for film qualities, the acting was fair. Wasn't too impressive, but I have definitely seen worse (*cough* Trolls 2 *cough*). The film production was honestly, very well done. The filming styles and camera angles were nothing new or too fancy, but they definitely set the mood of the film. The soundtrack was very suitable, kind of an old-school styled sound which fit the film grain and the feel of the film.<br /><br />Honestly, I would only recommend this film to 12-year-old boys who are desperate for nude scenes. If you are a fan of horror, or B-Horror, or Independent films, please, stay away. It will not please any of your senses, because anything "positive" from this film has already been done.<br /><br />I gave it a 2/10, and that's me being generous, and for the ending.
