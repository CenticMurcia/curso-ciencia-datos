Was it writer Tom Friedman's fault; or director Tom Kennedy's treatment? TIME WALKER makes the view want to take a walk. Sorry. Get this. A mummy from outer space is buried in King Tut's tomb over 2,000 years ago. He is let out of the tomb in California, and as he tries to find his way home, he leaves slim covered bodies all over a college campus and community.<br /><br />Cast members are: Ben Murphy, Nina Axelrod, Kevin Brophy, Annie Barbierei and Shari Belafonte.
