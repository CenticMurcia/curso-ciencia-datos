The film is good till the first half and then the director looses control over the film. He forgets that he is making a comedy and not a run around and keep on increasing character movie. The plot is different but gets down to the same thing like lots of other movies in the past. The director has not even taken care of the characters. There are a Parsi son and father who keep on speaking Gujrati. Wasn't this very obvious or was this pun intended?. There is an inspector who has been working for the last ten years and suddenly changes into a after-money guy. There is a dacoit who appears out of no-where and becomes a contender for the money. The director could have lost him after using him for the comedy factor. On the whole a movie you can watch once but might get bored in the second half.
