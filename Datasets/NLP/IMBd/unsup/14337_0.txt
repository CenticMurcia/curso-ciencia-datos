Such substance in the movie. Just the dialogue alone keeps you intrigued. The only reason I give this movie a 9 and not a 10 is because Bogies hand position is distracting. He walks like an ape. Even if he is supposedly imitating Dillinger - it's weird to look at. I also enjoyed the married couples side conversations - very comical and a refreshing change from the serious situation with the gangsters. Also loved the relationship between Betty Davis' character and her new love interest- not a sappy love story at all. Very mature feelings on Leslie's character - he is pretty captivating. Deep conversationalist and witty and quick as well.
