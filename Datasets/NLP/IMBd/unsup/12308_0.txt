I don't see how anyone could give this less than a 7. Its not as good as the first but most movies aren't. The acting is decent and the plot is good, but where this shines is the fact that its so unpredictable and the idea that freddy is inside jessie confused me at first but then grew on me and i became to feel sorry for the poor kid. The coach gets what he deserves and there are a few funny moments as well. There's less suspense than the first one, its almost non existent but still this is a godd movie, if you wanna see a bad movie watch Mortal Kombat Annihilation, that was bad! The thing with the bird was bizarre and completely off the wall and i also kinda get sick of everything bursting into flames all the time but the party scene and the ending, how we see the bus at the beginning drive off onto the desert and the ground opens up and hell swallows them was implemented well again at the end of the film (granted we just see them drive into the desert but still..) Also Lisa was hot! So there ya have it You get Freddy : ) A Hot girl! Violence! A Weird Plot! And thats what makes this awesome. Cant wait to watch the third one on Monday!
