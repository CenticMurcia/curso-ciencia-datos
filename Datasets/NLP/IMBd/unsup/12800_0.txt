I don't know why this film makes me laugh. I really don't. Did I, I'd tell you! I would!! But I can't. I can't defend this immoral film about a crazy bunch of speeders, razing across America in pursuit of... fun!! There's nothing to it, but a great cast from the 80's and a lot of good-willed humour. (That and some BADLY filmed fighting, by a young Jackie Chan).<br /><br />If you like Police Academy, you're gonna love this one! Honest!<br /><br />I give it an 8.
