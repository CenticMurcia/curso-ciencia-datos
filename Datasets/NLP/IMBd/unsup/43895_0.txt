Very confusing movie, and not in a Mulholland Drive type of way... Just that I wasn't sure whether I was watching a comedy or mystery. Some scenes seemed to be bit funny, but not quite enough to actually be amusing. At first I figured it was a botched comedy, but turns out it's a botched drama.<br /><br />Some of the acting is just so ridiculously bad that you figure they can't possibly be serious, and it's not just Torie. The bad guys are likable in a cute "Home Alone" sort of way (clearly unintentional), the good guys are uninteresting at best. No chance was missed to play up Spelling's (limited) sex appeal, in scene after scene she gets hit on. One has to presume her agent used his clout to change the script in order to boost what's left of her career.
