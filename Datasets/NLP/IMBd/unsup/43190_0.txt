I saw the trailer and was moved. It was a different type of movie to what Bollywood was doing and looked very exciting; yes...The concept wasn't any good, the whole sequel to ...don't even remember the name...I know it was a copy of E.T....<br /><br />So the trailer was very dark and grim with the fight scene in the warehouse looking very good and the song 'Pyar ki ek kahani' was refreshing. I've never been this excited for a Bollywood film before...And so I watched it.<br /><br />It was a mixture of Payback, Superman, Spiderman and lord knows what else. The poster was a copy of Daredevil and Priyanka was very annoying, while the end was just awful, the warehouse fight which I looked forward to was awful..I mean Spidey's fights are pretty spectacular but c'mon!....<br /><br />The only good thing was Pyar ki ek kahani...th only good thing.
