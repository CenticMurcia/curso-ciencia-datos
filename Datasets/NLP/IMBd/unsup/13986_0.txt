I've got the feeling that somehow the director couldn't decide what kind of movie to make here: A psychodrama about the inner conflicts of a woman (concerned with her past) and/or the solving of the conflicts in a relationship *or* a simple slasher spiced up with some naive psychology. Or both.<br /><br />But the movie is still pretty impressive with great performances overall (especially by Allison Elliot - that woman has got more talent in her little finger than a lot of big stars do, and Richard Harris' son is great,too), an effective score which includes some cool songs (too bad there is not CD out - how canI get hold of "Rockets" or the song played during the end credits?) and interesting/atmospheric and very well done direction. But the Irish background of it all seems to be a little bit forced.<br /><br />Anyway, don't expect some kind of standard horror flick or you will be disappointed!
