Warning: Contains spoilers. This movie isn't horrible. It's actually a fairly good movie, presuming you've never seen/heard the musical, novel, or summary of either. The story strays from the beauty of the Hugo's novel. While we are shown the complexity of Valjean and Javert's inner battles as well as external, vital characters are cut from the story, as are full story lines. For example, one of the major story lines of the novel and musical is a love triangle between Marius, Cosette, and another Thenardier daughter, Eponine (who's cut from the movie entirely). Eponine's unrequited love for Marius gives a bittersweet soul to Cosette and Marius and she is the one who gets them together. Also, I hate to break this to you, but Marius is NOT the leader of the ABC group (the revolutionary boys). The novel gives that title to Courfeyrac, and the musical to Enjolras (a sort of co-commander in the novel). The deaths of the revolutionary boys are much different and more heart-wrenching in the book. Also, the movie ends about 3/4 of the way through the book. If a movie version was done properly, with all characters and story lines, I have no doubt it would be a blockbuster.
