I enjoyed watching this movie so much in the 80's. It is a perfect blend of satire and kitsch that I truly miss in today's movies. The "revelation" at the end by Menlo was priceless (and shocking, Deezen). If anyone knows where I can locate a copy of this on VHS or DVD, I'd love to own it!! Such a shame that it's out-of-print!!
