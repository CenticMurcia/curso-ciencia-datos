Spoilers.<br /><br />How can a show that is so desperately trying to be different be so full of clich√© and formula? The lead character is supposed to be charming, but he just spouts so much drivel that you get really bored very quickly.<br /><br />I agree with others. It comes across like the desperate attempts of an unintelligent adolescent to be deep and meaningful.<br /><br />That brings me to the flashbacks, straight out of Serial Killers for Dummies. and the conversations about killing animals and wanting to kill people Dexter the kid has with his father, HOW RIDICULOUS<br /><br />It's not just the Monologue that is contrived, so are the sets. In ep1, check out the completely white room with all the blood splatters and red ribbons. There for a visual effect, nothing more. Anyway it failed, it just looks tacky.<br /><br />All in all a quite amateur attempt to creep people out mixed with a very mediocre cop show.<br /><br />Not a truly awful attempt but could have done better, Much better.<br /><br />4/10 for effort.
