Brings to mind 1984, Brazil, and THX#### add in a little doom and gloom (the Happening) and blame the human race for doing whatever we did to the environment to require us to run hide at depth inside the earth, and you have a bad action adventure version of Inconvenient Truth meets Journey to Center of the Earth. Didn't see Tim Robbins in the preview or I would have known better. We've beat this global warming dead horse long enough...how about the writers write something new and original. The movie was terribly predictable for anyone over 15. I'm sure many people would agree...the instructions for escaping from the City would have been clear and know by many, and would not have involved a sixflags water slide escape taking you down to make you walk up... Reading the subtext of the "map" the kids had suggested that the people were only supposed to stay in Ember for 200 years...the supplies were obviously meant to last for less...and many more people would have been attempting to leave or at least explore. When they finally leave the city via escape slide they go down down down...then they walk up up up stairs to escape to the surface... when they are at the surface they can see the city far below through a karst window (cave)yet when the generator stops they see no light in the city...I didn't really need ten lines of text to say this movie was a lame waste of time and money.
