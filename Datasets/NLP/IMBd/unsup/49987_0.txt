Thin plot - even for a teen slasher movie.<br /><br />Where's my free sample of shrooms or any mind inducing drug? I could have used this while watching Shrooms.<br /><br />The blueish hue is supposed to make this much more scarier...it just don't work. It just makes it look bad - real bad.<br /><br />There could have been some humor thrown in to make this a good film...especially since the shrooms were supposed to make you laugh...but no. Just lame action, uninteresting dialog, boring sett.<br /><br />Add to that, the typical screech that all horror movies must have and it just becomes really boring and bland.<br /><br />So much could have been done with this, but so much was left out. I assume that a second or third write was never thought of before filming and that nobody thought to expand on the story a bit.<br /><br />I want my sample damnit!!!! I deserve some good quality drugs after sitting through this.<br /><br />At least everybody got a paycheck out of it - or should have.<br /><br />Kinda shitty ending.
