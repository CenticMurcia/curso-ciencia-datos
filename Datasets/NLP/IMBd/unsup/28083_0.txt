I really enjoyed this movie and even more so the second time. Pat Morita imparts wisdom like Chancy the gardener in Being There. Only this time it's not from a garden but the warm glow of a Chinese Food restaurant. A little bit of mystery, laughs, love lost and found and throw in (ow) a flying pug dog. I was glad to see that no animals were hurt in the filming of this movie - in fact the monkey seemed to be having some fun. Quirky characters that you can care about. Where can I get one of those fortune cookies?
