It can't possibly do Albert Brooks' life any good to know that he co-wrote and directed such a limp comedy as "The Muse", which, looking back, could be pinpointed as a stalling-point in his film-making career as well as an obstacle for actresses Sharon Stone and Andie MacDowell, both surprisingly stiff here. Having never found her footing once she became a superstar, Stone made it an unfortunate '90's habit of churning out bigger-budgeted versions of the early flops in her career--the kinds of movies which went straight to tape. Here, she's a kooky, mystery-neurotic who seems to bring good luck to a blocked Hollywood screenwriter. She claims she's a descendant of Zeus, he doesn't care as long as he can sell his next script. Immature, minor offering from a man who used to know the difference between silly-smart and smarmy. *1/2 from ****
