Just wanted to add to the comment by Bailey-21(Alabama)...<br /><br />who said "the entire climax of this... is nearly an exact copy of that film (Long Kiss). Frame for frame, it's a pitiful ripoff."<br /><br />If you look at this scene 'Frame by frame', you can actually SEE Geena Davis standing by the truck! this is the SAME FOOTAGE!<br /><br />I wonder if both films were made by the same studio, and they ran out of money on this one, or if this is even legal!<br /><br />I felt Ripped Off!
