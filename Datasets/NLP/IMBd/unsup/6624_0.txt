I was very disappointed in this movie. I loved the first and was captivated by Luke Mably!!!! What a Hottie!!!! It had kind of the same feeling as The Princess Diaries 2. The story line of the two are very similar. A movie as wonderfully and beautifully written and done as The Prince and Me, I felt like the second could have been much better. Luke Mably played Prince Edvard as wonderfully as he did in the first and to be frank, he was the ONLY reason I continued to watch the film. He was still able to captivate me and take my breath away (I know corning!) as he did in the first!! The girl who played Paige was not my favorite and would not have been my first choice (Actually she would have been my last choice and I would have had to be desperate to pick her). THis movie was NOTHING but a disappointment!!Waste of time unless you are taken away by Luke Mably as I am!!
