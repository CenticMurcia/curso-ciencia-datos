****** POSSIBLE SPOILERS ******<br /><br />The one thing I did like about the mediocre FINAL CONFLICT was the subplot of the killer monk hit team . THE EIGHTEENTH ANGEL tricked me into believing I was going to be watching a similar type of film that revolves around a gang of killer monks bumping off bimbos but that doesn`t happen . Still not to worry because this film is so awful it`s nearly good . Highlights that caused me to laugh out loud were :<br /><br />Lucy`s funeral speech whilst holding her cat <br /><br />The man eating cats on the rampage <br /><br />The reaction on the actors faces during every melodramatic moment , and boy are there more than a few of those <br /><br />The line about scientists " Genetically making people " ! I was under the impression that all people were genetically made . One half of you contains your mother`s genes and the other half contain`s your father`s genes . If you`re reading this and you`re black but your parents are both white then I`m sorry to tell you this but they are not your parents.<br /><br />Oh and that scene where Lucy turns into a slo mo pouting model when the man starts taking her photograph ! <br /><br />Actually that`s the one seriously bad point about the film - It`s kind of sleazy . Rachael Leigh Cook in my eyes doesn`t look a day over 14 so when Lucy starts discussing modeling in her underwear , or keeps giving a sultry look or that horse riding sequence I couldn`t help but give an audible " YUCK "
