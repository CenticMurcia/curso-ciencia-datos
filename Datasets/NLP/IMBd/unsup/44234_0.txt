This movie was stupid. I mean who thought of Sylvester Stallone and Sharon Stone, together? It's completely annoying and is one of those films that the best part is the credits because the viewer can now breathe a sigh of relief that they made it through the film. Stone's yelps every time there is an explosion is very annoying as well.<br /><br />don't's vote: 3 out of 10
