When people say "skip this and go straight to End of Evangelion", they actually mean it.<br /><br />I love Evangelion but this movie is a waste of time and money. I bought it at HMV in the summer and bought it because I owned the series on DVD and TEoE.<br /><br />I was excited and I nearly shat myself because it said "107 Minutes", and I thought it was a movie, and it had an 18A rating (I'm from Canada, mind you). I bought it and rushed home with the DVD, taking it out of the silver slipcase and frantically taking it out of the package and putting it in the DVD player.<br /><br />What a waste of time!!!!! This is basically The series recapped in 45 minutes, followed by the first 20 minutes of TEoE. The minute I saw the opening scene from TEoE, I went "wait... are you sure I bought the right movie?". 20 minutes into that part, I just turned it off.<br /><br />Either way I find this negativity sad, because I really did like the series. I really did. I also saw The End of Evangelion and loved it to death, and I think if I had seen The End of Evangelion before this I would have liked it more, however that does NOT change a thing.<br /><br />I dunno about you, but right now I'm halfway into REALLY getting sick of the whole story. I mean, The creepy "Angels", the forgettable protagonist, the girl he's after and all that other stuff... aren't they beginning to get a little... erm... boring ? I mean, really, the only original part of the movie is in the "Rebirth" section, which can easily be found in TEoE.<br /><br />This is a waste of time and money, and the only reason to see is is for the "Director's Cut" stuff (But not like there's a whole lot, there's only 2 seconds of it in total).<br /><br />So this is basically my first Spoiler-free review, because really there's nothing at all to spoil. NO, this will NOT help if you haven't seen the show, and NO, the 45-minute flashback (snarl) will not help, either.<br /><br />Avoid like the plague! Or only see it if you have a burning desire to find out what happened to Asuka in the series.
