Mamie Van Doren stars in this little teen-exploitation flick about two sisters (of which Ms. Van Doren is one) who are caught trespassing while swimming in a pond. The sisters are charged with hitchhiking, and their sentence is to work on a cotton farm whose owner is the secret husband of the judge who sent them there.<br /><br />The cotton farm for these prisoners is a 20th century version of the company store, where the "costs" associated with their employment outpace their "wages", keeping them in continuous servitude to the farm's owner.<br /><br />The filmmaker wastes few opportunities to showcase Ms. Van Doren in her underwear, or in tight fitting sweaters. Curiously, for supposedly being fed dog food, these "untamed youth" have a surprising amount of energy to pick cotton all day, and then dance the night away without a care in the world. Mix into the cast a beatnik cook who is out of place in this agricultural gulag, and you have an embarassing film that shows youth as rebels only in the sense that they do not conform to the arbitrary standards of the crooked, yet wooden authority figures.<br /><br />If you want to see one of the first films condemned by the Catholic church, tune in to see why. If you want to improve your MST riffing skills, this movie is for you. If you want to see this as a double feature with The Grapes of Wrath, rent the Milagro Beanfield War instead.
