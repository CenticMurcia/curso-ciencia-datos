As i only started watching the movie half way through because there was nothing better on, what struck me was how compelling the story was, as it was a a B-Movie with hammy acting, it spotlighted the issues that occur amongst teenage girls-its scary how powerful envy can be & how it can drive someone to such a horrible act- but i found it hard to believe ( as manipulative as Ellen was) how Patty Duke's character could not see through her -although i have to say that Patty Duke did a great service to the movie And Ellens character being so 2 faced and Clingy makes you detest her.<br /><br />Not a bad effort for a TV flick from the early nineties
