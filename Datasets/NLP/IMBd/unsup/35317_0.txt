Another dumb drug expose film from the 1930s.<br /><br />A group of bad kids try to make a good girl a drug addict like them, while an undercover reporter tries to help her. According to this film, marihuana addiction turns you into a psychotic murderer! All the "teenagers" look like they're in their 20s or 30s; the story is slim; the pace is slow; truly horrendous comic relief; the dialogue stupid and it contains the worst acting I've ever seen. Obviously made by people who knew NOTHING about the drug. Not bad enough to be funny--just BAD!!!!! Don't miss the scene where two people are driving and the very obvious back projection keeps changing! For a good/bad one see "Marihuana" or "Reefer Madness".
