Brooklyn Lobster, poignant story about a man's love for his work, his family and his traditions. My wife and I enjoyed the film immensely and should be seen by all. The acting was genuine and both Danny Aiello and Jane Curtin should be applauded for the fact that they participated for the love of it, for a project they believed in, rather than for the almighty dollar. I especially appreciated the performance of Henry Yuk who I grew up with in the old neighborhood on Avenue J. The movie brings out the best in what people are. After the movie, Kevin Jordan held a Q&A session and those who watched the film gained a better appreciation for the family and the struggles they endured.
