Over the past years I've become a real fan of korean movies and this one didn't disappoint me either. I like movies like Silence of the lambs (even if it isn't as thrilling and suspense now as it was when it came out) or Kiss the girls. On the other hand I hated(!) Seven which in my opinion was a bit boring and had a terrible ending. What I love about many korean movies and this one shows it especially... the female lead character is played by a beautiful woman (one of the most pretty actresses in the world I would say) which is a nice change because besides Ashley Judd and Angelina Jolie American actresses are either pretty old or just plain ugly compared to 50ies to 70ies Hollywood era. Anyway, Tell me something is a well done thriller that keeps you wondering (in difference to twelve monkey were I figuered out the end after five minutes of watching despite what people said what a surprise ending it was supposed to have - I would rate Twelve Monkeys with 1 out of ten anyway, though. And I'm a vivid reader of sci-fi and I do love Blade Runner). Anyway I'm getting lost. Just let me tell you that you should watch this movie and just enjoy it. Not because of the gore scenes but because of the riddles it offers to the audience.
