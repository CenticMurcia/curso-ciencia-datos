Its been a long and painful viewing experience for audiences and fans of the scary movie series as the recent bunch of spoof-movies (date,epic,disaster movie and meet the spartans) have been quite horrible. And then along comes this movie. I watched this movie hoping that it just might be good. But alas, what starts out as a hilarious opening scene quickly gives way to an utterly disappointing movie with some really awkward scenes.The movie itself is about teens going through the usual issues with sex and maturity (well just sex actually) and plays in the form of small episodes.The only probable reason to even watch this movie would be for its few good funny scenes,namely - the opening scene with Frankie Munitz,the misplaced cell phone,the mistaken room,the scene with the prostitute and the intermittent commentary scenes with Matthew Lillard.In fact,the most hilarious scenes are those with Matthew Lillard and are worth watching (but only these scenes).<br /><br />All in all this movie which starts out promising is just another sad excuse for an attempt at comedy,which contains mostly awkward but un-funny scenes and pretty women (surprisingly enough), with the only good part being Matthew Lillard's jokes. Ultimately in the end not worth the effort or your precious time.What still amazes me though, is how in hell did IMDb give this movie a 7 out of 10???.
