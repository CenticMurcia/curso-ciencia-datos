I just finished watching this movie. Although it had a pretty weak budget, it didn't matter. That has to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. The movie made me think of my own youth, and the paths I have chosen to get where I am today. I highly recommend this movie to anyone.<br /><br />The movie follows three kids from their youth, through their adolescence, and into adulthood. In some ways it reminded me of Forrest Gump. I won't spoil the movie for anyone, but if you watch it, you will know exactly what I mean.<br /><br />I would say that if someone were to put this movie into a category of Baseball films this film would be right at the top with The Natural, and Field of Dreams.
