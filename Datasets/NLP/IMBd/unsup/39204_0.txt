Why, lord why? Why can't someone, just once, produce a version of the Island of Dr. Moreau that is even slightly faithful to the original (and may I say excellent) book. Why does every version have to have a love interest? Why do they leave out the main character's descent into madness when he is left on the island by himself and sees the beastmen degenerate into animals? Where's the social criticism, by the way? That having been said, this film isn't entertaining on *any* level. It's slowly paced, nothing ever really happens, inexplicably Dr. Moreau attempts to turn Michael York into an animal, and ultimately the film goes no where. On the small plus side? The film does have decent make up and acting by York and Lancaster. What is the law? To stop making crappy movies out of good books.
