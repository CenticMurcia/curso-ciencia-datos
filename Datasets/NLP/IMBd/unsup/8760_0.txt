Woodstock is one of the best, if not the best, concert documentaries ever made. I have just seen the DVD version with over 40 minutes of film not shown with the original theatrical release. The musical acts are generally fine but no one is going to enjoy all of them. Standout performances include Santana and Joe Cocker. I particularly like the use of split-screen imagery and the filmmaker's wonderful job of conveying the mood of that time and place. This movie is highly recommended for anyone who wants to revisit life in the sixties and those sadly forgotten messages of love and peace.<br /><br />
