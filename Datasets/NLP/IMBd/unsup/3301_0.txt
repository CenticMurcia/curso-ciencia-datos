Cavite is about Adam, an American Muslim Filipino traveling back to the Philippines to attend his father's funeral and visit his mother and sister. He finds his mother and sister are kidnapped by a Muslim terrorist faction to force Adam to do something. Adam is forced to travel around the Philippines to various places while his family is abused. Adam picks up a bomb and is told to take it to a church and leave it there as revenge for American crimes against Muslims. Adam tries to refuse, but the slime balls cut out his mother's tongue. Adam finds out his father was killed by the same terrorists in a similar bombing. As a back drop, Adam's American Christian girl friend calls him and tells him she's pregnant and having an abortion. Adam does what he's told, his family is released, and Adam goes back to America where his girl friend tells him she couldn't have a Muslim baby. As if a baby is born favoring one religion over another. While the dialog lacked some emotion, the acting made up for it to some degree. The cinematography was pretty good and you got to see some low income parts of the Philippines during Adam's travels and understand how the poor can be taken advantage of by sooth saying organizations that hand our money for cooperation. I liked the movie more for its raw surreal nature. Adam walking around in shock trying to comply with lunatics while also trying to think of a way out that doesn't kill his family.
