this isn't crouching tiger, the medevil matrix, or anything else it is being touted as. i guess not being a idiot frat boy i dont have the appreciation for this film that many others do. if you have seen good movies you will immediately recognize that this is not one of them. the story is weak, the movie relies on the occaisional tricky camera shot or gimic (which is strange and out of place because the film is otherwise shot in a very straightforward style) the "talent" cannot act and its not because they are speaking a different language, and, the movie is about 50 minutes too long and therefore is boring as hell.
