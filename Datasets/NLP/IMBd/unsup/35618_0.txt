I remember the real life events of this vividly since it was one of my best friends and the drummer in our band who was portrayed in this movie as the stepson. A lot of it was over-dramatized, but that's what Hollywood does. As well, it was told only from the viewpoint of the victim. So much more was left out. I saw it when it first aired, but I couldn't watch it again since it brings back such bad memories, plus it's so biased. I know Lifetime airs it often so I just keep switching channels. It's just too strange to watch a movie that is based on the real-life tragedy of people I know very well, especially when some of the facts and scenes are altered. The actors were far from nailing the personalities of these people, but again, that's Hollywood.<br /><br />UPDATE - 2007 - So, the "expert" who testified that the bullets matched his gun commits suicide a few months ago after he is confronted about his misinformation on the stand. BUSTED! He as no expert at all and made up everything. The case has now been reopened and it seems the bullets DO NOT match his gun. Hence more will be introduced to prove innocence of the "lead character" of this "wanna-be based in real life" movie. I hope when he is set free the producers come back to Baltimore and do a sequel to show just how wrong the first movie really was and show that he is innocent after all. They can show how he was set up by another cop who was also sleeping with her (the movie didn't show how she liked to hop in the sack with other cops, too). This movie should be burned in a bonfire with all the other biased trash out there.
