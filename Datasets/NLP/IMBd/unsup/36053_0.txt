Why is this movie considered controversial? Its so Pro-US its scary - is that the controversial part?<br /><br />The sober black man persuading the thug that "im a believer!" crap. The backstabbing broadcasting company twisting the story to make the troops look bad for there own gain. The wounded soldier who refuses to give up -"i just want to get back to my unit!". The strong woman supporting the wounded soldier "just give him something to fight!" The compassionate intelligence officer. Yadda, yadda, yadda, yadda, clich√©, yadda, yadda, mtv-cutting, yadda, yadda, yadda, rock music. Generation Kill pwns this crap any day.
