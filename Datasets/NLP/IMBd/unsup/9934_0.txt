I saw this at the San Francisco independent film festival, and it was totally contrived and boring. It was intended to shock the audience, I was just shocked on how slow and unimaginative this supposively innovative movie was. I won't give it away, but will only say that you will be disappointed if you decide to watch the whole movie through. It certainly does not get better as it drags on.
