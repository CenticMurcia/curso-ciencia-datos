Con artists Dr. Dudley and his naive partner Andy Williams decide to team up w/ the Frisby cosmetic company to save that company with the Dr.'s invention of flavored lipsticks. The boys get in trouble when they mistake a satchel of securities for their supply of lipsticks and are hunted down by a pair of detectives, while Ms. Frisby's manager is planning to ruin the boys by turning over the securities as well as Ms. Frisby by sabotaging her entry in the transcontinental race. The film has its moments but it is just the same plot devices in all of the other Wheeler & Woolsey films. Wheeler falls for Dorothy Lee, Woolsey for the woman he thinks has money. The opening scene of the musical number featuring many unclad bathing beauties probably marks this film from other W&W films. Funniest scene for me is the pool game w/ the two detectives, barely ahead of an overzealous girl wanting to test her lipstick. Rating, 4.
