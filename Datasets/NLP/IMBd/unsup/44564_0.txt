I just rented superman 1 2 and 3 and watched them in succession. 1 and 2 rule of course.... but this piece of " needs to be banished from video stores everywhere. not only is ot completely far-fetched with the whole "uber computer" who has more powers than the terminator and my pentium III combined, but the plot is WEAK, and the acting is HORRIBLE. check out the scenes where "evil superman" tries to act tough. oooh.. tough man he is. whatever. dont rent this.. its a 1.5 hour trip into a bad place. even worse than "batman and robin"
