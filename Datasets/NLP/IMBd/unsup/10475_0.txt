After hearing this film mentioned on steve buscemi's comentary while listening to Pine Barrens an episode of sopranos and felt i had to see it. Once i (finally!) found this film i was imediatly drawn away by the tag line "Mr Pink makes a movie" it still makes me shiver today. But I decided to buy it despite the DDT like qualities of that line.<br /><br />The film itself has to be watched twice to apreciate it as the first time all i got from it was a story about a drunk. Buscemi is great, a very convincing portrail of a lazy bum for such an intelligent guy. The story is simple'ish but has some funny one liners. A must see for any Buscemi fan like myself.<br /><br />Only one question why is Sam L Jackson on the back of the box when he has all of two lines? Pitty Buscemi could just let the movies speak for itself rather than using his past successes and cameo roles to push it.<br /><br />Smashin
