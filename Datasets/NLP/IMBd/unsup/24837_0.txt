ok, I must admit that I have been only admiring the beauty of Maxwell Caulfield in this movie. he is just damn cute. but again, this is also a good movie for the whole family to watch. easy to understand. this kind of disney-like movie is never a bad choice when you are just looking for fun time in viewing. rent the tape and watch it.
