As a film student, I have to watch a wide variety of films, both good and bad. This has to rate as the worst film on the first year of my course, and one of the worst films ever made.<br /><br />If you like your drama to be slightly slower than normal, then this may be for you, but even those who appreciate thought provoking over action will still be bored senseless by this absolute tripe.<br /><br />I have never seen a film slower than this one. The largely static camera barely helps, admittedly an intentional move, but I doubt intended to bore us that much.<br /><br />Yes this film sucks, and you'll be wishing the lead character would drive his car off the road, just to make it end.<br /><br />My Rating: 1/10
