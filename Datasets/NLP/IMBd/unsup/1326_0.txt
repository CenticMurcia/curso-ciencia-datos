Great music is not enough to make a great film. If 'Vengo' was screened on some world music channel, the viewers would have objected to the useless melodrama that deprived them of some thirty minutes of great music and dance. Amazingly, if you see 'Vengo' in the theaters or on the film channel, the objection is the same. There is great music here, and this is the best part. The rest is a very skinny gypsy revenge melodrama, not complex and interesting enough to sustain a big screen movie. Some of the characters are interesting enough to provide the opportunity for good acting, but what remains in the memory after the film is mostly the music, dances, environment. I rated it 7/10. Do not rent or select it for seeing unless you are a fan of gypsy music and culture.
