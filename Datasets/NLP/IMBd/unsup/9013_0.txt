Fox you fools!!! you have a real gem of a movie here and you are wasting it there may be 'more to a bottle cap than keeping liquid escaping' however there is also more than selling a movie than the odd random TV spot! This may be a film that succeeds in capturing the magic of the family film glory days of the 80's, (it took me right back to when I was ten years old and for the first time in years allowed me to become totally engrossed in the world that was portrayed before me) this does not mean you have to stay true to the 80's in your marketing campaign !!! Merchandise?Billboards?Internet?Giveaways?Video games? .. ..No- just a lame trailer! Its 2008 get with it FOX! This movie will no doubt become one of those titles that the next generation discovers by chance who will pour upon it the real attention it deserves strangely much like the box in the movie how ironic! 9 out 10
