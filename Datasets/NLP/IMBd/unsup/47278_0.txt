...But then, I had to buy it because of my name in the credits. Yep, I was the "key medic" in this travesty of film. And they didn't even list me in the "cast and crew." Bummer! But you know what the best part about this movie is? We all had a blast making it and you get to see the back of my head as I walk with my "family" across the parking lot in the beginning and then again at the end (I'm the guy in the blue "medic" outfit.) And yes, the scenery is majestic, I do forget sometimes since it's in my backyard and I see it every day. The craft service was the best -- I gained about 20 pounds during the shoot -- and they put the food right next to the medic station. I haven't seen most of the cast and crew since, but I still think about all, OK -- some, of you occasionally. Hey Buxbaum, if you ever get to Sandpoint again, call me! And I think you told me you could teach me to barefoot ski....<br /><br />The acting, particularly Cat's, is pretty wooden and predictable. To me she always looked like she had something really distasteful in her mouth when she talked and couldn't quite spit it out. Maybe it was the never-ending dialog. The best actor on the set by far was Rosie the dog (although I can't remember if she's in the movie and can't bear to watch it again to find out.) As for the plot of this movie -- it's pretty transparent, BUT I'D URGE YOU ALL TO RUSH RIGHT OUT TO BUY OR RENT IT so you can actually see my name in the credits and Polestar can recoup some of the house payments they paid me!
