Bram Stoker's Dracula -------------------------------------------------Nosferatu -------------------------------------------------------------The Lost Boys ---------------------------------------------------------Fright Night ----------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I have this thing for Vampire movies and I've got to say, I believe this one was a classic.<br /><br />Although it may not be so intriguing to those who are looking for an intellectual movie, if you like old classics, this may be the movie for you.<br /><br />Completed with comedic lines, gore that just doesn't impress the people of the millennium, and a classic Crypt Keeper ending twist, Bordello of Blood is a good watch.
