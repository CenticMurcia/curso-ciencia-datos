"Foyle's War" is all about Michael Kitchen as Christopher Foyle, a soft-spoken civilian detective who unravels murder mysteries using his deductive prowess while Britain gears up for WWII. Everything that happens in this very civilized, easy-going TV drama series is inextricably involved with the Brit war effort imparting a sense of the period and the history to the intrigues and drama of the stories. Although some clues are kept from the audience, much of each of the 90 minute mysteries can be deduced along with the protag offering an enjoyable "play along" aspect as Foyle slogs toward the inevitable crime busting conclusion. "Foyle's War" should be good stuff for those into cozy mystery fun. (B+)
