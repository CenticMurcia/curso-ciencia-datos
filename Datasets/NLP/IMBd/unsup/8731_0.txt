I too saw this movie in the 80s, even though I was a child I could see that this was a special movie.<br /><br />My family taped it when it came on TV (on beta video) we watched it lots and lots of times, until my parents went out and bought a VHS video and out went all the beta videos.<br /><br />I have contacted foxtel and all the free to air TV channels to screen it again but they all say they don't have the broadcasting rights. I thing channel 7 screened it in the first place.<br /><br />I would really love a copy of it, I have been searching for a copy since my parents threw out the beta. Its a brilliant movie.
