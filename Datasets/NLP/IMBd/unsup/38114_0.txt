I love low budget horror films, I really do. I mean, any time most people buy or rent such a movie, they think before they even reach for their wallet, "Oh, my my my...this is going to be bad." But folks, brace yourselves...it gets worse.<br /><br />The only reason I gave this movie a star is so it reflects negatively on the movie's rating, as opposed to posting no stars at all. We don't need anymore civilized human being to be subjected to such horrible films. Everyone else has accurately depicted just how terrible the plot, acting, effects and everything else is, so there's no need. The only thing you need to know before watching this is it falls right in line with all the other low budget failures that have been flooding the zombie genre lately. "If we try and put excessive amounts of gore in here, maybe no one will pay attention to every other flaw that graces this dung-pile." It doesn't work that way.<br /><br />And you totally know anyone who left this movie a positive rating had to be people that were in on making the movie. Especially since it's the first few comments. They even disguised one user as someone from Los Angeles, CA! Smoothe move, Canadians.
