A strong contender for the ultimate Hollywood tearjerker, director George Stevens' (best known for 1939's GUNGA DIN and 1956's GIANT) genteel parental drama never resorts to easy manipulation or overbearing sentiment, but manages to involve audiences through a tightly-constricted script and top-notch performances from its leads. The simple story is wisely left uncluttered, with no attempts to artificially inflate the proceedings with unnecessary thematic distractions. Stevens cleverly revitalizes the often-utilized flashback device by book-ending the sequences with the effective visual of records being played on a turntable. Stevens also pulls tremendous performances from his principals.<br /><br />Cary Grant and Irene Dunne had long been a favorite screen couple in the madcap screwball comedies THE AWFUL TRUTH (1937) and MY FAVORITE WIFE (1940), and here the duo both deliver absolutely tour de force dramatic performances that is far removed from their typical fare of the time. Grant was nominated for his first Academy Award as Best Actor for his heart-wrenching portrayal of a man that seems to repeatedly lose everyone he ever cares about. Grant's emotional-yet-refreshing-restrained courtroom plea is unarguably one of the most touching scenes in film history, and the always-terrific Dunne is every bit his match in a subtle and conflicted portrayal that always hits the right notes. Intelligent and moving, PENNY SERENADE is a perfect reminder of just how effective sentiment can be when crafted with high expertise and professionalism.<br /><br />Get your handkerchiefs ready, you may need a whole box full!
