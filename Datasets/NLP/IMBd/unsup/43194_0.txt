The one advantage that a sequel has over any other film is that it needs no build-up to set the stage nor does it need to introduce the lead players; it can straightaway get into the meat of the story and catapult the viewer into the heart of the action. However, this one advantage has not been put to use by the makers of Krrish. Though a sequel to Koi Mil Gaya, it tries to begin a new on several fronts and the lame screenplay never really gets off the ground, except towards the last 15-20 minutes of the film, and by then it's too late.<br /><br />What Koi Mil Gaya was to ET meets Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Krrish is to Superman meets Spiderman (with some Matrix action thrown in). But Koi Mil Gaya was an extremely well crafted entertainer with a crackerjack screenplay and deft direction by Rakesh Roshan, breaking the conventional hero mould and establishing that a great performance which is not necessarily heroic in true Indian tradition (but has heroism written all over in terms of originality and clever inspiration from other successful works) is bound to work. Krrish is not what one would expect from the same maker. It's not even a patch on the prequel, and wastes away valuable screen time establishing itself and its eponymous hero. Yes, this is a superhero film, and yes, some action sequences have a Matrix hangover and the special effects are worthy, well executed by any set world standard, but it's the writing which is very poor and lets the entire film down.<br /><br />Krrish does not match up to the prequel nor does it live up to the huge hype which has been created.
