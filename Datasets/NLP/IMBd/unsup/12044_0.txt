One of Bob Clampett's many surreal cartoons has Porky Pig on vacation in Egypt, where he misses a tour. Boarding a camel, Porky travels through the desert, but the oppressive heat sends the camel into full-scale dementia! How funny to think of an American going to a foreign country expecting a really easy time, and this befalls him! Yes, "Porky in Egypt" mostly looks like a place holder in between the really great cartoons that in 1938 (aside from "Porky in Wackyland", others included "Daffy Duck in Hollywood"). But I still find it funny. And if I may say so, people often treat the desert as the least tolerable climate, but if you've ever experienced a hot humid climate such as the southeastern US, the desert actually feels quite nice.<br /><br />Anyway, worth seeing.
