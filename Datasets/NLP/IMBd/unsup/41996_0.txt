This is very unwatchable stuff here. I used to like nick toons but now it's all about Rocket Power and Spunge bob. This is one of the worst cartoons I've ever seen. It's about a couple of skater kids that do tricks that's it and the cartoon is done in that unwatchable nicktoons way. Nickolodeon shouldn't of banned the Ren & Stimpy show. That was the only cartoon I liked on nickolodeon. Teen nick is even worse. So if you come across Rocket power avoid it because you will hate it. If you want to watch a good cartoon then watch the Ren & Stimpy show. It's much better then this slop. Rocket power is as bad as any nick toon out there these days. So if you haven't seen rocket power or any other modern nick toon then don't bother. My two year old brother could make something better than this crap.
