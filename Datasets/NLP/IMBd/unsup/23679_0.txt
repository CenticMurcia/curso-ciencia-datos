Agi Murad (Steve Reeves), a Chechen chieftain, leads his people in the fight against the Russian Empire. The czar Nicholas I, tired of the endless fight that is costing him money and armies, gives a letter to Princess Maria (Scilla Gabel) to be handed to her husband Prince Sergei (Gerard Herter), containing instructions to negotiate a peace treaty with the rebels. She leaves St. Petersbourg on a coach destined for the fortress in which the Prince Sergei, her husband, leads the fight against the rebels.<br /><br />Agi Murad is loved by the daughter of Haslem Bey (one of the chieftains engaged in the rebellion) - Sultanet (Giorgia Moll) is her name, and Agi Murad naturally loves her too. But Sultanet has another suitor, the cruel and mischievous Ahmed Khan (Renato Baldini), also engaged in the league against the Russians.<br /><br />Here we have the basic outline of the plot. This film, like many Italian epics (much more a horse & lance than a sword and sandal film) is very colorful, with a good cinematography, dancing numbers and battle scenes. The actresses Giorgia Moll and Scilla Gabel are gorgeous - Sultanet loves Agi Murad, and Princess Maria will love him too. Both actresses provide charm and sensuality to the film.<br /><br />Already in the beginning of the film, when the all-powerful Czar Nicholas I is talking to Princess Maria about her mission, it's all too clear that he's under her spell and Princess Maria charmingly takes advantage of his infatuation for her own means (after this scene I was hooked). And the lovely Sultanet commands the heart of two men - something that will have its consequences in the story.<br /><br />There's good chemistry between Giorgia Moll and Steve Reeves. Both of them would work together again in the enchanting "The Thief of Bagdad".<br /><br />This film is entertainment guaranteed. The production values are not as high as those of the American epic films, but this film is more creative and more fun. Don't expect much of the story, it's has been told many times before. See the film for its colors and spontaneity. "The White Warrior" is not so deadly serious like its American counterparts - the hero may fight for freedom and justice, and the villains can do very bad things, but there's always time for delight.
