The show is quite nice except for the actress should learn to act a bit more natural rather than trying to so call act cute. I have seen lot of her show and her acting really have lots more to brush up. Too fake. I also don't understand why she was choose to be the lead actress of this show. Maybe budget was low. If she can learn to act less fake, it would be nicer.
