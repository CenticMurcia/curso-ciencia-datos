Starting in 1934, when the new Production Code was enacted, 'inappropriate' adult themes were generally forbidden in films. That's because in the fast and loose 20s and especially early 30s, all sorts of very adult themes crept into films. Cursing, talks of abortions, extreme violence, adultery and even nudity were in films for general consumption---including in a Tarzan film (which appealed mostly to kids). So, a backlash took place and most of these topics were out or else if a sanitized version were allowed, by the end of the film the wrong-doers had to be punished.<br /><br />THE GOOSE AND THE GANDER is about as racy as they come in the Post-Code era. My assumption is that because the movie came out in 1935, it had been designed as a Pre-Code style film but had been re-written for the new sensibilities. So, on one hand, the film has themes of adultery BUT because it's Post-Code, the people never actually get a chance to consummate their illicit affairs. And, by the end of the film, people had learned their lesson and went back to their spouses or, in the case of the criminals, were arrested.<br /><br />The film begins with married Genevieve Tobin trying to arrange a tryst with George Brent. But, this tryst is interrupted by Kay Francis and her friends. It seems that some time back, Tobin had stolen HER husband and now using a rather intricate plot, she diverts Tobin and Brent to her home--planning on keeping them there while secretly contacting Tobin's husband so he could come there and find his wife with another man. However, when two thieves get caught up in the plot, the entire plan falls apart and where this all leads is anyone's guess.<br /><br />Overall, this film is very entertaining and funny--with typically good acting from Brent and Francis. Despite the Code, the film makers managed to work around it and make a nice little movie. The only negative, and I was able to look past it, was that the ending seemed a bit hard to believe.
