The movie is not that bad, but it's still a waste of time. It's the classic drama about a tough woman who is released from jail, gets stuck with a 7yo kid who just lost his parents and of course discovers her sensitive side... Deja-vu is written all over this film, cliches are all over the place and it's too predictable... not even Sharon Stone's well acting could save this film. I can't give it more than 4 out of 10.
