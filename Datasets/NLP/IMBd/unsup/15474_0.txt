I loved this movie , i enjoyed the beautiful scenery and the wonderful story of a girls journey to find her father ,,lots of suspense and fun. I wonder what ever happened to meredith salenger who played the title role . lanie kazan was evil as the landlady and i enjoyed her performance . i loved the dog who played a wolf too . favorite parts are the train ride and the journey in the woods .<br /><br />spoilers -- only parts i disliked even though they were realistically portrayed were the orphanage even though im sure thats the way it was back then for orphans.treated meanly but they at least could have listened to her when she said she wasnt an orphan.and also for the father to just leave his kid behind with the landlady who obviously is a rather loose woman .he didnt have time to watch the kid when he was around as she was always playing hooky or sneaking into movie theatres ,,although during the depression , you did what you did to survive but still he should have considered her welfare more than just to leave her like that, he didnt even say goodbye to her at the beginning of the movie when he left. course the writers must have worked this to make you feel sorry for her even more and sympathetic.
