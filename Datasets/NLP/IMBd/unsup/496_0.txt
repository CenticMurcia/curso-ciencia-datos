Great music! A chance for everyone to see and hear some of the R&B icons of a generation. Silliness of the plot is overshadowed by the quality of the musical performances of Ackroyd, Gooden, and Morton (they can actually perform!). Don't look for great acting, just go with the flow and enjoy! A must see/hear for all R&B, Blues, and Soul affectionados everywhere!
