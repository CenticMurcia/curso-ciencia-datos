It's really hard for me to rate this film. i didn't like it at all. Yet i still kept wanted to watch it.<br /><br />Even though it's a true story, all of the characters were like stereotypes. The British guy, the french guy, etc. So the acting was terrible, especially by the girl who played Amber. Shane West was really annoying. If that's how Darby really was, then i am not missing out on not listening to their music. He seemed like a pretentious attention whore who tried standing out just to get attention. And it showed a few of his phases where he changed his way of dressing and being. He never seemed like an original guy so i have no idea why he was so loved. If it was the stage show, Iggy Pop did much more than Darby. But Shane West always had this cocky smirk on his face even when he was trying to look sad. He was great at crying though! The Bronx as Black Flag was cool.<br /><br />The direction was pretty great. Except a few of the scenes you could tell were staged and didn't feel organic or real. Like when they were shooting up, they were in a conveniently lit spot just for them.<br /><br />i grew up listening to punk bands but never The Germs. i didn't even know who they were until a friend mentioned them. So i'm not biased when it comes to them and am not a fan. The movie was a 'meh' for me. i definitely didn't like the music. This movie is more for fans than people interested in movies. If you want to see a good indie biopic, see Control about Ian Curtis of Joy Division.
