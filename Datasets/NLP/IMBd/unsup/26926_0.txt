This one defintely beats the quite dull "Rome must Die". Jet Li's performance is excellent, however mr bad guy might be a little well too bad. The manuscript certainly could have needed a little more work..but all in all I say they did the best of it. A little more action tho wouldnt hurt :)<br /><br />7-8 / 10
