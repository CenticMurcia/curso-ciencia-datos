After seeing Submerged on TV and saw a couple of other Steven Seagal movies like Today You Die and Into the Sun, they were a lot better than this. This is another sequel from the great one since Under Siege (Which I never knew about Seagal making this sequel) from the 2003 movie The Foreinger and that one was better than this and I can't believe what crap this movie is. Don't get me wrong Steven, I am a fan and this is my 2nd worst movie from you and I hope you will comeback in a movie where it is better than this but I still hated this movie for the rest of my life.<br /><br />I give this 2/10
