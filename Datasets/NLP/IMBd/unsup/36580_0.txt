This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Somehow, in this veiled [auto?]-biographical mess, Sagat actually makes HIMSELF the center of attention! I will summarize the movie: [SPOILER WARNING]...<br /><br /> * Mother: "Yes, you're dying. We argued when you were young but now I love you." * Father: "Yes, you're dying. And yes, you argued when you were young but it wasn't that bad." * Daughter: "And now I'm dying!"<br /><br />Repeat several (apparently) hundred times and you get the idea.<br /><br />This is a train wreck of a movie, and I use the word "movie" lightly. I was drawn to this in that manner - a wreck on the highway that apparently no one else but me sees ... why is it still there? Won't anyone clean it up? Help?
