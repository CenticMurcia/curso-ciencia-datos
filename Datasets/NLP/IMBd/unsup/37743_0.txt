Shouldn't a satire be funny and not poorly ape a satire that was?<br /><br />I can't believe the mass of talent in front of the camera (and some behind, like Bernstein). Funny? Nope. I didn't even chuckle. It was like having my teeth cleaned with limburger. The constant and flat references to Dr. Strangelove made it all the more unbearable.<br /><br />So smug. So slow. So what? I couldn't even finish it. Then I find this was written and directed by the man that talent and character forgot, MM. That made it kind of a curiosity, but for all the wrong reasons. And shouldn't Rip Torn have just thrown the script in the trash with a "Nobody needs money this bad" snarl? <br /><br />Yet another blindingly bad film with SNL and SCTV comics (who have been so funny elsewhere).
