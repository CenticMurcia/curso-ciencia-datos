What a heartwarming movie. It's been a long time since a movie touched me enough to make me cry, and this one did. I've always loved Doris Roberts. She sent me her autographed photo last year after I wrote her to compliment her biography and ask for confirmation for a recipe in her book. She really makes this movie. I didn't see how the plot could possibly overcome the conflict but in a little twist, everything was set right in a bittersweet ending. A bit of a fairy tale in having someone take in all these warm and wonderful homeless people but don't we need a fairy tale sometimes to carry us through? You can't miss with this one if you crave something beyond the usual murder and crime scene analysis. This has none of that overworked theme. I wish there was a book but eureka, it seems to be an original screenplay. Bravo to Michael Lach.
