I usually give all movies a fair chance, but in this case, I'll make an exception. The movie was filmed in a classic way which was not very impressive. The acting was extremely sub-par, and the lines given to the actors were not much to work with. Most of the scenes in this movie were extremely cheesy and predictable. It seemed to me like the actors were brought out of a closet that they have been stuck in since the 80's Some of the themes of the movie were not approached like they should have been. A boy who seem to have a mental condition is made fun of throughout the whole movie, and hardly anybody did anything to try and help him with his problems. I have not seen the other Sleepaway Camp movies, but was thoroughly unimpressed by this one.
