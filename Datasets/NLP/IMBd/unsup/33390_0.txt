This poorly made,incredibly cheap horror flick is really stupid.Not scary at all,it offers us some laughable special effects and nothing more.This is the sort of movie that keeps you thinking that they must have intended it to be bad-this couldn't just be some sort of accidental mistake.I found two reasons to watch this piece of crap:1)Wil Wheaton("Stand by Me")2)Lucio Fulci,who was an associate producer of this movie.To sum up,all I can say is,that you will laugh till it hurts with "The Curse"-you can believe me!
