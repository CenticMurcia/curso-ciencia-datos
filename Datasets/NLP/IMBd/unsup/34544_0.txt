I don't know if this movie could have been any worse if it tried. My two roommates and I were totally pumped up to see this film, we set a timer on the TV and all ran into the living room when the timer went off and sat attentively on the couch like dogs about to be fed. <br /><br />When it was over, we slowly got up and walked out of the room without saying a word to each other. The movie was so bad it left us speechless. This farce of a film was nothing more than a way for John Leguizamo to live out his boxing fantasies. I recommend avoiding it at all costs.
