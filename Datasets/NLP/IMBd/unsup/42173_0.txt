There are so many movies in this world about the first daughter, and considering how few people in the world can relate to the very particular experiences of that group of people, this addition to this 'first family' film genre is just unnecessary. This was a combination of all of those random generic first daughter films and the mid-90's Meryl Streep wild-water-rafting film "The River Wild".<br /><br />Aside from the various yawning plot holes (how could two people avoid being blown to bits just by jumping really fast out of the cabin; why did the freedom fighter not pull out his gun BEFORE they started rafting into that white water near the end; why wasn't the forest swarming with secret service agents to avoid just such a chase), the whole movie felt contrived and boring. Ultimately, this was one story that really did not need to be told.
