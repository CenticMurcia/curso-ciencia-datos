This Hitchcock film, made soon after he burst into prominence in America with films like "Rebecca" and "Suspicion," is a lot of fun, but it's ultimately more of a technical experiment than it is a satisfying narrative film, much like "Rope" would be 4 years later. The suspense here comes more from wondering how Hitchcock is going to sustain interest in a film shot entirely within the confines of a small boat rather than through any dramatic tension. Still, any Hitchcock fan should see it, and Hitch works in his trademark cameo in a particularly clever way.<br /><br />Tallulah Bankhead is sexy and vampy in the lead role. She has the glamour and acerbic wit of a Bette Davis, and it's a shame she didn't do more film.<br /><br />Grade: B
