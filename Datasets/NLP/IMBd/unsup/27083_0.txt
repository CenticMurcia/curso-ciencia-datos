One of the early serial killer flicks and it still packs a punch. Kurt Russell's Malcolm Anderson reminds me a lot of Darrin McGavin's Kolchak, the skeptical paranormal investigator from TV's "The Night Stalker", from their lousy taste in clothes to their hardheaded devotion to the truth as journalists. Kolchak stalked freaks & creeps and Anderson gets the experience in reverse, seriously wreaking havoc on his off-work romance with girlfriend Christine (Mariel Hemingway), a schoolteacher with strong values. Richard Jordan is suitably creepy in one of his last roles--really a variation on the local corporate slimeball he played in another made-in-FL minor classic, "A Flash Of Green"--as the killer. Andy Garcia is also quite likeable in the role he's best at: solid support work as a police detective pal of Russell's journalist who inadvertantly gets as much press as the glory-seeking villain. I've seen this picture several times and never tire of it. It's in that class of films with "Night Moves", "Flash of Green", maybe "House of Games" and "Blood & Wine": tough-guy thrillers with smart writing and heroes to boot.
