Lake Mungo follows the familiar mockumentary style that has become the stable of many a modern day horror film. The film is painfully slow with some incredibly bad performance by the cast who seemed to working with dialogue and without any genuine emotion to their grief. Lake Mungo feels like someone watched Twin Peaks a few too many times then stumbled across The Last Broadcast and decided they want a J Horror moment as the cliff hanger moment. Clever ideas that were poorly executed. The film has way too many unrealistic ideas for a so called realistic ghost story. The film felt like it had it's running time padded out with plenty of shots of the sky and the Australian bush backed with atmospheric music. The bushland could have become key element in this story but instead it's relegated to running time material. Lake Mungo is all about the atmosphere and the potential for things to happen which never materialise in this film. This is one of the rare occasions that the idea of Hollywood remaking this film is actually interesting because hopefully the new writers will expand on the good concept and deliver whole lot more action, horror and drama.
