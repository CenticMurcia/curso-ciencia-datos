Imagine 'Jaws"with a $2.00 production cost.Small town with tourists coming soon.A sheriff who hates bees but lives in a town that relies on bees to make their living.Sounds like another sheriff we knew who hated the water but lived on an island. Soon into the picture a shark-oops,BEE kills someone.Sheriff is alarmed but the Mayor and other town locals ignore his warnings.Throw in a few teens who run amok in their sailboats- Er, pickup truck( along with sheriffs son)and you just know there's terror(?)around every flower bed.Son ignores daddy sheriff and runs amok with brainless friends who find great humor in killing off a herd of cattle with a box of bees.Hey,I COULDN'T make this up! Nor would I even try.As a few more extras get stung and die-the only way to get out of this bad movie before the drawn out ending-the sheriff tries to warn the townspeople.But don't pluck your tulips just yet,folks.The sheriff saves the day and the plants are pollinated just in time for crop season.As for the herd of dead stung cattle-we assume 'Killer Bees 11' will start with the town having a big old barbecue.
