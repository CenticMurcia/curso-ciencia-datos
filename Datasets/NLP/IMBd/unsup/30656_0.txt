I have seen this film many times and enjoyed it each time. Although it contains only minimal language concerns, it is best when viewed uncensored and uncut--as are most films. I find the humor that Paul Hogan uses to bring this concept to film takes what sometimes seems familiar story lines and raises them to the wonderfully unique. It has one of those rare mixes of humor, drama, and bittersweet and thought-provoking themes. Hogan provides a consistent character throughout and writes an ending that should be quite satisfying for those who hate the vague, confusing ends so popular with script writers today. Like, Oh God!, I find the movie uplifting with each viewing, as I find Crocodile Dundee's offbeat humor refreshing each time. Regardless of the rating you would give, I am sure you will at least feel the time spent watching this film was worth it.
