I caught this on IFC awhile ago, and I was rather hooked (the main reason at first was the title---The Cure is the best ^^). The conversations are interesting and the subtle relationships that build up; the way you can sort of tell what the characters are feeling is a really unique and rare thing in films. In fact it's more of a study of how people are than a movie. It also features one of the single greatest sex scenes ever in cinematic history (without any nudity at all!), revealing its sensual side. I definitely recommend this to anyone feeling up to some thinking.
