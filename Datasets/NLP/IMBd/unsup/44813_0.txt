What makes for good fight scenes in movies are those which stretch the limits of credibility but never leave you laughing in the aisles because they have lost all touch with reality. Banderas is very good at what he does and this movie is just a laughable comic strip that makes James Bond adventures look like conservative stunts. A movie should never leaving you feeling that reality has been stretched to absurd proportions.<br /><br />Despite a completely unoriginal plot and storyline, the movie has some substance. But get to the fight scenes and it's all over. The villains can open fire with machine guns and, despite a complete lack of obstruction, miss their targets completely. But worse, our heroes just walk calmly through this barrage of automatic firepower as though they know that they cannot be hit even if it were a Sherman tank aimed right at their heads from 20 feet away. It's so preposterous that it's difficult to take this movie as even a long stretch of the imagination. This ridiculous charade repeats itself several times and in each one there is never any suspense because you KNOW that Banderas and co. will calmly allow the villains to empty their arsenal and then our boys can go on a slickly filmed, stylish killing spree of the bad boys.<br /><br />This is a B grade rental for Banderas (and Hayek) fans only. There are better films for those who feel a compelling need to see more skin from Salma Hayek. If you must see this, take it for what it is -- a poor mans desire to see some sensuality without the porn and some outrageous gun play that will leave you shaking your head. This movie wastes many talents, style, and from a reasonably good opening it goes downhill from there...
