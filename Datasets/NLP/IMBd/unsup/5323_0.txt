Every single character is either fat, stupid, unable to communicate, unable to enjoy life or a combination of the afore mentioned. This movie goes out of its way to rub in the ways in which communication can fail and it tries a lot to be supposedly different to Hollywood garbage. <br /><br />Yet I can't help thinking that this is a great movie for people who hate people and really quite enjoy a feeling of superiority to all the idiocy and misery in this movie. <br /><br />There are 2 ways of escaping the fact you are boring, fat and stupid: Watch action movies or watch movies about even more boring, fat and stupid people. <br /><br />Most of the characters are very clich√©d. There's this French lady with her unconvincing broken English who happens to use only French words that any half-schooled supposedly intelligent and irony-understanding genius who likes films like this will understand. <br /><br />Having said all that - I wish there was some kind of miracle and a year in which only movies like this were released worldwide and people would be so p..ed off... Especially in the Land of unlimited opportunities. Better yet, have them be films with some wit like "Happiness".
