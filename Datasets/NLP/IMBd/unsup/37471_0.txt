I had high expectations for this film  primarily based on the amusing trailer. The first twenty minutes had me laughing and engaged in the characters and story. And thenit all fell apart. And I mean the film went cold almost at an instant. It was as if the writer and director scrapped the initial blueprint and started a new, much less enjoyable movie, somewhere before act 2. The laughs and character interest disappeared and what remained was a strange and pointless denouement, which was otherwise terrible. I'm still unsure as to what the filmmakers were trying to achieve seeing as it felt like they gave up hope early on in the story. Needless to say it was quite disappointing.
