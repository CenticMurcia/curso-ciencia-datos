A motley group of people are forced to seek shelter at a remote inn run by the snooty, sarcastic, but suave Amos Bradford (a perfectly unctuous George Zucco) because of a raging thunderstorm that has flooded out the bridge and the roads alike. These eclectic individuals include a vengeful escaped convict whom Bradford put in jail, a meek geeky bank teller who's trying to embezzle $50,000 bucks, a mean, ruthless mobster who also wants to get his grubby paws on the hot loot, a young couple who are planning to get married, and the huffy, overbearing, disapproving father of the bride-to-be. Naturally, a vicious killer starts bumping folks off. Efficiently directed in a briskly straightforward and economical no-frills manner by Sam Newfield, with an endearingly hokey script by Fred Myton, plenty of sharply sardonic dialogue, stark, gritty black and white photography by Robert Cline, a booming, melodramatic score by Charles Dunworth, and game acting from a solid cast (Glenn Strange in particular contributes an amiable performance as Bradford's clumsy, cowardly, oafish assistant Andy while Charlie Middleton registers strongly as a jerky ramrod sheriff), this wittily enjoyable Grade B mystery thriller potboiler delivers a reasonable amount of cheap thrills. A fun little quickie.
