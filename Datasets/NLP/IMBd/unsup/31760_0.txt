Â… but I thought it was a very interesting story.<br /><br />SHORT REVIEW: Gruesome, gratuitously sexual, interesting story, well acted.<br /><br />MY BIASES: I rarely watch horror movies. I never, ever watch gruesome horror movies like "Saw" and its ilk. I was really in the mood for a horror movie and LL in a more adult role. UPSHOT: I might be marking a little easy. Maybe. Or maybe not.<br /><br />I felt that the story, characters, and actors were all plenty good enough to entertain me for 2 hours. I suspect that the critics and other people who are dumping on this movie are somewhat reactionary against the fact that it definitely has some gratuitous violence and gratuitous sexuality.<br /><br />I will not spoil any more than the trailers do. Briefly, the story begins with an artistic girl named Aubrey Fleming. A girl at her school goes missing and her dead body turns up with some amputation. Everyone fears a serial killer, particularly when Aubrey disappears. I girl is brought in to the hospital who looks exactly like Aubrey. Everyone thinks she's Aubrey, but when she wakes up, she claims to be a stripper named Dakota Moss. Here we have a problem. This girl is either Aubrey or Dakota. If she's Aubrey, then why is her delusion that she is Dakota so convincing? If she's Aubrey, then is there really a Dakota? If the girl in the hospital is Dakota, then where the hell is Aubrey, and why do these 2 women look identical? It's a fun set-up and I felt that the end result was satisfying and revealed effectively.<br /><br />There were at least 3 scenes that were so gruesome and horrifying that I couldn't watch. I did the old "cover most of the screen with your hand" trick.<br /><br />In playing a character who has a drug problem and has an identity issue, I couldn't help wondering if LL was trying to exorcise some demons with this movie. Or possibly she was rebelling against her career which has composed of playing many good girls in movies with more general appeal. I have to admit that some of her fans will see this movie just to see her and will really wish they hadn't seen it. If you're expecting "Mean Girls" or "Herbie Fully Loaded", you will need some therapy to recover from this one.<br /><br />I should mention that while there is no Lindsay Lohan nudity per se, there are some extremely raunchy scenes involving close shots of various body parts of Dakota's while she is wearing next to nothing and writhing around a stripper dance pole. Just in the interests of full disclosure.<br /><br />In a side-note about cinematography, this movie is very blue, in the literal, colour sense. It's fun to watch just how hog-wild they went with all the blue. I started watching for blue objects and there were many: bright blue lights, clothing, ribbons, glass, eyes, gloves, etc. Not to mention that every shot seems to have a blue tint.<br /><br />So consider yourself fairly warned and enjoy the twists and turns of this movie, if you choose to give it a shot.
