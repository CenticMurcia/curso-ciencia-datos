This movie portrays Pauly attempting to revive his dead career. The irony is that if this movie were actually any good, it probably would revive his career. Unfortunately for Pauly thats not the case. It's terribly boring and full of bad acting. I applaud Pauly for recognizing why his career failed but wish he had just accepted the fact that he can't act and just chosen an alternative path to potential success.<br /><br />Don't be fooled by the all-star cast of this movie. That's just a stunt to lure as many poor victims into viewing this piece of lard as possible. I imagine most of the cast signed up out of pity. <br /><br />Pauly, Give up now! Go find a new career! Maybe serving at McDonalds? You MIGHT do well at that!
