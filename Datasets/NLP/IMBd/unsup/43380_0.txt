One a wet evening, I decided to pop down to the DVD machine around the corner to pull out a DVD for the whole family. Phantom Below looked promising so I decided to take it.<br /><br />What a disastrous movie. 90 minutes of pure agony. The cast is poor, the script is bad and the visuals are pathetic. You expect to watch a movie about a submarine, in reality the shots of a submarine are limited. Instead you are presented with computer animated shots of submarines, torpedo's and the like. They must have really saved on the computer animations because they look as if they come straight out of a cheap third rate computer game.<br /><br />The inside of the U-boat is also completely unrealistic. The studio shots remind you of 70's movies, they are so fake.<br /><br />There are some pretty good U-Boat movies out there. This one certainly doesn't rank among them. Don't waste your time watching this one.
