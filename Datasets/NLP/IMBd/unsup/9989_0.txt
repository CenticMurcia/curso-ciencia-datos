I'm not really sure they were trying to make a good film. There was a lot of material that really helped weaken this film that could have been edited out, and wasn't. It's almost as if the director, or the producer was making a film simply to have a bunch of friends appear on camera and was afraid to take out very poor scenes when their removal would have strengthened this film. Still and all, it wouldn't have been a good movie.
