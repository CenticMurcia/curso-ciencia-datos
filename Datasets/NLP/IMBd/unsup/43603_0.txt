Or, I should say, the first Bill Rebane film I can make it through without being bored to tears. I got this film on one of those 50 movie packs called "Nightmare Worlds", so you know I couldn't have wasted too much money on it. I don't know why, but I really like this film. Maybe it's the goofy music that sometimes sounds like an off key version of the theme from "The Good, the Bad,and the Ugly". Maybe it's the attention grabbing beginning. Maybe it's the original characters that I actually started to like about a third of the way through the movie. There's the drab but somehow attractive female protagonist, her brother who cares so much about the group that he actually leaves the cabin for help, the rich snob who is slightly reminiscent of Charles Winchester from M*A*S*H, the guy the female protagonist is infatuated with, and the brainy, slightly crazy nerd who looks somewhat like a walrus, and is actually more important to the story than you think he is at first. The atmosphere and cinematography were also above average. Now, I'm not saying this is a great movie. Heck, I'm not even saying it's a GOOD movie... it's slow paced, has bad acting, and the quality of the DVD transfer is god-awful... but you might like it if you have a very distinct taste in cinema... a BAD taste.
