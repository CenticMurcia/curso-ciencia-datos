Adam Sandler seems to be a very popular guy in America. It seems that the Americans truly adore men that portray overgrown kids and act like idiots for 90 minutes. With the exception of, for instance, ´There is something about Mary´ I have yet to laugh once while watching these exercises in psychological torture. But...<br /><br />I actually liked the Wedding Singer. I don´t know how, but Adam Sandler managed to make this film funny and even lovable. I suppose it is the simple fact that he plays an ordinary guy and the jokes aren´t of the usual ´man-falls-on-womans-breasts´ kind. <br /><br />I have no idea why, but I actually would give this 6/10. I rented it for 1$ and, to my great surprise, it was worth it.
