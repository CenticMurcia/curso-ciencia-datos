I do not wish to reveal any of the content of these films. I do, however, wish to convey a sense of gratitude to the directors for the artfully crafted scar that these films have etched upon my conscious. Each of these films have their own brand of indelibly disturbing content, and I highly recommend joining the altered persons who have viewed them. The camera-work is amazing. The symbolism is profound. I'm scarred, and wouldn't have it any other way. I do not wish to reveal any of the content of these films.
