Sorry but this is a horrible movie some of the acts were poorly acted in this kind of movie, I felt sorry for the little girl at the end as she gets hit by lightning and jumped into the water? I bet she did that on purpose cause you die burning if you get hit by a thunderstorm I don't understand why she gets out of the house by herself in the middle of the night that is kind of against god's law and this girl is to cute, pretty in this movie to hit lots of people and die if It wouldn't have made a movie called "The good daughter" like the "The good son" and that will probably help spread the word to the little girl's actions and they said that the little girl is 8 and she looks like a 11 or 12 year old. It seems to be unlucky for a movie about a evil child killing other people it might spoil people watching this people please do not watch cause after the day I watched this movie, it gave me sad dreams about Patty McCormack's death I almost started to cry after I dreamed and it might upset you a very sad movie and spoiled movie...
