I love this movie. I watched it when I was a kid and it brings back great memories. Plus it teaches us so many life-changing lessons. Be yourself, live your life to the fullest, remember those things that are important, and love who you are. Tyra Banks is so funny and pretty in this movie, a true big-hearted Barbie, or Eve. This also reminds me of the days when Lindsay Lohan COULD act. She wasn't slutty and she showed real emotion in her characters. She really does have the potential, she just needs to watch this movie again and take advice from it. This movie has a good story line, it makes sense, it's very funny and quite a tearjerker. ='( Tyra Banks proves to be a very lovable character, and even though she seems clueless at the beginning, at the end she is the one who learns it all and finally understands to be yourself, to love yourself, to remember those things important, and to live life to the fullest!! And always remember the classic song : Shine bright, Shine far. Be a STAR! Where you live where you are...Be a STAR!
