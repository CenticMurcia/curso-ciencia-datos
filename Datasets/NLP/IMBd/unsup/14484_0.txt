I am a novice dancer but this film left me speechless. It was awesome to watch the dancing and for me to think that both Lisa and Patrick were in their early 50's when this was shot, is amazing to me. They were beautiful in the dancing as were the other dancers. What inspired me to return to dancing was the scene with the seniors doing ballet. It showed to a non dancer that it is never to late to follow your heart and maybe take up a dream you had as a youngster. Choreography was great, I enjoyed watching to process and dedication required to get the show done. This film touches the soul, if not then no film can. The story is good but the dancing is awesome. Its a shame that the film did not get picked up my a major studio I think they really lost out. Great job , well worth buying this movie.
