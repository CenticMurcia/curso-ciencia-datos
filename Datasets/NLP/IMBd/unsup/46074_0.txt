I just don't want to see this WWII settled stories and concept of enemy movies anymore. Filmed a thousand times its just outdated and basically no longer funny or inventive. Even the gags are always the same, sorry.<br /><br />To be fair: in this movie the characters are nice - anyway. Surely it is worth to watch it (maybe just once). It's simple shallow entertainment with mainly war related indicated gags which kids presumably cannot understand. I've no idea whether children will enjoy it, apart from the cute little birds. Technical it is a pleasure thoroughly: well designed lively figures with rims and weakness and some fine flight scenes.
