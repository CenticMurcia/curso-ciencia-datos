Just as they are about to start their retired life, a couple has to take custody of 3 grandchildren, as their son and daughter-in-law have died in a car crash. The pain of the loss of their estranged child overtakes the shock of retirement postponed. A tribute to love (for the sacrifice) and human courage and love (for making it work). It is sometimes too close to home - for anyone who sees all aspects. But that won't stop you from admiring all actors, not just Keith and Gaunt. The supporting roles do not just reflect the incredible amount of talent for UK comedies, but also the reality of life: it goes on, outsiders will help you see the upside.
