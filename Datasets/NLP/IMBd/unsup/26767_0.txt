Stanley Tucci and Campbell Scott did well with this indie/art-house flick about two Italian brothers who attempt to save their restaurant business by organizing a big night to help get the word out. The film is written very well by Joseph Tropiano and Stanley Tucci, the direction fits and is a bit atmospheric, capturing the feel of the people. The cinematography was right on and done very well by Ken Kelsch. I liked the editing as well as the cast, Ian Holm was amazing, while Tony Shalhoub casted well here and not over-the-top, Stanley Tucci shows why he is underrated, with a good performance here. Marc Anthony, Liev Schreiber and Isabella Rossellini were all good in supporting roles while i didn't like Minnie Driver here (she was much better in good will hunting). All in all, a good meaningful film.---IMDb Rating: 7.1, my rating 9/10
