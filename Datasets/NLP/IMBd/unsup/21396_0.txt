Angus is a beautiful movie. Although it sounds like an overused storyline, (outcast who is not accepted by peers), this movie does a lot with it. Charlie Talbert is genuinely believable and Kathy Bates and George C. Scott are fine in their roles. James Van Der Beek is great in his role as the villain. The movie has some good plot turns as well. If you go see this movie, you will truly enjoy it. **** out of ****.
