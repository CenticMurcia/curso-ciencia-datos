They don't make movies like this one anymore.<br /><br />Simple concept: two people with messed up childhoods fall in love and go on a killing spree.<br /><br />However, with great imagery and styles used to execute many of the scenes, Natural Born Killers stands out quite a bit.<br /><br />The great performances were one reason this movie did so well. The soft-spoken, poetic, bi-polar psycho Mickey Knox was expertly played by Woody Harrelson. Juliette Lewis went all out here playing Mallory, the traumatized, angry lover of Mickey. Robert Downey Jr. gave one of his best performances here as Wayne Gale, the Australian news-reporter who blows the Knox's killing spree way out of proportion. Tommy Lee Jones gave an award-winning show as Warden McClusky, the bi-polar, crazy, eccentric prison warden. Tom Sizemore was very good as Detective Jack Scagnetti, the crazy Detective who chases after the Knox's.Rodney Dangerfield really helped steal the show as Ed Wilson, Mallory's drunken abusive father. Russell Means was very well cast as the Old Indian who helps Mickey and Mallory. There were also a lot of great side-performances by Dale Dye, Lanny Flaherty, Steven Wright, Richard Lineback, Kirk Baltz, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Edie McClurg, Sean Stone, Everett Quinton, Arliss Howard, and O-Lan Jones.<br /><br />The camera-work was especially good and nauseating at the same time, just how it seems to have meant to be.<br /><br />The music score was very well put together as well.<br /><br />All of these elements made this movie very enjoyable, unfortunately I felt the plot was pretty thin. However, that didn't stop me from enjoying this.<br /><br />8/10
