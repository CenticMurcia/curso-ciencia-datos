This is probably the best performance you'll see by Warren William--a very popular leading man in the early to mid 1930s but who has been all but forgotten today. And, since he's no longer a household name, it's not surprising that this film is very much unknown.<br /><br />This story is based on a real individual named Ivar Kreuger, who tried to corner the world market on matches by being about the most unscrupulous and power-hungry man of his day. The film concerns the many ways he shows that down deep he has no soul and there is no sin beyond him if it gains him more money and power.<br /><br />William is exceptional in the role and the film is fascinating from start to finish. Considering the film is about matches, it must have taken considerable writing, acting and directing talents to produce such a captivating film.
