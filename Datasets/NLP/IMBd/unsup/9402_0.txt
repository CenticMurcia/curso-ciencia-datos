Just watched this, the second of Boris Karloff's collaborations with producer Val Lewton, on YouTube. Karloff plays General Nikolas Pherides who is visiting, with American reporter Oliver Davis (Marc Cramer), a Greek isle in which his wife was buried. Turns out the graves were opened with many bodies burned due to the war situation. Also there is a plague that causes a quarantine of the house the General and Davis are staying in which also houses a man named Albrecht (Jason Robards, Sr.), an army physician named Dr. Drossos (Ernst Deutsch), a married couple (Alan Napier and Katherine Emery), a superstitious woman named Madame Kyra (Helene Thimig), and a beautiful young woman named Thea (Ellen Drew) who takes care of the invalid named Mary St. Aubyn played by Ms. Emery. I'll stop there and just say what a compellingly atmospheric drama this was especially near the end. Karloff himself plays a much more sympathetic role whose decent into partial madness is understandable here. Everyone else here also provide their own moments. Director Mark Robson, like other Lewton filmmakers Jacques Tourneur and Robert Wise, provides just the right touch of suspense to keep one riveted. So on that note, I highly recommend Isle of the Dead.
