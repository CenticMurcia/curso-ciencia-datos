In August, 1939, a worker has an abortion while working in a slaughterhouse and dies. The deformed baby is dumped in a garbage container and found by a beggar later, who brings him home. Along the years, the freak creature called Thomas is raised by the Hewitt family in spite of having psychological problems, working in a meat plant. In July, 1969, when the facility is closed, the inhabitants move to other places, but the deformed insane Thomas kills the foreman. His deranged stepfather executes the sheriff that is going to arrest Thomas, and assumes his identity, wearing his clothes, driving his car though the roads in Texas and entitling himself as Sheriff Hoyt (R. Lee Ermey). Meanwhile, the brothers Eric (Matt Bomer) and Dean (Taylor Handley) are traveling in a Jeep with their girlfriends Christie (Jordana Brewster) and Bailey (Diora Baird), Eric to serve in Vietnam and Dean escaping to Mexico. When the group has a car accident, Hoyt arrests Eric, Dean and Bailey and brings them to his house. Christie follows them trying to rescue the trio, trapped in the house of sadistic and insane cannibals, in a trip of horror and gore.<br /><br />"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning" is a great prequel to the classic "Texas Chainsaw Massacre". The story gives a good explanation to the origins of Leatherface, "the ugliest thing ever seen", and the movie is extremely violent and gore, with touches of surrealism. R. Lee Ermey has a great performance in the role of the deranged leader of the Hewitt Family. I had a very low expectation with this film and in the end I had a very pleasant surprise. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "O Massacre da Serra Elétrica: O Início" ("The Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning")
