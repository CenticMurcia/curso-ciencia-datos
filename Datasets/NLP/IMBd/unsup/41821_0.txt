Lauterhouse," affectionately referred to as "slaughterhouse" by its owner Devin Lauter (played by the director, who should have stayed hidden behind the camera!), is a big SoCal mansion on a secluded plot of prime real estate. Devin wants it converted over to a bed and breakfast, but the sadistic ghost of his late uncle, a former stage magician, keeps killing off whoever enters. <br /><br />Paranormal researcher Agnes Goldberg (Judy Tatum) is hired to photograph and exorcize the ghost and organizes a team of paranormal experts that include her "mental medium" husband Felix (Rob Zapple), "psychic medium" Whitney O'Shay (Kathleen Bailey) and sexy video-tech Ginger KoWOWski (Linnea Quigley), plus three low-grade rent-a-cops for protection. Naturally, things don't go as planned when Uncle Avery (J.P. Leubsen, the creepy guy from WITCHBOARD) starts to use his powers to kill everyone off.<br /><br />Looking for some of the worst amateur acting and dialogue ever to hit the small screen? Then look no further! Tatum and Bailey make Ben Stein look like Laurence Olivier! Also with a showerhead through a neck, a black character when threatens, "I'll tapdance on your face like Bojangles Robinson!," a fat voyeur groundskeeper, an exploding head, blood that looks suspiciously like Cherry Kool-Aid, Tenney's trademark AWFUL wisecracks, Linnea in the shower, a possession, a human meltdown and much, much more. It's all delirious fun! I've never laughed so hard in my life! In fact, everytime I see this for sale, I pick up a copy to give to one of my friends as a gag gift. <br /><br />I would rate this a 9 for laughs and entertainment value and I give it some credit because the plot is actually competent (even if much of the dialogue is not), but going by the craftsmanship, it's a generous...<br /><br />Score: 3 out 10.
