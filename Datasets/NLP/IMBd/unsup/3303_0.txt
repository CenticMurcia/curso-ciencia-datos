This is not a film for those who think movies should be completely literal. This is not a film for those who want to be told what to think. This is not a film for those who want a nice neat ending resolving all the issues of the world. It is a film for those who seek out truth and are willing to face it regardless of what it may be.<br /><br />This is a journey into the mind of a terrorist. It's a chance to ask yourself, "How would I act were I forced to live in that world?" I can imagine this movie will get many violent responses in the negative as it forces you to look in the mirror. The movie is not meant to represent Manilla per se, but all places of unbearable poverty and the harsh attitudes such cruel reality breeds. The goal of this movie is to make you think and in that it works wonderfully and brilliantly, changing your perspective and leaving you with questions you never knew needed to be answered.<br /><br />The closest film I can think of to this one is "Men with guns", another piece of brilliant film-making that paints a point of view. Commentary films will never have mass appeal but there is a fine meal to devour here if you have an appetite for the truth.
