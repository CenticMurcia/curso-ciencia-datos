This movie just meanders around in the woods for awhile, much like the cast, and then ends.<br /><br />I like Gary Oldman and I have to admit the other actors did a good job. The movie was very well done, cinematically and directorialy, however, it just didn't go anywhere. And, at least for me, there were a few important points that needed a bit more explanation.<br /><br />Like why was the little girl locked up? It had something to do with her mother and someone having offended God, I think, but otherwise you just have to guess.<br /><br />And, what happened to Gary Oldman's dog? <br /><br />I found the characters hard to warm up to. I just didn't care what happened to any of them. I can't really recommend this as some sort of underrated masterpiece. It isn't.
