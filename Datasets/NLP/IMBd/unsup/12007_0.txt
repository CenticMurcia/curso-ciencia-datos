Just rented this on Netflix because a friend had recommended it. It's not your typical...well anything. It's part horror, part comedy, part Marx Brothers, Coen Brothers, John Waters. And it's pretty good, especially if you like zany off the wall stuff. In many ways, it's groundbreaking...foreshadowing the confluence of horror and comedy that's so popular now (i.e. Scary Movie). Vic Dunlop is a stand up comedy legend, having worked the stages of NY and LA and having taught many of today's hot shot comedians. It's really interesting to see him in an earlier incarnation on screen rather than onstage. Worth a look, especially for fans of wacky comedies and movies that are just different.
