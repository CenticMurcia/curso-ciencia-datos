It's my old habit that whenever I post some comment I like to discuss the main characters character. According to me, if the actor portrays the character in question, he has done a very good job. Script, music, dialogues also count a lot on the success of the movie.<br /><br />1) Nagya or Nagesh Babu: played by director himself. Personally I don't think he did a good job. He look too settled for the prison life. Also when he tried to talk English, we could easily see that he can speak better and he was only pretending to be good. 2) Jaggu dada: played by Jakie Shroff. His character was really good. His acting also matched his character. 3) Ishan: played by Nasseruddin Shah. Now, in this movie, his character is supposed to be of a playboy. A dude who can score with women easily. But from his built, looks and age, he doesn't look very strong down there!!!! One thing is sure that he talks very good. As mohan says `too much of a smooth talker'. If only they had chosen a dude who was younger... 4) Chandrika: Played by Juhi Chawla. Of all her movies, I think in this movie she perfectly portrayed her character. It was simply unbeatable performance. She plays the simple wife who can cook and 'once a while'. But also has a rebellious nature which we get to see during the later half of the movie. This change was good. In general any actor/actress who can change their character according the flow of the movie is considered great. 5) Chandrika Husband: His acting was also good. Though he doesn't have many scenes but in the few he has got, he has done a good job. He plays a husband who likes liquor and TV. And of course someone who can't get it up!!!!!!!!!! I liked the scene where after having intercourse with chandrika he says: `If only you were a little more attractive, I wouldn't have so much trouble'!!<br /><br />6) mohan: Played by Gulshan Grover. Simple role. Played well by Grover.<br /><br />6) Chief justice dude: This dude has got only 2 scenes, but powerful acting.<br /><br />Overall a good movie to watch, but lot of adult scenes, and of some scenes /dialogues which are considered a taboo in hindi movies. Also, no songs!!!!!!!now very few bolly wood movies have no songs in it! Personally I think there should have been 2 songs which would lengthen the movie and we could've understood the characters better. I rate it 8/10
