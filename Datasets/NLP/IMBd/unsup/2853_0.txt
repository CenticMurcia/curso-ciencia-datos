I would just like to say that this movie was great,but you don't have to take my word for it,I not gonna spoil nutin. O.k but I gotta say this,I did not know that Lenny was a real person, Ha,Ha...<br /><br />I always heard Eddie Murphy say "Hey Lenny Bruce, Man.." and it was funny to me the way he said it. Later on,after trying to find something on TV I saw this movie and was like "oh,this is Lenny Bruce". I was thinking that all this time it was a name Eddie made up. Now it looks like this was his own way of giving Lenny his props or just dues.<br /><br />So just to add some extra lines to this thing rent this movie,buy this movie or when you see Dustin shake his hand,and tell him good job.
