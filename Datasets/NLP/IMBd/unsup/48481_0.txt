As soft porn erotica for soft porn erotica sake goes, this isn't a bad production. Obligatory hunks prancing around a remote seaside Roman political refugee camp in their diapers and assorted battle garb, these boys have too much time on their hands, so Roman sexual behavior being what it was in those days, there's a fair amount of male-male hanky panky going on plus the main story of the task master guard in(unrequited)love with the Christian pretty boy movie namesake: Sebastiane.<br /><br />Well after much nothing but fondling and slo-mo body contact the story progresses to the grand finale which is obviously a play on our hero's name in relationship to biblical characters. Don't wanna have too many spoilers here, but if you have some time to kill and nothing better to do, might as well see what 30+ year old gay films passed off as historical drah-mah is all about.
