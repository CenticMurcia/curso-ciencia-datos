Sadly enough, this new Highlander film, the 5th if you are keeping track. made it's television debut on the Sci-Fi channel. Good effort made, but it felt and looked like a made for TV movie anyway. Adrian Paul does a credible performance, but all others seem to lack to acting chops. Funny enough is the vague references to the original Highlander but this episode fails to compete in the continuity compartment. According the official H:Sourse website, this is the first of a new trilogy...well if they move ahead with the other two, you can be sure they will be made for TV or straight to DVD releases. Highlander: The Source may have a chance with repeat viewings when it gets released on DVD.
