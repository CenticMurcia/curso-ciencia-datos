I have never seen a movie like that. Not only the acting of the player is perfect but also it is almost unbelievable that none had every acted before. There is substantial number of new movies in Turkish cinema but Karpuz kabugundan gemiler yapmak is certainly among one of the three best movies played in the last decades.<br /><br />What is so said is that Turkish film industry keeps using some useless actors and actresses instead of the players of this movie. The director gave them a good chance to show themselves somehow and they did great job and I can't fathom why they have not been asked for any other movie. I could not help saying that shame on those who are not able to make use of these new players' talent in Turkish movie industry. No wonder why we do not have a good movie industry any more. Just think you producers let me say lastly....
