As with Max Von Sidow's "Joubert" in "Three Days Of The Condor, Robert Duvall's John J. Anderson lives a life of opposites. He seeks meaning in a life where he takes other lives without meaning. He seeks passion where his work does not allow it. As Joubert is deeply committed to his grandchildren, Anderson is to his adopted families wherever he finds them and, if only temporarily, to the fabric of life that accompany them.<br /><br />The movie leaves unresolved issues; what becomes of Manuela, her son, her friends and the fantasy-life of Tango they live in, all of whom Anderson has quickly come to love to the extent he can. What becomes of Miguel and Orlando who recruited him. It is part of the ambiguity of Anderson's life, stepping on and off the stage that he must continually leave these and similar accounts open, yet he adds meaning to the lives of others and they his as he passes through....and as he takes lives.<br /><br />This is a movie in an older and more sophisticated style. What is left out is not omission but rather is left to the viewer to ponder. The movie is not satisfying and is not intended to be. It is, however, compelling and worth seeing.
