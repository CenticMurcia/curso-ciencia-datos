My brothers and I loved this movie the first time we saw it at the drive-in theater in Commack, Long Island, NY. In 1971 we were 13, 12 and 10 years old. We were also fanatical Charlton Heston fans. In hindsight, we probably were the targeted demographic, given the cheesy dialog, poor production values and extreme violence of his movies. The "Planet Of The Apes" movie series whetted our appetite for Mr Heston's over-emoting and small weapons mastery. Then, "Omega Man" and "Soylent Green" came out with one year of each other. Both gave new meaning to the term "Christ Complex". SPOILER ALERT: The sight of his bullet ridden body at the end of the film in crucifixion pose gave us chills. Years later when we learned more about Chuck's far-right politics, did the scene give off a different vibe. But I digress. The guns. The hot black chick that gets down with Chuck (which again given his far-right politics, the scene now gives off a different vibe). Those crazy white faced, red-eyed zombies in their black bathrobes. What's not to love about this movie!? The perfect bookend to this movie is "Soylent Green", another dark futuristic thriller. Enjoy!
