Quite simply the best RPG ever developed by Squaresoft. Amazing visuals, brilliant story of love, hate and war, plus believable characters. It surpasses Final Fantasy VII by a long shot. Squall Leonheart has been called an 'unlikeable character' but he has issues we can all relate with. Rinoa is simply beautiful and a great heroine. A great cast of back up characters adds to the brilliant depth of the story. Well done Squaresoft.
