"Rollercoaster" director James Goldstone's "When Time Ran Out," with Paul Newman, William Holden, Edward Albert, Ernst Borgnine, Veronica Hamel, Red Buttons, and Jacqueline Bisset, qualifies as just another Irwin Allen disaster movie. By this time, Allen's disaster movies had been nothing but disasters. While this one boasts a terrific cast, "When Time Ran Out" amounts to a tiresome bore. Interestingly enough, this was Irwin Allen's final theatrical feature film.<br /><br />The action occurs on an island that suspiciously resembles a cross-between of Hawaii and a studio backlot set. A papier-mâché volcano smolders ominously in the background for most of the film until it erupts. Sadly, the Carl Foreman & Stirling Silliphant screenplay, based on Gordon Thomas & Max Morgan Witt's novel "The Day the World Ended," never erupts.<br /><br />Oil man Hank Anderson (Paul Newman) warns tycoon Shelby Gilmore (William Holden), Kay Kirby (Jacqueline Bisset), and everybody else booked in Holden's luxury resort motel to clear out while the getting's good. Bob Spangler (James Franciscus) claims that Anderson doesn't know what he's talking about. Spangler insists that the volcano won't blow. Not surprisingly, the volcano does blow, and Gilmore along with a host of others escape to higher ground after crossing a rugged obstacle course. In one scene, they must traverse a rickety old bridge over a stream of molten lava.<br /><br />If you've seen one disaster movie, you've seen them all. This muddled epic bristles with cardboard characters, predictable scripting (by two really good writers) and phony special effects. As for the title, Allen should have altered it. Time doesn't run out in "When Time Ran Out," it drags out!
