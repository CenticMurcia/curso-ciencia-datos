As awful as this is as a piece of film-making, it is pure comedy gold. The entire production reeks of egotism and pomposity, and the whole thing is amplified by the fact that nobody involved seems to realize how outrageous the whole thing is. The whole thing is really a tribute to Shatner's massive ego- though, to be fair, he does seem to have a sense of humour about the whole thing. Even the title is a pompous and pointless misspelling (how is "Spplat" pronounced differently than "Splat"?).<br /><br />I should add that the advertisements for "Creative Light Entertainment" that come before the movie starts are even funnier than "Spplat Attack" itself.
