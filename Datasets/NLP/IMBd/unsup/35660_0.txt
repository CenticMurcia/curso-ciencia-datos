Being one of John Carpenters biggest fans, I am usually very biased when it comes to rating his movies (I loved Escape from LA). However, I just could not get into this movie. It moves very slow and the screenplay is horrible. It tried to he a horror movie, but what was scary about it? NOTHING. Donald Pleasance gives a fine performance (as usual) but the rest of the cast is below average at best. This movie just does not pack the punch that JC's other movies do. I gave this movie a 3 out of 10 rating, and that was because I could not give JC a rating of 1 (even if the movie sucked).
