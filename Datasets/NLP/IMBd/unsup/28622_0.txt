This film makes a good marathon movie with other similar themes:<br /><br />Inherit the wind The Prisoner TV series<br /><br />It seems most movies are essentially epitomized by this film for this reason:<br /><br />Persecution. Be it FOR religion or AGAINST religion. The protagonist/antagonist style which is predominant is EXPERTLY posed here with Alec Guinness playing another brilliant role. This character is the opposite of the character he played in "The man in the white suit" BUT the theme is similar.<br /><br />In todays world the ethnicity is still a root persecution that leads to a lot of violence. This movie shows what should be avoided, but in recent news even the contrast in Iraq is highlighted within the controlled confines of a safe Movie environment. WE know the actors are compensated and safe... The stereotypes they portray seem to be Perennial and eternal...<br /><br />The end line can be said of ANYONE anytime, anyplace, any age.<br /><br />A timeless classic from a time when events moved slower. Todays movies move much faster which do not allow our children to absorb the real humanity pictures like these embody.<br /><br />I am a more aware man for having seen this film, and it allows my to deal with bullies I have encountered in real life who on buses will try to play the inquisitor in a menacing fashion, even though here in America we are supposed to be free of this interaction.<br /><br />There are classic interactions that are highlighted and should not be missed.
