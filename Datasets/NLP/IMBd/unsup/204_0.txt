If you liked 'Ringu' and 'Carrie', you're gonna love this. I just saw it and I think I like it even better than Ringu (but it would be close). It's moodier and sadder than Ringu, but that 'bone cracking' sequence near the end crawled so deep under my skin that it makes me shiver just thinking about it! Great acting (the lead actress is as great as she is cute), great music, great direction.
