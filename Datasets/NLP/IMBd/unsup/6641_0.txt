This is THE most horrible movie I have ever seen. I know, I know, I probably have better chances at spotting obvious locational goofs, but seriously. THAT IS A CZECH FLAG IN THE BEGINNING ON THE ROYAL BUILDING (or whatever it was)! But come on people! 4/10 ?! I'm disgusted. The plot is so thin it's crazy. Not to mention the acting! But seriously, the research done before this film is hilarious. Denmark is presented as a kind of royal dictatorship. At some point, and ancient law is brought out from our ancient royal library. Actually, it's 5000 years old.....Becaaaause, we even had writing, laws, let alone a king at the time?! I could go on and on about this nauseating piece of.....argh!! damn that swear filter! Seriously, though, if you REALLY want a shocking movie experience, watch one of the pirated Chinese DVDs with "Engrish" subtitles. That'll render you utterly incapable of understanding what this movie is about.<br /><br />Have a nice day and do NOT watch this unless you really like bad movies.
