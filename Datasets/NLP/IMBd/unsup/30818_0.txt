it seems incredible how this show took all the elements of the prequel trilogy and somehow made them.. good. this show is proof that the prequels didn't have to be the mess they were. it captures the humor, awe-inspiring action and pure awesomeness of the original trilogy and puts it in prequel context. finally the complexity of the relationship between anakin and obi wan can be appreciated. anakin is no longer simply an impatient, silly person. grevious is actually threatening. the battle droids are actually funny! 3PO is... not as annoying! at least he's not worried about coming up with puns in the midst of deadly situations this time around. tyrannous and sidious can be seen as truly intelligent and malicious conspirators. the wookie planet isn't gimmicky. the battle sequences are brilliantly massive and surprising. the jedi tactics are staggering. i could adjectivize this thing all day. bottom line: forget the prequels ands remember this as the true old days of star wars. if only.
