Great flick, mainly because of the acting. Uma Thurman, Gena Rowlands and Juliette Lewis were perfect in their roles, very well cast and so emotionally dead-on. That bar scene was murder, an emotional wasteland. I was only slightly disappointed with the direction and script. It seemed like things were a little too telegraphed and heavy-handed. When the two girls are walking on the railroad where the tracks meet they are "at a crossroads." Ugh, hit me again. Then, when someone is about to meet a terrible end, we see a long shot with a lot of weird light. Just a little too obvious.<br /><br />But I digress too much on the downside. Overall, a fantastic movie, makes me miss the 80s and be glad they're over all at the same time.<br /><br />9 out of 10
