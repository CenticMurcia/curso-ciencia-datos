As many of these other reviews have stated that a lot of the footage of this film is Benji running, it's true and it is really boring. Who wants to watch a mutt run through the streets of Greece for an hour? My family watched this movie together and my brother, who is 8 and loves animals dearly, even admitted that the movie was terrible! I do not see how these other people would want to watch this movie. Kids will not like this movie because nothing happens! But at least it is not Borat or whatever . . .<br /><br />Other people have said that this movie is kid friendly, wrong! At the end of this movie people are held at point blank range with all sorts of guns by mafia like hit-men.<br /><br />This Movie is really bad!
