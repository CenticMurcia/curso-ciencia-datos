There are only a few book to movie adaptations, I hate and this was one of them. My lordy lord lord,VC Andrews must be spinning in her grave,this is an abomination to her fabulous Dollanganger series. "Flowers in the Attic" was the first of her books I read and I was watching the VH1 TV show "I Love the 80's" and they mentioned that this was made in 1984. So I went out and bought it. Wish I could get my money back,this is so not like the movie. It is so no like the book,they cut back so much. If you read her books do not see this movie .<br /><br />The acting is done horribly and they twisted the ending so badly,the mother doesn't die until the fourth book or something,I can't recall
