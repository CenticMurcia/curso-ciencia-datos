This movie was too sicken for words. It was unrealistic and the man character fit his name in the movie, "stupid". I really enjoy the character who portrayed Jiya. Her interactions were the highlight of the movie. Once we went back to the other female, the movie tanked. Don't bother spending your money for the movie.....he dumps jiya and goes back to the other one. And how he proposes is ridicules. Jiya causes a scene during their engagement party accusing the other girl of loving her finance and her finance loving her. Then she demands to know what he feels for her, and he goes and dumps the red powder on her head and proclaims her his wife. Then everyone sings and dances and accepts his choice, at jiya's father house. What nonsense!!!
