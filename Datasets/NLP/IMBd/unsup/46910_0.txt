It seems in recent years, the company known as National Lampoon seems to be obsessed with flooding DVD shelves with terrible movies aimed at college kids. One of their more recent releases (although the IMDb says it was made in 2003) is Jake's Booty Call, an animated comedy using two-dimensional computer animation not unlike that used in South Park, but still with the characters looking like cardboard cutouts.<br /><br />Based on an Internet cartoon series, Jake's Booty Call is about a 20-something skirt chaser named Jake, whom speaks in broken urban slang, looks stoned throughout the film, and has a grin that never seems to go away and borders on looking disturbing. He seems to have an ego that would anger Kevin Federline and uses pick-up lines that are beyond corny, yet he does appear to score with women. His new friend, Siton, is not so lucky. In fact, it turns out that Siton is a prince of a fictional European country who can't seem to lose his virginity. Jake and Siton set out to go skirt chasing in some domestic and foreign locales, while Siton's evil brother, Lickapon, and his thugs follow their every move.<br /><br />God, this movie is bad. From the plot to the humor, JBC is terrible. The only thing remotely decent about this film is the animation, but that's about it. All through this movie, I wanted to beat Jake within an inch of his life for being such an obnoxious, over-the-top character. All of the film's jokes either fall flat or are on the level of grade school children. I can honestly say I've seen better writing on an average Adult Swim show in contrast.<br /><br />In short, avoid JBC. It is truly a waste of valuable time and money.
