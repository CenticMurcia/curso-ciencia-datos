As a fan of extreme cinema, I decided to buy Cannibal Holocaust to see how far it truly goes. Although it cost Â£18.99, I decided to buy it anyway because I heard it also featured Deodato's other film House On The Edge Of The Park, a film which I had heard quite a bit of hype about. Having watched them both, I have to say that by comparison, Cannibal Holocaust felt like an absolute masterpiece. Normally, I can watch B-movies and even enjoy them, but HOTEOTP bored me to death. There is actually nothing of merit. The razor cuts looked like Biro marks. And as for the acting...it was like watching a porn movie without the porn (except for a few scenes...) I was expecting a whole lot but received so little. There seriously is no redeeming quality whatsoever, and I advise fans of shock films, horrors, thrillers or whatever other sub-genre this film has masqueraded as to steer well clear of this faecal abomination.
