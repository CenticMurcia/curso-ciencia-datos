I still love this movie! I remember falling in love with Rex (I was 13!) and thinking that he was it for me!! I had the biggest crush on him for years! I guess deep down in, I still do! He's still sexy. I bought the movie just a couple of years ago, and now from time to time, watch it and fall in love again!! He has been in a few different shows, even a soap opera, but nothing he has done will match what he did for me in Sooner or Later! I can't imagine the 13-year old girls of today not watching this movie, and not feeling like I did when I saw it for the first time. I know that when you watch it several things are definitely 70's, but still..he's Rex and he's eternally hot!
