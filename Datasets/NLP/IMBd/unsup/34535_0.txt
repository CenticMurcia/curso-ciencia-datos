Witless romp featuring Gregory Peck as a sports-writer who has a whirlwind courtship with fashion guru Lauren Bacall, leading to a quick trip to the altar. CinemaScope fluff directed by a water-treading Vincente Minnelli does allow Peck to loosen up for a change, but the screenplay seems to have been written around the opportunities for mini-fashion shows (indeed, costumer Helen Rose devised the movie's premise, which helped win a Best Screenplay Oscar for writer George Wells). It's very slow on laughs until the amusing farcical conclusion. Peck and Bacall are not quite the sparkling romantic duo they're meant to be, nor is the lackluster supporting cast any help. Good to look at, perhaps, but certainly not memorable. *1/2 from ****
