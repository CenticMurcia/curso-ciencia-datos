I considered this a poor and basic movie, why? Well, the story is very poor, the cast is very poor and the shooting is also poor. For starters the plot begins with the final scene which is something I really find irritating, however, many good movies do that...Anyway, the whole movie centers around a crime which is investigated in a very pointless way and very little happens besides that, except for a few needless sex scenes... The cast didn't help either, sometimes it felt like an amateur movie, the main character was OK and the police detective was funny but the rest was very bad. I didn't like the way the movie was shot either, nothing new here and I felt the camera could have transmitted a much better idea and feeling with a bit more effort.<br /><br />I stress the word basic and not simple because simple things can be very beautiful and interesting, however, this movie has no depth, explores the drug world in a futile way and as a detective story it did not convince me.<br /><br />I didn't give it a lower vote because with all its flaws it still entertained me for a while (it was a Sunday night).
