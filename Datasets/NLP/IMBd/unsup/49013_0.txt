Holden had a great eye for a good script and always chose interesting three-dimensional characters and interesting situations. Other than this one, that is. Terribly dated and talky psychological drama that goes nowhere slow. One can only think Holden was forced to work on this picture, which hits you over the head with salvo after salvo of predictable psuedo-psychological double talk and laughable explorations into "hidden traumatic childhood incidents" intended to sensitively explicate present behavior in painfully simplistic terms. There is much unintentional laughter, but this is not a fun or funny movie. The great Lee J. Cobb is particularly wasted in a do-nothing part. Do yourself a favor and go rent BRIDGE ON THE RIVER KWAI or SUNSET BOULEVARD or STALAG 17 and put this psychobabble snoozefest back on the shelf.
