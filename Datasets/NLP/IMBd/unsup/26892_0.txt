who know little about the battle for Iwo Jima. It is almost like 2 separate movies in one. You have one part centered around the men who rose the flag and their life in the US afterwards. They are celebrated as heroes. The other part shows flashbacks of the fighting in the Pacific. I like war movies, so I liked those parts best. The war scenes were realistic and well filmed.<br /><br />The acting was pretty good, but this is not Clint Eastwood's best film. I have liked other war films better but this one is entertaining enough to watch.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: If you like war movies, then don't miss this.
