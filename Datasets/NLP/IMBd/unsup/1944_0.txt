The sexy shark swam on by, catching me by the eye. A rose for it I had to buy. . . f*ck it. This movie is the dumbest, foulest, arse sponge that ever floated to the top of my urinal. It made me jump once, but with one swift bowel movement it sunk again where it belongs, at the bottom of the sea.<br /><br />P.S. Australian on a boat SHOULD be drinking. if on boats at all. . .infact forget the boat.<br /><br />Also, "Open the hatch." is a guaranteed pick up line.<br /><br />This movie isn't worth ten lines.<br /><br />It isn't worth five. *padding out to ten lines COMPLETE*
