This energetic series of mini episodes is surprisingly faithful to the spirit and look of the live action prequels without deviating from the Cartoon Network's bouncy, anime-ish style. The character design, uncannily accurate voice work and fluid animation are all cracking, and it's fun to see the cartoon's events tie in to 'Episode III', while the majority of the action is spirited and inventive. Odd, then, that the series' major weakness is that there's too much going on, too much action and not enough quiet spots, which makes for a rather relentless and one-note viewing experience when it's not broken up into its original chapters. Still, it's an absorbing enough spin-off. No match for the real thing, though.
