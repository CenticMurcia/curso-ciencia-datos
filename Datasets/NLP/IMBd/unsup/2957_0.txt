Is anybody besides me getting burned out on low budget "homages" to other low budget "homages" ? <br /><br />Take everything you've ever seen in a spoof about horror movies, minus a decent budget, add talentless writers directors and actors and add a "we're so hip check this out wink wink nudge nudge" tone to the movie and you have hide and creep. Oh, if you can't get Stephen King, Clive Barker, Quentin Tarantino, or Robby Rodriguez just get the guy that did Clerks and Dogma to throw a stupid blurb on the DVD cover. Everyone cares what he thinks, right...?<br /><br />This movie wasn't even funny in a stupid kind of way. Stay away from this dog.
