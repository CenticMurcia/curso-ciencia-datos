This movie was absolutely the best werewolf movie ever made! It was so good, that, if I didn't have a short attention span, I would watch it back-to-back every day!<br /><br />First of all, the acting, once again, was superb. Emily Perkins does a wonderful job as Brigitte, and the new character, Ghost, was perfect, although her lines seemed a little too rehearsed. <br /><br />I really like the dark humor in it, once again. I like movies that can be dramatic, somewhat scary, and funny all at once (all movies should be!). I don't know how people can say that they don't like this movie. I do!<br /><br />The ending, where Ghost traps the transforming Brigitte in her cellar, and then welcomes her grandma home, is perfectly dark. I kinda think it's mean that she wants to hurt her grandma, but it goes with the plot. I especially like the very end, when she's reading the comic, and she says something like, "And off she went on her reign of terror, to vanquish her mortal enemies, of which there were many."<br /><br />I don't know why I like it so much, it's just perfect.
