My love of the Airwolf Television series is based on what great TV is all about: meaningful writing, strong characters, justice and a beautiful helicopter. I loved the music and the drama. I found my- self drawn to the TV set every Saturday night when Airwolf was on CBS. Some episodes were better than others but none of them disappointed me. I wanted the show to go on forever. Of course that is unrealistic. Still, when I met the helicopter in Van Nuys, CA in 1986 I was so honored and overwhelmed. "The Lady" will live in my heart forever. <br /><br />Edward Eugene Smith The Lion of Yelm Washington State, USA
