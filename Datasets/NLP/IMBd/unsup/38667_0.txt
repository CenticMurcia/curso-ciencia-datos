I have no idea why this movie has a higher rating then House 3 (a.k.a The Horror Show) which is actually quite good. .<br /><br />House 2 is on the other hand is quite possibly one on the worst horror sequels you will ever see, if you don't believe me then try watching it..<br /><br />1/5<br /><br />IMO the original House and House 3 are the only good movies in the entire series.
