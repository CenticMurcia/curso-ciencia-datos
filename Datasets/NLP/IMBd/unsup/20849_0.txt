I try to find humour in most things,but someone saying I'm the only gay in the village and repeating yer but no but. I admit it has me beat, I could watch it a million times and still struggle to find anything funny about it. It is about as funny as Ant and Dec are talented, and that's saying something. What is it about Little Britain people find funny, even the scene with the disabled guy is not funny. Perhaps, what I am missing, is that everything nowadays has to be politically correct so as not to offend anyone. If this is the case I can maybe understand the lack of humour in the show, perhaps what is most baffling, is how it won an award
