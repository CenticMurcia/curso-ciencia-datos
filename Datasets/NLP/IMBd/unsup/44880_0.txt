I recently watched this movie, and let me start by saying it is a step up from Talledega Nights, but a step down from Jolly Roger, simply because it just wasn't funny. The movie had no real plot, well maybe it did, but it was one of the most base, and typical teen comedies to date. Although it did have a rather contrived sub-plot which was even worse than the already almost non existent one. Plot aside, the acting was abysmal, but better than some movies I've seen in the past (some actors were worse than others). But overall this movie was abysmal, and was just one step below "Private Resort", simply because Private Resort had Johnny Depp (who went on to do great things), I'm afraid this cant be said for this movie. Spring Break 1/10...and it doesn't deserve a DVD release. It deserves to be cast into the fiery anals of hell. I got it for free and I feel cheated.
