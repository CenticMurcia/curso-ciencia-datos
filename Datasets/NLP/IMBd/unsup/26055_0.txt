Many classic scenes, Bombs Away, TV in the aquarium, Barbra's hands and heart placed just .....hovever, when the DVD company from hell released it on DVD, they censored a word that renders an entire scene meaningless.<br /><br />It was an historic word also, the first time a star had ever<br /><br />said it in a major film. F***!! The only time anyone has<br /><br />ever censored Barbra to this day! Still a great comedy!<br /><br />Sexy, funny and way ahead of its time! One of Bab's best! George's too!
