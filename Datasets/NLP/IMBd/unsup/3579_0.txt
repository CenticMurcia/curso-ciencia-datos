it's unexplicable where the serbian cinematography is going. we make or stupid black-humor comedies or bad social movies. mali svet is one that belongs to the first category. the movie hasn't no background, no construction that could hold him, the characters are tied by destiny which is very suspicious, there are many unlogical actions...it's just sad
