In this film Boyd rice plays a killer who does a few things that really hack-off the regular film viewer. He runs about for a bit shouting and acting extremely poorly, and rants on in a monologue format about his own views. in fact in one scene he quotes his own book, while pretending to be reading it from someone else's But that's not the point. - This film, to me, is excellent because of its "extreme" ideas and content. Some of which are: Nazis (don't get me wrong I hate racism), sex/BDSM, women, religion, murder and violence.<br /><br />The thoughts of Rice's character on these issues are extremely important as they relate to the target audience of this film. As most horror/thriller viewers will have at least one or two opinions as to how Nazis (don't get me wrong I hate racism), sex/BDSM, women, religion, murder and violence relate to media and how they may or may not mirror, and/or be applied to, real life.<br /><br />On the whole I think if you are interested in Nazis, sex/BDSM, Boyd's theories, feminism, or violence this will be of interest to you. However, I beg of you, think open mindedly about the film and the issues raised within, go beyond the aesthetics. No matter what your tastes dictate. - +DO NOT see this film if you get uneasy around sex scenes especially ones with such a low budget that you really do think you are watching porn. +DO NOT see this film if you are offended by neo-Nazis (Boyd Rice is NOT a neo-Nazi however his character does 'hint' at it in this film (costumes and monologues) +DO NOT see this film if you are horney (it way warp your impressionable little mind) +DO NOT see this film if you are disgusted by fecal matter +DO NOT see this film if you think the random slaughter of 'innocent' homeless people is disgusting...<br /><br />you wont be able to handle it. seriously i almost vomited at the 'fecal matter' part.
