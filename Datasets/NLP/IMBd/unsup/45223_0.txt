I watched this and was hoping for at least a few good scenes of humor, but was sadly disappointed. They did have a few short clips in the movie of some funny scenes, but very short brief stints of humor added in here or there. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't looking for this to be just a pure comedy movie. But there are about 3, maybe 4 funny scenes, the rest, even the scenes that are supposed to be the romantic scenes, drag on forever and ever. So if you have a chance to see this movie, pass unless you're renting it in the $3 rental section. It just took forever to get through watching and not really bad acting, just - well it took forever to get through the movie. lol But I suppose if you're a big fan of Aniston or McConaghy, yeah I don't know how to spell his damn name, lol, then go ahead and see this. But if you're just looking for a romantic comedy, definitely skip this slow one and find something, anything, better. Bottom-line - funny scene here or there, but seriously drowned out and drowned over by the slow-moving pace of the film. But that's just me.
