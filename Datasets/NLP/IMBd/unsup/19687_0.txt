"Peyton Place" hooks me from the first scene to the end. Every time it appears on television, I always have difficulty changing the channel.<br /><br />The movie have its share of dated trappings and mistakes (as a previous IMDb user commented, the film is set during WWII and the 50's fashions don't match the 40's setting) as well as the Hays Office mandates were still in effect, which also explains why some story lines were purposely watered-down or even censored. <br /><br />In spite of the flaws (or even because of the flaws?), many of the performances, including Lana Turner, Hope Lange, Arthur Kennedy and, especially, Lloyd Nolan as the town doctor and the voice of reason, were outstanding. (The movie was nominated for 9 Academy Awards including 5 nominations in the acting categories. Nolan should have been the 6th.)<br /><br />Beautifully photographed by William Mellor and a very memorable and still classic musical score by Franz Waxman, "Peyton Place" is an entertaining drama that still has an effect on this viewer.
