Everyone is trying to be so sophisticated with their analyses of this film - as if it's some sort of legitimate puzzle to be solved. This is not "2045" nor "8 1/2" nor "M. Hire." This is a filming of sequences of events which cannot stem from one another.<br /><br />Folks, the reason the director has no answer to the question of "what is this film about?" is that the film makes no sense. The viewer has no idea what's happening, especially at the end. What is the reality of the situation? No way to know. And no reason to care. This is food for thought? Not. This is nonsense.<br /><br />Even giving it a 'bye' for making no sense one cannot forgive the flaws in the story line. Why would Marc not show his wife the picture immediately? Why did he not try to follow her to his mother's house? What reason does he have, really, to doubt himself.<br /><br />Worse, the film, though short, drags. I thought he was on that dang ferry for a week!
