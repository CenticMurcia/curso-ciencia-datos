This movie is an extraordinary visual and a humanistic depiction of Ernesto Che Guevara. Like any biopic, there will be discrepancies. However, as a piece of film, and wax needs to do research, Che illustrates the man who fought for Cuba's people. While you may disagree with the ideology, the movie is amazing. Filmed in Puerto Rico and other amazing locations, Benicio's Che is a man with a mission from beginning to end when he is shot in Bolivia.<br /><br />I do not agree with what Che did in real life and I do not wear a Che tshirt; however, that should not prevent you from seeing this movie.<br /><br />It is easy to criticize a historical figure without understanding all sides. Please do not let a biased comment prevent you from seeing another great movie by Soderbergh and Benicio del Toro.<br /><br />Supporting roles from Catalina Sandino Moreno and Demian Bichir make this a must see. <br /><br />The editing could be improved if indeed this will be shown in two parts when as a whole, it is amazing.
