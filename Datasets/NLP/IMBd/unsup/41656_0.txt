This film has some scary, funny, and naked chick moments. Doug McClure gives a great performance with his limited ability (no offense Doug). The sea monsters, also known as humanoids, are guys in cheap costumes like the Godzilla movies. This film is not really graphic. If you can stand some blood and some guy in a sea monster suit pretending to hump a lifeless naked female for a second, then this is your film. I encourage all fans of eighties B movies to watch this one. Overall I give the film a 4/10 fair rating. The acting and plot get lame sometimes, but it is still fun.
