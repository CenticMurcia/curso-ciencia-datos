Many great films have a half a dozen (or more) copy-cats. This is one of the films that borrows, yet still stands alone in creating a revolution of beastie pictures. Gremlins, along with it's sequal are part of the "Greats", like "Jaws", "Star Wars", "Ghostbusters", among many many others. Some people don't get this dark comedy, and that's understandable. It is a mean spirited, fantasy film at times, but sometimes you laugh harder after you've been scared nearly to death. It would be wrong to deny this film it's just do. It showed, along with "Jaws", that thrillers can be fun and profitable, if you do it right. A loveable Creature named Gizmo, is brought home to Billy Peltzer, by his father, Rand. The new gift came with 3 rules. All of which Billy must abide by,and was forwarned. Billy does his best, but fails as he brakes the most important rule and lets loose hundreds of green monsters, that love to break things, and hurt people. It is a zany film, and if you haven't seen it, I don't want to give to much away. Enjoy the film, and it's sequel, which is one of the few arguably worthy sequels in film history. So check out "Gremlins."
