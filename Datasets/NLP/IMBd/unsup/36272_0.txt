Two used car lot owners, who we know nothing about, get involved with numerous shady characters, who we know nothing about, while being paid to watch a Pontiac convertible, which we know nothing about. Why would anyone be interested in a movie that explains nothing, and has zero character development? The obvious answer is you wouldn't. Throw in unending closeups of meaningless dialog, a "surprise" ending that is so ridiculous, it will leave you wondering if it didn't come from a different film, and other trivial nonsense that does nothing to explain this confused mess. Forget even considering seeing B.G.B. & O, instead seek out "Suckers", another low budget crime drama centering around a used car operation, that is absolutely brilliant. - MERK
