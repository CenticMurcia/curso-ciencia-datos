I can't recall the first time I saw this movie. It is still one of my dad's favorite movies and he's always had a copy (be it on VHS or on laser-disc, yeah he's had it that long). I guess you might say that I grew up with this movie. I rented it recently, mainly because of the nostalgic value it has for me, but remembered why I enjoyed it so much. This film is pure Americana and represents an era of American innocence. George Lucas really took some risks on this one. He made a film about cruising in the early 70s (an era that was marked by down beat films). I have to say that when Lucas was young, he had balls.<br /><br />The plot is extremely simple (but I still hope that I can do it justice). Curt (Richard Dreyfuss) and Steve (Ron Howard) have graduated from high school in southern California and are headed out east to go to college (the whole film takes place on the last night that they're in town). Their friends are Terry the Toad, the geek (Charles Martin Smith), and John Milner (the best driver in the valley, played by Paul Le Mat). The story follows the four as they cruise around town. Curt is worried about leaving town and decides he may not want to leave.<br /><br />Curt starts cruising with Steve and Laurie (Curt's sister, Steve's girlfriend)he sees a blonde in a white T-Bird, who becomes his obsession for the night after she mouths "I love you" to him. Curt goes from being with Steve and Laurie to cruising with his ex-girlfriend, to being abducted by a car gang, to finally finding disc jockey Wolfman Jack to play a song for the blonde in a white T-Bird.<br /><br />Steve decides to break up with Laurie because he's going off to college. Laurie takes it very badly (of course) and the two go through the ups and downs about their relationship through the night.<br /><br />Steve lent Terry the Toad his car for safe keeping while he's out of town. Toad cruises around and eventually picks up Debbie (Candy Clark) who normally would be way out of his league. The two get into several bizarre situations (including a liquor store hold up and having Steve's car stolen).<br /><br />John ends up having to drive around with Carol (who is probably about 13) after some girls who are cruising play a trick on him. John and Carol definitely have a love/hate relationship, but John tries to look out for Carol. John is being chased by Bob Falfa (Harrison Ford) who wants to beat him in a drag race.<br /><br />The separate stories all tie in due to the friendship shared between the four. Ultimately, the story is about going away and remembering the good times that everyone has when they're young. The epilogue really puts this theme in perspective. <br /><br />The film really could have been made about any period, but the fact that it was made about the last great period of American innocence really drives the point home that it is a film about growing up and changing. Granted, Lucas grew up during this period and was into cruising, but the setting is still essential to the theme of the movie. This period is coming to a close, for the characters because they're moving on and because of the events that would happen in the 60s. The setting is 1962. However, as I have previously stated, the film is not merely a period piece because the themes involved are timeless.<br /><br />I recommend for anyone.
