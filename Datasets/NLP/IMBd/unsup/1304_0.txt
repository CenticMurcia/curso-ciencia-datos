I wasn't very captured by the movie. The story sounded so promising. I even watched it despite the fact that I hated the art. I am a huge anime fan, and it just didn't do it for me. The relationship between Black and White was awesome, but I fell asleep because I found it so boring. I even watched the rest of it despite already not liking it. Even the art style has it's ups and downs... for something that I hated the art style for, it was animated very well. I did enjoy the colouring, and I loved the backgrounds. I suppose if you were to watch an anime for the colors and backgrounds, this would be a good one to pick.<br /><br />Oh well. It's not for everybody, or maybe even just me because my friend loved this movie to no end. (It's gonna be his birthday present.. :P )
