I had never heard of this before until I saw this on Encore late at night when I was hoping for something to fall to sleep to. It didn't work. This light hearted fast moving delight of a film kept my attention diverted, and instead of Morpheus setting in I wound up energized. Filmed in black and white, just as were so many of the movies that this film continually delivered visual echoes of throughout the length of the whole movie.<br /><br />The musical score is great, and the snappy roaring twenties patter dialog of Johnny Twennies alone make this a film worth buying on DVD - especially if you're a fan of old movies.
