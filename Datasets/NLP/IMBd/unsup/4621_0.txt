This film seems like a downer at first glance but there are some sublimely subtle comedic moments, despite the gravity of the situations. Maria Galiana is delightful in all her scenes. Too say more would be revealing too much. This film proves that "heartwarming" doesn't have to equal "schmaltzy." In fact, for some reason the melodrama reminded me of "Far From Heaven," only grittier. Ana Fernandez is like a Spanish Jennifer Jason Leigh, only with more conventional beauty (which she masks as best she can).<br /><br />Warning: Have some tissues on hand! If you liked "Central Station." you'll like this. (Or if you like this, try "Central Station.") Grade : A+.<br /><br />P.S. There's also a nice song over the end credits by late 80's/early 90's singer Neneh Cherry.
