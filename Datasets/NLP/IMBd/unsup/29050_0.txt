"Cowboy Bebop " was one of the most interesting animated show in the last years . I'm not very much into anime ,but I think that you don't need to be a anime fan to enjoy this show . First of all ,it takes place in a futuristic society ,but with film -noir /contemporary drama elements , and you could appreciate it in the music and the visual elements . The scenery have very much details ,and are very similar to the modern cities like new York . The music it's more than appropriate with many different rhythms ,all adequate with the spirit of the show . The characters are likable and mysterious , and all have a dramatic story behind them . Of course ,there are many funny parts that work very well ,and there are gags that made me laugh a lot . Even when this series it's too short (just 26 episodes) it have very much to offer . Some people consider it the best anime ever made .And it have enough merits to deserve that title .
