This movie had a collection of interesting supporting actors such as Peter Cushing, Ronald Lacey, Trevor Howard and the great Sean Connery.<br /><br />However, it completely fails on the lack of acting ability of Miles O'Keefe, who did a lot of movies of the fantasy variety before being consigned to Direct to DVD Perdition.<br /><br />The plot is that Sir Gawain has been given a year to live by the magical Green Knight, after which if he has not solved four riddles, the Green Knight can have his head. After a series of adventures rescuing a fair maiden from the magical city of Lyonese, and a battle with evil forces, Gawain has a final confrontation with the Green Knight, by which time you really and truly will not care anymore.<br /><br />Parts of this movie look good, others look kind of cheesy even for 1984.
