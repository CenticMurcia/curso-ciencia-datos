I don't normally think twice about movies that are this nauseating, but after realizing just how lame this is, I am forced to share my opinions.<br /><br />For the most part, three words can be used to describe 'Telling You', and I have already used them. Everything from the first word to the last scene was dreadful. Was this film trying to make a point about something? If it was, I totally missed it. I accidentally stumbled across this movie one night. After watching it, I tried to remember if I had ever heard anything about it before. I hadn't. This just goes to prove that it is not worth seeing.<br /><br />The plot was a disaster. What exactly was it again? All I can remember is that it mostly took place in a pizza joint. The writing was so boring, I found it almost impossible to stay awake. Scene after scene was humiliating on the actor's part. Not to mention the crew's. <br /><br />One thing that I found the most laughable, was the actors. Matthew Lilliard is able to handle more entertaining films. So why would he agree to take part in this? Hewitt, who is not one of my most favorite actresses, is "supposedly" talented, defeats that purpose for joining into this group of loser acting. I can't even begin to wonder why anybody would have the nerve to have anything to do with this film. I will commend them on one thing and only one thing. - They had the decency to not laugh in the faces of whoever thought up this garbage. <br /><br />I could rattle on and on about how much I obviously despised this film. Instead, I will let anyone who reads this, read the other comments because they are all basically the same. DON'T WHATEVER YOU DO, MAKE ANY ATTEMPT AT TRYING TO SIT THROUGH THIS.
