This movie could be forgiven if it was, say, a spin-off of "Cruel Intentions". That would make it bad, still, but not necessarily awful. However, having been linked to "American Psycho", it commits an unforgivable travesty! There is next to nothing good I can say about this movie, considering its precursor. If I had watch it in isolation, I would have assumed that the first one was similar; but I assure you it is not. Think of this is a high-budget, flashy thriller based on a murderous, whining teenage (?) girl who's planning to go into, of all things, law enforcement, and you've got the gist. It could easily have been an episode of "Law and Order : Criminal Intent", plot-wise.<br /><br />However, the budget behind this film shows: it was very pleasing to the eyes and, by forgetting its lineage, I was able to find it amusing. But it is still very disappointing.<br /><br />Films I like better: "American Psycho", which seems to have been developed by vastly superior beings, and is only related by marketing ploys, "Wild Things", which features more entertaining female psychotics and murders, "Bible Black: Lance of [...]"(its still in production, so I'm not sure of the title, but it is going to be good. It's Bible Black, after all), and even "Thursday". All of those have some of the same things, but much better executed. Plus they don't tarnish a good film's name.<br /><br />Heck, I even like "Drive" and "Mean Guns" better, although they're of a totally different genre (and most people didn't seem to like "Mean Guns", especially).<br /><br />So, don't make my mistake. Do not watch this movie. Unless you've watched everything else I've recommended, and everything else you can, and have nothing - absolutely nothing - better to do with your time.
