The basic premise of this film could have been vehicle for a thousand gags and one liners. However, this film tries to take itself a little too seriously for being touted as a comedy. There is some funny shtick buried in this film, but it is spread way too thin to be called a comedy. It does have a chance to redeem itself in the romantic category right up to the end, but literally turns its back on what the audience is expecting - No happy ending. As a result it turns a great premise into a dark comedy and reflects a sad slice of life. Instead of a dark successful comedy like 'War of the Roses', we end up with a film that falls flat. My guess is that the director tried to please everyone with this film instead of following his vision of what the film should be. The resulting film will end up doing poorly even as a DVD rental.
