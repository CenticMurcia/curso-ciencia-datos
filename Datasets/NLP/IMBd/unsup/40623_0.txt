If it were possible I would give this television series a negative number out of ten- alas I cant. I can just save someone else from being put through the awful ordeal of watching this stupid, unrealistic, repetitive, pretentious, obnoxious show. It seems this show is a home to all of the bad actors in Hollywood who cant get any other jobs. The plots are always boring, and to complicated to be portrayed in an hour properly. Vincent Denoffrio is abysmal (however is Oscar worthy compared to that thing playing his partner. I cant believe people actually enjoy these two actors. They're just annoying and phony and unwatchable. just stay away, and hopefully this show will be taken off the air forever.
