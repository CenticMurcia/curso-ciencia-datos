I Love It, I Love It, I Love It. I thought this was a Great Example of a Movie from My Favorite Company, Full Moon Pictures. It had VERY Bad acting, which View as a good Quality in a Movie. Also, for all those people that Accuse it of being a Copycat of Child's Play, I'll be the First To Tell You !No!. Blood Dolls is more Like Puppet Master.I almost even consider it to be one of the many Sequels to Puppet Master, Mainly because Puppet Master and Blood Dolls are both from Full Moon Pictures. Another thing just plain out great about this movie was Pimp Doll. He is so Cool. As soon as I Work Overtime I am going to Order the Pimp Doll from Full Moon's Website and get a Blood Dolls DVD (It Comes Included With The Doll). My Suggestion is: Go Rent it If you don't take my word for it.
