Acclaimed director Nora Ephron misses a winner by a big margin. High priced talent and a screwy plot equals a lame comedy. A very popular TV weatherman(John Travolta)is fighting foreclosure on his home, because he is going broke with a business venture. With advice from a strip club owner(Tim Roth)and the eager assistance of(Lisa Kudrow)the state lotto number caller on TV, a plan is contrived to rig the winning numbers. Situational comedy, but more or less a pretty stupid story. Maybe more of a drama and a whole lot less comedy could have saved this project. But this lotto flick is a losing crap shoot.<br /><br />Overweight Travolta is close to over the top as the egotistical weatherman. I don't recall seeing Kudrow in this light...sexy. No complaint here. Also in the cast are Ed O'Neil, Michael Moore and Bill Pullman. No great shakes, but the Travolta name is wagered to give credibility to this one.
