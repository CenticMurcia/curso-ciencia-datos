I wanted to record something from the TV recently so I pulled an almost forgotten VHS tape out of the storage area I originally got off of cable more than twenty years ago to decide if it was a keeper or not. Sadly, it wasn't and I was very glad to tape over it. The plot is almost nonexistent, although I must admit naked breasts were a real treat to find in the early 1980's and I did appreciate them at the time. If that's all you want nowadays go to Google and search under "images" for them but please do not spend even a minute of your valuable time watching this horrible waste of celluloid. Even the late lamented Robert Morley playing the part of God couldn't save this stinker.
