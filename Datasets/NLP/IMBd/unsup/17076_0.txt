His Girl Friday is one of the rare comic films that is not only hilarious but actually changed how films are made (or at least written). Director Howard Hawks' adaptation of The Front Page was the first time that lines were written specifically to be overlapped and Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell grab hold of those lines and never let go. This film is full speed comedy that never lets up.
