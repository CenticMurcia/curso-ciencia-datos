I ordered the movie and thought I'd ordered a DVD but received a VHS tape. I now see that it is not available on DVD, so a tape is OK.<br /><br />This is one cool movie that I can watch over and over and see new stuff.<br /><br />Great family movie too.<br /><br />We really lost a great new movie star when we lost River Phoenix.<br /><br />WHEN IS THIS MOVIE GOING TO BE ON DVD???
