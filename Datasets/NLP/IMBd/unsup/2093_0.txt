John Steinbeck published his Nobel winning book in 1937. This film adaptation of said book followed two years later. Lewis Milestone selected two virtually unknown actors to play the lead characters and struck pay-dirt. The film tells the story of two itinerant laborers traveling through California in the Depression of 1930. Burgess Meredith, plays George a sensitive and fast thinking individual who has taken and befriended Lennie, (Lon Chaney Jr.) a huge retarded man who is gentle, kind and well-meaning but hampered with a dangerous and prodigious strength. Securing employment, they begin working on a large farm ranch and are greeted by Slim (Charles Bickford) the ranch foreman and Whit (Noah Berry Jr.) a ranch hand. However they are also met by Curley (Bob Steele) and his flirtatious wife Mae (Betty Field). Life on the ranch is peppered with both opportunities of future dreams, but also with hazardous personal situations which seem innocuous enough, but are fraught with misunderstanding. Nevertheless, the movie itself is filled with both compassion for life, but also in heartrending acceptations of natural tragedy. The wonderful performances by Meredith and Chaney mark this great film with the unmistakable characteristics of a true Classic. A great movie stemming from an equally great book. A must see for all movie lovers. ****
