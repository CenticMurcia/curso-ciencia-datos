This type of comedy definitely isn't for everyone. This is very corny, but its SUPPOSED to be that corny, which is why some people will love this and others will hate it with few in between.<br /><br />Lloyd and Harry are idiots who constantly tease, prank and make fools of themselves throughout the whole movie. Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are perfect in these roles. If you like corny movies that are full of one-liners and laughs, this is the movie for you!
