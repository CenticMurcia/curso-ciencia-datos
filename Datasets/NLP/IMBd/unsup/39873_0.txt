This movie is another sub-realist creation of Henry Paris. The stetic aspect is more elaborated than The Opening of Misty Bethofen, but the movie is plot less.<br /><br />The good: Very good looking actress, perfect photography in some scenes, and that subreal world.<br /><br />The Bad: Most scenes are just a waste of time, and even not erotic or exiting at all.<br /><br />If you want to see this movie just FastForward to the Disco sequence. Is like a short movie inside the movie, and maybe the only cool thing to see.
