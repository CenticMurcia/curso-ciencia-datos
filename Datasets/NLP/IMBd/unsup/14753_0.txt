Upon watching the closing credits at the end of this movie, I was awestruck. All I could say was, "WOW." As a fellow member of the so cliche'd "Generation X," I completely identified with this movie. However, one need not be a member of any specific generation to appreciate it. Beautifully written, amazingly well-directed, esp. for an independent film, this movie not only touches on familiar conflicts in life (such as trying to make life not "suck"), it also has a somewhat sarcastic flair that would make anyone smile. Karl T. Hirsch has an amazing mind and a great eye/heart for what makes a film easily a favorite. I give it a 10. :)
