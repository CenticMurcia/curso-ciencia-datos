This film is complete rubbish and just an excuse for a bunch of old actresses to strip off. Helen Mirren is an exhibitionist and just loves stripping off. She used to look quite sexy, but she's now too old for it.<br /><br />Okay, so it's a real story and supposed to be a serious film. But, at the end of the day, it's about the exhibitionism of a bunch of old women. It got so tedious in the end that I upped the DVD to x16 to get it over with as soon as possible. <br /><br />The old women should stick to something they're good at: baking cakes.
