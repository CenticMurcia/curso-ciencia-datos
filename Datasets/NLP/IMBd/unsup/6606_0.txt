It really is a surprise to me a made-for-TV movie will be that enjoyable. If someone famous like Tom Hanks or J.Lo are in this movie. It's gonna be a huge hit. But all the actor/actress in this movie are good enough to beat anyone of them. Richard Ruccolo is one of main factor to make this movie funny. Hope he can make more good movie for us in the future. Anyway. U may find that this movie is impossible to be better than Hollywood movie. But it's free on TV man!!! Nothing beat that.
