This movie along with Star Trek, Lost in Space, Time Tunnel, Journey to the Far Side of the Sun, etc. set things in motion that influenced my life and what I did when I grew up. Although yes it has it's pitfalls, but the basis was sound and effects for the time I think were very good. I still enjoy it to this day.
