Though a little bit confusing at times, this movie is everything I expected from a Ringu prequel. The only reason that doesn't make this one my favorite of the series is because it couldn't exist without the others. Ringu 1 and 2 are more than a prerequisite; you have to see them to plainly enjoy this one! Of course, I love Asian horror, from Audition to The Eye to Chinese Ghost Story! What I mean is: if you're not into Asian horror films don't start with Ringu 0, you might get lost and never want to experience it again. If you're a fan of the original Ringu and other Asian ghost movies, go ahead and enjoy! You'll get to know a little better who Sadako really was before she died, how the curse was born and what makes this whole story so sad and scary at the same time. I also recommend to watch it more than once because it has nothing to do with American fastfood film-making, so there might be things that are misunderstood during the first viewing. The order I suggest to follow if you haven't seen any of the Ringu films: start with Part 1, then Part 2, then Part 0. There's another movie called Rasen which I haven't seen yet, so I can't tell you about it.
