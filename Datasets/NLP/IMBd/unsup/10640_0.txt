This movie is not the best Coppola ever, but one of his greatest accomplishments as a director. He was so detail oriented in the production of this flick that eventually led Zoetrope Studios to bankruptcy. Back in 1982 this movie became one most expensive films of the season!<br /><br />Among many things: first movie ever with a whole sequence fully computer generated (the opening credits), the recreation of downtown Las Vegas, and the Nevada desert inside the studio, the use of multiple computer-guided cameras (as developed by Lucas)...<br /><br />Although the plot is kind-of-weak and could have used some improvement, the movie became famous for featuring one of the most beautiful scores ever put in a film. The soundtrack by Tom Waits literally carries the weight of the movie and guides the action.<br /><br />Another aspect worth mentioning is the outstanding cinematography by Vittorio Storaro. The light and the colors are just beautiful: each shot alone is a perfect picture.<br /><br />If I ever make a movie, I just hope it looks and sounds just half as good as "One from the heart" does.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, the storyline is weak and too predictable, leaving you the feeling that Coppola left the screenwriting aside in order to focus almost exclusively on the mindbending technical details of the flick. It's worth checking just for the cinematography and the soundtrack alone.
