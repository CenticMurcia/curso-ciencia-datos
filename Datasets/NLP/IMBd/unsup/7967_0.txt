When one looks at Clerks, it's pretty easy to realize that it's a bit overrated. It's not to say it is a bad movie, but considering how much respect and a cult it has created in its wake, it seems a bit too much. The film was a major hit in the '94 Sundance. I guess people were captivated that a man who worked in a convenience store was able a movie greater than most people make in the entire career.<br /><br />Now don't a Shakeperean story here. It tells the story of Dante Hicks (Brain O'Halloran), your everyday clerk whose brought in on his day off. Throughout the day, he and his best friend/worst enemy/co-worker Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson) several obstacles in a greatly monotonous job. This includes screwed up customers, girlfriends, and stoners Jay (Jason Mewes) and Silent Bob (Director/Writer Kevin Smith).<br /><br />What probably got to audience the most was the film's no-hold bars, raunchy dialog that threatened it with NC-17 rating. Kevin Smith holds no qualms in creating some of most sexual-explicit situations in film history. Many times it feels forced and over the top, usually putting me in an uncomfortable place.<br /><br />That being said though, Smith is able to write some amazing characters. In most days, studios and filmmakers try to usually to cram the films characters down our throats so by the end of the day, we're suppose to feel for them. Smith doesn't do that. He just lets the characters play out, putting them situations that relate to the audience. These situations include be stuck in a dead-end job, yet never having the courage to leave and start a real-life. Smith makes us feel whatever we want to feel for the characters, which they're usually soon in the positive light.<br /><br />The film's looks is also something to be admired. Usually, independent films pride themselves for their artistic vision. The opposite could be said for Clerks. The movie is so artistically challenged it gives it a grainy, poor look that puts the audience in a world unlike most others.<br /><br />While not nearly worth the years of hype, Clerks remains a wonderful and nicely done comedic-farce.
