Only due to the fact that I love slasher/serial kill movies, did I rate this as high as 3.<br /><br />I skipped past the opening credits. The next scene opens in a cop station. In the ensuing seconds, it shows the cop browsing data on various wanted suspects. I believe the intent was that we would assume he was continuously going forward through the database. If you slo-mo and pause, you'll note the details in several suspects' files, and you'll note one that describes a sex crime. These details are displayed several times, and although the details are the same, the suspect's picture is different LOL
