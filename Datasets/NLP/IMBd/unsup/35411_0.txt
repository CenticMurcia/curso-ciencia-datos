Some people may consider the contents of the following commentary to be spoiler content. So here is your warning. This movie proved to me that a movie can be funny but ultimately terrible. It didn't really have much of a point, there was a plot, but there wasn't a point. The characters didn't show much intelligence, which may have been the point. One of them seemed to have an obsession over getting on TV and came to the conclusion that the only way to do this was to rob banks.<br /><br />A lot of this movie was based on getting girls, and making lots of money. It also portrays racial minorities as stupid and really just bumbling idiots. I guess I can't judge whether or not it is offensive or if it is funny in a satirical sense, since I'm not a racial minority, but it seemed pretty disrespectful.
