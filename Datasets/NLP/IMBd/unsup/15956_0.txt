Death Wish is a very clich√©d type of movie. Someone close to the heroic character is killed, hero goes out for revenge.<br /><br />However, there is plot here. There is also character development (for some characters anyway). It just doesn't take long for the movie to go down the famous path of hero becoming a vigilante.<br /><br />Charles Bronson was obviously the best choice to play Paul Kersey, the war veteran with a family who is happy with his life until disaster strikes. Stuart Margolin plays Ames Jainchill, Kersey's new found cowboy friend who introduces him to the world of carrying a gun outside of the war. Hope Lange plays Joanna, Paul's wife. Vincent Gardenia plays Detective Frank Ochoa, the detective who is sent out to find Kersey. I guess the rest of the characters aren't really worth mentioning except for an early appearance by Jeff Goldblum, who actually plays his part very well.<br /><br />The New York setting was very good, the wintry climate gave it all the more realism as to how cold the world really is. The music score was also really good.<br /><br />Bronson was definitely the main reason to keep watching. The part was seemingly written for him.<br /><br />Over all, not a bad movie. I'd recommend to mainly fans of vigilante/rogue cop movies and fans of Charles Bronson, as this is probably the role that fits him best.<br /><br />8/10
