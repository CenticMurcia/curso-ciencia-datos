I for one like B-movies. If u like B-movies too, I suggest.<br /><br />I saw it about a week ago and when I decided to watch it, I didn't get my hopes up. Plot is fine and the FX aren't that bad. It's simple gangster movie with the usual happenings. They sell dope, collect money, usually they beat up the guy, or brake something. Violence should've been better, guns r so fake. In the end wins the one who can pull out his gun faster, than the other. <br /><br />Everybody loves the money.....<br /><br />The more, the merrier!!!<br /><br />I'll give 4* out of 10*(B-movie rating)
