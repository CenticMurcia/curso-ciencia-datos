this is the best animation i've ever seen. i found it through digital TV and it really appealed to me. but what i felt and found the most beautiful thing about this movie is its deeper meanings of the relation between black and white.i knew the names would have a meaning and to the end of the film it comes together. Black and white are two kids who grew up together, helping each other protecting "there" city. but more in the end when black lets white been taken by the cops its really starts showing the symbolic meaning of them representing yin and yang, the first example i can give is white talking about that both lost most of there screws but he keeping them all. its like meaning that the one needs the other. my second example is near the end when black meets the minotaur and learning that it is the darkness in himself, with a inner journey he learns that the minotaur wants to let black use all his "dark" powers in the meantime white is freaking out because slowly the darkness (yang) is winning. this symbolism of yin and yang is again shown with the crows and the white dove's. but in the struggle white is showing up in blacks mind and starts bringing black back to his senses thus restoring the balance. even without that symbolism this movie is a must see, but not for young kids
