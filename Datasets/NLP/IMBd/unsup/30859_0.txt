You Don't Mess With the Zohan, latest Adam Sandler's comedy is a exaggerated and ridiculous movie that you will enjoy. It takes a tough topic like the conflict between Palestine and Israel and makes it an entertaining and laughable movie for the people. The story about A Mossad agent (Sandler) fakes his death so he can re-emerge in New York City as a hair stylist is a little exaggerated and with some repetitive jokes but still very funny to watch. It is the typical Adam Sandler comedy that includes beautiful women, sexual humor and a clumsy but lucky guy that tries to be a different or better person The cast is very good beginning with Adam Sandler that although his performance is a little exaggerated, he manages to make it funny. Rob Schneider as a Palestinian cab driver is very funny. John Turturro as the Phantom is also very good, Emmanuelle Chriqui with a decent performance as a sweet Palestinian girl who owns a beauty saloon and a brief but convincing appearance by Chris Rock as a Jamaican cab driver. In conclusion, a funny movie that you can either go and see it in theaters and spend a good time or you can wait until it comes out on DVD and watch it home.
