To begin with the positive, I'm quite willing to concede that the performances in this movie (by Dennis Quaid, Andie McDowell, Greg Kinnear and Toni Collette) were pretty convincing. Unfortunately, good performances just didn't make up for what I thought was an unpleasant and uninteresting movie about marital breakups and mid-life crises, and how they affect the relationship between friends caught in the middle. Kudos for the fact that the sympathetic characters in the movie (played by Quaid and McDowell) were actually suggesting that marriage problems need to be fought through and marriage held on to rather than thrown away, but still, frankly, I thought this thing would never end, and the ending, when it finally did arrive, was entirely forgettable. A waste of time in my opinion.<br /><br />3/10.
