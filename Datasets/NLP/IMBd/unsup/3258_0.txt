I first saw this movie when i was 11 years old, and it was love at first sight. In 1977, I bought it on super-8. Before VHS or any other home movie standard, that was the only way to own a copy. Sadly it's only about 20 minutes. The DVD double disk version brought me right back to the first time I saw "Bjergk√∏bing grand prix" (as it is called in Denmark), in the cinema. I'm proud to say, that back in 1975, in that little cinema, I fell out of the chair during the final race scenes. I often wish that the same thing would happen to day. But they simply don't make films like this anymore, and that's a shame. Then of course, the cinema chairs today are much more comfortable.<br /><br />It is very "Norsk" -very Norwegian. That's why I loved watching it in it's original language, on the DVD.<br /><br />Kim.
