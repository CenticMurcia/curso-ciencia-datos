Costner's films continue without heart or soul. Each is an appendage to the only film he ever made. This episode is more properly judged in the genre of videos, as this film substitutes any plot or character development, and certainly any acting for bland cinematography and overdone music. Discard comments regarding sexism and ignore comparisons to Tombstone, I feel sorry for him and his costars, some of whom actually deliver strong, believable performances. Doc Holliday is always entertaining. I was particularly saddened that the writers chose to trivialize the friendship between Doc and Wyatt by basing it upon a few meaningful looks and friendly handshakes. Showing Doc save Wyatt's life would have made for better watching and historical accuracy. And may I say, I love this legend...
