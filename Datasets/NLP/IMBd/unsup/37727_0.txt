this movie is corny beyond words. if they would've used a good writer to do it they might have had something here, but instead it's a complete travesty up there with the Schumacher franchise <br /><br />*SPOILERS* i mean come on! Vicky Vale is a redhead? and why do they insist on dumbing Batman down? i mean judging by the level of blood and the fact that they talk about corpses, it's not clearly not meant to be a kids movie. i would think Batman would be smart enough to not try to fight Dracula hand to hand, he would know to rethink his strategy after getting kicked around a few times. and of all villains, he allies himself with THE PENGUIN? you can't be serious.<br /><br />if you want to watch a good animated Batman movie, stay clear of this nonsense and pick up "Mask Of The Phantasm", or the uncensored version "Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker"<br /><br />DOWN WITH FAUX PAS BATMAN!
