If you ever feel like watching a movie for just pure fun and just taking a step out of serious stuff in most movies, this is the movie you must see. The 80's cheese makes this movie so funny! <br /><br />Its all about a baby boy, nicknamed Bobo, that has been banished by his older brotherinto the wilderness and then gets raised by wolves.28 years later a scientist goes into the woods to study a pack of wolves until she stumble upon the human wolf. Bringing him back to civilization, she teaches Bobo to read, talk, walk, and write his name in the favor for Bobo's mischievous brother to sign some papers to have $30,000,000 from their late father's savings into his own money instead of splitting the money down the middle. And thats where the wackiness begins. Notice the 80's story plot?<br /><br />I'm not a man that is into mindless movies like Dude Where's My Car?, Bill & Ted Excellent Adventure, or Harold and Kumar Goes to White Castle for examples. But this movie, which somewhat fits into this category, makes me never get tired of watching it. It's just pure fun! 7/10
