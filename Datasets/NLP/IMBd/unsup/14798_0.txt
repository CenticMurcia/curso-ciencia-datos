W0w, This movie is great, I watched just bit of it when it released, It was real sad, that I couldn't finish it, but now after about 1 year I determined to watch it no matter what, and I really loved it. Its a great awesome heart touching movie!. Loved Kal Ho Naa Ho.!! both its story and the songs are good. All the songs rocked. Its a perfect movie for a family to watch. Except some scenes which might be disturbing for some people, in one of the scene which Saif Ali Khan's home keeper maid thinks that Saif Ali Khan and Shahrukh Khan are gay. It was real funny tough. I'd vote it as 10/10. It's worth watching! I don't understand that why people didn't like Kal ho Naa Ho as much as Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham and Khuch Khuch Hota Hai...
