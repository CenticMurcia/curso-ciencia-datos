Contagion is the worst movie I've ever seen. I keep watching it because I just couldn't believe if was that bad. To the end of the movie it keeps getting worse. What bothers me the most is that everything in this movie is so unrealistic. Climax was the moment on which Dr. Landis saves the little boy on top of the roof by pulling some tunnel thingy which blows Miss. Ugly of the roof. It looked so amateurish and unrealistic. I could name you all the stupid things about this movie but then I would be telling you the whole movie. God, I just couldn't believe people could make such bad movies. I've seen movies with a lower budget, but non of them where such as bad as this one.
