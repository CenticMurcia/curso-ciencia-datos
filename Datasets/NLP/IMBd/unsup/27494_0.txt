I saw most of "The Rose" on TV a few years after it came out. I don't know quite how much I missed (just the beginning, I think), and I won't claim to remember the parts I saw very well. But as for what I did see, I remember very clearly what my reaction to it was, and other comments show me that I'm not the only one to feel this way. I saw a lot of things done by the characters -- things that were loud, emotional, rash and sudden; things that had to have some very strong motivations behind them. But at no point was I able to tell WHY any character was doing what they did. And when a movie is full of actions that require definite motivations, but don't have them, that movie ends up being tiring, pointless and unsatisfying -- which is what "The Rose" is.
