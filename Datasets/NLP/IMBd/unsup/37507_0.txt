The main bulk of the film is right up its own fundament but there are some fantastic shots of a fully nude Kate Winslet which makes this film a must buy... but it is really lousy apart from that. The plot doesn't go anywhere that could even vaguely be described as interesting and I thought it would be a really juicy look at cults. Alas, it was shabby.
