I thought the story was good but the direction was excellent. The director knew how to keep you interested in the story from beginning to middle to end. I like that the story showed the two brothers, one being the hero and the other being the "problem child". However, it takes a while before you remember that they are both from the same stock with the same bad ways.I'm sure he didn't have a big budget, regardless the movie seemed to be very professional. I feel that the story was a little to real, which would probably explain why it wasn't as popular as I thought it should be. There were a lot of drug scenes. I'm anxious to see what he comes out with next.
