Though I'm sure many disagree, I enjoyed the sequel even better than the original "Beverly Hills Cop." Both are good movies, but this one has more laughs, in my opinion. Eddie Murphy goes into more of his hilarious improvisations and since Tony Scott is in the director's chair this time around, the action scenes are more elaborate. Taggart and Rosewood loosened up in the end of the original, so their characters are much more fun to watch. I love Taggart's line at the end of the climactic shoot-out. I still can't say John Ashton and Judge Reinhold match up to Laurel and Hardy, like Martin Brest (director of the original) said, but they do make a great team. And as much as I loved the music in the first movie, the music in this soundtrack is even better! The song during the opening title sequence, "Shakedown," is perfect as it really got me pumped up for what was about to come. Like the original, this movie also has a strip club sequence and as an added bonus, shots of scantily clad "Playboy" bunnies. So how can I complain? Well...other than the fact that Bronson Pinchot (who stole the show in the first and third movies as the hilarious Serge) doesn't make an appearance. I still stand by my word in saying this is the best in the "Cop" series! This is yet another reminder that Eddie Murphy used to make funny movies. What happened to you, Eddie? We want you back! <br /><br />My score: 7 (out of 10)
