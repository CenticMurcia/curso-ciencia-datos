Absolutely loved all that I saw. I haven't seen the first bit, but the last hour and a half is definitely awesome. I don't know if this historically accurate or not, but it is historic enough to give you an idea of Asoka's story, the rise to power, Battle of Kalinga, change to Buddhism, all these are addressed. Everything had the hall mark of a great movie. The grandeur of the Mauryan empire was palpable. Asoka's evil in his rise to power, his ruinous campaigns for the empire were not just seen and heard, but felt. Absolutely awesome was the battle- the scale of the battle, the destruction, the disaster, the hatred and then the repentance, the scenes say it all absolutely wordlessly (Mark the scene where Asoka offers the dying soldier water, and he refuses to take it from the hated Asoka). Karuwaki's "you're Asok" deserves a place amongst the best scenes ever. I could feel the hatred she felt in my throat. <br /><br />The movie is probably somewhere in between Gladiator and The Hero, but absolutely has its own mark, the distinct Indian flavour. Wonder why it isn't more celebrated. Did this really flop in India??? Why??? Its probably one of the best movies to have been made!!!
