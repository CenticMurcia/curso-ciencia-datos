This movie unfortunately has not one iota to compare with Sideways in case anyone is telling you such bull... <br /><br />the script is slow, trite and only has one part that is fairly interesting which is the fact about the blind tasting in Paris, and the directing is so amateurish TV style that it screams Movie of the week! <br /><br />The father/son relationship doesn't work, the over done helicopter shots make you dizzy like its a glossy infomercial for Gallo wine, and the sunlight thru the pepsi ad commercial barn house feels like directing of a Michael Bay-wanna be, and how on earth did they pick these horrible young actors that are way 'too pretty to be anything but a TV soap star or model' Even the bartender has glossy lipstick that makes her look like a Coyote Ugly girl rather than some 70s hippie bar chick. And how many times can they cut to the father/son boxing each other.. <br /><br />But it all comes down to a boring script that just drags along instead of someone editing half the movie out..and moving forward past the Paris contest.. which is sad because this story could have been so much more but as they always say.. it's the script, script, script... and this one sticks with no connection to the characters it is so flat. <br /><br />I almost walked out if it had it not been for the brief moments of the Paris moments with Rickman/Farina.. yet the California ones were unbearable.. and im a wine lover that thought perhaps they would create some decent moments but nothing... And poor Bill Pullman did the best he could but these young actors should go back to soap operas and stay away from film and the director stick to TV directing or commercials.<br /><br />I gave it a 1 because i had to buy my friend a glass of wine to revive him after falling asleep halfway thru the movie after yet another car breaks down to create some suspense.. yawwwwwnnnnnn!!!!<br /><br />Oh and how about the girl watering down the tackle... yeah.. real nice sexist wanna be playboy soft porn... truly embarrassing!
