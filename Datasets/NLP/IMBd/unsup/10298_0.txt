Soap opera starring Barbara Stanwyck as Lora Hart, nurse in training who rooms and works at a big hospital under a stern head nurse, a real stickler for the rules who punishes nurses who stay out past curfew by putting them on night shift in the emergency ward. Lora's roommate is a wisecracking blonde, played by - who else - Joan Blondell, who advises her friend to stay away from the interns and find herself a patient with dough. Well, Lora meets a handsome, injured bootlegger while working in emergency, who plays in this film later as she gets involved working duty caring for two sick little girls (who actually looked quite healthy to me!) who are dying of starvation in a wealthy household that is occupied by an assemblage of real shady characters including a mean chauffeur in black, an abrasive housekeeper, a bad doctor with a weird eye twitch, and the mother who proudly proclaims she's a "dipsomaniac".<br /><br />This is a pretty weird movie - it's really comprised of two separate halves. The first half is the reasonably normal, and interesting story of a young nurse learning her trade and dealing with typical hospital stuff - the only slightly odd thing being the constant focus on showing these nurses in their lingerie as they change from street clothes into uniform several different times. The second half of this film is just a real shift in the focus of this story to the very oddball starvation/murder plot. The saving grace of this film is seeing Barbara Stanwyck acting up a storm and Clark Gable, who's fun to watch playing the evil chauffeur. Worth seeing for a bit of campy fun.
