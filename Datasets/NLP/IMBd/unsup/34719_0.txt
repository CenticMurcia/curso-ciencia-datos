I thought this movie was horrible! The acting and directing was something that a four year old could do. I DID NOT like the way the movie was cast and the things they changed from the original book. First of all, Carton and Darnay looked NOTHING alike. Lucie was NOTHING how they described her in the book. Not to mention how horrible the actress was who played Madame Defarge. Not only was the acting terrible, but the directing and blocking was horrible too. But, I'd have to say the worst part was when Carton and the seamstress started making out randomly while they were at the Guillitine. I mean, come ON! You have got to be kidding me! This movie is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I would not refer anyone to this movie.
