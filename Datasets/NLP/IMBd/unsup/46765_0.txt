"Unfairly maligned" "A hit" A gem" Who writes this stuff? This film was a real waste unless you are a punk rock fan.<br /><br />It is notable because it was the film that ignited the whole "video nastie" brouhaha in Britain. It was initially banned in Britain and Germany and then released with cuts in 1999 and re-released uncut in 2002. It is now in the public domain so you can see it for free. Don't bother.<br /><br />The actual horror portion doesn't some until 40 minutes into the film. 40 minutes of punk rock to see someone use a drill to kill some homeless guy. He only picks on homeless guys. Why in the world didn't he go after that punk rock band that was keeping him up all night? The only thing worthwhile in the entire film was Carol (Carolyn Marz) and Pamela (Baybi Day) having fun in the shower.<br /><br />Too bad I have two more Abel Ferrara movies in my queue.
