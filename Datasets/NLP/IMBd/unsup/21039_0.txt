This intelligent, crafty, dark comedy is a breath of fresh air. Though not completely original, this movie really works. The story centers around 2 Irish brothers (fraternal twins), who wake up while spending the night in a prison cell, and are "chosen" to take out God's vengeance on bad guys.<br /><br />What develops is an excellent dark comedy/drama that explodes from the first frame till the last. Quick, fast paced camera work and excellent photography helps to move the story along. The action is non-stop and the dialogue, though very "offensive" (alot of the "f" word), is right on target for the setting and mood of the movie.<br /><br />The showdown at the end is a little less intense then the rest of the movie, but still, nonetheless, works!<br /><br />The relationship between the two brothers is right on. Flannery and Remmus really do act like 2 brothers (the fighting in the air shaft, hilarious).<br /><br />One of the main highlights of the movie is the performance given by Willem Dafoe. Diverse, witty, and totally hilarious. He delivers and excellent performance as the FBI agent. He is intelligent, comical, gay, and doesn't want to admit it right off the top, but agrees with what the brothers are doing. He had me laughing throuh the film...and seeing him in Drag...Oh, you just gotta see this movie.<br /><br />Though some plot points weren't totally developed, (what happened to "F**k Ass?), this movie is still an excellent example of a lower budget movie that really kicks ass, and offers a fast paced, action packed joy ride.<br /><br />Check this movie out...It is well worth the time. I would like to get the DVD, and watch all the extra's that are on it. I would also like to get my hands on an uncut version.<br /><br />9 out of 10
