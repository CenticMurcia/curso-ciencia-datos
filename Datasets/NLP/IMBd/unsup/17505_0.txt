i remember when i first played this game years ago. i think it's a great game and anyone who's into FPS games should play at least one rainbow six edition.<br /><br />The graphics, sound and dialog are great. the controls, once learned, are easily mastered and employed in the game. In the heat of battle you get some people who flip out, charge the bad guys, or just wimp out and run. so when shots are fired you never know whats going to happen. another good thing is that the tangos are always in different locations so you can't run through it after playing the level a few times.<br /><br />the only quams i have is that the AI is too stupid sometimes. tangos can sneak up behind and if one team ember in the middle sees him but the others don't he will open fire regardless and mow down the whole team, and most of the time missing the bad guy. another thing is if you stop in tight quarters, like on stairs, and you gotta turn around. you have to kill about half of them before they budge. i think this was fixed in the sequals<br /><br />all in all this is a great game and it deserves high ratings
