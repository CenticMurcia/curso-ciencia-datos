First of all, full disclosure: I worked on this movie. <br /><br />I'm gonna give inside info: <br /><br />The original cover (what it was peddled with) was a humorous one. The distributors chose to go with a more ominous cover that would indicate a more gore-based movie (which it's not, but does have a couple of CGI moments that are real enough not to be noticed, thank you Rob Rugan and Jimbo...).<br /><br />The quote that it was better than "Shaun of the Dead" contains ellipsis that belie the original statement which was along the lines of 'it has moments that are even better than Shaun of the Dead'. These are choices that the distributer makes. They have nothing to do with the movie makers.<br /><br />This movie was not made as a response to "Shaun of the Dead": technically, it was released the day before "Shaun of the Dead". It premiered at the Sidewalk Film Festival in Birmingham AL the Thursday before "Shaun" was released on Friday. That's not to say it's success wasn't related to "Shaun" at all, it totally was in my opinion, but again, that's the distributer, not the makers.<br /><br />I've only said this for the commenters who took fault with these points. If you don't like it for other reasons, that's totally reasonable.<br /><br />And for 25K, you can't expect a better outcome for a bunch o' folks with day jobs.
