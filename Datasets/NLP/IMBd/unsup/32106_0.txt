If you're like me, and you're tired of seeing the same old crap come out of Hollywood year after year, add this movie to your watch list. 'Gun Shy' is a witty, off-beat comedy with an all-star cast. Liam Neeson stars as a nervous undercover DEA agent that must bring an old world mafia thug, Oliver Platt, and Columbian drug kingpins together in a multi-million dollar sting operation. At the same time, Neeson must also deal with an increasingly volatile digestive system and a horrifying fear of being found out. Produced by co-star Sandra Bullock. WARNING: Dumb people may find this movie boring or confusing.
