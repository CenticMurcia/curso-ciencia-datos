The Season ends with a very excitable bang and leaves us in suspense from the very start. The year has been a very excitable and interesting year and I have loved every minute of it, good and bad. I shall now do my last Good and Bad for Season 1, The Erlenmeyer Flask. Enjoy.<br /><br />The Good: That alien baby was adorable. x]<br /><br />The final scene. Beautifully done.<br /><br />Those bodies in the glass. Wow.<br /><br />Deep Throat. Trust him or not?<br /><br />The Bad: The whole shooting thing. :'(<br /><br />Conclusion: Brilliant end of a brilliant First Season. I want to believe. 10/10
