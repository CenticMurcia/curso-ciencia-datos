Yes, after having read my fellow IMDb:ers comments I feel I have to set the story straight! I saw some people rating this movie as an eight - this must be against some constitution! This is a really crappy movie, even for a genre where a certain level crappiness is the standard.<br /><br />It starts off poorly and predictably with the mandatory murder-introduction of the baddie. It's just that they didn't give it any effort which made it feel like it really really was just something to get over with. Do the stereo-typical smoking alleyway with something illusive moving just out of sight. Then suddenly the predator decides that now, unlike the past five minutes, is a really good time to strike. Slash-boom-bang! <br /><br />Predictable and stereo-typical are key words for this movie. Anyone who can't see what's coming next must either be very naive or new to (at least) this genre. The actors just plow through the script, not doing a bad job, but I don't think they spent too much time on in-depth character-analysis. The only one who is a delight to see is the guy playing the leader of the bug-hunting-team(recognize him but don't know his name).<br /><br />As for the ending (don't worry, I'm not gonna give this piece of art away) - that was the final yank that flushed the movie down - it was as if they didn't have enough time, money, energy or whatever left, and just fast-forwarded the whole thing. It was full of logical glitches, super-predictable and just mega sucking.<br /><br />To sum it up - I don't think too much effort was put into this movie or that anyone pondered upon what the end product would actually convey. So why don't I rate this movie a one (1)? On this I'd like to quote my fellow country man and comment leaver Karl Hem "because I've actually seen worse, can you believe it!"
