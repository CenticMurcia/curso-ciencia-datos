***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS***<br /><br />First: i'm a movie buff... A real one. I watch approximately 12 movies a week. Just to say that i'm not some popcorn eating teenager who wants to see "armageddon 8". If i were, i wouldn't rent this movie. Second: i'm extremely fond of slow and poetic movies. I watch a lot of European and asian movies, because i think overall they take more time to develop the story and do not simply hang on to Syd Fields' 3-act formula.<br /><br />This movie however was so extremely slow and hollow, that for one of the first times in my life, i really felt sorry for wasting time on a movie. The plot is told in 4 sentences<br /><br />***EXTREME SPOILERS : entire plot told ***<br /><br />1. Woman is going over to some friends<br /><br />2. Woman gets stuck in traffic<br /><br />3. woman takes a hitch hiker with her<br /><br />4. woman makes love to hitch hiker in hotel<br /><br />***SPOILER ENDING***<br /><br />And yes, i know, almost each movie can be condensed to 4 sentences, but with this movie these 4 sentences really tell the whole plot. There are approximately 20 lines of dialogue. It's like an idea for a short movie is pulled and stretched over 1h30. I really REALLY hated this movie.
