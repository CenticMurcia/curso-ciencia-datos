I have seen "Virus" at a sneak preview at a local cinema. That was luck for the producers! If I had visited the film intentionally and paid for it knowing it was to be shown, I would have been seriously worried about the way I spend my money. Not only the story was it, what was so horrible. In fact, there wasn't any story. A few good men enter a Russian ship and have to face an evil alien. Haha. there might be some people on this planet, who would've made a good movie out of this, but the producers of "Virus" didn't. The bad special effects, a mixture of elements of films like "Star Trek", "Alien" or "The Abyss", and the missing atmosphere make this movie one of the worst I've ever seen.
