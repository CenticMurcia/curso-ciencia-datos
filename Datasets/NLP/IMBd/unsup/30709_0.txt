Come on! This "shock" film is nothing but a series of rip-offs and stereotypes and is pure TRASH! The film tries to present a bleak look at "Viet-Nam Vets" who can't fit back into society following their combat experiences. Themes stolen from Midnight Cowboy (bleak New York City), The Taxi Driver (crazed vet shoots it out with three thugs at the end), Rolling Thunder (crazed and disturbed P.O.W. haunted by wartime nightmares), and Soldier Blue (hacked up bodies, severed heads, in a war setting) are chopped together to make this dull, and boring mess. Each character is too over-the-top and all come across as cartoonish. The acting is terrible and stiff. Honestly, the whole cast looks like heroin addicts. The mutant baby was borrowed from the horror film, It's Alive!. I'm sure the movie was made with good intentions to show the plight of Vets exposed to Agent Orange and Shell Shock, but it just doesn't get it's message across. Instead of wasting your money and time on this trash, you should rent The Best Years of Our Lives or Coming Home.
