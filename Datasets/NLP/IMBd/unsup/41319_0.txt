Not only is it a horrible movie, but it seems like the Director approves of the whole situation. It seemed like they made the Male cop out to be a jerk for saying they were sick, as opposed to it being for "love". Come on man, it's sick! You're not together forever, you're not "one". The guys dead, you just ate his heart and liver! The relationship is pretty much over when his severed head is sitting on the table. (thats not a spoiler, it tells you what happens on the back of the DVD) "Cannibalism is misunderstood". Are you kidding me? It's like ignorance claiming genius....ugh....The thing that makes me sick is that the movie appears to be trying to get you to sympathize with the twisted crap. I don't know man. The only movie I've seen worse than this is "Final Days", the movie based on the last days before Kurt Cobain's suicide. It's a close call though.
