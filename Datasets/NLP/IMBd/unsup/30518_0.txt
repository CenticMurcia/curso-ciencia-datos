This is my game."Rudra's Treasure" is one of THE best R.P.Gs out there that never made it to the west!<br /><br />This game has everything an RPG fan wants.Great chara development outside the battle planner (Especially me and Garlyle and all the heroes.),Excellent storyline (Amemiya-sama!You ROCK!),wonderful Soundtrack and not to mention....the KOTODAMA word essence magic system.Yes,the system that lets you litteraly spell out your own magic spells.The flaw was that we did not get our own limit break-like moves.Oh Well,I've talked too much.<br /><br />If you don't import or download,you are missing out on a great game!
