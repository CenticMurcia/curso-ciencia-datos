I would have given the movie a 0 but it wouldn't let me. Never in my life have I watched a movie and left it wanting the last 2 hours of my life back. This was without a doubt the worst and most boring film i've ever witnessed. To say that the story is lacking is a vast understatement and the movie moves at a snails pace. No life to the film whatsoever. <br /><br />The only redeeming quality was the cast. Although given the experience of the cast, one would expect a much better product. I say with complete certainty that this is the worst movie i've ever seen, even worse than Daredevil.
