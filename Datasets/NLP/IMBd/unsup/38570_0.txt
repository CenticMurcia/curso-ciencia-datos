The title is totally correct.<br /><br />I'll say up front I am not a horror film fan. This film was not advertised as such; the description said it was about a woman trying to get a guilty man to confess. I'm a fan of Dina Meyer's, plus it had Jeff Fahey and Dennis Hopper.<br /><br />What a bloody mess. I don't know what passes for blood in movies, but whatever it is, probably 90% of the budget went for it. That and raw liver. Yuck.<br /><br />The story concerns some sort of brain machine that shows thoughts on a computer, that is used to study this superman, sort of the devil incarnate, who can exert mind control and is also psychic. One wonders why the Meyer character would have anything to do with this guy. Supposedly the woman realizes they are alike. Talk about bad writing. Personally I didn't see it.<br /><br />Jeff Fahey plays the governor and a former lover of Meyer - actually, he isn't, but that comes out in this story. Back in the '70s, when Jeff Fahey was on One Life to Live, I stepped into an apartment house elevator and there he was. Very sweet, beautiful blue eyes. Twenty years later, I was invited to a reception by the artist Peter Max. As I stepped into the elevator to leave, a laughing, possibly in his cups man and someone else crashed into the elevator. Jeff Fahey. So we must have had some elevator karma.<br /><br />That wasn't enough to get me through this movie. Trust me.
