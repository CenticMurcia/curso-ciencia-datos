This game was supposed to be all great. Well, being a hardcore gamer, I must say differently. This games graphics were nothing special, they were very cartoony. The plot is terrible, no real story to this game. Weapons suck massively. There is some intense gameplay, but nothing at all in this game is anything special. Halo 1 was a better game, I give it a 7/10. I also compare this game with Half-Life 2, which is a great game.<br /><br />Halo 2 Half-Life 2 Graphics: Poor Amazing Story: Poor Great Weapons: Fair Excellent Realism: Poor Amazing Overall: Poor Excellent<br /><br />Scale used: Poor Fair Good Great Excellent Amazing
