Frankly, this movie is silly.<br /><br />Like others have mentioned, I too was confused at how "John the Baptist" morphed into Judas. It is dated, however that part can be fun. Also, seeing the Twin Towers...well, that is another subject (possibly the most powerful part of the film for today).<br /><br />Outside of that...it is a guilty pleasure. Kinda like the Godzilla (hmmm...God..zilla/God...spell) movies that your afraid to admit you watch despite their silliness.<br /><br />If you watch this movie, do it for the camp and the music, not the "message".
