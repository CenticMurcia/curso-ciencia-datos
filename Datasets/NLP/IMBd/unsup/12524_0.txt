well i think there is no comment on that movie... perfect that's the only word can describe it... i should talk more so in other words... the story was unusual but can be accepted easily and you feel the interaction with characters so fast... group of young boys and girls who try to find the balance and safety life in community...also how law enforcement and judge system can be understanding for such unique case... such drama can be useful for teens kids and also adults to learn how much important kids should live in safe and peace the meaning of real family and real love connection between group of people that lead to give a good push up forward into the success in work school or any other activity in life...thanks everybody
