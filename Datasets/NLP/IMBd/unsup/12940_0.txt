This movie begins very annoying. The name Eklavya is repeated again and again. It is so very annoying that you are gonna shout; "Yes! I know what the name of the movie is! Get over it!" Then the movie starts slowly to become a very original type of movies. The cast is great. Amitabh is on his best. He plays a guard of the king, but as a guard he is the father of the children of the king.<br /><br />The movie goes on when even the king gets to know the guard is the father of his children. And then thing are getting very hot.<br /><br />Story is very great. The plot twists are fenomable. You may not and cannot miss this movie. Highly recommended.
