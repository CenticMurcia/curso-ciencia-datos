Doris Doerrie is one of those directors who leave no traces on my consciousness: when I see one of her films, I start forgetting it right away. I know I saw Men..., Happy Birthday!, Nobody Loves Me, yet I can't for the life of me remember the plots. She is far more interested in sociological analysis than in story-telling, so her stories are as flimsy as those of Godard.<br /><br />Having said this, I must also say that the actors in Naked are very talented and they kept me watching this very silly story to the end. Alexandra Maria Lara is so promising; she's as impressive here as she was as Hitler's secretary in The Downfall. Her character, and Juergen Vogel's, are allowed to develop over the course of the film--we see they have stamina as a couple. Heike Makatsch, who started in TV as a VJ, showed some acting ability I didn't expect from her. Nina Hoss and Mehmet Kurtulus as the rich couple, got some acid into their performances.
