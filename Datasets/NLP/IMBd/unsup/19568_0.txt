I saw the first High School Musical just after it came out hearing rave reviews and i thought it might be at least interesting. I was wrong, after about 40 mins of watching I would have rather ripped off my own ears and set them on fire than watch for another minute. I had absolutely no intention of watching this sequel but I was asked to by my sister on her birthday so I did. If I had poison handy I would have taken it without a second's hesitation. It was literally the worst "movie" I have ever seen. Don;t get me wrong I enjoy musicals very much, this had the worst songs and most obvious lip-syncing I have ever seen. The dance moves were similar to what you might expect from some backup dancer for Jessica Simpson. What I hate more than this movie (if that's even possible) is the fans. The true fans are the most moronic people I have ever met. Using no logic to backup their arguments of why this movie was so amazing other than 'OMG How can you say High School Musical sucked?? Zac Efron is lyke so kute! I just wanna hug him forever!' I could care less how cute an actor is that does not excuse the horrible monstrous atrocity that is High School Musical! Please for your sake DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!
