A lot of people admits Plan Nine From Outer Space is the worst film of all time. But this 1952 French Canadian movie is just a little bit near to win the title. Acting are awful, story is very very stupid and anything's about this movie is extremely bad: film direction, sets, and music (Big old Hammond organ all the way!). In a very poor countryside of Quebec, a little girl lost her dear mother. Her father marries another woman. This woman hates the little girl. So she tortures her. She hits her with sticks, with iron, she push her in stairways, she don't feed her, she burns her hands on the stove, she made her eat soap (yes!) etc. But nobody's seem to notice, despite that the little girl look like a zombie. But at the end of the film, a neighbour seem to notice there is something strange about this kid... Then comes the priest and the holy man realise what's wrong. The bad woman is sentenced to death. But the little girl, now an angel, forgives her. Can you image worst melodrama? I can't! See this film! You will never forget it, in the same way people of today loves Plan Nine From Outer Space.
