It gets off to a decent start. I thought the film would be good first 10 minutes in but after that it became more and more painfully obvious this one was going to blow. This was supposed to be a comedy and it just does not deliver enough laughs. The original Van Wilder was a much funnier movie. This movie relies on a lot of college film clich√©s but doesn't add anything new to the genre. Kal Penn manages to hold up the weak material for a little but eventually the movie just sinks. Kudos to Kal because he is always entertaining, but this one sucked. The only redeeming quality in this film are the two female leads, they both provide nice eye candy. I would not recommend this.
