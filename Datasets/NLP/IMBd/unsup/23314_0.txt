Okay, Upfront this is more about the psychology of the Twins than a review, but on the scale I did rate the movie at an 8. It is more entertaining than a lot of the crap you see these days.<br /><br />But back to the subject, why people love the twins. It's basically the same reason that they were such a hit when they jointly played the character on TV. They are your average kid, with an odd look that makes you interested in their faces and facial expressions. This is the same quality that makes a true beauty stand out from a line of Miss America contestants. They don't quite fit the mold, and this makes them unique enough to attract your attention, and KEEP IT.<br /><br />And their young fans love this aspect of their fame, whether they understand it or not. The attention of the media on these two faces underlines the fact that the less than perfect face can be more beautiful than all the models on the TV ads rolled into one. This is a positive reinforcement to all the fans, that maybe they too, could be seen for their inherent beauty.<br /><br />I have read reviews that have referred to the Olsen Twins videos as "child porn", and that the "New York Minute" film pushes the envelope on this aspect of the girls popularity. This is of course, nonsense.<br /><br />What has happened to this country, when the appreciation of child beauty is simply written off as "child porn"? What terrible thing has happened to the sensibilities of U.S. citizens that simply must look at the writer/photographer Lewis Carroll as a deviant because he acknowledged and tried to portray youthful beauty?<br /><br />There are forces in the U.S. that find it politically expedient to point fingers at things they do not understand, and brand it "child porn" in order to draw headlines to further their ambitions. Heaven help us if these forces attain the upper hand they so wish to use to control media and all of our choices.<br /><br />The Olsen Twins are cute, they are pleasing to look at, end of story. Also they possess a quality or talent, that very few actresses in the history of our media have possessed. The reason Lucille Ball became so famous, (also Carole Burnette) was that she was willing to look slightly foolish, and do pratfalls and physical humor in order to make an entertaining movie or TV show. People loved that! They weren't particularly great dramatic actresses, they just riveted our attention with their visual and physical comedy. This is the gift that the Olsen Twins bring to their work as well.<br /><br />To those who have commented that New York Minute wasn't funny, I sincerely think you need to have your sense of humor examined. It was great fun.
