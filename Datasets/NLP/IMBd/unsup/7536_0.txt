Knowing that Jane Curtin was one of the original "Saturday Night Live" cast members might make it hard to imagine that she could star in something as serious as "Brooklyn Lobster", but it comes out very good. The movie tells the story of Frank Giorgio (Danny Aiello), a seafood merchant whose business falls on hard times, forcing him and his family to reevaluate their lifestyles and relationships with each other.<br /><br />I think that what made the movie especially effective was the Yuletide setting. It reminds us that while so many people are merrily eating dinner and opening presents, a number of individuals - possibly more than half of us - are struggling just to get by, with or without tragedy striking. As it is, I got the feeling that Frank felt pretty disgusted with how the surrounding world was celebrating, and that drove him to do some of the angry things that he did.<br /><br />So, this is certainly a movie that I recommend. See it if possible.
