Saving Marriage is what a documentary should be - informative, factual and laced with stories that cater to the emotional side of the audience without excessive drama. <br /><br />The documentary has taken a volatile issue, which has the potential to be very one-sided, boring and repetitive due to it's association with politics and the law and made it digestible and easy to understand for the general audience. It's not preachy and insular as many documentaries dealing with gay issues are. It's objective and just hearing what some of those politicians had to say for themselves left me speechless. <br /><br />The interviews were captivating and the storytelling fluid. It hits the social, political and human points of the issue accurately.<br /><br />This documentary should also be a must-see for any straight married couple - it may make them stop taking their union and each other for granted - after all, it's a right that is not afforded to all.
