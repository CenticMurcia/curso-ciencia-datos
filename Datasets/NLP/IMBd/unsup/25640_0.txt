Italian 'sequel' to the 1978 sleeper hit Patrick isn't so much a sequel as it is a very lurid remake.<br /><br />Road-side prank leaves young man in a coma. Now, his doctor father has lured a band of suspects to his isolated house so that the comatose victim's telekinetic powers can reek some bloody revenge upon them.<br /><br />To say that this film is trashy is simply an understatement. Patrick vive ancora drives both sleaze and gore to extremes that are rarely seen in the genre. In fact the story and the cast take a back-seat to some of this ballsy action! Our cast is obviously not afraid to show some skin. The telepathic murders are gruesome indeed - who could ever forget that scene with the fire poker, talk about your phallic imagery!! Need I say more?<br /><br />For those seeking an intelligent and brooding lost thriller, watch the original Patrick (1978), but those that enjoy sleazy B horror must see this film to believe it! Adults only, and I mean those that are exploitation fans! <br /><br />** out of ****
