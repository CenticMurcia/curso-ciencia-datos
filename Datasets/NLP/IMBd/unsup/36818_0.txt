I have been a fan of Randolph Scott westerns since childhood and enjoy most of his work, but this movie plods along so slowly that you wish that everyone would shoot each other early and end the misery.<br /><br />The good guys & gals are too noble and self-righteous and the villains are obviously rotten, evil and stupid.<br /><br />The best thing about the film is the color scenery.<br /><br />1 * out of 5.
