This is a good film. Me and son enjoyed watching it and helping Thomas and friends solve the mystery of the lost magic train. I read some of the other reviews on here by people criticizing the movie, and all I have to say to those people is - lighten up! If you sit back and enjoy the movie and pay attention to all the clues, you'll see the story works out pretty well. The only rough part of the movie is that some of the scenes with Diesel 10 were scary to my two year old son. Yet these scenes help to create the tension needed to propel the story. Also, the scenes with Thomas are great and so is the theme of being, "responsible, reliable, and really useful."
