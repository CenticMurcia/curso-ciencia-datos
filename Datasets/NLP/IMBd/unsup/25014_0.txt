This could possibly be the worst Australian Movie ever made. Claudia Karvan has come a long way from this sad excuse for a movie. The storyline is unbelievable (unless you think a pleasure boat could actully travel from Melb to Sth Africa (which it clearly could not). The characters are shallow and the dialogue is very "dumb aussie".<br /><br />Avoid this one people.
