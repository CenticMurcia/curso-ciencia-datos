what shall i say what hasn't been said so far. "absolute Giganten" is one of my all-time favorite flicks. This movie has everything, it deals with great friendship, melancholy, a lot of fun, tragic and love. The imagery is beautiful, the spare dialogues rock. Its set in Hamburg, and i can't imagine any other place that would have worked out that well with the plot and the feeling. Great actors as well, "DULLE, DULLE, DULLE" ;)<br /><br />I envy all the people who haven't seen it so far, because they can experience it the first time. So go and watch it.<br /><br />p.s. on october,26 2006 schippers second movie will hit the screen - "Ein Freund von mir"
