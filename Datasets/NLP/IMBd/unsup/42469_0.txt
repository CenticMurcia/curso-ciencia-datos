I just watched this with my kids. It's kind of boring and hard to pay attention to at times. I found the humor to be pretty juvenile, which would make it great for kids except that the juvenile humor also has adult themes. I enjoy campy comedy. However, this movie is just ridiculous and in it's attempt to reach for stupid humor, it achieves half of that goal. The stupid half. I didn't leave the theater feeling like they owed me two hours of my life back, but it certainly wasn't close to justifying the ticket price. I found the acting to be less than believable. I didn't expect award winning performances, but the characters should be believable even in less than believable stories.
