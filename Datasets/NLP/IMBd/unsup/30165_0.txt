Death 4 Told is what it is- a low budget "Creep Show"-esk horror film filled with cameos and loaded with zombies, gore, haunted houses and cheesy valley girl screams; a b-horror film lover's dream! The film is put together very creatively through the twisted eye of writer/director Bo Buckley and the "star" of the movie, Margot Kidder, gives a wonderful performance backed strongly by a slew of very talented new comers and old hats that should not be overlooked.<br /><br />This very "un-mainstream" level film is a horror gem that is absolutely worth a peek and I look forward to the future blood-covered delights created by the fearmakers team.
