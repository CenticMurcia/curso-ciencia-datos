What do you get when you mix HORRIBLE writing, bad acting, shortsighted direction and some of the stupidest moments in the history of Cinema? You get Leprechaun (1993), starring Warwick Davis of "Willow" fame and Jennifer Aniston who would later go on to starring in the popular T.V series "Freinds" along side Courteney Cox (Scream), Matthew Perry (The whole nine yards), David Schwimmer (Six Days Seven Nights), and many others. Friends was a well-written and addictive sit-com, which had allot of Star guest appearances including Bruce Willis (Die Hard) and Brad Pitt (Troy). This is of course nothing like Friends. It a simple premise that was poorly executed.<br /><br />When Dan O'Grady returns to the U.S. after stealing some Irish leprechaun's pot of gold, he thinks he can settle down and enjoy his newfound wealth. He thought wrong. The leprechaun followed him and O'Grady barely gets away with his life, having locked the little monster in his basement. Ten years later, J.D. and his spoiled daughter Tory move in. By accident, the leprechaun is released and almost immediately the annoying creature starts to look for his gold, not displaying any respect for human life.
