Strangely watchable, but not at one sitting!!!! Just look at the cast and story - NFL owner dies, leaves team to son-in-law (Kennedy)if he recreates travel of Chat Choo Choo to song (leaves Pennsylvnaia station at a quarter to four, etc) who is married to Hanley (Here Come the Brides, remember?), mistress is Eden, coach of team Namath, etc etc etc. Maybe if I could get a pan and scan edition of just Hanley?
