As every other "shockumentary", "mondo death film" and the like out there "Traces of Death" also holds nothing back and pulls virtually no punches as we are treated to one revolting and sickening clip after another of people dieing and or being horribly injured in ways that no sane clear-thinking person could ever actually fathom! Amongst some of the worst and most vile clips seen in the film include the actual on-air news footage of a disgruntled husband shooting his news reporter wife to death live on Spanish television; a helpless and innocent pig who get's literally roasted to death in a slow and unbelievably sadistic fashion via a blow torch by a group of scientists obviously doing what would be considered now (and even back then) illegal animal experimentation; and a really gross and totally uncensored male-to-female sex-change operation that goes above and beyond anything you might have otherwise seen on TLC's infamous surgery shows! The list of equally as nasty sights and sounds just goes on and on from there I'm sorry to say these, however, were just some of the more shocking and severely stomach-churning things that viewers should probably be made aware of before watching as they are sure to horrify, if not psychologically scar you, depending on the fragility of your mental state at the time of viewing. On a personal note here I watched this lurid and thoroughly disgusting exercise in the grotesque a number of years back right after seeing both "Death Scenes: Volume 1" and "Death Scenes: Volume 2". This and the two aforementioned films have a dark freak-show like allure to them that as ashamed as I am to admit it now was what initially peaked my curiosity and eventually drew me to actually picking them up from my local mom-'n-pop movie store. "Traces of Death", unlike the other two, incorporates only news footage and clips taken from around the world as opposed to the really old police file photos and such which made up the bulk of the others. This makes the film just that much more disturbing if you ask me because when you're looking at live and in motion footage and can see exactly what led up to that person's death, one has a tendency to want to play that terrible scene over and over in their head for days after; and for me it isn't always done intentionally, it's just that it get's in your head and doesn't want to leave until you are able to focus your thoughts on something more pleasant instead until it goes away...which is easier said than done I'm afraid! That is the type of damaging effect such films as this one can truly have on you, and if you find yourself doing the same thing as I just described after watching even one of these films I implore you: please avoid "Traces of Death" like you would the plague because ultimately all it will ever do is give you horrible nightmares and leave you thoroughly nauseated for days after viewing!
