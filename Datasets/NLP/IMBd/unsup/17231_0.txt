This film created quite some controversy. It really depends on how you see it. You shouldn't take it as a drama, that's for sure.<br /><br />I just loved it! It has a great sense of humor. Many really dark humored scenes that made me laugh out aloud, just like the rest of the audience in the cinema I was in.<br /><br />Some bourgeois critics didn't like it, but that for me is only a sign of the narrow mindedness of todays film critics. The film just doesn't follow any of today's rules of art-house cinema. Which is what made it such an refreshing experience to watch for me.<br /><br />A crazy, wild piece of cinema with a strong political message. I liked it much more than "The Edukators", because it's more honest in a sense that it doesn't camouflage it's intent, and also because it's much more satirical.<br /><br />Definitely fun to watch, positively a must-see.
