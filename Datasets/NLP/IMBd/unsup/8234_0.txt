I'm not exactly sure what I expected going into this, but it wasn't really what I got. But that's kind of a good thing. I guess I was expecting some tired old ghost story. What I got was a bit of that, but with a original slant to it. People expecting jumpy thrills will probably be a bit disappointed, but I rather enjoyed the fact that there's a bit more substance to the story. I'll avoid going into the plot much as it would likely give away at least some of the story.<br /><br />I'm not really sure why IMDb lists this as a horror first and foremost. Sure, it has some horror elements, but I wouldn't even call it a thriller (again, it's got some elements, but it doesn't feel like the meat of the story belongs in that genre) let alone a horror. To me it's almost more of a drama about losing a loved one unexpectedly, grieving, closure, and the effects of clinical depression. With a slightly supernatural twist all shot in a documentary style, of course.<br /><br />Again, I'm not really sure what I expected. I think it was more of a bland ghost story, so I was pleasantly surprised by some of the twists and turns the movie takes. I'd definitely recommend it even if it's not exactly (in my mind, anyway) what IMDb says it is.
