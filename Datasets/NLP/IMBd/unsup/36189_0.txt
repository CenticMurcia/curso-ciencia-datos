William Shatner is the acting high-point in this vapid, phoned-in excuse for a film. If that doesn't send you running to another aisle of your video store you should be looking in the S&M section. Related to the first film in name only, it has none of the style, the irony, nor the plot to say nothing of one shred of the acting. And I didn't even like "American Psycho." Lose the catchy soundtrack and there is no reason to even listen to it. Mila Kunis, while pleasant, is a flyweight made-for TV actress and this stinker does nothing to expand that role.<br /><br />Skip it. Sitting in a dark room for two hours would be infinitely preferable. I bet the echo of the last "Cut!" had not faded before this was on its way to the video plant. What a waste of tape.
