Then this would be the last before last seduction, right? It will happen, I am positively sure. But what about this movie? Apparently it is bad if you have seen The Last Seduction PERIOD. I did not see that original and must say that I was pleasantly surprised by number II. I am convinced that it is in a entirely different vein, it is probably more a parody than a follow-up. I felt well entertained and often quite amused.<br /><br />Is this a good bad movie? Definitely! The action is supposed to take place mainly in Barcelona, Spain. But the movie makers had to make do mainly with Cardiff, Wales, Great Britain. So do not expect a presentation of the more glamorous parts of the capital of Catalonia in this movie, the place seems to be populated mainly by Brits here. The storyline is a little sketchy, but where it is unconvincing it adds to the hilarious overall atmosphere. And there really is quite some (intentionally) funny dialog, several good and quick verbal exchanges and a pretty elaborately laid out credit card scam angle which already is of a certain historical value.<br /><br />This certainly is a movie whose cast is above the material. The majority of the actors and actresses are British, and they know their trade. The male lead is very convincing as sleazy wannabe gangster boss with a low I.Q. Joan Severance is pretty much the only American in the cast, she puts the right amount of irony into her performance  and she really has extremely long legs. There is also some great support by Spanish bit players (the Spanish sounds at times a bit shaky, though  but what else can you expect in Cardiff?).<br /><br />The Last Seduction II may also be pleasant to watch for feminists. The two leading female parts order the macho guys around pretty much and are mostly on top. The most funny scene for me was a simple extreme long shot of Severance and the male leading part walking down a street side by side. The man is more than a full head shorter than his companion and although in full macho regalia he looks rumpled and thoroughly miserable.<br /><br />Believe it or not  except for some unnecessary violence I can recommend this movie.
