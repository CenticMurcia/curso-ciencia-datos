I was so disappointed! I had been waiting to see this film for so long, and I think I expected something totally different. I thought the acting was over-the-top and too exaggerated, for example, the swell of 'sexy' 40's era music that played every time Scarlett Johanssen appeared in a scene. Granted, Scarlett was BEAUTIFUL in this movie, she's such a classic beauty, an she was perfect for the time period. However, whenever there was a serious/suspenseful information-revealing type of moment in the movie, the camera would linger on her face for ages while Scarlett's eyebrows furrowed and lips quivered while we waited for her to give a breathless answer of some sort. The love scenes couldn't have had less chemistry, with their contrived spontaneity, and clumsy ripping-off of clothing, and the constant comparison of Hillary Swank's character and Mia Kirshner's character who were supposed to bear an uncanny resemblance to each other in the film, when in reality they look absolutely nothing alike. Not to mention the confusing side crime story that I'm still attempting to decipher three hours after seeing the movie. I will say that the cinematography was great, and the costuming was perfect. But, I was very disappointed with the film in its entirety.
