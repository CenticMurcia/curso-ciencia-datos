I am a great fan of both the series and John Nettles, but the plots of Midsomer Murders seem to be getting more inane with each episode. Granted, there have been some contrived though enjoyable episodes - A Death In Chorus and Country Matters are recent favourites - but this one was terrible.<br /><br />The scene where the digital photographer continually flashed the film photographer by way of intimidation brought laughter and derision from my family, and the ultimate premise was too far-fetched for words.<br /><br />Usually, good acting and production values tend to carry even the more contrived episodes through to a reasonable denouement; for me though, this one was just so silly it was beyond saving.<br /><br />I've read somewhere that the franchise is coming to the end of its run...I hope it goes out on more of a high.
