"It Waits" inspires the same kind of fear that rice cakes do. Not only is it the same garbage as always, it's bad garbage. Rife with every standard post-"X-Files" pseudo-horror trope (look! it's a native American legend! honest!) but with the added bonus of having a soundtrack straight out of a 1992 romantic comedy/drama, this film is insulting to the viewer in every way possible. The only (and I do mean _only_) reason I didn't give this film a 1/10 is because "666: The Demon Child" is worse. I beg you, the viewer, not to waste your time watching this kind of thing. We can't keep settling for these bland horror-placebos. It's time that we stand up and demand that real horror film-makers have their chance to shine.<br /><br />I had to buy "Deadbirds" from a video rental store that was closing, and "It Waits" gets international airtime on digital cable. There truly is no justice in the world.
