"12 angry men" was really a disappointment for a guy like me who waited for 1 hour to watch a story in the film...but after an hour i have realized that how wrong i was to download such a film..i was so much desperate to watch dis flick and in the end it disappointed very much.<br /><br />I've heard people saying it is a simple story though i din' found it simple rather i found it irritating. There was no reason for making such movie and moreover no reason to share a place in top 10 list.<br /><br />I can not see even a single positive point about the film except few dialogues..few dialogues were excellent..henry fonda was average but unfortunately sidney lumet nowhere shows the direction which i was expecting from such a good director.<br /><br />just 12 jurors fighting on a murder and the life of the kid was in their hands. 11 were in the favor of GUILTY for the kid, while one was saying the kid on whom the blame was to kill his father was NOT GUILTY and after more than 1 hour of distracting and boring discussion the alone juror who feels the kid was not guilty was successful in changing the mind of other 11 jurors and in the end saved the life of the kid.<br /><br />Watch it on your on sake.. 3.9/10
