I stumbled on this little gem a few months ago on IFC, and just watched it again today. If there was an Academy Award category for "Best Modernistic Recreation of Classic Hollywood Styles" this film would have won hands down. Gibson Frazier is amazing, channeling the spirit of Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd with a script that reads like a Robert Heinlein short story. (Or perhaps Harlan Ellison...) Hang your belief at the door and flow with the fantasy. You are not going to learn any deep truths here. Except perhaps how to make a really snappy film on small change. The plot (what there is of it, and be fair, not many reporter/gangster film from the 20's and 30's did either) moves Frazier from the clean black and white world of New York to its darker underbelly without once getting dirty or losing the starch on his Herbert Hoover collar. Worth you 80 minutes. More so if you love old 'B' movies.
