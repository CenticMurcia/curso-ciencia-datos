I love Juliette Binoche. I have seen every movie that she has made that has been available in the U.S. While the trailer for this movie didn't sound like something I would be interested in, I had to give it a try. I should have stuck with my instincts.<br /><br />The performances by Binoche and Jean Reno were good, there wasn't enough in the storyline for them to do anything with. It is a story of two miserable people to have a chance meeting at an airport and start a relationship. Neither character had any appeal to me, nor did there appear to be any chemistry between the two actors.<br /><br />In short, this movie had very little in the way of a plot. It was supposed to be a romantic comedy, but nowhere in this movie did I even chuckle.<br /><br />While this isn't a terrible movie, it is without substance. I would have to recommend staying away from this one.
