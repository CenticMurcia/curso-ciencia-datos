A famous photographer wants to shoot photo shoots in an old asylum with three hot young girls. The company that owns the property insists that their representative be present. The representative (hero-boy) immediately and constantly antagonizes and confronts the photographer because of the harsh treatment of the girls. My question: Why would a famous photographer put up with such a macho hero-boy doing his best to ruin the shoots? This was the foremost unrealistic aspect of this movie for me.<br /><br />But famous photographer continues putting up with hero-boys crap, and the movie plods on. Lots of boring talk with the photographer verbally abusing the girls and threatening to fire them if they don't do what he says. Yawn. Nothing much happens until the end, when an ugly ghost possesses the photographer and hero-boy saves the day for the girls.<br /><br />Really one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and not one that is so bad it is good. This one is just a bore.
