...but there's no hope for the QUEST OF THE DELTA KNIGHTS. Ever wandered into a renaissance fair? Ever HEARD of a renaissance fair? Good, you're qualified to be a historical consultant when the sequel comes around. Seriously, folks, it's jaw-dropping misfire after misfire, as Lord David Warner chases David Warner the Taupe with an army of vikings, ay-rabs, pirates, and various castle types who thankfully have very short attention spans, because they never chase Warner and his ward for very long... or maybe Warner lost 'em at the inn/whorehouse. Aside from the prostitutes and a scene with urine-tossing though, QUEST is inoffensive enough, and manages to cram more idiocy into its approx. 90 minutes than most 2 hour Blockbusters. Plus, after a while the quantum-fractured wasteland this film takes place in starts to grow on you... a giant hand shaped rock made sense after the tree village (elevation: 3 feet) of cretins, the goon squad dressed as vaguely menacing knights, and the endless rolling hillocks and groves that made it undoubtedly clear that this movie takes place in...Europe... somewhere... or other. It's flashing bouncing stoopid entertainment and I wish the people who made it better luck with their future endeavors. Or more talent. The title was cool.<br /><br />Huh huh... wizard wizz.
