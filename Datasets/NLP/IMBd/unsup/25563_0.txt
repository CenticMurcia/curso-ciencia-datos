In honor of today being Election Day and having previously seen both Betty Boop for President and Olive Oyl for President, I just went to the Misce-Looney-ous site to watch Daffy Duck for President which it linked from YouTube. Originally storyboarded by Chuck Jones and turned into a book before his untimely death, this latter-day Warner Bros. cartoon was another entertaining lesson on American customs which Jones had previously done with Porky Pig on Old Glory back in 1939. Daffy decides to run as the Commander-In-Chief thinking he'll be able to make a law abolishing rabbits. Bugs tells him that the president can only enact laws so Daffy runs for Congress in order to get rabbit season to occur "12 months of the year". Turns out he's the only supporter of that bill! Basically this was a good way to get children to learn the Constitution and the three branches of government involving two beloved cartoon characters. Joe Alaskey was a fine pick in continuing the familiar voices created by the late Mel Blanc. And kudos for the two directors, Spike Brandt and Tony Cervone, for doing Mr. Jones proud with their pacing of the animation scenes as well as printing a dedication to his memory. My favorite punchline came from Bugs, "At least you're not a lame duck!" This short is available on the Looney Tunes Golden Collection, Volume 2 DVD set.
