I'm a guy. I first saw this film in bar full of bikers. And STILL I cried! I've only seen it one more time since then, and that's not nearly enough. Look, let's start a letter-writing campaign to TNT or TCM or SOMEBODY to broadcast this movie again. It's a crime to let it fade away into obscurity! Seriously, we need to get organized about this. We should choose a cable channel, find out exactly who schedules the programming, and bombard that person or those persons with hundreds of hard copy letters, not e-mails. Address them by name, be polite, make very sure how much this means to you, and convince them that this film can attract a huge cult following. This is a movie for future generations, not just the 70s generation! Don't you want to be able to share this with your kids and your grand kids? Let's get started. We need to save this film.
