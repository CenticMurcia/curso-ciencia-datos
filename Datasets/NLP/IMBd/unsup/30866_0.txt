First, it is important to say that as a rule I like Sandler. I feel he was able to roll a successful comic career into a sometimes brilliant movie career. While I generally don't expect a deep experience, he is entertaining and sometimes touching in his work.<br /><br />That being said, this movie was a complete waste of time. Yes, I got the Israeli references. Yes, I got the New York angle. And, yes, I was very alive during the 80's and the attempts at humor were not lost on me. Quite simply, the material wasn't funny. I don't mean it was "unfunny" by comedy standards, I mean it was unfunny by Adam Sandler standards.<br /><br />There were a couple of scenes that were quite humorous, and they thankfully weren't drawn out to lose the effect. Unfortunately, there was nothing of redeemable value to link those moments together.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor, if you aren't a Sandler fan, don't go near this steaming pile and if you are, fight the urge to "give this a try" and go watch your favorite Sandler flick instead.<br /><br />2 Stars is being generous.
