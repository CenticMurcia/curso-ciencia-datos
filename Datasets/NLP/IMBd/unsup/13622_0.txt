For a 1932 film, this had a lot of good moments. I thought the scenes with Roberta as a baby were wonderful -- very good direction. But then, it's Frank Capra.<br /><br />What I couldn't really follow was the point of the first five minutes of the movie. We know she's going on a vacation with her life savings, but why set her up as a small town librarian and then never make reference to that part of her life again in the movie? Seemed unnecessary and a little confusing. And who names their daughter Lulu? But the best part of the movie -- the best worst part -- is how old everybody gets after only about sixteen years. Stanwyck's character is probably only about 40 at the end of the movie, but 40 in 1932 is like 70, clearly, so they pile on the make-up and give her a grey wig. At least she's not wearing a shawl and walking with a cane. She actually carries off those scenes well, and she looks gorgeous. I really enjoyed it.
