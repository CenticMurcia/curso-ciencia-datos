As a pilot rated in both airplanes and helicopters I was appalled at the gross lack of technical accuracy in portraying the in flight emergency. I can't believe that with all the aircraft used in this film that the producers did not get any technical advice. The engine problem was never accurately portrayed and even a trainee on twin engine aircraft would have known to feather the prop so it would not be windmilling and creating more drag. An emergency locater beacon is required on every King Air aircraft of the type used in the film would have pinpointed the aircraft's location quickly. I hate it when aircraft movies feed more inaccurate information to an audience which may be fearful and unknowledgeable of aviation. The story was also unrealistic when I discussed it with friends of mine who are in the medical transportation field. The producers should be penalized for such an ignorant attempt of a film.
