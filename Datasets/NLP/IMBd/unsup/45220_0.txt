"D.E.B.S." is the interesting title of a film which just doesn't seem to know what audience it's trying to shoot for. (In case you were wondering, "D.E.B.S." is an acronym for "Discipline Energy Beauty Strength") The film is definitely going to be a 'head turner' not because it stars some very attractive actresses, but because of the 'love-story' that sprouts between two of the lead female characters. Yes, you read right, two of the female characters turn out to be lesbians.<br /><br />Now, there's nothing wrong with lesbianism, but it seems as if it's a very touchy subject that not too many people will understand, especially if they're a bit more on the conservative side.<br /><br />Nonetheless, that part of the movie is beside the point. It's a comedy that tries it's best to spoof the typical spy/action/adventure/thriller genre by adding it's own humorous twists to it.<br /><br />There were some moments where I actually laughed a little bit, but the moments where I did laugh were due to some of the audience members saying funny things (No, the movie did not make me laugh in the least bit). Overall, the movie left a lot to be desired in terms of storyline. The humor of the movie was not even along the lines of quality similar to a 'Naked Gun' or 'Airplane', but some sort of generic type of humor which tries too hard to please many audiences.<br /><br />The one thing that did surprise me were the special effects. There were some pretty interesting visuals that caught my attention, especially for being kind of original. (Most notably being The "force field" and "laser trip wires" around the D.E.B.S.' house/dorm and the "hologram" technology that the Directors of the D.E.B.S. use frequently throughout the film) Will the male viewers like this film? Yes, because there are some very attractive 'eye candy' actresses starring in it, some of whom also end up locking lips at several points (I won't spoil that part for you). But, that's where it's going to stop for most male movie-goers.<br /><br />Will the female viewers like this film? Yes, not only because there are many humorous references that only females would truly understand (I'll be honest, I didn't laugh at some of the 'jokes' because they were probably intended for the female viewers. I'm a male.), but because there's a certain amount of plot that only female viewers can really latch on to.<br /><br />Genders aside, will the distinguished movie-goer like this film? NOT A CHANCE. Think of this film as a type of "Spy Kids" movie, but only aimed at the 16-30 audience base. This is also a film that most parents should NOT let their younger children watch, due to the various adult themes. (Note for parents: You think it's difficult to explain "The Birds & The Bees" to your young ones? Try explaining the idea of homosexuality to your youngsters.) I highly doubt that this movie will make anything close to $20 Million, given the fact that it has a touchy subject that most of the conservative folks will try to bash upon. Even if it didn't have that 'shocking twist' (lesbianism), this movie would STILL be a garbage-throw away-not-even-average film. (I will give it this much though; At least it's not a film directed by Uwe Boll. *UGH*) I'm glad I didn't have to pay to see this movie. (Free preview tickets rule!) I would have felt so ripped off if I did pay. Then again, I probably wouldn't have even wanted to see this movie if I did have to pay. This film certainly wasn't on my "Must See" list for 2005, that's for sure.
