Let me begin by saying that I love (1) interesting, well-defined female characters dealing with everyday problems, (2) well-made independent films and (3) James Marsters (not necessarily in that order). Unfortunately, "Winding Roads" satisfied me on only one of the above counts (that being #3).<br /><br />The premise of the film sounded promising to me (three female friends weathering different challenges at the same time in their lives). However, the script doesn't allow us to spend enough time with the characters or go fully into their motivations. In the case of the Rachel Hunter character, this is unfortunate. In the case of the Kimberly Quinn character, it renders her (in my opinion) unsympathetic, as her decisions and actions are without any real foundation or concrete motivation.<br /><br />I don't want to go into spoilers because, frankly, I don't want to spend too much time writing about a movie that already took up ninety minutes of my life that I can never retrieve. There are many talented actors in "Winding Roads" (Hunter and Marsters, in particular, made the most with what they were given). With more carefully-written characters and plot, this could have been a very affecting movie. As is, it just left me feeling kind of "eh". I cannot recommend it.
