The budget for this film was obviously completely spent on the stunts and the explosions, leaving nothing to the writers. How can one explain this film otherwise?<br /><br />Out of all the B-movies I have watched lately, this one must have been the most predictable yet inconsistent, irrational, inaccurate and downright plain dumb, making it purely an insult to the viewer's intelligence. In fact, I have found myself laughing out loud in scenes that were probably supposed to be very dramatic.<br /><br />Gary Daniels is playing Ray Morgan, a police detective making the mistake of killing the son of an obviously very important man in the local underworld (Sloan). From this point on, Morgan's life turns into a living hell, as Sloan decides to wage a little war against the ones responsible for the death of his son in particular, and apparently against the rest of the world in general, namely the local police station, families, friends and other innocent people passing by. When the fog of war clears up, Morgan finds himself alone, discovering all that are close to him are either dead or affiliated with Sloan. Being left only with a vengeance, Morgan sets out to destroy the man who destroyed him.<br /><br />This pretty standard setting, along with a lousy script and a lousy post-production job, created an action packed comedy (well, I've found it quite hilarious). When overlooking the flaws of the film, you get quite a good action flick: there are grand chases (quite stupid, but grand nonetheless), loads of explosions, numerous shooting scenes, a high body count and finally a naked woman (the lovely Griffin Drew) -- all of which are essential ingredients for a decent action flick. However, there are a lot of flaws to overlook. I won't even start to list the inconsistencies of this flick or explain the foolishness presented in the flick, since doing so will generate quite a long list. On the other hand, if I were to give only a few examples, the whole image would not have been perceived, and you would have probably called me a perfectionist or a snob, so I won't do that either.<br /><br />So if you're looking for pure action, choosing this flick might be a good choice. However, if you fear knowing reality or having good taste will damage your satisfaction, go for another feature (True Lies is good...).<br /><br />
