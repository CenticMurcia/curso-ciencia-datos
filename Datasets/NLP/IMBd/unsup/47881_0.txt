This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen! I was shocked at how bad it was. One of the stupidest plots ever, with ridiculous situations that made no sense (ie, with all their intricate planning, why was it so hard for them to get away from the police?). Michael Caine was totally wasted- it seemed like the director just said "Act angry the whole time". Plot lines went nowhere- the girlfriend just disappeared halfway through the movie, never to be seen again. What kind of movie were they trying to make? Comedy? Crime drama? Wacky farce? They couldn't seem to decide- there was lighthearted, goofy music at times, other times it was quite violent (ie, the clubbing of the guards). Massive quantities of illogic and/or breaking the laws of physics that were impossible to ignore (ie, the whole bus scene at the end). Even the enjoyment of watching cute little Mini Coopers couldn't make up for all the garbage that this movie contained. Watch the newer one instead- it's vastly better.
