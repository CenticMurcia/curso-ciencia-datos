This film failed for me on several levels and only entertained me just enough to keep me from heading for the exit.<br /><br />Just as when Action/Adventure films cover up a weak story with expensive CGI or Hi-Tech action sequences; this fiasco does the same with eloquent dialogue and the grace and beauty of the 'period' part of the story.<br /><br />Why does the lead (present day) male character have such a passionate aversion to relationships? What triggers the sudden change? She is a rude, frigid 'lady', who also uncharacteristically falls in love with him, an American slob. None of this is explained to my satisfaction.<br /><br />In the story of the past; why did the female lead have to be a lesbian. It neither mirrors nor compliments the main plot. A myriad of near misses and plot twists make the rest of this tale completely unbelievable. The worst for me was the ultra-weak nonsense of the dialogue regarding Ms. Paltrow's character's brooch. Spare me, that was simply nonsense.<br /><br />The only redeeming feature of this Romance/Mystery/Adventure (?) was the mystery involved in gathering the evidence. I think that despite the grandiose vernacular (hey!) and the beauty of the scenes and decor in the 'past', this stinker was just another emperor who wasn't really wearing any clothes.
