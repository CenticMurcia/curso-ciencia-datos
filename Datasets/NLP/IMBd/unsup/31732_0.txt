I liked Pretty Cool one a lot more, had some great comedy, this one didn't seem to have a plot or story, the best actress was the science girl, she has potential to be a good actress I think. And I also noticed one of the actresses was the only one to run around with her top off all of the time displaying her silicon all of the time (perhaps that's all she could do to get the part & that's as far as her acting skills go) pretty sad, this guys other movies look a lot better. to top it off the DVD froze toward the end, it was the only one available at blockbuster, guess they only carry one copy at a time. I see this guy's next movie will star Pamela Anderson and Denise Richards, that one looks like it will be one worth watching in theatres, not just because of the talented actresses but because it sounds like it has a great plot and story. I suggest you all check that one out as well and pass on this one if you haven't already.
