Yawn. This movie is a real snoozefest. As someone who is in an interracial marriage, I was curious to see how this movie handled this issue. Had it not been for this personal reason, there is no way I could have sat through this incredibly boring movie. The only parts of the movie that really made me laugh were the few scenes with Alex Whitman (Matthew Perry's) parents. These couple of pages had some real energy to them. Too bad the rest of the movie did not.
