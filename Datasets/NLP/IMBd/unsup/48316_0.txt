Some films are deliberately downbeat and depressing; this film achieves that by default. The mid seventies were a high point for British TV - The Sweeney, Fawlty Towers, Rising Damp, Morecambe and Wise, Are you Being Served and many others; in all other ways British culture was at a low point. This film more than demonstrates that. Glam Rock was over, Punk hadn't started. There were two choices, Bay City Rollers for the kids, or bloated (if you'll pardon the pun) prog rock and heavy metal for the adults. Really not a good time for cinema to make a sexploitation comedy concerning pop music then! In fact as welcome as wearing a West Ham shirt at Millwall was at that time.<br /><br />A sex comedy that is neither sexy nor funny, and these days you won't even be able to go to a Berni Inn in your Austin Maxi to refresh your jaded palate after watching.<br /><br />But I have to agree - the appearance of Liam Gallagher's doppleganger provides a jaw dropping moment!
