When this movie appeared in the 1970's poll, I could not avoid laughing. I saw it back then at the local Drive-In with a date. This is classic Drive-In date fare. It is bad, but then, that is part of what taking a date to the Drive-In was about. You didn't want anything too good. It had sufficient scaries and jumpy spots to make it perfect date stuff. In the unlikely event you ever find a copy of this movie, grab your honey, pop some popcorn, turn out the lights and snuggle up on the couch (make sure you are alone in the house). The nostalgia trip with far outshadow the movie.
