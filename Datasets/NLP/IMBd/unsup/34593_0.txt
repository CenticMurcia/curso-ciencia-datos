This movie made me realize why I didn't watch the cartoon as a child: It's not funny. I had hoped that any project with Robert DeNiro and Jason Alexander would be worth the price of admission and had thought that my kids (aged 10 & 5) would enjoy this film. Unfortunately, even my five year old thought it "just wasn't funny". I hope DeNiro made a lot of money because he lost a lot of my respect by involving himself in something so crappy. The only person involved in this "film" that merited any consideration was Jonathon Winters, who could have been funny at the Neuremburg Trials. A viable alternative to the death penalty would be repeated viewing of this movie. I rated it a 2 out of 10.
