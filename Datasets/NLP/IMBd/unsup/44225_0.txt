STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />Burnt out Vietnam vet Mac McDonald (action 'superstar' Michael Dudikoff-hahaha- as he is described on the back cover) now gets by making dodgy deals with shady characters. But when a deal goes wrong, a young woman is kidnapped and is witnessed by Fraser (Stephen Dorff) a young man who's been following her around photographing her. Mac and Fraser are unwittingly thrown together in a desperate cross country chase to find her, getting on each other's nerves no end but bonding together more and more so as the chase goes on.<br /><br />Dudikoff wishes he was an 'action superstar' or even that anyone would care to see him in a break from form in this sort of buddy buddy, male bonding sort of film. What's more surprising is a much younger Stephen Dorff in the supporting role, a 'before he was famous' moment before he was the villain in the Blade films. But what a creepy character he's playing, a kid who basically stalks the hot chick from school on his scooter bike, flashing his camera at her...no wonder she wants nothing to do with him. You wonder what's on his mind, tying her up, raping her, chopping her into tiny little pieces??? Urrgh, most unpleasant character. Aaargh, but then his daddy's been killed in the army, so maybe he's not so awful after all. But then later on, to wit a touching, sentimental moment when he has a heart to heart and then loses his virginity to a prostitute?!? What's going on with this film??? And then there's Dudikoff, who we have every reason to believe is a drug dealer until about a quarter of the way into it. Oh, so he's dealing stamps, he's still dealing with criminals, or people he must be smart enough to know are criminals, so that doesn't make it much better, does it? <br /><br />On less creepy, morally troubling notes, the film just seems to be a mess of all different types of films, unsure of what it actually wants to be. An action film, a male bonding film, a rites of passage adventure, a comedy. It certainly doesn't work as all of these and in the end just comes off as very boring, with any sign of decent action at the end, by which time you've long lost interest. Stay away. *
