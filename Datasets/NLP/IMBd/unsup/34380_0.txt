Why the *beep* did they cast Ben Browder to play in this movie at all? He can't act, and his voice don't fit the screen or his character. Sure you can say "he was in SG-1!". Let me get this straight. When you get an actor trying to imitate another actors character (guess who) it never EVER works. They would have been better off starting the story with his tragic death... somewhere in the lines of -he cut off his own head while shaving.<br /><br />Cheesy costumes, childish lines, bad musical score, and overall a whole mess storywise. And I almost forgot to mention the overacting... oh boy...<br /><br />None of the characters seem real anymore, because their lines worked against them (with the exception of Christopher Judge who did a good job with the piece of crap he was given).<br /><br />Avoid this one unless you're a die hard SG fan. I'll give this a 2 since Teal'k made at least 6 minutes of the movie watchable.
