****Excellent<br /><br />***Good<br /><br />**Fair<br /><br />*Poor<br /><br />This is the third installment in the Dirty Harry franchise and probably should have been the last. After successfully creating a character who's as brutal as the enemy in a violent society Clint Eastwood turns Dirty Harry into an action star. No longer is Harry battling the enemy but his female partner who has to prove to Harry that she can be a great cop.<br /><br />The plot is actually quite good and Eastwood still delivers but the film lacks impact and the art imitating life premise is gone. Not to mention that the action scenes are a bit dated. <br /><br />RATING: 2 STARS<br /><br />Mustapha: You really *are* a dirty son of a b---h. <br /><br />Harry Callahan: The dirtiest.
