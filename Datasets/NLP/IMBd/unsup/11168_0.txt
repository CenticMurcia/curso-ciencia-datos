This coming-of-age, romance, baseball story has every smaltzy, sentimental, semi-mental, feel bad, feel good cliche that ever graced a 50's big studio or Disney flick. There isn't one original scene, situation, or piece of dialogue in the whole movie. To make it worse, every point made on the screen is hammered home immediately afterward by having a character tell us what we just saw. The acting is nearly as bad as the screenplay. How is 104 minutes of unlikeable characters whining, crying, and refusing to act with any intelligence supposed to entertain or enlighten us? <br /><br /> I thought they didn't make them like this any more; unfortunately, sometimes they still do. If "The Natural" is a home run into the light towers, then "The Road Home" is a dribbler to first base.
