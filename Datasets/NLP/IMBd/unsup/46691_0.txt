A film that probably could have been 15 minutes long.<br /><br />I was expecting an action/disaster movie, instead I got an overlong and often boring human drama played out between a husband and wife. I found it unrealistic - so in love but when she first returns to the house he wouldn't let her in! And as for the 'twist' - I didn't see it coming but it was not so much a twist, more of a cop-out ending.<br /><br />Very dull and mis-sold on the trailers as some kind of action movie.<br /><br />Maybe my comment is negative based upon an unrealised expectation, but hey, blame that on those who put together the trailer and marketed this movie.<br /><br />Plus points could be the acting which was fine, but I often found myself paying more attention to the shaky camera work - why the director decided on this style during even the most heartbreaking scenes is beyond me.
