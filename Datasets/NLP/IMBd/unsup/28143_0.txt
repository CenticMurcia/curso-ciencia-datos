I Like the horror genre and THE GIRL NEXT DOOR is on a different level.<br /><br />This movie is so realistic to the teeth, that it makes you think about life. It makes you think that all the flashy movies you have ever seen are like cartoons compare to this.<br /><br />It's about child abuse, torture, and manipulation.<br /><br />It shows how powerful a parent affects a child's mind.<br /><br />I don't know, I'm still very disturbed by the movie.<br /><br />Although, I would want more bad things to happen to that witch and her boys, the movie ends very well.<br /><br />It's not about revenge, more like a lesson to be thought, that there are sick people out there who are actually doing this to children, and the question is what are you going to do about it?
