This film would have to rank as one of my top ten movies of all time along with Casablanca, Day For Night, O Brother, Where Art Thou? and the Godfather. True to life; unpredictable; filled with metaphor; acted beautifully; filmed with splendor; spellbinding; are just a few of its positives. <br /><br />Six hours is a long time for any movie. Reluctant to go to such a huge commitment of time, a friend convinced me to sneak into the last hour of the second half. I was hooked. I attended the first three hours the next night and the final three hours the following evening. I then bought the DVD, which is something I rarely do.<br /><br />The characters are real. They act the way we all do: with imperfection, hesitation, regret and courage. Kismet and chance are as important as direction and drive. Life is full of surprises but our path, our mistaken goals, and our view of life propel us like invisible currents in the sea of life. Power, attention, revenge and avoidance of failure, are addressed as a mosaic of human personality and potential. Success or failure is not presented as some "feel good" Hollywood formula, but as a confrontation with good and evil. Life is complicated. There are no easy answers; only painful journeys that once ventured can transcend the pain. But there are no guarantees.<br /><br />Thank you Dan, for sneaking me into the Oak Street Cinema. It has enriched my life.
