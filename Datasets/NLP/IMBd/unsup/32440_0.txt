Too bad I can not assign a 0.<br /><br />This mind-bending garbage has Loni Anderson, Dom Deluise, and Jennifer Love Hewitt in a steaming pile of a kids movie. The pitch was clearly "ET meets Gremlins, but without the scary gremlins." They even stole the scene where ET flies in front of a full moon.<br /><br />Munchie is ancient, grants wishes, but doesn't really do anything cool besides fly a pizza into the kids room when he is denied dinner. Loni Anderson shows off fine plastic surgery work, there is the requisite mad scientist neighbor, and the evil stepdad figure and "i wish my dead dad was here to see this" type writing.<br /><br />What I love about this movie is that there are all these C-List actors in what is just a totally botched Z-grade kids movie. The writing is terrible, the puppet is literally a teddy ruxpin rip off with no facial expressions, mouth that just opens and closes, and eyes that only move horizontally. Mystery Science would have had a field day with this vomit. Truly terrible.
