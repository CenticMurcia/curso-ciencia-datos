This film, with a shoestring budget and a few cast members, unexpectedly satisfied my longing for brilliant Filipino film-making. Although, at times the movie was annoying, all the minor slights were forgiven in the end. I can't help but cringe on the voice over that they used for the terrorist and the shaky camera handling which almost induced vertigo among the viewers. Certain parts of the dialogue were unnecessary and were probably added to the film just to trigger shock from the audience. Nevertheless, the movie's sum is definitely greater than its parts. The depiction of the slums, streets and people of the Philippines was very realistic. The scenes were so vivid that the audience would actually feel like being transported to where the shots were taken. Cinematography and editing were fantastic - I like how the same frames, i.e. face of the lead actor, were illustrated from various angles. Very cutting-edge for novice film makers! The plot they tried to tackle was very touchy, but they delivered it in a straight-forward, in your face manner. Overall, this is a film that I would recommend for anyone who enjoys watching Filipino films! Good Job on this one!
