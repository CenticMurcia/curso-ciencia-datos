Almost every minute of the film is predictable and the stupid behaviors of the FBI agent and his wife make it worse.<br /><br />Agent Novack tells captain to keep it quiet after finding the body but he acts just opposite, running like crazy all the time and screaming at people. He also questions suspects in a way not really fits an FBI agent. He looks for the guy while on the phone but doesn't notice that our killer is not there(he was a suspect too) and goes on.<br /><br />His wife Michelle Novack is more dumb than him as she leaves her son alone and goes up and down all the time just because of curiosity. So it was obvious that their son was going to be kidnapped. That behavior was really annoying of hers i kept myself saying "Go back to your kid woman!". One more thing about her is that when the killer wants her to come down he goes directly without telling to her husband. Killer wouldn't know about it.<br /><br />This film lacks acting, script, and logic which make it completely waste of time.
