TLJ's understated tour de force - of course Daniel Day-Lewis got the 2007 Oscar for showing the world what a great actor he is (and he is, don't get me wrong). <br /><br />On the other hand, Tommy Lee Jones doesn't show off his acting skills, he shows us a man, a troubled man, a, restrained, some would say uptight individual, a loving but maybe distant father, a remote and quite desperate husband, with all his prejudices and doubts. A performance not to be missed, it won't leave you untouched.<br /><br />It's a pity that this film probably won't be watched by the general public in the US - it's probably too devoid of outright action to appeal to moviegoers. Still, I feel it's one of the best and most thought provoking war films I've seen.
