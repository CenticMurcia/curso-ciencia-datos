I HATE censorship but this film needed it. I have nothing against the issues explored but there was unnecessary nudity of a minor in a sexual way. There was also unnecessary sexual innuendo of a minor that was not vital to the plot and that is just wrong. I think this film is a sorry excuse for child porn and questions must be raised at the director's choice of cuts and the need for some of the sexual scenes that were not vital to the plot.<br /><br />Other issues: the plot was not that good and the camera work was unnecessarily shaky.<br /><br />The one plus point is that I could see the actress who player Melissa doing a lot more and a lot better in the future but if she continues with this kind of film she will tarnish her reputation for future non-porn films.
