This made for TV movie would be ok if you left out the second half of the film. The plot starts out good, but gets progressively dumber as the film moves on. The film keeps a good pace and can even give a scare in places, but overall, I'm not impressed - and the bad effects make the movie rated only a 3 in my book.
