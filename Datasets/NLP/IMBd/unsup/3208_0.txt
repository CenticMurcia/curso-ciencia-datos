But I just couldn't believe that this was really happening. Where were the isolation chambers? Where were all the medics? Where were the police and the politicians?<br /><br />If it had been set in the 50s I might have been able to tolerate it, but it had been updated to 2005 and as a result it just looked lame. My suspension of disbelief lasted about five minutes before I started to get annoyed with it. The presence of Indira Varma kept me watching a little longer until I was forced to hit the fast-forward button after about half an hour.<br /><br />If this had happened today, the crashed rocket would have been surrounded by troops, police, scientists, stripey red and yellow tape, covered with a tarpaulin with filtered air, and no-one would have been allowed near it for at least a week until all possible biohazard and radiation tests had been made.<br /><br />Just too frustratingly unrealistic for me. Oh - and the soft focus effect all the way through - puhlleeze!!
