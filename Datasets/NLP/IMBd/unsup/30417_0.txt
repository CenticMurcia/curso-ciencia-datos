This film is likely the best view in the world of early television. Though most of the audience didn't know it at the time, the large part of TV performers were second-rate, washed-up, or suffered with substance abuse. Surprisingly, many of them had great success in this new format.<br /><br />The cast all fit the time period excellently. Peter O'Toole is perfectly cast as the aging drunkard who wishes for his former glory and Mark Linn-Baker is good as the ambitious young writer. The whole film is brimming with energy and cleverness, more than it's share, but kept together by director Richard Benjamin.<br /><br />7.1 out of 10
