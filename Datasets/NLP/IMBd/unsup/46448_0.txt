The short films of Kenneth Anger are certainly NOT for the casual film goer! The best way to describe them is avant-garde--and often make little sense, as they are not meant to be shown to the masses. Some are incredibly artistic--like filmed work of art. Some are really cheaply made and definitely look it. Regardless, they are a challenge to watch and I very strongly recommend you see them with his commentary activated. So why would I see these shorts? Well, in a recent interview I noticed that John Waters credits Anger for much of his inspiration. And, since I have seen all the films of Waters that are available (a couple very early ones aren't), it seems natural I'd give Anger's films a try. This and four other reviews are best on the DVD "Films of Kenneth Anger: Volume 1".<br /><br />Watching and rating PUCE MOMENT was very difficult. While it was not an unpleasant short film, it really only was a snippet--part of a longer film that either no longer exists or which wasn't completed. As such, there really isn't a coherent story, just some nicely filmed footage of a 20s-inspired actress dressing and leaving her home. While not particularly interesting on its own, Anger's commentary is interesting--especially regarding what happened to this actress later in life.<br /><br />Overall, not a bad film but too short and disjoint.
