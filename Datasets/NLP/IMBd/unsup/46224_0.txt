Possible Spoilers I wanted to give this stinker a 1 but the dialogue was so bad that I laughed until I had tears running down face. "I killed you fish, my brother". "They fed the negro rum". "Come on hand, come on hand". Jeez this movie is worth it just to get a few solid belly laughs. I just couldn't take this movie seriously, it was way too cheezy. "He said". "He thought". Yes, even the narration was so bad it was funny.
