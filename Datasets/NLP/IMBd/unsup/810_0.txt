I saw this movie again recently. The first time I saw it I was incredulous, and the second time, even more so. Is this really truly how health care is funded in America?? Isn't there any kind of public system at all? <br /><br />I just can't get over the apparent fact that a country that claims to be the most advanced of the so called developed countries would only have private health care. It's ridiculous. <br /><br />Here only elective surgery is rationed, hip replacements, cataract surgery, that kind of thing. If you've got insurance, then you can go private, but otherwise, if you've got enough points, you get put on the waiting list and you eventually get your op for free. (The thing with the heart transplant would *never* happen here, that sort of thing isn't covered by our main health insurance company, as it's fully funded by the government.) <br /><br />Although people are constantly winging and moaning about expensive doctor visits, (about NZ$50-$60 for an unsubsidised adult) if you need to go to A & E, you just go. In an ambulance, or otherwise. You don't have to ask permission. <br /><br />What, prey tell, do people do if they can't afford health insurance?
