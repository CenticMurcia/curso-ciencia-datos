this movie kept me thinking all of the run-time. it is good because of the content, actors, script and pace. what i liked best was the way the movie got me thinking about problems. how do problems from your youth develop in your life, how often parents made the problems (worse), how different ages and experience react to your problems.<br /><br />beautiful because of the quite simple story without making it more dramatic than in needed, which i read in other comments as well and agreed with. on of the things i also read was that people knew the ending to soon. OK, i am not stupid and thought of it a couple of times, but i was looking-thinking-enjoying; the movie was to good to just saying that a movie sucks because you had a hunch how it ended....<br /><br />sorry, no more comments on comments, but the construction of the movie was really good, and the ending fitted well. the only thing i liked less was the further the movie got, it could use some other story lines. sometimes it was a little too much, not really annoying or something, but just thinking back and one negative remark is not that strange, concluding 8 out of 10. see it. it is real and keeps you thinking.
