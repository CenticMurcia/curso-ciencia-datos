When I saw this movie, Ghost Dog: Detective Tail, I thought this movie was going to be a waste of time. BUT I watched it and I was stunned by the amazing acting and plot and especially the dialouge. I mean a dog that gets killed and comes back to life to solve the murder? That is genius. They chose the perfect dog for this movie. I cannot believe how great that dog was. The scene where he steals the car keys is the best scene in film history. I didn't know who I was until that scene. I am surprised this movie did not win best movie of all time, or at least an Nobel Peace Prize. If you have not seen this movie, do it now. It will change your life. It changed mine. Hunter- R.I.P. You were the greatest dog the police force has ever known. You are irreplacable and will be missed.
