Awful, awful film. The direction (Leguizamo) was choppy, the storyline jumped ALL over the joint, the acting (with the exception of Leguizamo himself) was absolutley horrible, and the fight scenes looked as if they were filmed in slow motion. I think Lequizamo is a fine actor and performer, but this was an absolute disgrace of the film.
