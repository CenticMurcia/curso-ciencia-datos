Set in Coney Island this is the story of a psycho killing people on the midway. I'll leave the actual plot for you to work out when you see this.<br /><br />This is one of those so bad its good movies, one where your jaw hangs open in disbelief at whats going on.<br /><br />Take for example the music. Its folk music. Why? I have no idea. I don't think anyone who had a brain cell couldn't see that the music chosen has nothing to do with whats going on on screen. Its so opposite to what you are seeing it grates on you.<br /><br />Its occasionally acted and partially written which makes it somewhat watchable.Its a movie to get drunk and watch laugh at.<br /><br />Its interesting to watch the carnival scenes since its incredibly obvious that they are filming at an operating carnival since people are constantly looking at the actors in a puzzled manner. The crowd scenes after the opening decapitation are fall down funny. As is the response time of the police and medics to the crime scene, never has help arrived that fast in New York.<br /><br />If you're in the mood for grade Z entertainment I recommend the film for a nights rental.
