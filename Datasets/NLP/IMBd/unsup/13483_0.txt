Plot Summary: Man crashes car in weird town that causes car crashes for profit.<br /><br />"The Cars That Ate Paris" has the death knell label of 'cult' film. So it is a very much love it or hate it affair. But unlike the main contenders of that ilk such as Rocky Horror, you can't tell from the first fifteen minutes which camp you are going to fall into. The start could be called conventional; the film could easily regress into a quirky drama about a man who is injured in a car crash and has to get used to the day to day living in a town full of oddballs.<br /><br />But, as the film progresses it is clear there are more sinister themes; however up to the climax the film never looses its light hearted atmosphere that makes it so enjoyable, for me anyway. In the climax the film changes tone somewhat; the younger generation of the town take to their bizarre contraptions made of salvaged car parts, included a pincushion VW Beetle, and set about destroying the town as a result of the older generations treatment of them. Some scenes during the final ten minutes may make you wonder if you should be laughing or crying; the end scene where the Mayor forces Arthur to keep ramming one of the attackers with the rear of his Cadillac for example.<br /><br />The film has other plus points, mainly in the shape of Australian cult icon Bruce Spence of "Road Warrior" fame, and the direction of Peter Wier. Wier has gone on to be more commercial in Hollywood, his most notable output there being "The Truman Show" and "Master and Commander". If you dig deep enough you could maybe find some similarities between the dark comedy nature of Cars and Truman, but otherwise Cars is in a different world to his Hollywood work.<br /><br />Overall this seems like a silly, quirky low budget film but there are some dark undercurrents that reward if you can decipher them. Worth a look, but still a love or hate affair. But I'm pleased to say I'm one of the lovers.
