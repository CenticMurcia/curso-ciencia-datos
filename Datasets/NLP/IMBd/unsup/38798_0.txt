NO redeeming qualities what so ever. Deserving to be called one of the world's worst movies. Directed by Ted V. Mikels and co-written by Arch Hall Jr. Get the hint yet? Talk about a low budget; how about NO budget. Yes, that bad. A creepy tale of a factory whose cat food transforms mild mannered felines into man-eating beasts. Trying to act in this movie are Sean Kenney, Warren Ball, Sanford Mitchell and the busty Monika Kelly. Fun to hoot and holler at!
