Okay, i was at my local video store to rent some movies when I came across a tape. I looked at the cover and it showed a scary ugly man and the title said "The Horrible Dr. Bones". The cover looked good and I read the back and it sounded like and interesting film. So I rent it for two dollars. I watched from beginning to end and I was very disappointed! It was like the worst film I ever seen in my entire life! I wasted several minutes of my life! The effects are just plain terrible and fake! The effects look like rubber plastic props bought from a little Halloween store for kids I mean seriously! The storyline is terrible! The characters are annoying! The acting Sucks! Literally, nothing in the film makes sense. What a dreadful movie! It's a good thing a didn't buy it! I know what they were trying to do but it did not work at all! They just wasted their money he-he! Please people....this is a warning....don't watch it! Save yourselves!
