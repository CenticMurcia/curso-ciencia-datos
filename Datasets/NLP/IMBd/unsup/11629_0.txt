I was surprised to see that this movie was only rated a 4 by IMBD members. I loved this movie. Jamie Lee Curtis and John Travolta were very good in their roles. The double story lines about the MacKenzie and Health Clubs reports were very realistic and interesting.<br /><br />But I guess the real reason I liked this movie is because I decided two months ago to get into shape. I am already seeing amazing results and this movie with it's health club story and terrific soundtrack help keep me motivated. But even if you aren't currently involved in a fitness program you will find it impossible to keep from dancing to the music in this movie. One song I loved was "Masquerade" by Berlin.<br /><br />For those of you who are wondering if you should see this movie, please ignore the negative things you have heard and rent it anyway.
