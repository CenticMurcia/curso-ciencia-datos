Well, not quite scary. More like goofy. I think the slapstick of this movie is like whistling in a cemetery, false bravado. The world is a scary place, and it does no good to simply gloss over horror by ignoring and laughing at it with hysteria, in my opinion. This movie is too clever by half. The War of the Worlds is parodied as simply an excuse for non-stop Saturday Night Live gags. Saw and Saw II are the occasion for Shaquille O'Neal and Doctor Phil, of all people, to share a torture chamber. And, other references to movies such as Brokeback Mountain and others are simply the background for ridiculous and even disgusting behavior. Craig Bierko and Beau Mirchoff are charming as the War of the Worlds father and son. The other members of the ensemble are only mildly entertaining as they woodenly go through their paces and utter their silly lines. The utter silliness of the parody is annoying as well as shallow. Horror is real. Slapstick comedy is real. But, it is really boring to see horror assigned to updated Abbott and Costello or Three Stooges gag routines. This debases both genres.
