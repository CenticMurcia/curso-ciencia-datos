Well, I bought myself this movie as it seemed to have an interesting content.But how I was disappointed, poor acting, a very poor story (sometimes getting real grotesque too) and even the making of the film looks sad.My advice for the director: Much shouting and beating doesn´t make a second ROMPER STOMPER, which is, a classic of modern films..at least that´s my opinion.So maybe more concentration on the story and better actors will do it.
