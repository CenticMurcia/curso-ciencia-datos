Now I'm not sure what to call this movie. A horror movie or a comedy? It confuses the viewer in many ways. When you expect to burst out laughing, a woman is pulled under a bed and a bunch of blood bursts out from underneath it. Its like "Whoa!" And even worse, the events are extremely corny and you lose track of what's happening. The main character, Dope-smoking, tv-watching, Anton's hand is possessed by Satan and it causes him to do things that he wouldn't normally do, like shove a glass bottle through his friend's head. He gets the girl way too fast and it doesn't even leave you time to think how he scored with her in the first place. He drops off her lost little journal thing at her house and runs away when she answers the door. When he comes back to her place on Halloween, she grabs him, throws him down on the bed and starts kissing him. The comedy is completely stupid. The movie expects people to laugh when heads are sliced off and when girls are cut into pieces with a fan. Don't expect to be amused by this horrible excuse for a comedy-horror.
