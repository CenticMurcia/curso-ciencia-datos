The main reason that I bought this movie was that Gene Simmons is my most beloved rock idol. As well, I'm proud that my tiny little country has the honor to be asked for an actor like Rutger Hauer in a big American movie. The title of this movie sounds full of suspense and the description on the back of the cover sounds lethal, full of nuclear terror and L.A.-wide fear...But I didn't like the movie at all; the tension of the confrontations between the main players hardly ever wasn't built up in a creepy way. The main enemies even hardly ever met each other in the movie. This wouldn't be a real problem if other players would have had fierce clashes with each others, but they mostly remained far away; the one in the police station, the other hidden in the oil warehouse. When they prosecute each other in the factory, the scenes seemed pretty predictable to me. A good thriller ought to be quite unpredictable with a complicated plot. The story was just humble, could be compared to many other thrillers. Even the personalities were neither eccentric nor very expressive. It's a tragedy that the love scenes in the movie were the most beautiful. This ought to be a real thriller, not a romantic movie!! Gene, you should run away back to your far better movie 'Runaway' and Rutger, welcome back to Holland!
