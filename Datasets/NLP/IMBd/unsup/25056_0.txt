Vince Rocca and crew have accomplished something that is very rare these days, a romantic comedy with balls. Kisses and Caroms could possibly be the first "anti-romantic comedy," a fresh, witty film that explores relationships with a- no-bullshit, tell it like it REALLY is attitude. The acting is spot on in this indie film and the dialogue is sharp, honest and above all funny. I watched the film by myself and burst out laughing at least six times. Trust me coming from a cynical bastard like myself that is a HUGE compliment. The characters felt real and you could relate to their problems and attitudes towards sex, and the dreaded relationship issue. Back to the dialogue, this is one of those films that has you repeating the dialogue to your friends' days after and stealing the words for yourself. See this movie! You'll laugh and you might even learn a thing or two about life, sex, relationships and pool. I can't wait to see what Vince has cooked up for his next project.
