Great concept, poorly executed. Anything that has to do with Anctartica is going to be very interesting and even more when Horror is mixed on. <br /><br />The problem with "Sometimes They Come Back...for More" is that it falls downhill terribly after a cool beginning, typical for quality B-movie standards.<br /><br />The action is quite good at first but then , towards the ending, it looks like a cheap footage from typical direct to video mediocrity.<br /><br />Also, the movie gets pretty boring because of the lack of action and excessive useless dialogs.<br /><br />The best thing about it is the acting. Solid performances by Faith Ford and Clayton Rohner. They took seriously their cheesy role. Great concept, poorly executed. <br /><br />Anyways, if you have hunger for a regular tending to bad B-movie, watch this one and you will probably will be satisfied. But in my opinion, a movie with such good potential ended as a mediocre B-movie that is only one of the bunch.
