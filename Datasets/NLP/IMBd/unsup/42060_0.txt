I have to give the Film Makers props on this one. They had one HELLUVA Producer to sell this script. It honestly saddens me, that I, as a film maker, have to work so hard to get financing for a Project that has been deemed, "The Pulp Fiction" of Zombie movies. Another script reader stated they don't even like horror films, but they would watch "The Z Memoirs" once it is made.<br /><br />I just pray that once The Memoirs is made, that the Makers of WL watches it to see what an Intelligent Horror film is like.<br /><br />With the cast we have, and the Production staff, yeah, we have DP's from Dreamworks signed on, I'm sure this will be one to remember...<br /><br />What film was I on here commenting about again...? lol
