Yeah That Summarises What I Have To Say. The Plot If any is (now please don't hate me for revealing it) At the end of mankind on Earth, the scientists build a self-sufficient underground city for a few people in order to preserve the human race for two hundred years. They leave also instructions for the future generations to return to the surface of the planet in a steel box that should be kept by the mayors through the generations. However, the instructions are lost and the inhabitants stay in the city that is completely deteriorated. The power generator has problems and the blackouts are longer and more frequent and the city is running out of food that needs to be rationed. On the Assignment Day, the teenagers Lina Mayfleet and Doon Harrow are assigned to work with the pipework and as messenger, but they swap their job positions. Lina, who is the descendant of the seventh mayor, finds the box of instructions in the house of her grandmother and shows it to her friend Doon. They decide to explore the way out of the city and they discover that the corrupt major and his henchmen are stealing food from the population. When they are hunted by the major's hoodlums, they have to find the way out of Ember to survive and save the populations from the imminent darkness and the end of the city. Now a city built underground wouldn't last for 200 years. what kind of government tells kids to pick jobs out of a hat? a ####ing horrible one if you ask me.<br /><br />To all people who like The Shawshank Redemption and people thinking that Tim Robbins actually saved his career with Shawshank Redemption (even though I've never seen the film): Tim Robbins ####ed up his career with this movie<br /><br />The Only Reason I Gave It A 2 Is Because Unlike Most Book Movies It Didn't Spawn 8 Sequels (I'm Talking To You Harry Potter)
