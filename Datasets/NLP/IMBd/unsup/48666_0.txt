This movie is a bad ripoff of "The Long Trailer" and was a really sad attempt at humor. I am trying to remember the last entertaining movie I saw with Robin in it, maybe "Goodwill Hunting" or something back in that era. I am beginning to think he is just trying to finish out some contractual obligation because I honestly can't see where his heart was in it. Or else he just sucks these days because this movie stinks. The raccoon gag was completely idiotic and his kids make me hope Global Warming hurries up.<br /><br />RV stands for Really Vacant of anything approaching comedy. Remorsefully Vapid, Ridiculous Vortex of stupidity, or Repulsively Vacuous.
