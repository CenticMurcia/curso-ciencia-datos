I didn't knew Lenny Bruce until I heard about this movie. But I'm a big fan of biography movies, so I decided to give this movie a shot, since I like Dustin Hoffman and also a world of stand up comedy. Lenny is a biographical movie about Lenny Bruce, a controversial stand up comic, who uses comedy as a public statement against his legal and personal troubles. The movie presents a story in black and white color, so it's quite depressing from time to time. Dustin Hoffman also did a great job as a troubled stand - up comedian, despite the fact I found him far away from being a comic actor. Like I said, the movie is quite depressing, not very funny even if it talks about stand up comedian (Man on the moon for example, was a perfect movie, which make a combination of comedy and drama, but Lenny is just drama)and from time to time it is quite boring. Personally I had problem with the first hour of the movie, which is quite boring and sometimes very annoying. The director put a lot of scenes in the movie, which don't have nothing to do with a whole story; for example first 10 minutes we're just watching the lead female character stripping on the stage. And later on another nude scene with Lenny, his girlfriend and another takes place for about 4 minutes, which is really boring and annoying. But the other half of the movie is much much better; Lenny Bruce's legal troubles, obscene behavior and problems with drugs... the movie was in this case quite realistic but also very very depressing. But overall I like this movie; Hoffman is great, realism is very painful and some of the dialogs in the movie is excellent, the only issue I had were some unnecessary nude scenes and unconvincing beginning of the movie. And I also didn't like the fact, that a movie about a stand up comic is not even funny.
