Simply put, the worst film I've ever seen.<br /><br />I've seen better acting from junior school dramatics, and been more thrilled by Noddy books.<br /><br />The 'plot', for lack of a better word, revolves around a sexy teen on her way with stereotyped friends (geek, jock, bitch, clown) to a concert, which they NEVER REACH (!)... and the group fall into the hands of the dumbest hillbilly psychopath in the world.<br /><br />"My god, this place is so creepy.... quick, let's make out!"<br /><br />The actual horror content is not even comedic - filmed on a cheap 'shakey' cam, tired clich√©s of 'he's behind you!', and 'the body has VANISHED!' are over-used, and by the end, if you actually have the stamina for it, you're praying they get cut up and hung up on hooks.<br /><br />I've had more enjoyable experiences picking my nose.
