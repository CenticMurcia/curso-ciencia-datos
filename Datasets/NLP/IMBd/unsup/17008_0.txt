After "Terminator 2" this is one of the best directed action thrillers I have seen and it finds for ever a place in my best of DVD collection. There are two masters for action movies for me: John Woo and James Cameron. The stunts were great and all very real executed. I mean there doesn't exist any cartoonish scenes as we see today in the cinema at times. John Travolta did perhaps after "Face Off" one of the best jobs in his career. If you liked it I highly recommend the other broken arrow film called "The Sum of All Fears". "Broken Arrow" is incredibly underrated and should be classified as T2. For all action fans a must see, you wonÂ´t be disappointed.<br /><br />My wife and I vote 9.5/10.
