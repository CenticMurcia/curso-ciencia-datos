Andrea Bianchi's "Strip Nude for your Killer" certainly isn't the best Italian giallo ever made, but I really enjoyed all the sleaziness and obscene violence it had to offer. The plot, the acting performances and all the sexually depraved elements are all fairly standard but the film is unusually fast-paced and the gore is really delightful. Fashion models once again are the targets of an insane killer, who breathes heavily and constantly wears a motorcycle helmet, and the victims are all vaguely connected with the poor girl who sadly died during an amateurish abortion-attempt. The sexy photographer's duo Magda and Carlo start their own investigation with a lot of pointless (but nonetheless exciting) lovemaking sessions on the side. Five years before his infamous sicko-film "Burial Ground", director Bianchi already damn well knew how to appeal to horror-loving audiences: the murders are extremely nasty and there's an overload of nudity wherever you look. Still the camera-work is quite stylish and the red herrings are slick enough to keep you interested in the actual revelation of the killer's identity. I even counted 2 or 3 genuinely suspenseful moments, notably the extended scene in the dark room where Edwige Fenech is observed by the killer whilst looking for clues. It's not yet a patch on Dario Argento, Sergio Martino or Mario Bava but we're definitely going into the right direction. The actual climax (as well as the murderer's fate) is regretfully weak, though. Andrea Bianchi's twisted sense of humor is illustrated in the very last dialogue.
