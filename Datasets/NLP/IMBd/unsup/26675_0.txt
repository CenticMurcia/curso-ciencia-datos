Chuck Jones as director, and that means it will be at least entertaining. The Coyote, or Eatibus Anythingus, chases a fly because he is very hungry. When he wants to eat an empty can the Road Runner, or Hot-Roddicus Supersonicus, runs by. Of course the Coyote prefers a Road Runner over an empty can, so the chase can start once again. This time he uses a steel wall that has to pop up, a motorcycle, birdseed on a bridge, vitamins for the muscles in the legs and a Burmese tiger trap.<br /><br />Most of the gags work very good. The one on the bridge with the birdseed is terrific, the timing and use of the pop-up steel wall is perfect and the gag that involves the Burmese tiger trap, and the freeze frame directly after that (you will recognize the moment) are hilarious. A very good cartoon.
