well, I just watched it, and forgive me, but this movie is just some crap work. dominik moll tried to make a thriller, but I guess he still have to learn. the movie's beginning is good, but there is a brutal change in the middle, not explained. then there is a dark sequence going until the goal moment of the movie, which isn't even surrounded, then all is coming back to normality. I waited for an explanation about what happened to Charlotte gainsbourg (the serge gainsbourg & jane birkin's daughter), but nothing. I'm still searching why Charlotte Gainsbourg changed her mind for around 45-60 minutes in the movie. notice the good Charlotte Gainsbourg & Rampling play. In fact, I guess Dominik Moll didn't had any idea about this feeling change, and so didn't explained it. I wasted my time watching this movie.
