Little Noises is the tale of a self proclaimed writer (Crispin Glover) who actually hasn't written anything and lacks the talent to do so. Glover envies the glamorous world of the writer and would do anything to be included in that world even forget the ones who love him for him. Glover is soon given the works of a mute friend and passes them as his own. "His" works are published, he is paid handsomely and introduced to the world of the writer. In the process he breaks his relationship with his girlfriend (Tatum O'Neil), turns his back on his only friend and the mute who gave him his poetry.<br /><br />Little Noises is a dreary tale of greed, the thirst for power and wealth rolled up into a disturbing melancholy mesh. Crispin Glover, one of my favourite actors shines in the lead role with great performances from Tatum O'Neil and Matthew Hutton as the mute. You'll probably find this movie in the "Comedy" section of your local video store, but it's out of place with movies like "The Jerk" and "There's Something About Mary." Little Noises offers moments that leave the viewer saddened rather than laughing. The finale of the film is one you won't be able to get out of your head. Leaving the viewer with a glimpse of the past or what the future could have held. Check it out, but don't expect a comedy and the same quirky Crispin we all know and love.
