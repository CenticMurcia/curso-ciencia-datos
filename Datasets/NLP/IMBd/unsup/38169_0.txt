Sleepless is the most recent work I've seen from horror master Dario Argento (Deep Red, Suspiria). I'm ashamed to mention I haven't even seen his contributions to the Masters of Horror series but I heard it's good, especially Jennifer. Before watching Sleepless, I was told Argento was back in great shape. Still I had rather low expectations. And it seems I was right. Though its opening sequence is great and so is Max Von Sydow's character, most of the movie is nothing but a below average thriller. The death scenes are quite nasty, but there's no atmosphere. The soundtrack is good, but there's nothing creepy or dreamlike about the images. It's just pure B-movie looking without emotions, good or bad. Maybe I should get over my eternal nostalgia about 70s horror. Maybe I should get over the fact that an experience like Suspiria only happens once in a lifetime (unless you buy the DVD). Maybe I should just try to appreciate this movie for what it is. But I can't. A somehow interesting film, for fans of Italian thrillers or people who love Dario Argento, but don't expect a masterpiece.
