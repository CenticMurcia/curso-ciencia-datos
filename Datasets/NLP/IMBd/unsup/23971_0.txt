What more can be said? Wonderful stuff, MUCH better than the hundreds of films etc jumping on the HK bandwagon after the success of The Matrix.<br /><br />Dacascos deserves much better than the dross he's been in up until now - hopefully Brotherhood of the Wolf will net him some more major roles.<br /><br />Finally, if you can play it - track down the UK (region 2) HKL/Medusa Director's Cut DVD - it's the full, much superior uncut version of the film with the original soundtrack. Plus there's a ton of great extras and a hilarious commentary track.<br /><br />The only way to watch Drive!
