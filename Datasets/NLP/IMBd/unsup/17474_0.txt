In this autobiographical war film, the viewer is shown in a marvelously thought-provoking fashion the true meaning of heroism. Murphy was rejected by the Navy and USMC, yet became our nation's most decorated veteran. Especially poignant are the scenes wherein Audie Murphy loses those closest to him. His tears are more than acting, they represent his memories of the real life sacrifice of the fallen heroes of WW II. This is a masterpiece of autobiographical cinema ! <br /><br />The performances are realistic and yet familiar to us veterans . The camaraderie, sorrow, hardship and esprit de corps transcend the half-century which has passed. The final battle scene which depicts Audie's Medal Of Honor winning actions is moving but characteristically modest in its presentation. Enjoy this portrait of a true American hero.
