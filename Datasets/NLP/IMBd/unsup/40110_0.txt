Director Rick Bota made two Hellraiser movies at one go. Shooting in Romania is apparently cheap, so he takes on the task of releasing two more outings of the franchise at one go.<br /><br />This time the story revolves around a group of teenagers, immense fans of an internet game called Hellworld set in the realm of the Cenobites. Two years ago Adam, the one responsible for introducing the group to Hellworld, set himself ablaze in a gruesome suicide. Since that time they played less of the game and one of them cut all ties he had with the grouping. However an internet riddle results in an invitation to a Hellword party hosted by none other than a Lance Henriksen lookalike. The party is like no other, as the Hellraiser fans can really party: Random sex, easy-going naked chicks, hellish music and a lot of Hellraiser lore make this the event to be at... Rick Bota naturally one again reminds us of the Merchant bloodline, which was so key to the horrendous Hellraiser IV (thanks for reminding me of that tragic movie!).<br /><br />After two decent flicks in Hellseeker and Deader Rick Bota is back with this teen slasher movie version of Hellraiser with Pinhead as the new Jason. The reaction is immediate: WTF? And the WTF stays on with you up until the very end of the movie. Lance Henriksen sums it up himself the best stating at one point: "You feel like your in a bad horror movie?" Hell, yeah. At least I did. Almost no Cenobites parade through the movie and the gore is exceptionally unimaginative with Pinhead lopping off one kids head (totally idiotic torture tactics by the master of pain).<br /><br />The movie is infested with sexual undertones and quite a few naked chicks parade throughout the movie with a sex scene here and there. If a mix of sex and gore is your piece of cake you'll be loving this. After seeing Deader it seems however cute chicks is Rick Bota's of distracting people from the lacklustre scriptwriting...<br /><br />I was also quite surprised that the Cenobites seem to be progressively less frightening and devious with time. Could it be that in the era of special effects people have forgotten about how important decent make-up is? Surprisingly the movie ends on a high note and after the terrible hack-fest in between I really like how the movie was resolved. Everything seemed to fit together so nicely and highly influenced my end score (from 2 to 4). An unexpectedly slick end to the movie and most likely a nice outr√© to the series.<br /><br />If only we didn't have to watch a teen slasher movie to see the suiting end to the series.
