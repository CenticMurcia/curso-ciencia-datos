Has anyone noticed the similarity of Grady to Shangri-La?<br /><br />The airplane crash brings Conway to the lamasary of Shangri-La; a car smash brings Ben Stone to Grady.<br /><br />Both find a world in which they can function apart from their 'chosen' capitalistic professions.<br /><br />Unlike 'Witness', 'Doc Hollywood' does what we all would: find that entrance to Shangi-La and never look back! Who, even a Yankee, could leave Grady? Who, even an Englishman could leave Shangri-La?<br /><br />A great movie!<br /><br /> -30-
