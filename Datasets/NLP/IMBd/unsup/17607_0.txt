A while back, I bought a multi-pack of exploitation films (oddly misnamed "cult films") and this was one of twenty films in the set. However, unlike most of the other films, this one just wasn't very interesting and really bored me. The production values were a bit higher, but it still was a very bad film--just not bad enough to be funny or memorable.<br /><br />This movie is about the "white slavery" problem--women being forced into prostitution and other vices by evil mobs. The film begins with a sweet young lady being kidnapped but ultimately escaping from these thugs. Much of the rest of the film concerned tracking down the jerks and prosecuting them, but despite being very salacious in nature, the film was so very dull and poorly acted it was a real chore to finish.<br /><br />Barely watchable--and that's the BEST thing I can say about this one.
