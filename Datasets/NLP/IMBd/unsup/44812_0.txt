We need to remind ourselves that posing is not acting.<br /><br />Besides that the rest of the film is a mess. Consider: Double barrel shotguns cannot fire three consecutive times. Bandera's sawed off double barrel inexplicably holds eight shells which are never seen ejected.<br /><br />Silencers are worthless placed on revolvers.<br /><br />Bandera's accent can drill through concrete.<br /><br />It is axiomatic  sub machine guns used by the bad guys always miss their target.<br /><br />If the bad guy has a gun and the good guy doesn't, something will happen to bring the obligatory "mana-a-mano".<br /><br />Cartoonish, underdeveloped characters.<br /><br />Okay, so you have this weird guy throwing knives at you and he's managed to stick three blades in you. Don't bother pulling out of your pants your 9 mm pistol and shoot the guy  hide behind a trashcan and wait for other bad guys to drive up out of nowhere and kill him for you.<br /><br />As usual Hollywood depicts the racist stereotype of the typical small town in Mexico  backwards, no police, violent, primitive, with women that are whores and men who are drug dealers.<br /><br />Oh, but it's so hip!! Besides, it was directed by a "Hispanic".<br /><br />Worthless stylistic crap.
