I must say that from the previews this looked like just my type of film - powerful, good acting, tense, maybe a bit slow but only in a smouldering-with-tension kind of way. Perhaps that is why I was so disappointed with the plot-less tedium that was Three Burials. A border patrol guard kills a Mexican and this prompts an hour and a half (it seemed like at least 3) of the guard being dragged across the country by the Mexican's friend. And it is revealed that the guard's wife had sex with the Mexican - but with no character development this is simply unfathomable. This utter lack of character development is the inherent problem with the film and it renders most of the characters' actions to be inexplicable. Moreover we are expected to sympathise with the Mexican immigrants yet without any of the protagonists in the film being any more than almost comic stereotypes I was left completely cold. I agree that the politics are sledgehammer PC but this would not have bothered me at all if the film hadn't been so lacklustre. Unfortunately, despite the excellent acting of Barry Pepper as the border guard, this film is as vacant as the Texan desert in which it is set.
