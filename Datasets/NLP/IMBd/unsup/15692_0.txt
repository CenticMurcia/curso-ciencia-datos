Stephen is indeed a beautiful guy. The casting director did a good job to find all those people. I have not read the novel, however, i think that this movie is well done.<br /><br />There is one thing that I did not think that it is possible. It is when the little boy starts to talking how the young girl who is about to get married does not talk about her future husband all the time at all. And it also did make sense, why did the girl wrote him a list of things that she is getting. And what little boy knows anything about adult life.<br /><br />the movie is well shot, the color was right and romantic. I especially when the girl walked in the forest with Stephen, it seems to be a place that has never been touched by human steps. it might be more beautiful if it was shot during a froggy day.<br /><br />The ending was not too surprising. it is a little formulated, not unexpected. Love will always be the forever topic in films.
