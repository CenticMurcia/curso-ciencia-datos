Don't give in to the peer pressure to support Inferno on this board from people who claim to have a great understanding of the film and that those who don't like it just don't get it. If you read those reviews closely, many are written with poor grammar and not any real support. Take that with a grain of salt. They're just afraid that claiming to not like it will make them seem out of touch. There's nothing to get.<br /><br />The reality is that Argento has done much better work. The story is a completely un-involving snoozer, the characters are bland and emotionless (as their loved ones get murdered left and right), the unintentional comedy level is high (house-cat and rat attacks, random midnight hot dog vendor killers) and the ending is one of the lamest I've ever seen. It's worth watching only if you're an Argento aficionado. Otherwise, don't waste your time.
