What a delight! Finally, someone has made a send-up of 'b' horror movies that is both hysterically funny and scary at the same time. The premise is simple: A group of young film makers (think hot, scantilly clad babes) break into a dilapidated movie studio hours from the wrecking ball (the studio was closed years before after the tragic accidental death of a teen idol)to make the last movie ever there. Through the course of the night, the actors and crew are picked off one by one by a killer. Is it a ghost, or one of their own doing the horrific deeds? The fact that this was THE last film ever shot at Roger Corman's famous Venice studio is not lost, in fact the flim makers play up Corman's history with aplomb. Director Brian Katkin stylishly designs scenes to play off the no-budget elements and raises the bar. Clever, well directed, Katkin keeps his tongue firmly in cheek as he takes material that could have been pedestrian and adds both wit and silliness to make it come alive. But don't let this fool you. The film is genuinely scary, walking a tight-rope between farce and fear. Murder and mahem abound as freely as do the breasts. Again, playing off 'b' movie stereotypes, the audience is treated to an enjoyable romp. Producer Damian Akhavi (Shakedown) who had a hand in the script, show a sure hand and eye for this material. The ensemble cast of mostly unknowns create funny, memorable characters that the audience genuinely cares about and their untimely deaths are certainly felt. Kuddos also to composer Christopher Farrell (a long time Katkin collaborator) whose effective score guides the viewer from laughter to fear and back to laughter with ease.
