I have also been looking for the movie "Sunshine" for years. Thank-you so much for the link to the site where I have just ordered my DVD of this awesome movie! I saw this movie when I was 16 years old in a theatre back home in Saskatchewan and have never forgotten it! I started my search a few years ago, inquiring at movie rental joints and department stores, with no luck! I was reminded of the movie each time I listened to John Denver song (he also happens to be my favorite singer)and also could remember that the young dark haired lady that was dying of cancer. It drove me crazy as I was anxious to watch it again!<br /><br />I can hardly wait to get my movie and watch it again!!! Thank-you so much, I am so grateful to YouTube, cause that is where my search started tonight and the rest is history!!! Best day, ever!
