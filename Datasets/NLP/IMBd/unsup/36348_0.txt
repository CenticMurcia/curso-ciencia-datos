yes slater played in very bad things, but the very bad thing is this movie. probably the worst flick straight to DVD I've seen in awhile. bad script, bad acting and bad directing. i don't recommend this summer failure not even to my worst enemy. i give him three stars for my favorite actor, Christian slater, who can do best, i know that. I'm going to read the novel so i can see if Stephen king really gone stupid or what? the man that wrote the shining, shaw shank redemption, misery is now stuck in a horrible flick like Dolan's Cadillac? i don't think so, maybe the novel it's far way better than this very bad film...by points, i can say some causes for this failure: 1. the script it's very lame 2. the characters are so poor and their background lacks in every aspect 3. the casting it's also uninspired 4. Wes Bentley 5. the directing looks like the work of a blind man, not Stevie wonder, cause he's a genius...
