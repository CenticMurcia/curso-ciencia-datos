My brother and I saw this movie late on Cinemax one night five or so years ago. Since then they haven't replayed it. Also no one we have ever talked to has ever heard of it. It is a B-movie but it is really good. It's one of the few movies I have seen that has ever scared me. I wasn't as much scared as I was one the edge of my seat. The Evil Dead's are the only other films that I have ever felt this way before. Well I just thought I would post this and if you have seen please respond because I would love to know me and brother are not alone.
