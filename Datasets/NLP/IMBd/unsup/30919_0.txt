This is a good movie. Action packed with some amazing effects. The plane clash scene is fabulous in a macabre sort of way. The movie kept me entertained through the majority of the film until the final fifteen minutes. I was glad to see the end of the annoying daughter of the spooky kid who wrote the predictions 50 years earlier. The movie was going well for me until she flipped and drove off with the two kids. Then the aliens arrive to steal the car and kidnap the kids. Then Nic Cage tracks the the stolen car and find the kids and then let the aliens just take his son in their giant space ship ( Really ). After a 30 second of a sort of emotional goodbye. Nic Cage lets is son go while he and the rest of the world disintegrates. The effects are wow. The story is good apart from the aliens. Well worth a watch.
