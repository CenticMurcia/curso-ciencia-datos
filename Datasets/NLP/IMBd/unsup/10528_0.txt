Excellent movie, very well acted, conceived, photographed. No cheap sentimentality here. It grabs you and hits you hard, leaves you serious and depressed. No sides taken really-all the deeds and people it shows are murderers and victims. This is a movie for thought, not entertainment! Even though it's impossible for a movie to come close to the real horrors that took place in that land, as in so many other lands, it makes one think about the enormous scale of man's inhumanity to man throughout history. If I ever had any doubts that the world is ruled by Evil, thinking about the wars, blood, lives, lies, and horror going on for centuries reminds me that it is so.
