I just loved this movie it seems I can never get enough of Don Juan and Miguel. When we see them live no matter how many times I watch I still can't help laughing so hard I cry.<br /><br />I have a lot of friends who come over for movies and things and I always show this if they haven't seen it and every one just loves it. Many of them have never been to a Renascence Faire so they have never seen them live so they have no prier knowledge of what they are like all the more fun to see them falling on the floor laughing.<br /><br />I hope they come out with another one soon there CAN NEVER be enough of Don Juan and Miguel
