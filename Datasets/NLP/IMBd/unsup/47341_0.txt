I won't give out any spoilers even though I hated this movie...but here's why!<br /><br />-The storyline was crap. It makes no sense whatsoever and is plain stupid. -There was NO character development -The freaks were nothing special at all. With the exception of maybe 1 or 2 weird looking characters(whom you rarely see and never even hear speak)the freaks in that movie are way outdated...(as in nothing shocking) and it should have simply been called "Carnaval" instead of Freakshow. -The ending was completely disappointing. Actually, the whole movie was disappointing. <br /><br />All in all, this movie is not worth buying or renting. Don't even waste your bandwidth downloading this crap(if you download movies).<br /><br />Perhaps this film would be considered "gory" if we were living in the year 1970.
