"Miracles" debuted on January 27, 2003 on the ABC Television Network. After constant pre-emptions and special episodes of "The Practice", "Miracles" was cancelled after only six episodes. The Save Miracles Team, even after a year has passed, is still doing what it can to save the show. For more information, please visit MiraclesHQ or feel free to contact me personally.
