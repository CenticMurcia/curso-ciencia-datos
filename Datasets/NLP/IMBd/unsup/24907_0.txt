Though this film is ultimately forgettable, the saving grace is a savory morsel in the form of a cameo appearance by Jon Craig Liebling. In his role as the steward in a scene featuring a commuter airplane, Liebling delivers another of his subtle - yet, scintillating - tour de force performances. His understated and nuanced interpretation of this complex character contributes a level of patois to the scene that is memorable long after the credits roll. If you haven't done so already, be sure to seek out Liebling's contributions to the Jill Clayburgh film, "I'm Dancing as Fast as I Can", as well. Once heralded as one of Hollywood's premier talents, Liebling (in both his acting and writing modes) was a dynamic presence who embodied a wide spectrum and depth of expertise that transcended his young age. From Clooney to Crowe, Ben Stiller to Jude Law, today's "A list" of Hollywood talent have all taken colors from Liebling's paintbox of cinematic artistry. When Liebling chose to leave California for a quiet, yet idyllic, life in Vermont, filmdom lost one of it's most treasured - yet inexplicably under-appreciated - players. Rumor has it, however, that Liebling now crafts short films for the exclusive enjoyment of friends and family. What lucky people they are, indeed!
