This movie is a complete turd, a goddamn pastiche for snobs. How can you make a movie with no budget for actors, landscapes, car pursuits or explosions? take a couple, put them into a room for the entire run, and keep them saying topics on every topic from "look, mommy, I have no Willy" to "this is the meaning of life and death". Let have balls and instead of kitsch theology talk about Heidegger the next time. And the special mention goes to it's spectacular "I would be able to make MTV videos if I wanted to, but i don't" montage.<br /><br />Whatta poor French cinema imitation!!Pure rubbish!!!!!!<br /><br />I'll add a couple comments more since IMDb asks me to do so... although I think that it's boring and unnecessary to say that the actors are as charming as a brick is; that the movie is interrupted by a stupid "amateur home musical video clip" in order to promote the latest (Chilean maybe?)radio hit; and that it's pretentious sensibility is absolutely laughable
