If you have are tired of the increasing boredom that ships with movies from Hollywood nowadays this is for you; there are no mister-nice-guy or sane persons in this movie. Depending on your taste it is either comical or terrifying; if you go for the first you are in for some hilarious scenes. The story circles around a lifelike doll that previously happened to be the girlfriend of a paranoid doll-maker, who killed her after she threatened to leave him. The doll continuously goes from one owner to another, but not without leaving a bloody trail behind her that results from the attraction she has on people. Everyone in this movie is messed up in a way, be it the creator of the doll who is somewhat paranoid or the cosmetic surgeon that kills a patient and eats what-ever part of him. To summarize: this is an highly original, comical (in the black humor sense), bizarre movie that is a must for those who are tired of 'normal' ones.
