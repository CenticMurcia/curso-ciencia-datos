Silkwood (1983) Meryl as martyr! Now firmly entrenched as a leading lady, Meryl costars with Kurt Russell and Cher as a nuclear power plant worker uncovering some nasty bits of information that, of course, cause problems with the powers that be.<br /><br />As Karen Silkwood, Meryl plays a flaw-ridden person who nevertheless rises above her own private demons and gathers the courage to speak out against an industrial giant. The movie manages to walk the tightrope of personal drama without teetering into melodrama. And unless memory fails me, another Oscar nomination was given to La Streep. Cher too, turns in a winning performance as a lesbian friend of the family.
