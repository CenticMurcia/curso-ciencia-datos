Hard Boiled was the first Hong-Kong-movie that I saw. The movie blew me away. I had never seen so much action, so much violence, so many cool characters and above all perfectly coreographed action. Excellent actor Chow Yun-Fat plays Tequila, a cop who is determined to crush the biggest syndicate in Hong-Kong, after his partner and friend was killed in a shoot-out at a teahouse. The action in this movie is so intense, that you will not believe it untill you`ve actually seen this classic movie. This movie is better and a lot more violent than anything Hollywood has ever made. I thought that this was the best actionmovie ever made, until I saw "The Killer"(also directed by John Woo and starring Yun-Fat). American actionmovies like Face/Off are kindergarten, when compared to the likes of Hard Boiled and The Killer.<br /><br />10/10 <br /><br />
