After reading many reviews from people who said Scary Movie 4 was crap, I was reluctant to go and see it. But I did, and take my word for it, it was well worth it. <br /><br />Scary Movie 4 was hilarious. I can't remember the last time I laughed so hard. Its parodies of films such as "The Grudge", "War of the Worlds", "Brokeback Mountain", "Saw I and II", and "The Village" and many others work well to make an entertaining 80 minute movie. And lets not forget the parodies of celebrities, which includes Tom Cruise and Micheal Jackson.<br /><br />The Plot Basically goes like this: The dumb witted Cindy Campbell (Anna Farris) has taken up a job as a house caretaker for a old lady that is said to be cursed. While she is doing her job she discovers that the house is haunted by a ghostly little boy. But thats not all. Giant Tripods are coming out of the ground and killing everyone, and aliens are taking over the world. With the help of newly befriended neighbor and failed father Tom Ryan, Cindy sets out to get some answers on a long hilarious journey...<br /><br />Scary Movie 4 is a silly movie. If want a deep, thoughtful film that makes you think, this is definitely not for you. If you want a few good laughs then this is what you're looking for. Just empty out your brain and enter the cinema or put in the DVD. I almost didn't see it, and if I had I would have unknowingly regretted it.
