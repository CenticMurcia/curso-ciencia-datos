In 1976, L'il Davey Cronenberg must have seen how the US dominated Canadian culture. So he made Shivers, his first feature. On the surface, this movie is a fun horror romp, but unlike most generic horror films, it carries a deeper meaning.<br /><br />Without giving too much away, Shivers (or "They Came From Within") deals with a virus that preys on civilians in a remote apartment complex, and turns them into sex-crazed zombies. The virus, which is the representation of America in the film, starts out in the host, and then quickly spreads throughout the building, much like American culture does in Canadian society. Soon the whole building is filled with mindless, sexual cravists...I think you can see where this is going. American films filled with sex, violence, and mindless story lines infecting Canadian cinemas? All signs point to this theme, and it's fun to watch this film, and pick out all the parallels. Although, if you're not for motifs, watch Shivers for the classic twisted horror Cronenberg brings to the screen. We are treated with references to Night Of The Living Dead and many other classic horror flicks along the way. In closing, if it says Cronenburg in the credits, you can guarantee a pretty grotesque/insane/outrageous experience.
