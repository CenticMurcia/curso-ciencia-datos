I first saw 'bitch' at a film festival in Oklahoma last year, and I must admit, I've enjoyed this movie over and over since that day. I am lucky enough to have this privilege since I own it on DVD! I have since moved to Georgia and I made sure to bring 'bitch' along with me! The film is so clever in its content and honestly funny, and you can just see the love that was put into making it. The hardworking gentlemen who created 'bitch' are amazing and deserve any credit you are willing to throw their way. For an independent film (or any film for that matter), this is really top-notch in my book. I definitely recommend it to anyone. So go rent it, buy it, love it. I promise you won't stop laughing. Bitch is a well-oiled machine, to say the least.
