This was about as saccharine sweet as they come with plot holes big enough to drive a truck through. At first, you don't understand why Mr. Turner can't pick up his daughter and later, it kind of filters in that he is a very busy man. Then you have Tre, the "would-be" angel (ripping off It's a Wonderful Life" here) who isn't allowed to fall in love with the person he is sent to help (portrayed by Keshia Knight Pulliam) but does anyway. The angel in charge of him tells him it will be too painful for both of the parties involved. And at the end, all he says is ,"Yeah, you're right. It does hurt." As Keisha's character, her is a guy she has supposedly become attracted to and she just says "See you around." He leaves and that's the end of the movie. There was a story somewhere in there about saving a foster home for some kids but it just served to move the rest of the story along. Poor Tom Bosley - he must be hurting for money to be roped into doing this! The only "positive" I would have for this movie is that I thought Ms. Pulliam looked gorgeous and that's coming from a straight woman who grew up watching her on the Cosby Show.
