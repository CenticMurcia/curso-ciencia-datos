This movie was a great attempt of Sanjayji to adapt novels into a Bollywood cinema...But the story was very simple ...Two lovers, one man and a girl, They both have their lovers and all that. But there is the great Bollywood quality in this movie with the significant and magnificent set and locations...the locations were artificial and it was a great hard work which i understand by the producers...Salman and Rani portrayed their roles indeed great than any other movie..The songs were beautiful..But the story could have been more tight on audience with ups and downs......There were such scenes in this movie which were unnecessary like the jumping over puddles and those things...The 1960's set's concept was mind blowing and the lighting and makeup and the technical background was superb i should say... Overall , a good movie!
