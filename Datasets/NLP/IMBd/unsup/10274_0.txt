Well, this a very good TV series from our neighbor country Turkey. Its a series about romance and love.Very good indeed.Here in Greece we had a similar series but is was a dramatic one (cant understand why Greek writers are stuck on this kind...drama is not always good).To be exact I prefer the Turkish one cause combines lots of good things (characters, script etc) and cause as a curious Greek I'd love to see the Turkish point of view...with this one u can see the common cultural background of modern Greece and Turkey.This TV series was really a good surprise for me.I am addicted neighbors!!!Not forget to mention than Nehri Erdogan is the most beautiful creature on Earth!!I would be happy to see her coming here to Greece!Congratulations!!!Merhaba!
