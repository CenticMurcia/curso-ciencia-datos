What can I say about Troma and Decampitated? This film was so BAD! Bad in ways you would want to eject the tape during the first 20 mins. The cover is a good lead-on. You think it's a horror flick, but needed it is another Troma rip-off. The writing is BAD, some of the jokes are funny but then it gets old quickly, and the killer, concealed by a bee screen, can actually be seen! Avoid this one... unless you like cheap-worthless comedy.
