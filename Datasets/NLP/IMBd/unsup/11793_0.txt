I think that every boys/mans and women in the world should watch this film...because it 's quite true...and you will learn a lot about the opposite sex;) it's also quite original in the way it is filmed, the interviews...you have a lot of different point of views which are quite representative ...I'm speaking about women's point of view, of course...and i wonder if it's the same for boys. it may be not famous but it's worse to see it, believe me! Watch it either in couple or with friends...it doesn't matter as u can speak about it together! I've seen it with a friend, we had a lot of fun...than I saw it with my boyfriend, it was interesting...
