Why is it that the films and the actors from films in the 80's and 90's seem to be so unfunny now that you want to stab yourself in the face with a fork? Eddie Murphy, Robin Williams and now Mike Myers. All these guys need new material and good scripts to get their careers back on track. Please do not go back to Austin Powers, that series has been dried up and The Love Guru is just a rejected character from other ideas. Mike, you're a funny guy, let's see it eh? Jessica Alba does noting here, she is not funny and doesn't use her 'assets' to make me interested. I think she was actually relying on her 'acting' skills on this one. I never thought I would actually ever say this but, I was happy to see Justin Timberlake in this. He had some good moments of comedy, a lot funnier then Myers. Mike, the former N*Sync boy toy just stole the film from you.<br /><br />Myers uses same old material, recycled and coming from a different 'approach'. You know how Goldmember used the same jokes as The Spy Who Shagged Me? Same stuff here, just in a different format. More short jokes at mini-me, more sexual innuendos with names and a wink at the camera here and there. Same old stuff we've seen before.<br /><br />The scenes where the characters are playing hockey aren't even that good. They don't represent the game in any sense of realism. Guys are spinning and flipping everywhere. Usually sport scenes are thrilling, this one was a joke. The funniest bit involved the one and only VAL KILMER, who is in it for 5 seconds.<br /><br />I guess if you think two elephants doing it is funny, then you'll enjoy this. for everyone else, just keep on keeping on.<br /><br />What a horrible way to start the year off.
