During WWII, a plane crashes on a small island. The three men aboard (Mac, Bill, and a servant, Jeff) survive and find their way to a mansion. The creepy doctor who lives there takes them in and introduces them to his catatonic wife. Immediately, Jeff suspects there is something wrong going on, but the other two guys seem fine with the fact that the woman is walking around comatose. After talking with the house servants, Jeff is convinced the house is full of black zombies. Turns out he's right, and the evil nazi doctor has reanimated the corpses through a voodoo priestess.<br /><br />As many films made during this time with black characters, this movie relies on blatant racial stereotypes. However, Mantan Moreland is really the saving grace of this otherwise yawn of a movie. His "easily scared" bug-eyed routine is boring, but when the comedy isn't rooted in racism, he gets to deliver some hilarious lines (the dialogue is often very witty--"can I help it if I'm loquacious?") and it is clear to see this man was a natural comedian. There's lots of talent in this movie, especially by the black cast who did the best with the awful material they were given. But overall, it is too silly with an abrupt anti-climax and not worth seeking-out unless a fan of Moreland.<br /><br />My Rating: 3/10.
