As far as this film goes as a horror film, it's not that great. It was made more for entertaining the mind that giving you nightmares. The acting wasn't too hot, scripting was a little corny, and story was deliberately altered in some very serious ways from the book!<br /><br />I wouldn't get so much on this movie's case if it wasn't advertised as "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein." The story only resembles that of the book! Before you go and invest three bucks in this movie (or however much closeout movies cost in your area) please read the book. It is a beautiful piece of literature that has never been successfully portrayed on the silver screen. I expected truncations, sure, what story adapted for the theater doesn't. But it's not so much they removed portions, they incorporated segments of their own design! And bad ones at that! So bad it negated much of what the original story had to offer!<br /><br />Please don't be fooled by the title "Mary Shelley's Frankenstein" because it's not! Watch this as one of those "wanted to be dramatic, but didn't quite make it" movies. Please Branagh and Lady, spare us the grief and actually read the book before you blunder into putting someone else's name on your crap!
