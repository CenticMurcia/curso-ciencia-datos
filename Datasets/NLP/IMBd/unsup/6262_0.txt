I watched this movie with quite a lot of hope for having found a diamond in the rough, but was thoroughly disappointed. The movie is VERY slow throughout the middle of the film and the ending is so bizarre that I was very irritated when the credits began to roll. The ending could have been better if the filmmakers had elected to explain WHY Mrs. Green wanted to kill everyone. I gathered that she was homicidal because of the effects of the drug, but the film didn't really clarify, either through a back story telling about her addiction to and reactions from the drug or some other device. Basically, it showed her sneaking downstairs to snag some of the formula while her husband went to town (what did she do to get the drug all those months when her husband DIDN'T go to town?) and then she goes wildly crazy at the end and tries to kill everyone. I think it's sad when a movie has to have it's back story explained on IMDb message boards rather than during the film. And how come hubby wasn't homicidal while taking the same formula?!? And then Mrs. Green magically pops up under Cameron's (whose character is extremely annoying in the beginning) hospital bed, unbeknownst to the medical staff who go in and out of his room at all hours of the day and night. The ending would have been laughable had I not been so irritated at the whole waste of my time. As slow as the film was, I kept telling myself, "This had BETTER make up for the slow-going with a great ending!" Wow, was I let down. . .
