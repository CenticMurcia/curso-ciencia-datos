I must have seen 'Splash' a dozen or more times as a child of 8 or 9 and not since. It's been my pleasure tonight to watch it with my 8 year old boy, all the scenes I remembered and some of those I didn't came flooding back and we had a real hoot.<br /><br />Howard manages to create a whimsical comedy/fantasy but it's not without depth too. Hanks, in one of his earliest roles is superb as 'unlucky in love' Allen, who in the end shows that love has no boundaries. Daryl Hannah was even more beautiful than I remember and, particularly in the early scenes where she doesn't speak English shows why she was perfectly cast for the role. Eugene Levy and John Candy add the humour and make it an all round joyous watch.<br /><br />I won't pretend it hasn't got 'flaws'. I mean why doesn't she just climb out of the tank, dry herself off and walk outta there, but this isn't and doesn't pretend to be some kind of statement film. I simply can't judge it that way For me, it was a childhood classic, and now is simply a classic in its own right
