WTF!Why did they ever make another Kickboxer without Van Damme? 2 and 3 were OK, but still they still don't compare at all with the first. Terrible fighting scenes.They should of left it alone after the first.Making 2-3-4-5 was very disrespectful to the original.(A CLASSIC)I think Kickboxer 4 just made Tong Po look so stupid and weak.In the original he lost to Van Damme but he still was a bad mofo.In 2 and 4 they made him like look an amateur.I know Van Damme ain't a great actor but his action scenes make up for that.Sasha Mitchell on the other hand is a terrible actor(acting scenes and fighting scenes)If your gonna make a sequel u better make it better then the first if not don't make it all.
