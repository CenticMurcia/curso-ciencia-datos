At first I thought this would be a Santa Clause rip-off, but after seeing it, I would recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />Despite the plot similarities, this movie stood on its own merits. The casting was perfectly done, and the actors did very well in their roles. Charles Durning and Katherine Helmond made a nice pair as the outgoing Santa and Mrs. Claus. Who better to play the role of a "young" Santa struggling with identity and relationship issues than the actor who played Frasier all of those years. No good story is complete without a good villain, and Elaine Hendrix -- who played the gold-digging fianc√©e in "The Parent Trap" -- again played the part to perfection.<br /><br />I especially liked the subtext of how the power and love of the holiday spirit can overcome the cruel, corrupt world surrounding us.<br /><br />Give it a look...with the family!
