I recently went to see Christian Viel's Deaden at the Sitges Festival International De Cinema De Catalunyain in Spain and I liked the movie a lot. It was the film premiere. The film was fast. The story simple. It was brutal. The music was excellente. Fallon was a good actor most time. Big surprise. Good comedy with Kersey Fallon friend in the film who was funny. Lot of guns-cocaine-action and the killings were originale and sadist. Bad things was the film was done on a low budget and some of fist fights were not that good. But it was a good vigilante movie with lots of violence-laugh-drama.<br /><br />Alan
