"Filthy" is unbelievably bad. Don't get me wrong; I love bad movies-- I'm a huge fan of the "so bad it's good" school of thought. However, to paraphrase Scarlett Johannson in "Ghost World", this movie "is so bad, it goes right past good and back to bad". As far as writing, "Filthy" has dialogue that feels so forced and clich√©d, that the actors sometimes looked like they couldn't hide their embarrassment from having to deliver such tripe. The premise is so poorly-conceived that I don't think anyone has enough rope to suspend their disbelief enough to enjoy this movie.<br /><br />I was bait-and-switched into watching this waste of electrons when I attended a showing of "Brainjacked", a full length movie from the same creative cadre (which turned out be pretty good). Rather than first showing the movie that I came to see, and saving "Filthy" as a bonus for people who wanted to see it, Andrew Allan and co. made the decision to show "Filthy" first. Now, I can see his strategy behind this: he made "Filthy" completely immune to walk-outs, considering that a crowd which paid 8 bucks to see "Brainjacked" wasn't likely to leave until they had seen the feature.<br /><br />As I sat through "Filthy", I developed a strong empathy for protagonist Dana Diamond. It was not because of the movie itself, but because I walked into that theater willingly, and almost immediately I was trapped, and all I could see was rotten garbage.<br /><br />The Tampa Bay connection earned this movie two of the three stars I gave it.
