Definitely a great lighthearted, family film. Makes you feel warm and cozy. Perfect film for the holidays. It is right up there with all the classics, IMO!<br /><br />I won't describe the plot since others did such a good job. I will say that Mimi does a wonderful job playing the pushover who hasn't come into her own yet. I think Mimi made the movie, I honestly can't think of anyone else in this role.<br /><br />A must see!<br /><br />
