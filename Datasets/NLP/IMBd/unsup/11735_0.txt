After the mildly entertaining Jalla! Jalla! this is two steps down for director Josef Fares who tries hard to make this work but it just won't get off the ground. All the basic ingredients for a good comedy are present: a funny story (local police post has to shut down due to low crime rates, so the police start bringing the crime to town) and actors who are suitable for this kind of screwball comedy.<br /><br />But it is badly written, most jokes are average and some fall flat. And as comedy is about timing, timing is not something Josef Fares handles well during the whole movie. It all reminded me a bit of Airplane!: When in a certain mood you can laugh about it, but take a closer and more detailed look and it's actually not very funny.<br /><br />Strong points are when Kopps is breaking its own screwball form with the action fantasies of Benny (Torkel Petersson) as an American super-cop.<br /><br />At first you won't expect such light-hearted comedy from the country of Bergman. Because his style is very well suited for children, I would advise Josef Fares to make movies for that age (and I am serious here). For the time being I prefer Lukas Moodysson with his current evolution to radical movies in form and content.
