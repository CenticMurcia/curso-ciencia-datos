Just a quick note for those who haven't caught it already, the Unholy alliance episode is totally missing all the background music. I was doing a little hunting around and everything I've run across talks about replacement discs being available but I haven't found anything yet. If anybody out there has any info on this I'd appreciate it as I'm sure everybody else will, otherwise I'll update this myself if anything comes to light. It seems like too many companies are getting in that rush to deliver these releases and they never bother to spend the time double checking the final product. I've had three individual titles that I've had to send back to Warner Bros. alone just trying to get a product that delivers the way it should. Usual story Quantity over quality.<br /><br />"Snarf snarf"
