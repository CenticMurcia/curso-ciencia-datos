This is an absolute piece of junk. No doubt it was the WORST John Candy flick the late actor made. Even 'Uncle Buck', made the same year, was an improvement on this idiotic waste. This movie just isn't funny at all. Although it wasn't meant to be taken seriously (it is, after all, a comedy) the laughs are few and far between, and most definitely NOT original. Unfortunately this was made on the downhill slope that Candy's career became, after 'Planes, Trains & Automobiles'. It was simply NOT funny and a major disappointment considering Candy's performance in movies like 'Stripes'.<br /><br />Someone who wants a good John Candy movie should try 'Only the Lonely' or 'Stripes'. Avoid this piece of crap at all costs.
