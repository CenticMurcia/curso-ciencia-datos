The pilot episode was a little slow, and I almost didn't watch the next one, but I decided to give it another chance and am very glad that I did. The show found its footing and characters and it's now one of my favorite shows on t.v. And since it's production is in Vancouver, it should be immune from the writer's strike.<br /><br />Zarkov seems like a rip-off of Rodney from Stargate:Atlantis, but the rest of the characters are very good. Gina Holden is hot!<br /><br />It's little strange the way they changed Mongo from being another planet to being another dimension, but I guess they did that for budget purposes and to make the storyline easier. This way they just have to walk through a rift and can be in Mongo in 5 seconds.
