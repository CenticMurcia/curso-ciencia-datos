As an Indian American who grew up in this country this is by far the worst piece of story telling I have ever seen. Not only was I offended by this man's (Krutin Patel grew up in India and has the audacity to tackle a subject matter which he knows nothing about) movie but was actually angry that someone actually thought the Indian American experience resembled anything like the story on the screen.<br /><br />In my opinion what this is can be categorized as the FOB's (Fresh off the boat) view of what the Indian American experience is all about. It is pretty clear that the writing was done without any perspective of growing up in a cross cultural environment. Actually the fact that two kids grow up in the same house and one has an accent like he just stepped off the boat and the other sounds like the girl next door is pretty far fetched.
