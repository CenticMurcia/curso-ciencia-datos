Coen Brothers did it again... I loved "O'Brother Where are Thou" made by the duo so much and "No Country for Old Men" was terrifying yet entertaining.<br /><br />The latest offering "Burn After Reading" falls in league of dark comedies with smart presentation. The Director duo rightfully presented a chain of events due to leak of a secret CIA data. One thing that lead to other was really engrossing and so much fun to watch. The background score was awesome. The beginning and ending of the movie with an aerial view of earth from space was really really innovative for this visual effects lacking movie.<br /><br />In performances, Francis Mc Dormand as Gym worker, online date searcher and looking for cosmetic surgery was simply stand out. Without pretending, her unhappiness with loneliness and growing age was clearly reflected on her performance. Brad Pitt as macho gym instructor was convincing. Tilda Swinton and John Malkovich as frustrated husband-wife pair is fun to watch. What disappointed me was the role of George Cloony. His role was interesting but some how he did not manage do justice with it. In some scenes he had gone over the top.<br /><br />All in all, a healthy comedy with realistic approach. Two thumbs up to Coen Brothers.
