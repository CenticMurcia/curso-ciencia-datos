First, to get something out of the way; nhendley-1, did you even watch the movie? Or were you sleeping and just caught bits and pieces? It would be understandable that you could have been sleeping 15 minutes into the movie because it is awful, but doesn't help your argument. The police even stated that there were no fingerprints on the gun and if you would have watched the scene in the church you would have seen why. Second priority is to outline what I thought about the movie Â– oh, it was awful. It was an obvious attempt to just be a fun movie but it was far too frustrating with horrible dialog and acting to be tolerable, let alone fun.
