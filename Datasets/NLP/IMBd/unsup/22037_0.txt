Ten Inch Hero is a touching, elegant and sweet movie about people not quite so ordinary, and the masks they wear for each other without even knowing, without even wanting to. It's also a movie about tearing down the masks and - simply - finding what's really important.<br /><br />The movie is worth watching at least several times. The dialog is witty and sharp, the plot elegantly constructed and absorbing, the music masterful (and funny, because it perfectly mirrors the plot and - surprisingly - brings comic relief in a few carefully chosen places), the filming beautiful and professional, and the actors good, funny and entirely believable.<br /><br />Clea DuVall is, as usual, a quiet but very intense presence on the screen, yet the filmmakers don't let her steal the show entirely. Same goes for Jensen Ackles, the central "fun" character, who has quite a few superb moments that show both his comedic ability and enchanting subtlety. Alice Krige was a wonderful casting choice, and her presence (complimented by the music) transforms the scenes in funny and touching ways.<br /><br />In other words, I want the DVD, and I want it right now!
