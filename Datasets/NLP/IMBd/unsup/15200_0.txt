Although the movie's subject was the corruption of a cigarette-manufactory and the way a honest man and a journalist work together to bring it out, the mainstream was the courage of a man nearly paralyzed by fear yet determined to do what has to be done. Never before I saw an actor "breathing" fear and determination so intensely during the whole length of a movie as Crowe did here. He should have won his OSCAR-nomination that year.
