(Some spoilers) So, this is what all the furor was about, huh? Well, I'm sure that the novel, for its time, was in fact as scandalous as I've heard. Of course, due to Code restrictions, the movie version was watered down, although it still manages to deliver its message. I must say that the film certainly does not lack plot points  there are many plots to the story, yet when it was all over it still felt somehow anticlimactic, due to the unrealistically up-beat ending. It's as though, having gone through so many trials and tribulations (very well portrayed by the entire cast), all is right with the world again. Did the novel end this way? I'll have to read it and find out.<br /><br />I would have liked to have seen more of the character of Norman Page (played fabulously by Russ Tamblyn). His was such an interesting character, yet was given limited screen time. This is a shame, as I wanted to know more about him each time he appeared on the screen. (SPOILER>>) This lack of depth in the script was probably due to the taboo nature of his relationship with his mom. A very fine performance by Tamblyn nonetheless.<br /><br />Hope Lange was heartbreaking as Selena Cross, a girl from the wrong side of the tracks. Her meek demeanor and then the cracks in that façade made for a powerful performance. You just knew that someone was going to end up having to take control over the sickening situation of her family life, and I cheered when (her fear still paralyzing her to fight completely) the doctor (a superb Lloyd Nolan  extremely believable as a caring physician) came forward to help rectify the situation and clear her name.<br /><br />Lana Turner was great as Constance MacKenzie, although she too did not have enough screen time. In fact, as averse as I usually am to longer films, I feel as though Peyton Place could have benefitted from another half hour at least. Turner's conflicts with daughter Allison (Diane Varsi in a strong performance) were very realistic, and the viewer can easily identify with both characters and their development throughout the film. Very well done.<br /><br />Lee Philips was pretty good as Michael Rossi, the handsome new school principal. His is the first character to challenge the town's usual way of thinking. In the end, he gets his way, but not until after several struggles with the community, his love interest and himself. The only drawback here is the actor's voice, which is really squeaky. In fact, if you look closely, some of his dialog seems to be dubbed  what it must have sounded like originally, one can only guess!<br /><br />A more minor sub-plot was that of Rodney Harrison, the Harvard-bound high school graduate facing scandal due to his love for the infamous loose-living high school girl, Betty Anderson. This aspect of the story also had a lot more potential that what was seen, and again, its (sad) resolve was too pat  although truer-to-life than some of the plots. Both Barry Coe as Rodney and Terry Moore as Betty were believable in their roles, and this viewer was saddened by their fates which, given the times, was unsurprising  a `you play, you pay' attitude.<br /><br />Peyton Place as a character itself also goes through a metamorphosis in the film. An excellent narrative device of Allison MacKenzie's voiceover describing the changing seasons perfectly represented the changing attitudes/times for the town and its people. In effect, the passage of time and the seasons serve to illustrate the townspeople maturing and adapting to life as the world and its ideals evolve. The mechanisms of this transformation was the strong point of the story, and was quite effective, indeed.<br /><br />So  a somewhat dated film with a social conscience and not without its merits.<br /><br />
