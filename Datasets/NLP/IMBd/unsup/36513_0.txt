'Burial Ground' is one of those movies we horror buffs used to pass by when going through the horror section at the video store. It has one of those artworks on the sleeve that you never forget. For years in the U.S. it was only available on VHS in a poor quality print. The worst of it being night scenes so dark you almost couldn't see what was happening. Now that it's finally available in a high quality print we can see it the way it was meant to be seen. Whether or not that's a good thing is up to the viewer.<br /><br />Pros: An absolutely breathtaking location. Some really awful...I mean awfully funny dialogue like, "You look just like a little whore. I like that in a girl." Lots of cheese with a dash of camp. Some of the zombie make-up isn't bad. The more subtle parts of the score aren't bad and help make some scenes creepier. A good amount of blood and gore. Zips right along. The zombies make for some pretty creepy monsters. The actors, though below average at best, at least seem into it and not embarrassed. Some things have to be seen to be believed. An appropriate ending.<br /><br />Cons: Threadbare story and cardboard characters. Plot holes and lapses in logic galore. Some overacting. Some of the zombie make-up is really poor. Most of the score feels out of place, especially the jazz.<br /><br />Final thoughts: Though not quite on the same level as other great "so-bad-it's-good" Italian zombie movies like Bruno Mattei's 'Hell of the Living Dead,' you can't deny it's charm. It's one of those special bad movies that has to be seen at least once.<br /><br />My rating: 3.5/5 (So-bad-it's-good rating) 1.5/5 (Serious rating)
