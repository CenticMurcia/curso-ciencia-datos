This game is terrific. Even do this game is made for the game boy advance with all of the console's limits, is also extremely enjoyable. It is a very long and fun game with innovating stuff for the genre. Its story is really good as the characters are. But what is the difference between this RPG and others? It has magic.<br /><br />When you take into account that the game boy advance is not one of the best consoles out there, you would be a bit hesitant about this game. But I can assure you that all the good stuff totally make up for the system's limits. The fight are very well designed, the world is really big and you can find tons of monster to practice the moves. The sound is also enjoyable and the graphics are good for the game boy advance.<br /><br />The story is about a group of four adepts (The person who can use Psynergy) with different powers, who need to stop the bad guys from lighting the four beacons/seals and therefore break the alchemy seal that use to balance to forces on earth. The story is little more complicated than that since there are many sub-plots and you get to understand our characters and the bad guys actions.<br /><br />The new features included in this game are the Djinn, which are Pok√©mon like creatures (They need to be caught as well) with different powers. The difference is that there are only four kinds of them (Water, fire, wind and earth) which match each of the four main characters type. The main characters own special powers according to their type (for example the earth guy has powers related to earth and so on) which are necessary when you need to solve puzzles to beat the many different dungeons. You can set Djinns to each character to provide them with additional strength or you can also change types for them. The Djinn can be use in different forms in battle, you are able to use each Djinn special technique, or use a group of them to sum an even stronger attack. You can also use each character special power (They call it Psynergy) or simply attack the bad guys with your weapons. The battle system is really good as well but it would be a little long to explain.<br /><br />Overall this game is an absolute worth trying. Anyone who claim he/she likes RPG will love this title, and the rest will love it as well.
