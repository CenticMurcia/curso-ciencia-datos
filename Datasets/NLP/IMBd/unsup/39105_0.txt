Firstly, I'll give an outline of the show in a few words (spoilers: maybe). A bunch of people live on fictional Ramsay street who all suffer a whole bunch of of tragedies from breakups to deaths. There... that's it.<br /><br />When I first started watching it I didn't mind it at all, it wasn't to bad, then it started getting crap. How many times can you come up with the same storyline? To demonstrate... I'll just show some of the story lines that are repeated a couple of billion times a year. Consequently, this can also give a general outline of the plots for several years to come from now. If you wanted to know what happens with neighbours next year, this is it! <br /><br />1.someone accidentally gets pregnant.<br /><br />2.a young teenaged couple get together generally followed by a messy and horrible breakup (as an example, Goodrem/ and that black haired dude whose name I can't remember).<br /><br />3.someone gets married... followed by some tragedy and/ or death.<br /><br />4.or... my favorite... someone dies!<br /><br />Still... occasionally there are some original story lines that pop up in the show, none of which made me continue watching. You can only do the same story so many times.<br /><br />I agree with one of the reviewers when they said that the most interesting characters are the pets. I think my favorite at the moment is the scully dog (if he is still there). They are more interesting than the actors, most of which are not very good (there are a few exceptions) and make me want to laugh at the show every time I accidentally come across it.<br /><br />well... just to finish off and to put it in a nutshell, the show would be more interesting if it weren't shown 364 out of 365 days of the year. (I might be over exaggerating that number, but I'm sure it comes pretty close).
