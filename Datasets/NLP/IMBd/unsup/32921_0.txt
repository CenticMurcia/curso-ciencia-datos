I cannot believe that Marissa is dead... The OC cannot be the same without Marissa! The Fab 4 are the main of the show, and Ryan and Marissa the most incredible couple on television I have seen... I just don't get why they killed Marissa. I heard that is was because of Mischa Barton, that she wanna leave the show and make some movies. But yesterday I read an interview with Josh, the creator, and he said that it was not Mischa who wanna leave, that they just killed of Marissa because of all the bad things who happens to her : that was the only solution. BUT I DISAGREE! It's not the solution!!! Please bring Marissa back in a coma! No Marissa, No OC!!!! I'm a biggest fan, and It won't be the same without her... Ryan & Marissa 4ever!!!!
