This Canadian short is okay, but it fell far short of my expectations for it. There are a few cute lines, and the main character does a few amusing things, but for the most part, it's only mediocre at best. Do yourself a favor, and instead of watching this film by Richard Condie, try to find his masterpiece "The Big Snit"...THAT is a funny film.
