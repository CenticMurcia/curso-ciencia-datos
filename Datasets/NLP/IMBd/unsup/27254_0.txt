A review on the compilation of Michel Gondry's work. Michel is French and sometimes better known as the drummer for OuiOui. He has produced a number of innovative videos for various artists, documentaries and short clips. This video examines a body of his work from 1987 through 2003 for such artists as Bjork, White Stripe and The Rolling Stones.<br /><br />What I like about his videos is that they not only move with the music and tell the story of the lyrics but they have an incredible artistic content through his use of special effects and repeating images that leaves one wondering 'how did he do that'. Each one is like watching a magic act and yet the entire clip runs seamlessly from end to end.<br /><br />When I listen to music lyrics, poetry or stories there is this movie of sorts that develops in my mind and I can almost become one with the music. Videos I like interpret the music in a way that lends to that in my mind and brings to life on the screen. Kind of an extension of the music, another instrument. Michel has a talent for bringing the music into a visual medium in such a way that I am drawn in further.<br /><br />In the Stones video for "Like a Rolling Stone" we see the heroine who starts out a socialite to become the junkie that she once mocked, her life intertwining with her past and present, pleasant and harsh, posh vs blatant.<br /><br />Cibo Matto video for sugar water took me a few watchings to catch on to the effect he used for them. The video chronicles a day in the life of each of the two girls, framed side by side, except one starts at the end of her day and the other at the beginning, and they converge in the middle of the piece in a catastrophe. Thus the film could be played either direction for the same effect although it is so skillfully done that the viewer does not realize that at first LOL, at least I didn't.<br /><br />White Stripe videos use his technique of repeating images, echoes in the camera, to produce images that are controlled by the beat or chord played. For instance, each time the base drum is struck, a new drum kit appears along side with the musician at that kit, like a mirror effect where eventually the instruments repeat into the horizon as the players advance.<br /><br />In his short flick for Levi's jeans he produces a story, in gritty black & white set in 1930s depression era where the main player drives past scenes from that era, arriving at a drug store, to buy, of all things, condoms. As the wary patrons give him baneful stares, the druggist wishes him well, he slips the condom tin into that little watch pocket thingy that those jeans have, and is off, driving through the country side only to arrive at his girlfriends at night. Her father answers the door, and to his dismay, it is the druggist from earlier, and the look on the fathers face is priceless as well, as here stands the young man he'd made the sale to earlier LOL.<br /><br />Overall there are around 27 music videos, twelve short films and flicks, commentary sections and a book, The CD can be purchased singly or you can do what I did and buy it in the boxed set with 3 other CDs that cover other directors and artists. Always looking for the better deal ya know LOL
