I read some of the user comments on this movie and I was kind of shocked to see that all I saw was negative comments about this movie. To say it is the worst movie ever made is ridiculous. I found it to be quite a good film. There was a lot of gore for horror fans, a lot of funny one-liners (like with Freddy in the Nightmare on Elm Street series) for those looking for laughs, and a cast of characters that you actually loved to watch get killed off. Oh, and the actress that plays the seductive Antoinette was very fun to watch. My only complaint is that I can't figure out for the life of me why movie-makers will always put glasses on a female character (who is obviously very attractive) and then act like all the characters think she's ugly. Is being visually impaired such an ugly thing in America? Well, anyway, I think this is a great movie for die-hard horror fans. Just don't watch it if you're one of those uptight movie-goers
