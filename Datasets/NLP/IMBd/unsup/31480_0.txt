It is hard to believe that Jodhaa Akbar, the most awaited movie of the recent times, has been so poorly choreographed by non other than our Oscar nominated director, Ashutosh Gowariker. It looks like a work of some bollywood neophyte who is too obsessed with the concept of epic romanticism. Though the story is plagued with historical flaws and misconceptions, thats not the point which should be bragged too much. Its the script and screenplay which went uncalculated. This 'untold' saga of love looks like it has been told a zillion of times in all other mediocre bollywood love flicks. The impact of other characters in the movie is totally missing unlike Lagaan or Swades. The movie doesn't take you to that golden era (remember Mughal-e-Azam). I am not expecting an epic political thriller like Elizabeth I, II(which too were given by our comptariot) but both maturity and tenderness is totally missing. And handling this usual love tale for 3.5hrs...thn dude, i've got to take a break!!! may be two;). In short, its a demo of a half hearted job! I would have given it 5 pts but as it comes from an Oscar nominee, i am compelled to give it 4 pts!!!
