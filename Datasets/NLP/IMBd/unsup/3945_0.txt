Yes Hi "Kill Or be Killed." - Sorry to only answer your posting now, but I've only recently become aware of all this 'stuff' on "Kill and Kill Again," on which I was the cinematographer and helped get the martial artists for the movie, since i knew them all.... You are right. A lot of people preferred the first film also with James Ryan as Steve Chase in "Kill and Kill Again", but I must tell you that the box-office figures tell a very different story...in fact, depending on how old you are, you might remember a film made by Bo Derek's husband John Derek called "10" ...a 'tits and bums' vehicle to show off the many charms of his lovely wife that did very well at the box-office and was released the same year as "Kill and Kill Again'. Well, believe it or not, "Kill and Kill Again" made more money than "10". Much more money....I have the figures somewhere......Anyhow both these movies have gone into the memories and archives of "Chop Suie' or karate pot-boilers.....One of the many things I admire about James Ryan is that after these two big successes for him in the USA, he was offered many more roles like that and could of happily gone on making them ad nauseum, going for the money and fame. But he declined....went back to South Africa to become one of SA's best male leads in theater and TV /cinema...a 'big up' for Steve Chase ........ tai krige sasc.
