I was waiting with great expectation to watch this series. The promos on the ABC seemed like it was going to be a great watch. Sadly the presenter seemed to whisper his way through the Machu Picchu segment. (Was he frightened he may scare the animals away?) My husband who is somewhat hearing impaired couldn't understand a word and we finally put on the text. By the time he had got to Chan Chan I was nodding off and my husband was fast asleep. So much for what I thought would be an interesting and educational trip. Don't know if i'll bother with the rest of the shows next week!!! Can learn more by getting a good encyclopedia and a look on Google Earth.
