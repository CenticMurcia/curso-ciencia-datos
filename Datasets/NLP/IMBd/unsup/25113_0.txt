This is a great movie! I've got to say it again: This is a great movie! I've never liked cowboy or Indian pictures, but this movie realisticly sets up a fantastic but simple premise that there are Indians still living in the wilderness. Tom Berringer discovers them with the help of Barbera Hershey while the sheriff played by Kurtwood Smith is looking for him. Smith, by the way, is now probably best known as the no-nonsense father on "That 70s Show." I also have to mention the dog who seems to get a lot of his own scenes. The Indians superficially look authentic and believable as does their history which is so grounded and set up before hand that they could almost be real. The scenery is probably the biggest star as much of the locales and views are too breath-taking to be real. This movie would have had Academy Award written all over it had it been released theatrically. This movie just goes to prove that Hollywood big shots really don't know what they are doing.
