This is a terrible waste of time. Its supposed to be a real story, but is<br /><br />obviously pure fabrication and anybody who has the slightest understanding of technology will see right trough it. But this is only the part anyone can easily see as false, but not the major blunder of this abomination. I'm trying to find something good about this movie, but as it isn't very entertaining, informative or well made it certainly isn't an easy task.<br /><br />As a counterweight to this fiction I would recommend watching "Freedom downtime" a documentary about Mitnick and other hackers, Tsutomu Shimomura and John Markoff (the writers of this movie).<br /><br />The one thing that is obvious after watching this movie is that the egos of Tsutomu Shimomura and John Markoff are off the scale. As for Mitnick, who knows what the reality is, one things for sure its not what this movie is representing.
