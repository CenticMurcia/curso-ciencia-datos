I have been looking for the overnight bag Morris Chestnut had at the bachelor party in the movie. Someone please help me find it!!!! The movie was a must have on video and the cast was excellent! Nia Long was gorgeous!!! No matter how many times I watch it it's like the first. Are there anymore "black " films like this coming next year? Did this film receive many awards? How old is Nia Long in this movie? The female that slept w/ Terrance Howard was gorgeous also. What are her next movie project?What is her name? The girls at the party was fine!!!! Does the director have anymore projects pending? I give the entire movie an A+!!!!!!
