When a group of alien agents from a dying planet come to Earth under the leadership of Isis (Amelia Cooke) to build a portal to connect both worlds, the warrior Rykker (Mark Dacascos) opposes and defends the earthlings. He rescues the teenager Julie (Emma Lahana), whose family was murdered by the invaders, and together they try to destroy the portal and avoid the invasion commanded by the cruel Saylon (Billy Zane).<br /><br />"Alien Agent" is an unoriginal and forgettable B-movie, with a terrible screenplay that begins the story like a sequel of a pilot of a TV show. The situations are only motive for car chases, explosions, shootings and stupid fights. The story begins with a car chase when two aliens fire their machine guns against Rykker but never hit the hero; suddenly one of them wisely jumps on Rykker car to struggle against the hero in a ridiculous sequence. The rest of the story follows the low standard. My vote is three.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "A Invas√£o" ("The Invasion")
