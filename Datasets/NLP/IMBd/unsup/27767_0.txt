In the 1950's, Britain didn't go for monster movies like America did. This one from 1959 is one of the best.<br /><br />It is directed by Eugene Lourie and is basically a remake of his The Beast From 20,000 Fathoms with the story set in England instead of America.<br /><br />The dinosaur in this movie is woken up from a very long sleep as a result of atomic bomb tests off the coast of Cornwall. He heads for London after killing several people on the way. He goes on the rampage there, bringing down London Bridge and killing some soldiers in the process. He gets gassed at the end. Willis O'Brien (King Kong) was responsible for the stop-motion monster. It looks quite impressive.<br /><br />I foud this movie quite enjoyable and is worth seeing if you get the chance.<br /><br />Rating: 4 stars out of 5.
