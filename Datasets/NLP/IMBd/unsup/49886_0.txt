A real shame of a movie. Spiritless and full of clich√©s. What really got me angry was the inconsistency of the soldiers' ability to fight. They acted like powerless zombies when they fought the good guys, but pulled the backbone of some victims in one firm jerk! I mean, c'mon! It's the kind of movie you cannot watch even for laughs. Well, I did. And that only because I kept waiting for something to happen. It was so lame I could throw up. Even if you are a horror movies fan - trust me, this is an outrageous kitsch. It's the type of production that one does for money only, not because one has a real story or a genuinely artistic view to a story. It looks like five-year old kids playing in the backyard - although this remark may be offensive to the intellect of any five-year-old, or two-year-old for that matter! Omaldy.
