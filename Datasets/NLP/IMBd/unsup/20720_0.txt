Ben and Katie Jordan (played by Bruce Willis and Michelle Pfieffer) are in love...well, they WERE in love! After fifteen years of marriage and two children, the love is fading fast, and divorce seems like the only light bright light they see. While their children, Erin (Colleen Rennison) and Josh (Jake Sandvig) are away at summer camp, Ben and Katie tell about the highs and lows of their fifteen year marriage, and remember both the good times which seem to bring them closer again and the bad times, which totally tear them apart...again. Yet beyond the heated arguments between Mr. and Mrs. Jordan, there are Ben and Katie's strong, passionate feelings for each other...which could possibly bring hope in saving their marriage.<br /><br />"The Story of Us" is a sappy love story for just about anyone! Okay, it's not the BEST or most brilliant movies I ever seen, but perhaps, this film can teach valuable lessons of what true love is and of course that sometimes the bad times in a relationship of any kind can bring partners closer together...especially if they've been married for fifteen years!!! :) <br /><br />What I liked about this film was the moments of bubbly humour in which some of the characters brought on-screen (i.e. the ever annoying Andy and Joanie Kirby played by Bill Kirchenbauer and Lucy Webb during the "I HATE THE KIRBY'S" part of the movie), and the senseless fights between Ben and Katie. One thing's for sure, you can easily see the guilt in their eyes after they fight! Yet that's kind of cute! Though it's obvious that they love each other still...this movie still keeps you still on your seat...wondering what might happen next or what crazy little subjects Ben and Katie might fight over again and again!<br /><br />They kind of remind of Ricky and Lucy Ricardo from "I Love Lucy" only they are living in a different decade...they have more children...and they curse more (well...duh)! Yet like Ricky and Lucy, they seem to fight over stupid things, which is normal in any relationship, right? But of course...some of the issues they did fight over were kind of serious and maybe important to them personally. From Ben's complaints about Dot (Katie's mother) to Katie's complaints about "the other woman" in which her husband denies. Kind of serious stuff...huh?<br /><br />Let's put it this way: "The Story of Us" is a modern American love story with a heartwarming twist that you cannot ignore! Anyone would enjoy this movie...especially women and romance lovers! If you like novels by Danielle Steel or Sandra Brown or enjoyed films such as "You've Got Mail", "Nine Months", or "Down To You", you will like "The Story of Us"! Or...<br /><br />If you're in for a good romance film in which you laugh or cry to or could sit back and relax, rent this movie! I'm not into these sappy, simple love stories some films have to offer, but I enjoyed this movie!!!...and you NEVER KNOW...maybe YOU will like it too!!! :)
