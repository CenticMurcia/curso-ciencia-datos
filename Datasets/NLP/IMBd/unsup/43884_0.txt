I have visited many of the places in 'Around the world in 80 treasures' and really loved my travels. However, Dan Cruikshank has trivialized the history, culture social systems and architecture of these places to present an imperialist, pompous 'search for treasure' -(whatever that is supposed to mean). The idea of a treasure (in mysterious places, like the East) is a totally Victorian imperialist British concept and completely inappropriate for discussing the cultures of the places that this idiot visits.<br /><br />He is an ill-informed waffler and a complete opportunist who hasn't even bothered to do adequate research into the places he visits - I doubt if he has much interest in knowing about these places. Rather the program is just about him and with his dramatics and animations he steals from these extremely interesting places to direct attention to himself. For example there is no need to emphasize the drama of the markets area of Calcutta through dramatic gestures, there is enough going on there already. So why doesn't he just let us enjoy seeing the place and tell us a few well researched facts, instead of forcing us to look at him? <br /><br />I think Dan Cruikshank is shameful and should be an embarrassment to the BBC - and to the ABC who present his antics. The only way I can bear to view this program is to turn the sound off - even then I'm forced to see his ridiculous gestures as he dominates the screen. Watching this program is an exercise of frustration and I won't be punishing myself again.
