Good B-scifi film with an awful title. The plot has an alien race trying to build a worm hole terminal on earth so they can leave their dying planet and forcibly take over the earth. They only thing stopping them is an single alien who wants revenge. What can I say its turn your brain off time at the old homestead. The best way to describe this is a way better than average SCIFI Channel original film. Its a better than average TV movie that just works with in its limits and goes. Certainly its nothing you haven't seen before but its sense of seriousness makes it worth your time in front of the TV screen. If there is any flaw its the invulnerability the aliens have, it kind of takes the edge off the danger. Still if this had a better title people would be eating this up.
