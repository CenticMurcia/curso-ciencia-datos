Android of Notre Dame is third Guinea Pig movie, the first is Devil's Experiment and second is Flowers of Flesh and Blood, and these first two are the sickest in the series. Mermaid in a Manhole is fourth, and the rest of the series I can't remember clearly in which order they have been made. Anyway, Android of Notre Dame is no better than the others, and it isn't particularly disgusting either, and that is a achievement when we're talking about Guinea Pig films! A funny looking dwarf tries to save his beautiful sister from a deadly disease by using dead girls as guinea pigs for his experiments. The experiments on dead girls are pretty vile, but dull too. They don't shock too much even though the film tries it very much. The severed head reminds me of Re-Animator but that's all these films have in common. The acting is again non existent and the film was pretty hard to sit through for the second time, even though the film runs only slightly over one hour. The scene in which the dwarf tears off his victims/guinea pig's ribs with sound effects, is perhaps the most disgusting scene in the film, but it is also very stupidly made and the make up effects look as realistic as ketchup flying to the wall.<br /><br />Android of Notre Dame is one of the worst shock intended movies I've seen and the most trifling part in the series because it offers absolutely nothing significant for the viewer. Japanese cinema fans will probably check this out, and so did I, but the expectations shouldn't be too high, and that applies to the whole series, too. Even the first two are not as sick as they could have been, but they are still very rough and mean spirited. Watch if you think you're interested in this kind of sicko cinema.
