Now, this is an amateur home-video!! Its an ultra "Z" film only for one propose, too shock, with ultra violent and grotesque scenes, with a non linear\sense story.The film focus the character Karl the Buchter (Andreas Schnaas, also the director) in a killing spree, walking around the woods killing people without a propose, every signle death is sadistic and brutal..(what they are thinking?)!<br /><br />Its not a film of all gore fans, its beyond that,its a film for real ultra-violent cinema fans, in my opinion the film is a little bit sick,nasty and unnecessary..If you like this one, i recommend: "Antro da Necrofilia" and "Eu Zombie!!! 2- A carnificina total"
