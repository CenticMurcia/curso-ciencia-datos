This series about slaves coming to America is not particularly good, or well made. The only reason African-Americans like it is so they can hang on to a 150 year old memory to guilt European-Americans into submission. The only reason European-Americans like it is for fear of being branded a "racist" because they don't enjoy a mini-series that is not good in the first place. If I make a mini-series about my ancestors coming to America in the boiler room of a passenger ship no one would even care, some would probably even call me racist because there were no blacks on the ship . This does not even compare to modern masterpieces such as "Band of Brothers" which do not cling to distant memories that divide America and cause much hurt. Stop the real racists and don't see this movie.
