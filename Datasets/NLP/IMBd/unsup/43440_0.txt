This is a devilishly clever picture full of interesting twists and unexpected developments. It's also well produced against the exotic backgrounds of New Orleans and Key West. BUT! (Or is that BUTT?) It looks like a promotion for the tobacco industry. About the only time people are not lighting up or puffing away or communicating through clouds of smoke is while they're involved in chases. (Question. How can our hero run so fast when he smokes so much?) This was a good film that could have stood on its own merits. Did they really need the tobacco money that badly?
