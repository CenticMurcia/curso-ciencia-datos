+ SPOILER ALERT + Well, after seeing this movie, I often pondered to myself; "Why did Aladdin and Jasmine get married again?". It's true. If you remember at the end of "Aladdin", the two were clad in fancy, purple wedding vestments. But in this third "Aladdin" movie, the two are about to wed (in their plain, white wedding digs) when suddenly, Aladdin's random father, (who never even existed up until this point) along with his forty thieves, crashes and destroys the ceremony.<br /><br />Then, some random wand is really an Oracle who tells Aladdin where his father is. Aladdin is all like, "DADDY!!" and goes to find him.<br /><br />(I won't give the whole movie away, but I'll sum it up into this...)Aladdin ends up helping his dad in his quest to find the "Hand of Midas". (Seriously, it's like collecting PokeMon cards. Just get a life.) They find this Hand, that brings out many goof ups.<br /><br />One; the Hand turned Aladdin's dad's cloak to gold. It moves freely and seems flexible. Yet, when the bad thief Sa'Luk touches the Hand and turns to gold, he can no longer move at all.<br /><br />Two; the items that the Hand touch turn to gold instantly. Yet, Sa'Luk takes a while to change.<br /><br />Three; after all the trouble poor Aladdin goes through to get his dad the Hand, his father hurls it out to the sea. What a waste!! Though this film was way better than "Return of Jafar", it couldn't save the film's cheesy songs and sappy storyline. Aladdin's dad gambles with his son's life several times, really making Al's, "He's a good dad." philosophy go to poop. It's really a poor movie.<br /><br />3 out of 10.
