After the sunsets a great comedy and I think Pierce Brosnans great. Don Cheadle was very poor I think but Salma Hayeks tops were nice. In After the sunset there is too much sex and nudity for the rating I mean eight year olds could go see that and Pierce Brosnan has his shirt off for like half the film. 30 percent of the film is shot of either topless men or women with hardly anything on apart from bra and knickers or a bikini! Sometimes sex scenes make a movie but in this case it just ruins it. The language is great though, not too much swearing but where there is swearing its funny.I love Pierce Brosnan, I think hes cool and the movies cast well. Woody Harleson is good too, he makes the film fuuny. Overall this is a great film, so get tickets and go see it, but a message to all the crew from After the Sunset - next time miss out most of the sex and nudity! <br /><br />From David Nicholson, Film Critic, Texas
