A collection of poorly acted parts, with Diego Luna the only positive of any note. <br /><br />How anyone can think this film is any good is beyond me. The plot is disjointed and random, the casting is terrible, the storyline is uninteresting and to top it all, the ending is ridiculous in the extreme. Never have I seen so many people walk out of a cinema early. Maggie Gyllenhaal, usually so good (Donnie Darko, Mona Lisa Smile) was wooden and her character lacked any credibility; John C. Reilly is atrocious, partly at least due to a pitiful script whose only goal seemed to be to pad out the minutes before the film got to its end; Diego Luna was likable and moderately adept, but couldn't make a difference to the film on his own.<br /><br />This is the worst film I've seen since Antz... and that was animated!
