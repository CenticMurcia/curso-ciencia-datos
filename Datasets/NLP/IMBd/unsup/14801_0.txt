Despites of all denials from Karan Johar, the movie does have a quite a resemblance to Indian classic Anand. Srk playing Rajesh Khanna's role, Priety playing Amitabh Bachchan role, Saif Playing the lady who was the love interest of Bachchan. I repeat it has quite an resemblance. The Performances were great, maybe sharukh get the praises but I personally appreaciated 2 performances. One of Priety and Saif's. Saif is really funny, and the best thing about him is he doesn't overact to make people laugh. I am just wondering how long does he have to wait till people start giving him credit for what he deserves, Saif carries his role wonderfully. Priety is like Julia Roberts of Bollywood, Preety woman. She could act, she proves yet again that she is not just a cute girl with a dimple on her cheek. The highlight of the movie is the funny moments of the movie, and it is filled with them. Shahrukh was good, yet again but Saif is the surprise. The movie was specially interesting with glimpse of all the stars; Sonali Bendre and Sanjay Kapoor, Rani and Kajol, Uday Chopra, Farah Khan. The supporting cast was very good too. Jaya Bachchan proving as her husband Bachchan that despite of her she still one of the best actresses. Lillete Dubey is a M.I.LF. Rajpal Yadav should overtake Johnny Lever any time in Bollywood top comedian slot. Sushma Seth, Dara Singh, the eternal macho man. Reema is nice. Satish Shah and Katki Dave are delight to watch as Gujus. Harry Potter look alike kid and her baby sitter were cute and ofcourse THE KANTABEN, homophobic maid was very funny. It was nice entertainer, nice fun, more funny then emotional. 7/10
