My parents had rented this show because they heard it was good, and there was nothing on T.V., so I decided to watch it with them. And oh my gosh, I couldn't stop watching! It was so good. I needed to know what happened next every single episode, so now, I'm addicted. It's like a roller coaster: it has many twists and turns, you never know what'll happen next, thrilling, exiting, and fun.<br /><br />The story is supposed to be in real time. Each episode is 1 hour, each season has 24 episodes, so one season is supposed to be 1 day. What happens is Jack Bauer, who works for CTU, finds out that his daughter had been kidnapped. He'll do anything to save her, and, well, you'll see what happens. (This is the plot for season 1)<br /><br />Trust me, you won't be able to take your eyes off of the screen.
