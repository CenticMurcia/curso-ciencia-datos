I am still affected by this film. I worked at the theater that had shown it and was surrounded by the controversy. It got the first NC-17 rating ever (Which is pretty much a kiss of death, like the film "Showgirls."). The reason for the rating? An erotic picture of a woman and an octopus!(True story!). Anyway, this was a pretty intense film, and the triangle(Henry, June, and Annis)was pretty interesting, too. The one who stole the film though is Kevin Spacey(Early in his career)as Osbourne, the writer that's obsessed with naked female contortionists. I liked the feel of 1930's Paris and the cinematography. Watch out for a cameo by Gary Oldman as Pop (He was married to Uma Thurman at the time.).
