Martin Scorsese directs this highly acclaimed bore fest. Elaborate costumes and sets, but a story line that offers very little. A high society lawyer(Daniel Day-Lewis)in mid 1800s New York City falls in love with his intended's(Wynona Ryder)cousin(Michelle Pfieffer). A long time to wait for nothing to happen. Sorry Mr. Scorsese, just not enough to keep us awake.
