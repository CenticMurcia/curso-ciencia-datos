Richard Ward as the proud Harlem gangleader and Paul Benjamin as Jim Harris the steel of a trio of smalltime thieves who get in over their heads are the stars of this movie which has gotten lumped into the blaxploitation category. Though Anthony Quinn and Yaphet Kotto are the stars along with Tony Franciosa as a middling hood given his last chance to become somebody of respect in the New York Mob get top billing its the above mentioned actors who carry this excellent crime drama which is a far bloodier and grimmer version of The Killing. Doc Johnson isn't anybody's flunky and Jim Harris would slaughter all the cops on Law and Order and NYPD Blue combined plus pistol whip the CSI crew too. Top rate.
