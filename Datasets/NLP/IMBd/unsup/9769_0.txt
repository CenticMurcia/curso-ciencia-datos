It's unbelievable how silly some movies can be. I forgot completely why it was that I started watching this movie. It has a story, I'm sure of that, but it can't have been a very thick one. Everybody seems to have motivations, but they don't say anything about them. They just look pondering into the camera for a moment or two (three, ten) and then take action. A little more light on the flyers activities would in other ways also have been nice. I mean: they're on a spaceship, the electricity bill will not be the largest post. And that way it is actually possible to see what is happening to some of the flyers, fights in the dark do so little to me.<br /><br />By far the worst film I've ever seen.
