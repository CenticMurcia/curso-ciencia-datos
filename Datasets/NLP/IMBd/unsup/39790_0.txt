I found the movie boring: a self indulgent throwback to the fifties, as interesting as a fall off a bike with much less poetry. Sitting thru it seemed to me as frustrating as being trapped in a traffic jam like the one depicted on screen. Some beautiful shots of Paris and a pleasant score fell far short of redeeming this picture for me.<br /><br />
