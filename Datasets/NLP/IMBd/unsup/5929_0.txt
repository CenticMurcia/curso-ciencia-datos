The director was genius! I loved the music and the actors were so great! Kate Maberly really did a great job, as did Maggie Smith and Laura Crossly! I also noticed how Mary's dresses changed along with how she progressed with her attitude. They got brighter and prettier, than just "Black, Black or Black". I also really LOVED the music, Zbignew Preisner's music fit the movie SO well, and I LOVED IT!!! The movie had some scary parts in it, too! Like when she went at night to find Colin, the music and the camera-work and that scary blanket with the ugly boy on it covering Colin's room gave it an eerie kind of vibe. I love this movie!!!
