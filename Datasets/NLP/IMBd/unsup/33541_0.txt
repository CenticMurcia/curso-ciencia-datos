Major disappointment! I thought it was going to be a typical horror movie but with a bit of originality. I was wrong. The originality that the movie was trying to achieve was over-done and therefore didn't make any impression on me. In the end it's just another low budget movie, done in a reality-TV kinda way, similar to "Blair-witch-Project" in terms of VERY little action and WAY too much talking. It feels like it was not edited at all. Surely that makes it seem more real, but we all know it's not. It also wasn't entertaining. I honestly had to stop myself from falling asleep several times...it was awfully boring and a waste of time. If you expect to see a scary movie, it's just not it.
