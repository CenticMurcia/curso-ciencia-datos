My middle son and I watched this film over and over and over when he was about 3. Sure, it is cheesy, and some of the dialog borders on the bizarre. But talking on a shell phone? A tiny Alec Baldwin? Great stuff. Of all the entertainment directed at kids, this is some of the more gentle and least commercial I have come across.<br /><br />This was my son's favorite, and you have to love films that are part of your kids' lives. For that, hate me, but I give it ten stars.<br /><br />Granted, when doing the movie, the writer and the directors were facing some challenges. You are adopting a movie based on a popular toy and a really low budget TV show. Add to that, it is about talking trains. Hey, you make a movie about talking trains.
