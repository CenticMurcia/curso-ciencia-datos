I normally wouldn't bother writing a review for a made for TV movie, but I got stuck watching while at home for Christmas. Christmas movies are supposed to be kind of cliched, they have to be because Christmas has become a cliche to most people. This movie took that idea and ran with it.<br /><br />First you have the reluctant Santa Claus, which has only been done a few dozen times in recent years. Then there is the rich man falling in love with the hired help, coupled into man being engaged to one woman only to realize it was a mistake and that he is really in love with girl-come-lately. Then add some cookie-cutter characters, like the proper butler giving sage advice. Or how about that the hired help has a mystery son. I say mystery son because it is never explained if the son is from a bad marriage, out-of marriage, widowed, etc. At least I don't remember it being explained. I won't even go into the goofy cop, the swindling best friend, incredibly sappy happy ending, etc.<br /><br />I think there are people in the world who would relish a movie like this, but if cliches, and telegraphed plot twists turn your stomach, then avoid this movie.
