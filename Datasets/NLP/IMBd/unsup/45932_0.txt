I've actually seen one worse fantasy movie in my entire life, so I can't rank this one as a zero. Maybe a .1 or something.<br /><br />Okay, all right, that's rude ... Most low-budget movies aren't truly made for the purposes of making money ... they're made by people who really love making movies. I really hope that this movie's creators had fun making it, but I'm a little baffled, trying to figure out how they got somebody to distribute this.
