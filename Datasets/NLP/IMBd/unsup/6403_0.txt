My first experience of watching this movie was inexplicable. Never before I felt such high adrenaline rush for watching a movie. A Clockwork Orange is full of messages and takes an extremely critical stand to society. It shows how the so called 'normal' elements in society are far more weirder and hypocrite than ruffians like the central character -- Alex. Notice how Alex appears more human, more balanced in comparison to his parent's paying guest, a supposedly 'normal' person? How Alex's parents disown him after he returns home from a correctional center? <br /><br />Also when Alex is taking his final exam to leave the correctional center you can notice that Kubrick is questioning society's parameters of right and wrong. To pass the test and be considered 'sane' Alex must reject the most primitive needs of humans, like avoiding physical contact with an extremely attractive lady and avoid self defense, no matter how badly he is getting beaten. In this scene Kubrick was exposing society's distorted views on righteousness. Why is consensual sex always immoral? Is self defense a crime? Also, notice how the correctional center staff is enjoying to watch Alex being humiliated. This suggests that in reality 'normal' people are just as immoral and wrong as open criminals like Alex and his gang. The only difference being an average person is a closeted immoral, while Alex does his dirty job in the open.<br /><br />One particular thing which took me by surprise in A Clockwork Orange was the absence of loyalty within Alex's gang. Normally, gang members are shown as being ruthless to strangers, but they behave with utmost trust and loyalty within the gang. Here Kubrick shows them as completely insane minds with no rules or morals.<br /><br />A Clockwork Orange also shows the government's role to come in the rescue of outcast youngsters and bring them back into mainstream society. The final scenes where the minister privately assists Alex is an indication of that.<br /><br />Every actor does a splendid job, but Malcom MCDowell as Alex, stands out. The scene of violence where he leads the beating of a homeless man is alone worth the piece of admission. <br /><br />This is one movie not to be missed. Its both very moving and also extremely entertaining. And it has repeat value as it requires multiple viewings to absorb its tail and enjoy it to the fullest.<br /><br />Kudos to Kubrick's genius for making such a unique piece.
