I didnt laugh at all. there are some funny scenes, but they already put those scenes into trailer. if you saw the trailer, you can assume that you saw the film. absolutely pointless... not even funny. same jokes over and over again.. mazhar alanson has an awful performance which ruins the film most. cem yilmaz only plays his real character, he didn't act actually. only person who deserves respect in this film is Selim Nasit Ozcan.
