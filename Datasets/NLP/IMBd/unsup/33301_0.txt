Ugh. I hate this movie. I hate the fact Chow Yun-Fat is in this movie. If there is one film I wish I could obliterate from my consciousness, this would be a Top Ten candidate.<br /><br />In a rip-off of a number of Hollywood movies, Miu Kiu Wai plays a guy who has the ability to enter the dreams of others. This is how he twigs to the fact that there is a crooked cop on the force. While mucking about in other peoples' dreams he encounters vampires, monsters and just general stupidity.<br /><br />Eric Tsang, surely one of the most annoying individuals ever born, portrays the trouble-magnet buddy as well as a salacious robot. He looks like a demented Tele-Tubby.<br /><br />Chow Yun-Fat plays the cop. Anita Mui plays a reporter with a boyfriend who should know not to eat birthday cake with a hunting knife. Emily Chu Bo-Yee plays a piece of wood. Well, it just seems that way.<br /><br />Terrible, awful and good only for making fun of at parties, this film is solidly in my list of CYF's Bottom Five movies. If you must see this one, try and get a friend to spring for the disc so you won't feel bad about wasting your own money on it.<br /><br />
