My wife and I expected a predictable root-for-the-good-guys movie ala Rocky, Karate Kid and all, which this is. However, this is so well done, that it didn't matter to us that we were 10 steps ahead of the film. All of the cast and crew did excellent jobs, and you all pulled this off with a very high degree of professionalism. Go see it!! It's a movie that people of all ages will enjoy, and I'd recommend it to anyone and everyone. This is the level of film quality that we expect when we pay full price for a movie ticket. Great work Kurt, Elisabeth, Dakota, Kris, and the entire cast and crew!!! You all played wonderful characters, and the entire audience at our screening applauded as the closing credits rolled.
