Some quotes from friends of mine about the TV series "Hex":<br /><br />'Pretentious sub-Buffy twaddle.'<br /><br />'"Hollyoaks" for Goths.'<br /><br />'Moody, dark, impenetrably pointless.'<br /><br />'As scary as a balloon on a stick.'<br /><br />'Too mediocre to qualify for a "So Bad It's Good" badge.'<br /><br />'Clearly written for teenagers by marketing men and seedy hacks in cardigans.'<br /><br />'Money back, don't want.' <br /><br />'Takes itself far too seriously.'<br /><br />'Bad, bad, bad. Just really bad.'<br /><br />'Like "Angel" but without the plot, the jokes or the acting talent.'<br /><br />'A ghost train ride with the power switched off.'<br /><br />'Makes me ashamed to be British.'<br /><br />'Makes "Charmed" look like it was written by Chekov.'<br /><br />'I'd rather watch fabric conditioner commercials back-to-back than another episode of "Hex".'<br /><br />So there you go. I couldn't find anyone who watched this miserable TV series who had a good word to say about it. Mind you, I'm 39 and most of my friends are of a similar age. There must be a lot of sullen teenage Goths out there who liked "Hex" enough for it to have such a high IMDb rating.
