Wow, you'd think that even B movies would at least TRY to get the facts straight. There were quite a few things wrong with this one, but here were the most annoying for me: <br /><br />1. Our heroes looking at African animals from the air with binoculars, yet when we are shown the "binocular" view, it's taken from ground level.<br /><br />2. Massive airplane cockpit. 1940's airplane cockpits were incredibly cramped arrangements that were crammed with instruments, yet the cockpit shown here was massive, with not a dial, switch or gauge to be seen. Convenient for filming perhaps, but completely unreal.<br /><br />3. Indigenous species. The padding in this film included stock footage of the animals seen on the ground in Africa. These included a cougar and an orangutan, neither of which are native to Africa.<br /><br />4. When the English "Jungle Goddess" of the title was in Africa, she taught a local African woman broken English. Yet when the woman spoke the broken English, it was with a Mexican accent. Riddle me that one, Batman! <br /><br />This one was pretty bad all the way through, with two thoroughly unlikeable and annoying male leads. And at just an hour long it still had 15 minutes of padding. If you've only got 45 minutes worth of script, you don't have enough of a story to even make a movie, so why try?
