This sequel was actually THE best of all the sequels of Species. It was sexy but actually there is a story attached to it that makes fictionally sensible. The IMDb rating of 4.1 of the time I am writing this review must have been given by those who were sexually frustrated because the way the movie was marketed (The Cover) it was for those who were perverted minded hoping they will get a full on alien soft-core flick which is not at all. For me the sexy scenes just spiced up the movie like any other which had a really good story, good plot, great actors and a good ending. The team behind the making of this sequel actually put much effort into making this a good movie which is worth its time watching, just hope they made a buck at the end. This movie should have went to theatres because it was good as the Alien series with Sigourney Weaver. This movie is probably not an Oscar type of movie but is much better than some of the movies that get so much attention like Twilight: New Moon.<br /><br />This movie is two thumbs up like Ebert & Roeper would say.
