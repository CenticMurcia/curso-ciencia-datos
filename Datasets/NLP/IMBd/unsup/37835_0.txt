Whenever I see a review that suggests something is the best or worst film ever I usually am inclined to dismiss the review out of hand. As such I don't say this lightly - this genuinely is, probably, the worst film ever made. It's mind-bogglingly, spectacularly crap. It is amazing. If it has a redeeming feature it is that it is hilariously awful. For a while. But even that wears off. I'd suggest everyone see it, just so they can stop making those comments about how this and that film is the worst ever made. This has gotta be it. Now I tried posting this review at this point, but IMDb insisted I have at least ten lines to a review. This is difficult, because there really isn't that much to say about this movie. I mean I could include an outline of the plot complete with a few spoilers, but the problem with this is that there needs to be a plot to start with. <br /><br />I suppose I'll go with an anecdote. I was having a discussion with a friend about the worst movies we'd ever seen. I suggested Pearl Harbour, Titanic, Godzilla (the US one - the Japanese ones are happily crap), Jurassic Park 2 as memorable candidates. He shook his head and told me I had to see this. And yes, it does make those others look like veritable masterpieces.
