I saw this film for the very first time not too long ago on TV. I thought it was just the typical spaghetti-western, with a lot of gunfights,blood and dead people. Obviously I was wrong.<br /><br />During the first ten minutes or so it seems a standard European western, but then appears a horse pulling a wagon full of onions where "Onion" (Franco Nero) is hidden. That´s when the fun begins. I´d like to remark from this film the surrealistic details it contains such as the nazi look of the villains, the capacity of our hero "Franco Nero" eating and even drinking! raw onions.<br /><br />If you have the chance to watch it, just do it. I believe you won´t be disappointed.<br /><br />It seems as the couple Franco Nero / Enzo G. Castellari always made good films... (Check some of them: "High Crime", "Keoma", and "The shark hunter"). enjoyable films...<br /><br />
