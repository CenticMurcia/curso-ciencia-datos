Clearly not a movie for everybody. Seeing the number of positive reviews this film gets, it nearly feels like a duty to add a negative review to the few already posted, as a warning to potential viewers.<br /><br />It was just painful to sit through the entire movie. And I like silly comedies, I like "nonsense". I can find redeeming qualities in a movie if it is at least vaguely entertaining or if it makes me laugh out loud a few times. In a word, I'd be a good audience for this type of film, if only it had something good in it, anything. But this was just plain horrible. "I want those 80 minutes of my life back!"TM<br /><br />I did laugh a few times, but it was really not enough to justify the time invested in watching this. Go rent a "Naked Gun" flick or something by the Monty Pythons ("Hitler in England", for example) instead. Even a Ben Stiller comedy would be better.
