I give this a 10 out of 10...it was a great movie. You got to understand what these dancers were doing and see why they were doing it. It seemed like a good way to get out their anger. The company I am in, we all went to see it and we all came out impressed. Especially us younger ones, I even said I wish I could do that :D Dancing is so much fun, and when you find out why others dance like that, you start to respect it little more. I think everyone should go see it, you'll love it. Its sad, its happy its entertaining! SEE IT NOW!!!!.....WHY Haven't YOU SEEN IT YET!....jokes..you have to see it, its a great way to understand dance...NOW GO!!!
