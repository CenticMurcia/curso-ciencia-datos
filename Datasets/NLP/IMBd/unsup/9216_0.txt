Every now and then a movie just plain WORKS. For me, this was one of those movies.<br /><br />Although the setup was a bit clunky at first, this movie ended up grabbing me by the gonads and did not let go until the very end. And what an end! The reversals of fortune were clever and literal.<br /><br />Thank god for the quote on the box about Animal House -- otherwise I never would have been able to quite categorize this film. But, yes, this is Animal House for a more lawless set of folks.<br /><br />A word too about the use of music. Without ever descending into music-video-land, this film made incredible use of music to move the story forward and propel the scenes. In fact, the scenes and the music fed off one another in a completely holistic way. Kudos to the director and his composer and music supervisor (and his editor!) for what was clearly a well-though out battleplan.
