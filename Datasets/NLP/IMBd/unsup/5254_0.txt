This movie had an excellent story line. The actors were great and the choice of Matthew Lillard as Manic was genius. Lillard built upon his earlier "Scream" success playing a crazy. Saffron Burrows' portrayal of Angel was genuine and she sizzled as the Wing Commander! Special effects were very good. In my opinion, the movie was much better than I expected it to be. I recommend this movie to everyone, but especially Wing Commander fans.
