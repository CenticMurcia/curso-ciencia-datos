La habitacion Azul is an everyday story, it shows us nothing different from real life events. The rhythm is incredibly monotonous and totally predictable. The cast is OK but I think mexican productions are in great need of new talent, the same actor appear in several movies and all of a sudden you don't know you're watching a different one. I like to go to the movie theater to see something different, out of the ordinary, stories that challenge the imaginations, that go further than what we live.
