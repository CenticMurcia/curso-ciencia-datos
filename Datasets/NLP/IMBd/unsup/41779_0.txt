As a non-American Indian living and working in the Navajo Nation, I thought it would be interesting to see a film supposedly relevant to the people I was working with. Boy was I disappointed. The Navajo Nation Police as they are portrayed in this film make me cringe, not to mention the Navajo culture and people. This movie is sadly one large stereotype, and as most stereotypes is greatly off the mark. This film is a blemish on the career of a wonderful actress (Irene Bedard) {Irene- Why did you participate in this?}. If I recall correctly, this film was not even shot on the rez- it was shot in Utah or Nevada or something.
