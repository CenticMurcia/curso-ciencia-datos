Well i am a fan of Egyptian mysteries... and everyone knows there's not enough of them. This attempt was pathetic. At times they throw in things that have absolutely no plot behind them.. your like.. What The.. where did that come from! The writer should never be allowed to write a script ever again. What a complete and utter waste of time. My 10 year old daughter could write a film better then this. They could at least have the least bit of facts to put in the story. I feel sorry for the actors who worked in this.. though they must have realized as their characters were all so pathetic. I have enjoyed previous stories that contain the main character.. for example Starship Troopers.. he has really taken a step back starring in this absolute sad joke of a film. Complete drivel. Do not bother to watch.
