- But certainly to mine, at least.<br /><br />This first TV pairing of Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer was a Friday night must-see for me. I found it quite addictive. The sketches were preposterous - with items like 'novelty island', 'Justice Nutmeg' and 'the man with the stick' - the props looked like the result of 30 minutes improvisation with the contents of a local skip, whilst the dialogue was quick, slapstick, and largely surreal. Lines like: 'Now this is the time of day when I like to put a plum under a viper', could only have been uttered by Vic. <br /><br />Played-out in the old fashioned music hall style, Vic Reeves held the commanding role as MC whilst Bob Mortimer did a turn as side-kick. Then there was 'Les' a mute, aberrant assistant turned comic prop, with shaved head and laboratory coat, who seemed to have co-ordination issues. Other characters came and went as required. <br /><br />I've had guests who stared at the programme with a blank stupefaction and then turn to me as if in belated discovery that I were deranged. Nothing would persuade them that it was hilarious. <br /><br />Well; for me it was a Friday night staple that they never really bettered even with their later and more extravagantly funded follow-ups. 'Shooting Stars' continues their penchant for tacky props and prizes, and its recent reappearance as a new series is testament to the duo's popularity. <br /><br />Individually they have very little to offer, but as a team they're a scream.
