I suppose saying that the end of this movie is great gives something away. Then again you don't know what that is so maybe not.<br /><br />The plot of this film has Kirk Douglas dying as all of his relatives try to curry favor and get left his fortune. When every trick in the book fails they call in Michael J Fox as his long lost favorite nephew. Fox is now a down on his luck pro-bowler desperate for the cash the family promises him.<br /><br />Some of what follows is sit-com material, some is highly inspired. The good part of it is that almost all of it is funny.<br /><br />Certainly the film as a whole is not the best thing down the pike, but it has its moments, all of which make this film worth seeing.
