A movie that is supposed to feel like a reality series comes off as a scripted poorly edited documentary. You want reality talk about ticket prices at Fenway to go see those schmos! I'd rather send my kids to college!! Unfortunately this movie makes all Bostonians look like ignorant morons. I live here it's not true but you do have idiots yelling "Yankees Suck". Gee if that's the case Genius then why are they the best sports franchise in history? The response you usually get is "they suck anyway". Yes, very intelligent indeed. Remember baseball is a sport that honors respect for players of all teams and is a combination of physical and mental ability. This movie drags Baseball into the empty headed dungeon of Sports machismo. If you want see a truly great Baseball movie watch "Pride of the Yankees" instead. You'll feel better about yourself and appreciate life a bit more.
