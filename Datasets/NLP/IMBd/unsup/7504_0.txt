This film is a really enjoyable experience. It is extremely stylish from the beautiful cinematography too the superb acting. It is ferociously character driven and basically spends it's length just enjoying the presence of it's three fascinating main characters, Anais Nin (Madeiros) and Henry Miller (Ward) and his wife June (Thurman).<br /><br />All three actors are extremely good, especially Thurman who makes one of the most impressive uses of limited screen time (about 50min) that I've ever seen.<br /><br />Thurman exudes the sexuality and screen presence of Dietrich and Garbo combined, and goes through an entire gamut of emotions from high melodrama to subtle tender moments, such is the nature of June Miller. The range shown in one role is astonishing. I have always thought Uma Thurman was a good actress, but I didn't realise she was THIS good. Nothing prepared me for what I saw here. It is a performance everyone should see before they comment on her as it leads me to believe she has been largely wasted in the rest of her career.<br /><br />The film is worth seeing for Thurman's performance alone, but also for the cinematograhy and the fine work of other cast members. The much publicised erotic element only really rears its head for a torrid 25 minute period in the middle of the film when Anais goes from one lover to the next.
