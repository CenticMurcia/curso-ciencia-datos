Ok first of all, Bette Midler is one good actress, and singer. The Rose is about a woman of the same name, Rose, who is brought down from her rock and roll stardom by drugs, sex, and obscene remarks from mean men calling her obscene names. But she can't help it. This film is loosely based upon Janis Joplin, a rock and roll star who came "down" from drugs. This movie is sad, at the end. It made me cry, and I am a man, so ladies you know you gotta see it!! And the song THE ROSE is my favorite song now!!! I love it and I loved the movie and I will watch it over and over.!! thank you , C. Patterson
