I am a huge fan of the zombie genre, especially Romero's original classics, but it seems to me that the genre has been done to death in recent years and there's nothing much to say any more. This movie just about sums that up. I did have high hopes for it - there are times when a low budget indie-type movie can breathe new life into a tired franchise - but this movie wasn't it. Very poor acting and a weak script, combined with huge plot holes, make for extremely annoying viewing. I mean, the acting is really amateurish - I've seen better in a school play. And there are some scenes where you just hold your head in your hands and wonder "Why the hell are they doing that?!?". Avoid this and re-watch "Dawn of the Dead" if you want to see how it should be done.
