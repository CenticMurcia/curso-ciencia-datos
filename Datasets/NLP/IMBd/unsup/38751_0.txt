When two guys are driving in, yes you guessed it, the woods they have to hit the breaks, a girl appear saying her car's broken down. But by hitting the breaks they have a flat tire so a ranger takes care of them telling campfire stories. The existing of campfire stories is to frighten people, well here they never do. Only the last story is the best. The second one is so stupid and never frightening and even doesn't contain blood. The acting is okay, especially the ranger knowing that he is the lead singer of The New York Dolls. The only positive thing is the appearance of The Misfits, but i noticed that they mostly do a performance in bad movies. Couldn't say it better.
