i was astounded at the rash of negative comments. in my view this was a great class b movie. while it might not rank with the Cagney genre of gangster movies, for a crime drama, it catches the angst a decent detective trying to find the logic in the irrational might feel.<br /><br />meet Lt. Megan Paige (Eliza Dushku). she's the detective with the brain. why she asks herself would a deranged killer murder a little girl with the initials cc in Christs Church? The percentage of the population with identical initials is small. What is the perverted logic behind the irrational act? She pours into the case but can find no answers. As she is steadily driving herself crazy with trying to second guess the irrational mind, her finance Capt. Kenneth Shine (Cary Elwes) orders her off the case. Hr attempt at suicide lands her in the funny farm where in group she discusses her overreaching toward a solution.<br /><br />Zoom ahead to her discharge. A benevolent ex-fianc√© restores her to uniform in the records department, but with a recurrence of the alphabet murders she is allowed to tag along with the investigating detective through a series of dead ends until a nearby small town force pins the incident on a hostage taker shot in the act.<br /><br />Can former LT Megan Paige retain her sanity long enough to find the killer? See the movie.<br /><br />The cast is not composed of world class actors but the acting is credible.
