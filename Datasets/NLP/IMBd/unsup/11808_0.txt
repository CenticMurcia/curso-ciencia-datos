I always have liked thrilling exciting films that also were puzzling for various reasons.<br /><br />Vantage Point is such a film. It examines an assassination from the viewpoints of a few of the many spectators, There are many surprises in the fast 90 minute (including 6 minutes of credits)running time.<br /><br />Pete Travis ably directed from Barry Levy's screenplay. NOW in films like this down thru time, the screenplay we watch rarely was logical or made much sense. We do not see thrillers for great stories. We see them for excitement's sake.<br /><br />The acting by a large cast both known & little known actors are all first rate. Since the film was made in both Spain & Mexico many non-Americans are cast in various roles to great effect .<br /><br />Dennis Quaid does his usual great job, so does Forrest Whittaker, Sigourney Weaver, Mathew Fox & William Hurt. also cast are Spanish,Mexican actors Eduardo Noriega & Edgar Ramirez & are as expected just first rate.<br /><br />One other actress I must mention is Ayelet Zurer . This fine actress played Eric Bana's wife in MUNICH, 2 years ago & here she gives another fine performance.<br /><br />This is a worthwhile film, just sit back & ignore the improbabilities of the story. NOTE. Any one remember how improbable North by Northwest was. We watched & enjoyed the goings on.<br /><br />Ratings; ***1/2 (out of 4) 96 points(out of 100)'IMDB 9 (out of 10)
