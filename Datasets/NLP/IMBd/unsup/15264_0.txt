SPOILERS FOR Sunday AND SEASON 4 I loved the idea of seeing how our friends spend their down time, but the killing of Dr. Beckett was a very stupid move on the part of the writers. He was a well liked secondary character, killed off in one of the most ridiculous fashions I've ever seen in a show (I mean, really, an exploding _tumor_?!). Then a few episodes later, they kill off Dr. Weir. You'd think they'd have learned after the uproar following Dr. Beckett's death not to go around killing off major characters.<br /><br />I really think Sunday was the beginning of the end of Stargate Atlantis, at least for me. There were good episodes in Season 4 and 5, plus some good moments even in the bad episodes, but overall the show just wasn't the same. The new doctor was very annoying, as was the move to turn Season 5 into the McKay and Keller show, or as I liked to call it, Sex & The Stargate.<br /><br />It was clear that Dr. Beckett was killed off to make room for the new actress, the writers' new pet character. A Mary Sue, who had few flaws, and was never even called out on them. Keller could do no wrong, and if she did, it was overlooked by the characters. All because the writers were angry at the fans' reactions, angry that they didn't love Keller the way they did. Then Dr. Weir was killed off to bring in Col. Carter, in a blatant attempt to pull SG-1 fans to SGA.<br /><br />Two major characters killed off in the space of only a few episodes. The writers didn't care about what the fans thought, only themselves and ratings. If they were only writing for themselves, they shouldn't have put SGA out into the public arena. But because they did put it out there for other people to see, they should have taken into account their feelings as well.
