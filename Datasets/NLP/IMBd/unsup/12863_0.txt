I am a HUGE fan of Nandita Das. She is my favourite Indian actress, by a long way. When I bought this movie I knew that it would not be a Bollywood type cheese-fest. It wasn't. What I liked about it: The pairing of Sanjay and Nandita was very good. They were very believable as an ordinary married couple. Committed to each other and their children. No glamour, no implausible wealth for them. Just sincere, real people. Both were very good in their roles. Nandita is a beautiful woman, who seem literally luminescent, with her intelligence and passion radiating out from within. Sanjay was excellent as the tortured father. Om Puri was frighteningly good as the psycho Dad from hell, and the supporting cast all played their parts well. This movie doesn't pull any punches, either metaphorically or literally. It was one of the most taxing movies I've watched in a long time, but ti was worth it. If you're looking for Main Hoon Na or DDLJ, look elsewhere. If you want powerful, affecting cinema, with a good cast and great performances, give Pitaah a try.
