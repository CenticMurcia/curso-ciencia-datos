I don't know how this actually got released. I do realize that there probably were intentional jokes in this but it is hard to tell. I saw this movie at two video stores here in the Cowichan Valley, BC! So congratulations for that. To the maker of this film: I do admire your ability to "produce a film" fast plus make many copies of it on a professional looking DVD and make a good cover for the DVD. It's great to see someone making horror movies from Canada also. But thankfully you posed this film as if it were American (Washington, U.S.A. not Ontario, Canada.) That was the saving grace of the DVD because I'm Canadian. It was also a relief to see that the Canadian government didn't give money to help this get made. Use your strengths to release DVD's to video stores, but please have all different cast and crew make the film itself.
