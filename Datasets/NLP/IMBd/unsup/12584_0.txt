At the age of 38 Errol Flynn was considered past his best but there is no evidence of this in THE ADVENTURES OF DON JUAN.This is a sumptous feast of a swashbuckling movie,better than CAPTAIN BLOOD and THE SEA HAWK and eclipsed only by the magical THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD. The action is splendidly realised in this picture which captivates from the start with its magnificent score by Max Steiner which accompanies the fight sequences with gusto.Flynn is at his fencing best here,using mannerisms and gestures in his fighting scenes which look both comical and threatening at the same time.A fine and witty script is well served by the entire cast and it is always good to see Alan Hale as Flynn's companion in arms especially in a role like this which is Little John in all but name. At the end of the movie when all wrongs have been righted the Queen asks Don Juan where he will go next.He replies that he will go where most legends go,namely oblivion.I laughed at this line realising as we all should that oblivion will never provide a home for Errol Flynn.
