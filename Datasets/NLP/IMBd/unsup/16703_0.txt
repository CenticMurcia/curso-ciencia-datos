This fine film appeared recently as part of a Chilean film festival at The National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. It is a very moving portrayal of people caught up in struggles with a dictatorial society and harsh weather conditions. The romance between the two main characters serves as a fine example of how we all look for relevance in a world dominated by evil and natural forces.<br /><br />The acting, the script, the cinematography and even the music are all superb. This is the type of film that you will rarely encounter from our Hollywood gristmill. Chilean filmmakers are obviously not afraid to confront their past and to deal with it by producing great artistic films. I have been going to this festival quite regularly and only hope that more people will get to see fine cinema from Chile. Highly Recommended.
