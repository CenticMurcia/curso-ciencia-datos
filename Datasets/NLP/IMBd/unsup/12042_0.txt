I loved it. A mish-mash of RGV's previous gangster flicks. Simply loved 'Randeep Hooda' as 'Deshu'. How cool is that character? Seriously, he's one of my favorite characters of ALL TIME. I just loved the simplicity of this movie. No stupid camera gigs. No special effects on gun-shots. The focus is entirely on telling a good story and it keeps u riveted like other gangster flicks haven't. 'D' never drags.<br /><br />Hooda has some screen presence.....this guy really commands ur attention. He emotes through his eyes and is downright chilling in some scenes. He's also gifted with a strong voice. I can definitely see him going places.<br /><br />People expecting another cheap kichri of Satya/Company will be surprised by how entertaining and well made this flick is. Definitely recommended!
