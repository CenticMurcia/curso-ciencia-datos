I must admit, I was impressed on several levels with this sequel. As far as the flaws, I can see some of the bad cgi, some cheesy acting, low budget effect, etc.<br /><br />BUT This movie was more sincere in its efforts than the first. As a former player of the game, I saw that it held true to many of the game values, and I could relate to the characters and story.<br /><br />The cast did a good job, and it was more of an ensemble performance. Like the first film, I was impressed with their exotic use of Lithuanian film locales.<br /><br />If you've never played the game, you probably won't see it as more than "typical cheesy fantasy". For players, it will be a pretty cool experience, and not just a bit o fluff (One character gets killed by a Frost Dragon, another gets her arm teleported into a wall) I have a mixed feeling about the end, since the Hero doesn't "Get midievel" on Damodar, but I like that refreshing break from the clich√©d final face offs that Hollywood demands to insert into every movie. Our hero is not a wisecracking killing machine. He's strong but just as vulnerable and not just out for revenge.<br /><br />Bruce Payne is an interesting choice to bring in from the first movie, and he handles the role of evil Damodar well, despite having no real motivation outside pure revenge.<br /><br />The chemistry between party members is above average, and they're smart characters, not the typical dumb pretty people. A decent film overall
