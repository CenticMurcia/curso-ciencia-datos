A Superb Film!!<br /><br />Like 2002's "City Of God", "Carandiru" too takes a similar approach to a True Story. The narration of this movie is Excellent. One story after the other, well paced and well Told. Some stories are completely disturbing. The Level or reality present in the scenes and the Mix of Humor is always well BALANCED. The performances by all the actors are worth Praising.<br /><br />******Spoliers********** this movie could be Politically incorrect. The ending in particular is made out of Rumors and stories told about what happened. We should know that this movie isnot trying to make statements. After all we know what the outcome was. But could there possibly be any justifiable reason to such MASS-KILLING? NO! Well that's the only point this movie is trying to make. And I respect the movie for this.<br /><br />This movie All in All is an Excellent film. Well written and perfectly Directed. I wonder how this movie did not make it into the Oscar Contenders list. 9/10
