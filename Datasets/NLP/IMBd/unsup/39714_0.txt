This movie was a rather interesting first take for Director Sobel.The story is interesting, the comedy works,somewhat,and the characters are well developed.The biggest downside is in the technical aspects of the film. The sound quality is very bad at times.And, the lighting;Lee, one word of advice.TAKE A PHOTOGRAPHY CLASS!!The lighting is terrible,just terrible.Most of it is full frontal, sort of like the old 8mm movie lights,which were mounted on the front top of the cameras.If the director was trying to make it look like a home movie,then he succeeded.But, I think it detracted from the story, the characters,and made the film less watchable. I spent most of the movie complaining about the bad lighting,instead of watching the film.<br /><br />Still, I have to give the film a 4 out of ten, if for nothing else, the killer soundtrack, featuring some of the best underground rockabilly bands ever.I hope that this director gets more opportunities to develop his craft, as his story was actually pretty good.Maybe, with some experience,and a bigger budget, he could come up with something really good.rp
