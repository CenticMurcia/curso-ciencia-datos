I was actually hoping this film didn't have anything to do with the last two installments and that the titles were just similar..man was i wrong. If this p.o.s can be called a sequel then Hollywood is truly an awful place to make films.<br /><br />The movie starts off a lot like The Thing (a much better horror film)but slowly degrades into a manure pile, having to figure out who's killing who, where the bodies are being taken, zombies are around, someone is dead, now they aren't, now they are, the guy's brother is behind it all, and oh yeah, hes a demon and turns out our protagonist is a demon too, but, you know, with a good heart, who falls in love with the girl and saves the day.<br /><br />Thats pretty much the film and it sucks, so now I've saved u the pain of watching it, go do something better with your time. Really folks, skip this one.
