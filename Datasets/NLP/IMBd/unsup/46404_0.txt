This is done well enough to satisfy the most indiscriminate, but even those children in my acquaintance who were above the age of nine were dissatisfied with this animation, citing rough edges, and a complete disregard for detail where backgrounds and set props were concerned.<br /><br />The story is the familiar story of most movie-goers' childhood, hidden deep, but it is in there, about a chicken who, when hit by something from the sky (pine straw, perhaps?) proclaims the sky is falling, much to the amusement of the other barnyard residents of the chicken's fair village. This has, of course, been Disneyized, made into a father/son thing, and child characters were invented for the further Disneyization to be complete.<br /><br />This is not great, and offers little for the family, OR adult audiences. This was aimed mostly at the kiddies, and only the younger ones will (at least in my experience) typically enjoy this. Probably because the "dad" in this is a self-centered, faithless mook who cares about no one but himself. Even after he shows support of his son, it's all about "look at me, look how supportive I'm being!" instead of Chicken Little and HIS accomplishments. He sucks as a father, and who wants to see that? There are too many in real life, who suck, for this to be enjoyable.<br /><br />It rates a 4.0/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
