Favorite characters from the hit T.V. show "Saturday Night Live" bring a pretty low comedy that doesn't deliver too much. There are a couple laughs, but mostly all you get is a strange feeling after this movie. Despite the characters being non stop funny in S.N.L, they don't really have a life story that can be brought into a movie. They try to live in the suburbs and fit in. The community is questionable about their apperance, but they let them be apart of it. The daughter wants to look and feel normal, and eventually does fit in with her high school. Strange that she has a normal accent of humans, I have to mention. Over all, it's not a bad movie. But I'd only watch it again if I were pretty bored.<br /><br />4/10<br /><br />
