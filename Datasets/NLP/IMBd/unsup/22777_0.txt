O (Takashi Sorimachi) is a Japanese living in Hong Kong and is the best hitman money can get in Asia. To evade from his enemies, he rents another apartment opposite his current one and lives there.<br /><br />Tok is the new kid on the block who wants O's high-paying jobs and obsessed about having O's fame. He rents an apartment above O's to observe him and rents his favorite films from the neighborhood video rental store even though he doesn't own a VCR.<br /><br />Chin is a Taiwanese who owns a video rental store round the corner, cleans O's apartment 3 evenings a week and has huge crushes for both men.<br /><br />Adapted from the HK serialized novel of the same name, it has less details, character development and plot but still leaves a lot to be admired. And if you liked Johnny To's Running Out of Time, you would enjoy his style of gun fights, the hint of brotherhood between the two opposing characters and the non-sequential way of story telling. Highly watchable.
