This Movie Is Very Funny Like When That NK Soldier Dropped A Grenade And The S Soldier Layed On Top Of It. The Villagiers Were Like What The Heck ARe You Doing? The Grenade Didn't Blow Up But When The S Soldier Threw It Backwards The Grenade Blew Into A Corn House And POPCORN CAME OUT! Laughing Out Loud! Its Pretty Sad When That Scared Medic Dies After He Gets Mad When His friend dies and at the beginning when all those innocent NK Soldiers die especially that wounded soldier.<br /><br />This Is A Truly Amazing Movie That Anyone Should Watch. I Give It A 10 Out Of 10. Its Tae Guk Gi Comedy Style! This Movie Is Really Comedy And Is The Best Movie Rated In Korea.
