Not a big fan of these K-dramas, watch them more with the spouse as a window on the culture. The hammy acting, over-cranked "action", poor girl/rich guy(s), family values, no sex ingredients are all here. But this one is a weak effort, with far far too many minutes of silent angst/introspection by the four leads interspersed by either Han Ji-eun or Lee Yeong-jae storming out of the house they share and then returning for more. Seen on a weekly basis it must have been a hoot to wonder which one would be packing this time. Word to the wise - people have to talk on TV, it is more like radio, the screen is too small for big action or scenery, and there's none of that here, Shanghai and Seoul are seen in dull overcast skies. Watching people stare at walls while soft music tinkles in the background is, well, kind of boring. The story also has to move a bit on it's own, this one lurches ahead by having the two "friends" (...who needs enemies?)appear now and then to prod them on. A rare bit of wit in the script raises the score but overall a snoozer.
