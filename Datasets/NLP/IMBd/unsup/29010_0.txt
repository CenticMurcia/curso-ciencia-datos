Verdi outdid himself when he penned La Traviata. The cast of singers for this production is superb. The cinematography is appropriately both beautiful and colorful, particularly at the Villa outside Paris.<br /><br />Stratas is excellent and poignant as Violetta. Domingo makes a most passionate Alfredo. Cornell MacNeil is a splendid Giorgio Germont. Alan Monk is a fine Baron. The cinematography is particularly fine.<br /><br />All in all this is one of the finest productions of La Traviata ever.<br /><br />I believe that I have it on both laser disc and DVD.<br /><br />
