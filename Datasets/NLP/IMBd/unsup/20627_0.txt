Although this is a classically executed Film-Noir, it is a slow-moving and ultimately disappointing film. Indeed, Joan Crawford has never been better. Van Heflin has a great role as the man she desires. The cinematography is more than perfect. However, the story of a woman slowly going insane is not well constructed and takes forever to get going. I gather that psychiatry was just beginning to be fully embraced by the public as a cause for criminal behavior, hence the "psychiatry for dummies" explanation of Joan's behavior during the story. The film finally comes alive near the end and gets more interesting after Joan gets more crazy. But everything ends in a thud when the resolution of the film is nothing more than the doctors agreeing she is crazy and that's what caused her to murder.
