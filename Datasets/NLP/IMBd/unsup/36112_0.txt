There may be worse movies. Yes, indeed, there may be worse movies. That doesn't mean I want to see them, or be near them or even hear of them. You can have your director's ouevre, your Ed Wood, your own particular claim that a particular movie is the Worst Movie Ever Made. I don't really care.<br /><br />When it comes to High Concept Pictures, this ranks up there with Jules White's "Dogville" series, in which inoffensive puppies are stuffed into costumes, wired into position and then made to stand around, urinating on themselves, after which voices are dubbed into a satire of "the Face on the Bar Room Floor"; or "The Three Fatties" series: If they laugh at fat comics, and they laugh at at movie teams, then how about a movie team of three men who tip the scale at 300 pounds each? Yeah, that's High Concept!<br /><br />Well, the High Concept here was to cross the Singing Western -- itself a slightly bizarre idea with the idea of an All Midget movie. They'll love it! At least, the producer did. The midgets were cheap, the script available for pennies -- mostly endless repetition of "He wants to be the biggest man in the county!" and the songs... well, they ain't Gershwin.<br /><br />Has to be seen to be believed, and even then you won't.
