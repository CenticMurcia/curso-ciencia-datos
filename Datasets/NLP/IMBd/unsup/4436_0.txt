It was one of the few shows on CBS that didn't have a chance as it should have had. It was well-written and I liked the cast including Brian Keith and his real-life daughter Daisy Keith (Both father and daughter committed suicide years later). I remember this show because it was rural and set in the Heartland of Nebraska. First, there are few shows set in Nebraska anymore. I always liked to see how other people lived in other states. The show also featured Richard Gilliland (husband of Jean Smart in real life). I thought the show had a lot going for it but obviously, I was wrong. The show got cancelled and I have nothing but my memories of it for now. It would be nice to see family oriented sitcoms like Heartland today on network television or on cable or in syndication. I have a feeling that Heartland would have done well in syndication like Mama's Family.
