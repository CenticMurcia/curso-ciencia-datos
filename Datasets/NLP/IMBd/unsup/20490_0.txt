I didn't really get into this movie until the first car scene, Then things begin to happen and From this moment forward, this movie turns into a pure magical experience you just can't turn away from. Michael J. Fox is at his very best and so is everyone else in this heartwarming film. I found myself wanting to find this enchanting little town full of pure "down home folks". It's a very funny film that draws you completely into it. It's about real life, real happiness, and real people. No phonies here. This film will make you think about what life is really about. Watch it once and you will find yourself wanting to watch it over and over again. It's absolutely one of the best films I have seen
