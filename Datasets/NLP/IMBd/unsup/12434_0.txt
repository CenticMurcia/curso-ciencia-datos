It's not even a good Bad movie if you see what I mean..... Cheerleader horror movies ought to have at least a few cute cheerleaders who manage to have a wardrobe malfunction every few scenes, as this movie goes on you are rather glad they generally keep their clothes on cos they aren't exactly pretty.... The rest of it just gonzo enough to lift it to a 2 instead of a 1.... The plot is a bit hard to follow some of the time, glaringly easy in other places, generally rather disjointed, which considering the mad doctor disectionist theme might have been a situationalist pun in something cleverer. This is one for bad low-budget horror purists, if you are looking for a Skinemax T+A horror show, get something else.<br /><br />Chris
