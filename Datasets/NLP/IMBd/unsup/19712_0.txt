I thought this film was excellent. I think it was great for Eve Ensler to allow and encourage these women to openly express themselves in a non-violent, positive and honest way. The only woman whom I found to be a total phony was Pamela Smart. She is the infamous New Hampshire seductress husband killer who got her teen lover to do her dirty work for her. When she read she took no responsibility for her actions. She told the same story she's been offering up for the last 14 years. "It was not my fault, i'm innocent, it was my co-defendants". Does this sound familiar.<br /><br />The thing I thought was really cool about it was that Eve Ensler, my favorite female playwright was the workshop leader. Also, another great thing was that actors, Glenn Close, Rosie Perez, Marisa Tomei, Maryalice and Hazelle Goodman gave excellent Broadway like performances. Not only did I like their performances but I also liked the discussion sessions in-between.<br /><br />I thought that the women being able to express themselves this way was great. The reason I think this is because most of them have not done many positive things in their in lives but this is one that they have done. I thought the "Puppy Behind Bars" program was cool. It must be nice to train these guard dogs for needy people and give back.<br /><br />I give this movie a 10 stars out of 10. I liked it so much that I bought my own DVD of it. I think the interview with Eve Ensler and Judith Katz was very cool and informing. I also like the full-length performances by the featured actors, because although I like hearing excerpts of things, I do like to hear them in whole too. "Thanks, Eve Ensler".
