I remember seeing this film when it first came out, and also remember that is disappeared from the video store shortly thereafter. The special effects are dodgy, the script is poorly-written and the acting is pathetic, but that doesn't matter. No one could seriously pick up this film and think, "Dylan Walsh, Ice-T AND Erika Eleniak? This is going to be good!" It's an average film that's fun the first time round, and may even offer a few surprises (frankly, I didn't expect it to end the way it did). Actually, now that I think about it this film probably kicked off my love-affair (*cough*) with B-grade movies. It's fun if you don't take it seriously, and even then it's painful to watch. Rent 'Beyond the Poseidon Adventure' instead.
