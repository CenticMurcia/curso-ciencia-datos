I like horror movies, especially old ones. I don't care if the acting, or the story is cheesy as long as I enjoy the movie. But I found this one far from entertaining. The death scenes aren't anything to look at, there is barely any blood, and the suspense just isn't there. The whole movie is covered in darkness, half the time I couldn't see what's going on the screen, because there isn't any lighting. As hard as I tried, I just couldn't get into it, I forced my self to sit through the rest of it hoping it would get better, but there is nothing there. And that's a lot to say, when Halloween is just around the corner, and I was watching this at night with a couple of friends.
