contrary to some of the comments here-- this movie is not hilarious.<br /><br />the plot was great, but many of the jokes were wasted by some horrific dialogue and awkward english. the better talents like Gerard Dep. and Renaud's character Zero are largely unused in favor of some bumbling fat guy who was torture to watch....<br /><br />good direction-- just bad, bad, baaaad acting/dialog and a waste of some good characters
