<br /><br />Walt Disney cartoonists toured the USA to promote the Disney cartoon feature HERCULES a few years back. They explained how a villain's face is drawn with many extreme sharp angles, while the faces of good characters are drawn with much more gentle curves.<br /><br />This explains the downfall of LIFE-SIZE. Jere Burns' face is the living, breathing representation of a Disney bad guy. As Christopher Walken instantly radiates supernatural feakishness, Jere Burns instantly embodies the villainous antagonist. He can't help it. His smile always comes across as sneering and menacing. His look is always fierce.<br /><br />This distraction is very unfortunate as LIFE-SIZE has so much going for it. Tyra Banks is the ultimate doll. Lindsay Lohan's common girl looks helps Tyra Banks' perfect super-model beauty shine. The story is engaging, and the pacing is good.<br /><br />So, why not cast Brian Wimmer as the warm, charming single father? Wimmer's good-guy looks is the Disney artist's dream. LIFE-SIZE could then stand toe-to-toe with ONE FINE DAY as an exercise in adult charm and chemistry.<br /><br />Oh well, perhaps next time.
