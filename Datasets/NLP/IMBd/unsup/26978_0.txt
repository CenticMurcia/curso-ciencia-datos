There are several beautiful things about this movie. The beautiful scenery of Hawaii or Maui, whatever, and the looks of Jason Mamoa. Both worth watching. Mamoa is fetching in his scenes without his shirt, running along the beach. Quite a fantasy. Or in the deep blue waters of the cave. However not too much else happens in this older married woman and younger lover theme. Virginia Madsen, that Sharon Stone wannabe, is just awful, in this. No chemistry, not even sexual for the young man. In fact their love scenes fell flat. Too controlled. Lainie Kazan doesn't sing a note in this. Too bad. She's a super singer lady and plays a grandmother on the island. For a Jewish mama she seemed to play the role all right. But, I'd rather hear Lainie sing a torch song. However, there is the beauty and distinguished Vietnamese actress Kieu Chinh in the film. She brings simplicity and class to this picture. So 3 stars for Hawaii, Kieu and Mamoa.
