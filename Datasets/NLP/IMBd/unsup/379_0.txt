good Canadian movies are a hard jem to find ( as is any Canadian one) but this one is somewhat easier to find<br /><br />after watching the first one i immediately needed to view the second and i isn't a letdown in any way to its predecessor.<br /><br />the story follows Bridgette after running away from her dark past. shes completely changed except for the fact shes still a werewolf, and is now an independent woman with some "problems" but soon after passing out in a snowbank from an overdose of monkshood is taken into a drug clinic and the story begins there.<br /><br />if you thought the first one was to dark, then you may have to watch this movie of an extended period of time<br /><br />any wean this movie is amazing in every single way buy it NOW!!
