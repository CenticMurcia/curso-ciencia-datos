This movie is so bad that it may make the list of worst movies of all time. The world has a one world goverment led by the devil. The hero of the movie is put on trail for "hatred of the human race." Nothing rings true in the movie. It all seems so dumb that you wonder why anyone would have any part in the movie. There is no real story, no one can act plus it has Mr. T in the movie. That should tell you the type of actors the movie has in it.<br /><br />You can thank God that there is not a one world government and that I am not the leader. If I were the leader and you liked this movie I would put you on trail for hatred of movies (and art).<br /><br />You will see some born again members of the God squad give this a review with five stars. If you rent or buy this movie try not to curse.<br /><br />There are excellent movies out there about God and religion. This is not one of them. Pray that we are not subject to many more movies like this.
