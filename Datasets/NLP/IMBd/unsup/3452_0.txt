this is the absolute worst piece of trash i have ever seen in my entire life! who would be dumb enough to rent this trash? actually i am dumb enough because i paid 3 bucks to see this movie because i thought it looked halfway decent, like an actual good slasher film. its amazing, if i were in 1987 maybe i could have gotten a video camera and shot a film as bad as this. the acting is terrible, the script is worse, there are like no good death scenes, the music sucks, the ending sucks, this film just sucks sucks sucks! avoid at all costs! for a decent flick rent the glenville films or slumber party massacre or something like that, not this junk. <br /><br />rating: 0 out of 10
