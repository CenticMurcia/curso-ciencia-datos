What's wrong with these people? These movie makers, they think they can be creative and change myth and classic cartoons to suit their "vision". Where there vision is blurry and need glasses. If you want to be creative, then write something new, you don't go around messing with classic Greek stories. The minotaur is part man and part bull. Which mean he walks on two feet and has hands. What happened to his eyes? There was a flashback when the minotaur was born and he had eyes. Just because something or someone goes blind from decades in total darkness doesn't mean his eyes fall out and where is his lips? Is this Minotaur alive or some kind of Zombull? The acting and story works, but the whole minotaur thing truly destroys the experience for me. One, fur on flesh, two walks up right and three has lips and eyes. The changes totally ruin this movie and I feel anyone who knows the slightest bit of Greek myth will feel the same, it's quite obvious the makers knew nothing of Greek Myth or of Minotaurs. So I give this awful piece of crap the NOOSE!
