Even though the idea is interesting (a society where the Gays are the majority and the straights are the exception), the implementation of this subject on the movie was awful. Characters without any cause of existence (the two fathers, the "funny" friend of the boy etc), a REALLY NAIVE plot, caricatures who scream all the time without knowing why (it is supposed to be funny in Greek movies), and a very bad approach lacking any comedy characteristic. I didn't laugh at all, and at the end of the movie I felt like an idiot (the end is VERY-VERY naive). At the pros of the movie I only add the photography and the good production. Don't see the movie and waste your time like I did.
