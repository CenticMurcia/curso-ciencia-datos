MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!!! I am from Durham, North Carolina where this took place. My family even knew Michael. I live a few blocks from the Cedar St home, and was shocked when I heard what happened. "Poor Michael.." I thought. What I was to learn about this man many of my family members and friends of my family called a friend would shock me. All things considered, I think the case is still extremely circumstantial, and the reasonable doubt is there. Can you move past the physical evidence and get into the science? I am not completely convinced as to his guilt OR his innocence, but I think the criminal justice system failed him. Was his bisexuality an issue? No. Was Elizabeth Ratliff an issue according to the events of December 9th, 2001? Most certainly not. In the end, the trial wasn't even about Kathleen anymore, but more so about trying to paint Michael as sinister a man as there could possibly be.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great documentary, and I highly recommend this to everyone. Jim Hardin says this case is about pretenses and appearances, but look deeper into those, from both sides. Not even a Hollywood writer could make a script this compelling.<br /><br />10/10.
