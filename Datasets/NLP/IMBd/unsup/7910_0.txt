A group of VIPs including Henry Kubica (John Waters), a high-executive of the Corporation, is kidnapped by a gang of robbers in a building of a casino, which is protected by a state of art security system. Kam (Bobbie Phillips), the human hybrid and IBI (International Bureau of Investigation) agent, together with another IBI agent, infiltrate in the group, trying to get enough information to organize the rescue of them without jeopardizing the safety of Kubica. However, she realizes that there are much more interests for the Corporation that the safety of the persons. This movie is really a bad clone of Die Hard, having bad story and ham actors and actresses. The beauty of Bobbie Phillips is not enough to save this film. Anyway, Bobbie Phillips and the surprising end of the plot are the best this movie can offer. The parts I and III of Chamaleon are better and better. My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): `Sedutora e Fatal II: Inimigo Mortal' (`Seductive and Fatal II: Mortal Enemy')
