After the success of the Home Alone film they decided to do the continuation. Quite unnecessarily, all the more so because it is an everyday plagiarism. Then again it is happening into the day of the Christmas, then again Kevin is starting the scuffle after the provocation of the brother, then again he is being told off by the mother, then again he must leave home together with the family, then again is getting lost this time getting the aeroplane mixed up which was supposed to get on then again... Okay, it won't be spoiler, but we are dealing with the sheer plagiarism. As well then again we are coming across the same nebbish types. Apart from that the second part of adventures this way isn't amusing Kevin as first, mainly thanks to darker climat. I am advising.
