I'm awestruck by the people who wanted this movie to win the Oscar for the best movie, where do these people live??? One this movie is lifted from the Oscar nominated "The Miracle Worker" which also won the best actress that year. Well you could say that remakes also get an Oscar, nut it needs some originality. Amithab's acting is at its pathetic worst. It would have been a great theater production but for the screen it just didn't do it. Where is the fairyland where all this is happening, there is not a single things that seems to be related to India it seems more to be set in Britain with the British speaking good Hindi. In all it was melodrama at its worst.
