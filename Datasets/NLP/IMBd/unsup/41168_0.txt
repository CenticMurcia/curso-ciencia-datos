First of all to the formal qualities of the movie: it is well done regarding the score, the cinematography and the actors' performances. Nevertheless, it was extremely hard to watch till the end because it made me furious how it depicted men and women. If it's true that, according to other reviewers, the movie truthfully adapts the novella of Lawrence and his opinions, then it doesn't say any good about Lawrence's work either.<br /><br />As a straight man, I'm not very fond of 90% of men (most of them haven't got the heart, openness, and sensibility that I can easily find in many female friends), but the guy in this movie was extremely disgusting and is shown as a typical 1960s smug, self-opinionated alpha male who doesn't ask a woman once he has made up his mind, and who isn't interested in her thoughts, doubts or feelings (this being another ugly stereotype in this movie: a man doesn't have second thoughts, doubts or too much feelings, while women are so despicably weak that they consist of nothing else). He unperturbedly returns to the farm despite Ellen's letter saying that she doesn't love him and can't marry him, and even then, he doesn't ask, doesn't wonder. What communication skills, what a role model to be married with!<br /><br />The movie's/Lawrence's hate towards lesbians is clearly shown in the short dialog between Paul and Jill where he wonders why she would be a lesbian as she's "not bad-looking, features are good, nice legs" (we are to understand: you become a lesbian because no man wants you, i.e. as a last resort). Then he tries to "convince" her that it only needs a real man to convert her (yes, he means himself!). What a subtlety! At that moment, if I hadn't been a man, I would have sworn to become lesbian myself.<br /><br />Furthermore there's the ridiculous tree cutting scene at the end where the movie/Lawrence finally gets rid of the stupid, stubborn dyke who stands in the way of another unhappy, but holy marriage of an idiot with a weak-willed woman who doesn't love him. Here again, the man doesn't falter, whereas Ellen stands around like a prop. Women are such ridiculous sheep-like creatures that they show no solidarity, not even in precarious situations. And they aren't supposed to as their foremost allegiance must be to their husband.<br /><br />Is that what you wanted us to learn, Mr Lawrence (author) and Mr Rydell (director)? I'm glad we've overcome the stench of those times and thoughts.
