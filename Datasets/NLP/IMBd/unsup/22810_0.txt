This "Tarzan" variation has losing coach John Amos (as Sam Archer) finding "The World's Greatest Athlete" in the form of loin-clothed Jan-Michael Vincent (as Nanu), while on safari in Africa, with sidekick Tim Conway (as Milo Jackson). Naturally, Mr. Amos brings Mr. Vincent home, to bone up his failing college team. Vincent's furry companion "Harry" (a tiger) also makes the trip. Vincent is puzzled by kissing, but finds a willing partner in Dayle Haddon (as Jane). Alas, voodoo godfather Roscoe Lee Browne (as Gazenga) wants Vincent returned to Africa...<br /><br />A well, dumb movie. All you really have are some 1970s TV favorites, sweetened with a young and beautiful Jan-Michael Vincent.<br /><br />**** The World's Greatest Athlete (2/4/73) Robert Scheerer ~ Jan-Michael Vincent, John Amos, Tim Conway
