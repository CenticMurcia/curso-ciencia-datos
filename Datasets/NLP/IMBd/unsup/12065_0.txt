This movie was good, but wasn't that exciting. It was a little to long and the acting in the beginning wasn't that great but it picked up towards the end. Very predictable of how the ending was going to be. The two tigers that attacked the horses in the movie could not have been any more fake. The coolest character was the slave to the Muslim princess who was beatin' the crap out of maybe ten guys with swords. The sand storm was really sick and believable and a close call for Viggo when he was running from it. There were a few people who p****d me off throughout the movie, like the guy who kept trying to sabotage Viggo's character. Overall, the movie was good, but I wouldn't want to watch it again.
