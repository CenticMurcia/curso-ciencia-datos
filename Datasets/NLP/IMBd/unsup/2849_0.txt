This is an odd little Dutch movie about a dress, which seems to be the bearer of bad luck for all who come into contact with it. First a man loses his job because he doesn't agree with the choice of design (it's a pretty blue with an odd leaf design). Then a woman who buys it becomes ill, and when the dress is hanging out to dry after washing (apparently she barfed on it) it blows away and ends up in the hands of a young woman who lives with an eccentric painter, who is then set upon by a deranged ticket taker from a train, a bus driver, and then gives up the dress to send to Africa, but it's of course snagged by someone else who cleans it up, trims it a bit, and it ends up on this young lady who also ends up on this train with the deranged ticket taker, who then stalks her to her remote home while her parents are away, etc. etc. There are some quite amusing moments to this, and at other times it's about as strange as can be. This is a dark comedy, and at times it also offers up some social commentary on the homeless and on foreigners. In some ways it reminds me of "Phantom of Liberty" or maybe "The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeosie" (Luis Bunuel) in its episodic style. This odd little film definitely won't be for everyone though, but it's funny and bizarre and even a bit touching at times. 8 out of 10.
