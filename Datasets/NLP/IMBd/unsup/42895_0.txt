This Married With Children Reunion was such a let down. One hour and all it was is a clip show. Just some quick clips about Al, Peg, Kelly, Bud and Buck. Jefferson, Steve, Marcey were there but no clips really about them. FOX really let me down. This show gets a D-. And thats only cause MWC the show rules.
