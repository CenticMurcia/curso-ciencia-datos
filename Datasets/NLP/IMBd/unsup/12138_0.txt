I absolutely love movies that provoke thought, and this movies does exactly that, and then some. At first, being only 22, I was weary about renting it because it was released before I was even born, and thought that the movie could possibly be out-dated. I could not have been more wrong. I could write an entire dissertation about this movie and the aspects it raises about present day life, but instead I'll just simply state that this movie is flat-out amazing and will certainly make you reflect on the path of life you have chosen to follow. While watching this movie, I had to repeatedly rewind the movie because I would be in such deep thought about a point Andre had just made, that I would completely miss the next few minutes of the movie. Quit reading this comment, scrounge up some change, and go watch it!!!
