Personally, I am a fan of apocalyptic fiction and thoughts of what would happen if the bombs really dropped. I have read all the good books, from Alas Babylon to The Last Ship to Lucifer's Hammer to The Beach. Apparently, the producers and writers of this God-Awful show have not read any of them and seem to have no clue how life might really be like if a small town was isolated by a nuclear holocaust. The writing is so absolutely terrible, they say stuff like "When I get back to DC, I'm gonna get rid of these clothes!". What DC, lady? Its gone. Get a clue. Its laughable. After Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans descended into a kind of hell only 24 hours after the storm...looters, gunfire, rapes, a REAL struggle for survival. In Jericho, they seem to have an endless supply of beer at the bar, the booze is flowing, nobody is hungry, they are not defending their city against unknown evils, its hard to imagine that anyone on the writing staff has a clue about what a struggle daily life would really be like in a post-holocaust world. The first van full of Uzi-toting bad guys would mow the town down and they would abduct and rape the women and the men would all be dead. The concept of life after the big one is an interesting premise, but perhaps there has never been a show about a serious subject on the laughable scale as this embarrassment. Rebuilding the world, or what is left of it, is a topic that can engage us for a long time, but the people in this clueless town act like "oh, a bunch of nuclear bombs wiped out most of our country, when is Oprah on!."
