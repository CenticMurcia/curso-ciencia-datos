Laura (Molly Lamont) thinks she is being frightened to death. She is not a very pleasant character, just the way she talks to people. Professor Leonide (Bela Lugosi) and his companion Indigo (Angelo Rossito) arrive. Rossito had a featured role in "Freaks" and was hugely in demand in Hollywood. Bela is fantastic as usual as Leonide, someone from Doctor Josef Van Ee's (George Zucco) past. The way Bela looks the Doctor up and down and sneers "old friends" with a wealth of meaning - is there anyone who could doubt he is one of the all time greats!!!!<br /><br />It is a pretty ghastly movie - nothing makes much sense. The doctor's son produces a photo of a masked couple - he thinks it will clear up the identity of Laura. The ending is fantastically bad with every thing in the plot but the kitchen sink. And any film with Joyce Compton as the second lead (however madcap she is ) you know is not going to be a grade A production. Still the "Natural Color" does look very natural - not garish or artificial. The biggest mystery of the film is why it was filmed in color in the first place - when there were so many lesser musicals that could have been enhanced by color.
