I believe I am doomed to never catch THE WOODS all the way through, despite owning a DVR, but I have now seen most of it over two or three viewings. A troubled girl is sent to a girls' boarding school set in the woods, and from there her troubles only mount. She hears voices, witnesses nasty things going on in school, keeps getting into it with a jealous adversary, and periodically exhibits traces of telekinesis, making various objects stand on end and dance. In the end, which I am yet to see completely, her power linked with those of two other school girls, keeps three ancient witches from doing something nasty, like swapping bodies or something equally bad. The movie is slow-going and moody, but genuinely scary. I understand the ending dissatisfied many viewers. Maybe some day I will find out why. Agnes Bruckner as the new arrival is the real focus of the film, and she gives an amazing performance for a then-20 year old playing a teenager. The wonderful Patricia Clarkson is the slightly mysterious school dean. The rest of the cast are pretty much unknowns. The film, while American, set in Connecticut and shot in Canada, feels almost foreign, as if it were set in Germany, for example. Also, I was reminded from time to time of Argento's witchcraft masterpiece SUSPIRIA, although there is no gore in THE WOODS.
