Not even great special effects can save this film. It's simply awful.<br /><br />A special elite force is brought into Washington.<br /><br />Ice Cube has got such anger in him. His bitterness usurps his part. Yes, he was unjustly put in jail, but get a life already.<br /><br />Willem DaFoe is up to his old tricks in the role of the villain. The fine acting talents of Peter Strauss are wasted in a role of a good looking president who is looking for world peace in a world of violence. DaFoe, as his adviser, plots his demise. We know what invariably happens, but to give the DaFoe character a military burial in praise of him? For what?<br /><br />The mild mannered Strauss using the 4 letter word was also quite inappropriate at the moment it was uttered.<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson has the thankless role of Cube's mentor. Don't these guys bother to read scripts anymore?
