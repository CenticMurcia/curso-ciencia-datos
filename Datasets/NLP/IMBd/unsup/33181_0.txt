Very amateurish film-making that goes absolutely nowhere. Nothing redeemable at all. This film could have been good if even so much as a single individual involved in the film had a clue how to make movies. <br /><br />I often wonder how much these movies cost to make. I wonder.. could this film costs like maybe $50,000 or more? If so, what dingbats are giving these people such amounts of money? I can't understand how many filmmakers there are out there who have no real understanding of any part of this wonderful medium yet they get money to make films all the same. Gotta give them points for that at least. <br /><br />Aaaaanyway....
