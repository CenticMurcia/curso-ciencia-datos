I doubt this is on the air in America now (2008), but Star World network is touting this as a new show in their "family friendly" lineup. It goes way overboard to make every character have a serious hang up about something, and of course there is Jane Curtain's mental illness, oh thats always a great subject to laugh about! They all get together working in a restaurant and there is a lot of awkward moments, in fact the whole show is more soap opera with a load laugh track added to make you think it's funny, but it's just one awkward moment after another with a mentally ill woman thrown in for the gut buster (not!). There was a reason it only aired for 5 episodes, LOL. That may be the best joke this show provided! 4 stars because its in color I guess, I actually would rather a lame show like friends over this and I always turn the channel when Friends comes on, so there ya go.
