Can't say I would have much faith in a bunch of scientists that come to survey the devastation reaped on the West Coast of Ireland but are so 'clever' that they fail to notice that the surveying instrument they are using does NOT have a battery. Admittedly I use this sort of gear all the time and do tend to notice minor details like whether or not I can actually turn it on or not but this crack team of experts seemed to miss that. Bet they felt silly when they got back to their base and found that all their work was lost cos they were too dumb to notice something as obvious. Not a bad film but some of the accents were a bit odd to say the least......and why is it that America always takes charge whenever Earth is threatened.....that would terrify me more than the bloody comet.:)
