"Kiss of the Dragon" is just my favorite movie. You don't see Jet Li in any of his movie like this before. This is his most violent movie yet. His moves are more realistic compared to his previous movie "Romeo Must Die". In this movie, you don't see Jet Li flying in the air, he stays on the ground doing hand-to-hand combat.<br /><br />I recommend this movie to any hardcore action fans, but just don't take you children to see it.
