An interesting action film about a group of bank robber come terrorists who Hijack an oil rig from which they wish to fire an electro magnetic pulse over California to wipe out any traces of their robbery. Unfortunately for them, the tug boat captain, an ex marine happens to be around to help save the day with help from an undercover FBI agent.<br /><br />Watch as the face paced action with gun fights and even hand to hand combat. There are explosions and the screen play is spot on. I recommend this to anyone.<br /><br />Vinnie Jones does an excellent job in the bad boy role of terrorist group leader. Eddie Griffin as the tug boat captain is as perfect as you can be. You even get to see Shaggy in this film.<br /><br />My rating 10/10
