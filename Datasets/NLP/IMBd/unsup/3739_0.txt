I first saw The Zoo Gang when I was a child of about five. The story itself is the cliche'd 80's movie where a group of kids beat the odds to fight for the club that they have, the place that gives them meaning. They fight an incoming developer and his hick family by training with Ben Vereen, otherwise known as Chicken George from Roots. When their training is finished, they realize that they've had the power the whole time to defend themselves and their friendships are made even stronger.
