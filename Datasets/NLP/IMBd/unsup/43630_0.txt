This film doesn't even deserve one star.<br /><br />The writing is horrendous, the plot is directionless and the story has been done and done much much better. Visually it's hideous.<br /><br />Basically it's the old case of "the original stuff wasn't good and the good stuff wasn't original" except there really wasn't anything good at all about this film.<br /><br />The character of Dorian must be one of the most painful protagonists ever. He's not endearingly weird or even dorkily cute, he's just hopeless and the brother isn't much better, he just has better social skills. There's no character arc at all. You just hope Dorian dies alone and his brother has a drug overdose. Maybe he did actually, I don't even remember.<br /><br />It's not comedy-drama because it's not funny and it's not a drama because it's laughable. Tragic tragic tragic and completely cringeworthy.
