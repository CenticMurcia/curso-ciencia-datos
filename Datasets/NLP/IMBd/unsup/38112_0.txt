The story is not original, not coherent and not enjoyable to watch. It's nothing more than lame idiots (how many no one really knows as the numbers inexplicably keep changing) running around trying to survive zombie attacks.<br /><br />The characters aren't very interesting in the first place --- just a bunch of dumb clich√©s. Even so, the acting is pathetic and these people should be embarrassed. It's more than just what they say, their actions and movements are all off and out of sync with nearly every scene.<br /><br />The DIALOGUE is deplorable. The last time I heard characters repeatedly speak in such a stilted manner was in those old Saturday morning cartoons from the 1970s.<br /><br />The writers really ruined this movie; if you don't start with a well written story there's no sense in even making a movie.
