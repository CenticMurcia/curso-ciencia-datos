Razzle dazzle is a very poor excuse for a trip to the cinema. in fact so lame even as a dance pic it tanked completely and struggled to find even a morning session in week three. The problem? well there is no movie; it is yet another 'mockumentary' a sort of hybrid Waiting For Guffman or A Mighty Wind and too late in the cycle of so-called funny fake documentaries. Also it insults the very audience it seeks to draw... kids in the suburban dance schools and their fanatical parents... this is the sort of misfire typical of many Australian so-called comedies: no market research, obvious characters and a compete waste of resources and expertise. The whole misguided Mr Jonathan's school of dance disasters is simply not funny and basically smacks of being created without any thought to how asinine it actually is. The ads and posters for RD clearly suggest a teenage Strictly Ballroom but there is no movie, just this wobblecam 'making-of' nonsense. With a strong cast completely wasted mocking stereotypes they hope will actually buy expensive $16.50 tickets each to see this in a Sydney cinema, Razzle dazzle misfires on every count. Only two things are of genuine interest: Kerry Armstrong's great body and the fantastic interior of the Crest Ballroom. The boring rest? NO.
