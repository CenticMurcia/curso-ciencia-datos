Louis B Mayer would be spinning in his grave. With a cast headed by Banderas and Angelina I was expecting ORIGINAL SIN to be an emotional drama displayed in the once powerful MGM style- it was a let down.<br /><br />The story had the potential to be dynamically projected but with an over abundance of soft pornography tended to lose its way.<br /><br />An interesting supporting character role was provided by by Jack Thompson.<br /><br />The print viewed tended to drift in and out of focus from scene to scene and the colour was a little muddy, although in some respects this heightened the atmosphere of the late 1800's.<br /><br />The musical score was excellent.<br /><br />The audience was predominantly in the 30 - 50 age group and generally expressed some disappointment and considered that the feature was a little on the long side.
