It was inevitable that we weren't going to like this Gaelicised take on the zombie movie. You just can't take Irish people being pursued by the living dead seriously.<br /><br />There's some pretty poor acting in here and the whole situation pushes suspension of disbelief a little too far.<br /><br />There are a couple of good moments, but anyone could throw a couple of decent jolts into such a genre film Â— it lends itself to them...<br /><br />I can't understand how anyone can bugger up such a simple format. They're zombies, the script writes itself... Alas, there was no respect here. No understanding of what to do with them.<br /><br />Poo.
