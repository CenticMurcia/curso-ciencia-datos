First off, this is NOT as good as the movie "Beautiful Thing"--the other British film about gay teens. But it still works wonderfully on its own terms.<br /><br />The movie is well-acted by the whole cast and the story is realistic (unfortunately) and true to life. Some people have complained that the interactions between the two boys keep running hot and cold way too often. Well welcome to real life! I know of similar situations with friends and this movie captured them perfectly. Also the isolation and longing of the gay boy was so accurate. There's a sequence at a dance when the two boys are staring longingly at each other while dancing with two women they couldn't care less about. That scene brought tears to my eyes! Also when the gay teen tells off the guy he's in love with and the closing scene (don't want to give it away) were also extremely powerful and honest. The film also ends realistically BUT not depressingly. Also, the film IS funny. It's not a comedy, but it does have its light moments. See it! It's well worth 8 or 9 bucks.<br /><br />
