"The Fury" has gotten better with age and can now be viewed as one of DePalma's most satisfying thrillers. It consists of two stories which eventually overlap. The first story deals with a former government agent (Kirk Douglas) who searches for his son, who has been kidnapped by the feds who want to exploit his telekinetic powers. The second story revolves around a teenaged girl (Amy Irving) who discovers that she too has paranormal powers. Eventually, Douglas enlists her aid in finding his son. The film includes some unexpected humor and several breathtaking sequences, to include a stunning shot where Irving's character is surrounded by past images of Douglas' son (you gotta see it to believe it). The denouement is contrived, but effective and has been ripped by other films.
