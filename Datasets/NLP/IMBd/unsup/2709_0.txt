This mini series, which is based on the brilliant novel of Bulgakov, is NOTHING like the plot summery! The summery is just a disgrace for the plot! Woland (Satan) and his entourage are not shown as evil beings whose main purpose is to come between the Artists and Margaritas love. On the contrary, their main goal is to put some sense into corrupted human minds. In any case, the book himself is a wonderful book which gives you something to think about. And the series presents the book with wonderful actors and a plot which is one-in-one to the book (except, of course, for the little things that are not according to the book. But what can you do? No movie is exactly what the book says). I give it 10! 10 for the book, and 10 for the series!
