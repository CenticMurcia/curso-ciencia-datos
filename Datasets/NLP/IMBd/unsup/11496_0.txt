I too remember this show from a very young age. I wasn't even five years old when it premiered on ABC, yet I can vividly recall the theme song. They actually showed reruns of it back when I was in grammar school, and I never forgot it. Well,according to Amazon.com, "Tenspeed and Brownshoe: The Complete Series" will be released on DVD in March of this year! I'm ordering my copy ahead of the release date so I suggest you guys check it out. At the price they're offering I doubt there'll be any extras but that's fine with me. It's true that the chemistry between Jeff Goldblum and Ben Vereen was easy and natural. Because the actors liked each other, their character's friendship seemed genuine. They were so mismatched and from totally different backgrounds, and yet they worked so well together. I was such a sucker for private eye novels and TV shows, and I loved how Stephen J. Cannell played with that genre's conventions on this show in particular. Neither of them had law- enforcement backgrounds; one of them had been on the wrong side of the law most of his life and the other one was as straight-laced as could be. Yet they were legitimate private eyes, combining their unique talents to solve the mystery while making us smile along the way. I loved how they went back and forth with each other; nowadays, this type of banter is par for the course, but in 1980 it was so ahead of it's time. Anyway, just wanted to let my fellow fans know the news.Thanks!
