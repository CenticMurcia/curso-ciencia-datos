This is OK movie to watch. Exactly copy of Hollywood movie "Derailed" .. for god sake these directors needs to stop doing plagiarism. Now about movie, nothing great about it or the performance of the character. The girl Geeta (Ms Kapoor) is hot and beautiful and thats only the reason make me keep watching this movie. If you guys have seen derailed then in initial part of the movie only you will realize that its another copy of movie. Anyway overall I'll rate this movie 2/10 as it has some pretty looking girl. Songs of the movie is OK too.. I would say its another concept they are trying to follow like they did with movie Murder.
