Due to the recent Full Moon Feature "Killer Bong", I was incredibly apprehensive to see this latest drug-themed horror yarn. Thankfully, "Shrooms" isn't a dopey comedy, written to appeal to the minds of adolescent boys... Unfortunately, it is a painfully boring movie, despite that, seemingly, winning endorsement. A group of teenage friends venture into rural Ireland during mushroom season with plans no more extensive than "tripping out". One of the girls unknowingly eats one of the 'wrong' kind of mushrooms and experiences uncontrollable premonitions of her friends' deaths. Honestly, who funded an Ireland vacation for a group of stereotypical losers, who head right from the airport to the bleak woods, with no food other than the fungi they intended on?? The whole basic premise seemed utterly forced into a tired formula of young, drug taking campers. This, inevitably, leads to the incorporation of a spooky ghost story (which ends up supplying a source for the hooded killer), which was pointless in the long run, but I guess the crew had access to a big, creepy building they wanted to show... Also, the involvement of the two inbreeders seemed like gratuitous filler. Numerous scenes in this dragged on effortlessly while the end was a complete ripoff of "Identity" and "High Tension". To sum it all up - I pretty much hated this movie!
