Oh dear.In a desperate attempt to keep up with the Paul Raymond/Fiona Richmond era of tacky English semi - porn,the "Carry On" production team came up with this absolute stinker.They even had the gall to use the same location as the immortal "Carry on Camping" as if they were hoping that some of the magic might brush off onto the dandruff - ridden crumpled shoulders of this dirty mac of a movie.Well,I promise you it didn't.With "Carry on Behind",the comedy lights went out all over Pinewood. It has none of the innocent,cheery, Music Hall quality of the earlier movies,here we see unpleasant sneering jokes that demean women.Even a performer like Mr Kenneth Williams - a master at transforming poor material - can do nothing with this trash.He looks tired and dispirited. When he fell into a cesspit he probably felt a deep sense of relief. Two of the cast of the current TV hit "It ain't half hot mum!" make an appearance but were clearly uncomfortable with a script that makes the Croft/Perry series seem like the work of Noel Coward.In particular Mr Windsor Davies - a very funny man - is wasted in the role of a randy butcher off for a weekend's leering with the near - catatonic Mr Jack Douglas. Mr Bresslaw and Miss Sims both seem vaguely embarrassed.Mr Connor is very bad as a retired army officer. As dear Oscar once said,"There is nothing so old - fashioned as being absolutely up - to - date".With its flowery shirts,flares,silly hair,crap colour and pointy collars,"Carry on behind" was on the button archetypal mid 70s - there was even an Austin Maxi.But,more than nearly any other "Carry on",it has aged badly.Like Don Revie's Leeds Utd and the Bay City Rollers it is best forgotten.
