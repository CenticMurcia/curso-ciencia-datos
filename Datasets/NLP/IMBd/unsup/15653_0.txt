This has to be the comedy of the year. What a comeback for Todd Bridges. Excellent writing and acting. This thing had me laughing my ass off all day. I saw it three times in a row. The funniest character is barney bumble, a old school pimp from Oaktown. Basically Todd Bridges and his buddies are all out of the green stuff. They go all over town trying to score. one thing leads to another and Todd's character "JIMMY" is arrested and thrown in the slammer. His buddies spend the rest of the movies going to various characters and go through various obstacles until they finally score. From a whitey hating white pimp, weed dealer. This fool has an umbrella in every scene. He speaks like he's from the ghetto-est ghetto. HILARIOUS!!!!!!Great rent, better buy. Thanks, and please make another one.
