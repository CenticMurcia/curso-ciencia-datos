I saw this on television recently. I remember when I saw it first in the early nineties that it got bad reviews at the time. I think the critics just had it in for Polanski. 'Frantic' was dismissed as a poor man's Hitchcock, though I thought it was a pretty good stab at doing a Hitchcock, suspenseful enough.<br /><br />A devastating chronicle of the disintegration of a relationship. Though the role reversal development was done better in Bunuel's Tristana, I thought.<br /><br />I was struck at the time by Hugh Grant's hilarious portrayal of the twit of an Englishman. This was an act that soon palled over the decade, however.
