Just saw it. Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but never in my life have I felt such hatred for a movie character. I thought Bad Santa looked like Mother Teresa next to this guy. I wouldn't call it great acting on Thornton's part, (he's totally "wooden", no pun intended), he just seems good at being a dick. I literally wanted to bury a claw hammer into this guy's skull, and I'm not a violent person! I kept BEGGING for Stifler to kick his ass. But he was such a puss that I started to hate him, too. Susan Sarandon is still hot, I don't know why she's in this loser. 'Laughed 2 times: when Stifler's buddy got caught on video talking about Sarandon's boobs, and then when that piece of crap Woodcock ate the asphalt. HAHAHA!!! Really hated the end, trying to be all feel good. I wanted to end in Woodcock's death. I know, it's just a movie. The best thing I can say is that it DID get a reaction out of me, I was not apathetic about it.
