Its the best action T.V show in the history, I like the characters Jack Bauer(Kiefer Sutherland) and Tony(Carlos Bernard) they was a nice N-team, and sure the President. David Palmer(Dennis Haysbert) he is really a great actor and can be the president in the real life ;), oh i forget about Kim Bauer(Elisha Cuthbert)she is nice and sexy ;). The best Season I like is season 4 and 5 was the best seasons. Now I am waiting the next season I think now jack must have some peace in his life. Last thing i like to talk about is the music of the Show its very nice and so cool. In the end i wish the best for this T.V show and more success. Thanks ;)
