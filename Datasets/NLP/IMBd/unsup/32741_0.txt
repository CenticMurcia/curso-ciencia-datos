No redeeming value. A cheap piece of trash that bears the same resemblance to the books by LeGuin as a Ford Pinto does to a pinto stallion. Everyone involved in this production should be ashamed.<br /><br />The producers were clearly looking for a way to rip off Harry Potter and/or the Lord of the Rings when they stumbled upon this venerable series of fantasy books. Obviously they were just looking for a "brand name" to slap onto their uninspired swords-and-sorcery tale. To get the Earthsea stories to fit this mold, they have stripped out everything original, worthwhile and challenging about the original books. It's not even clear the screenwriters read the original books, they appear to have written down the character names and geographical features and started from there.
