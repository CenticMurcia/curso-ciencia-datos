Most comments here are biased probably by the fact that his main character is Lindsay Lohan I see a lot of bashing , and i've seen worst movies, so this is not a bad one, if you skip certain details.<br /><br />The overall script i think is very original, could be better of course, but it kept me on my sit the whole time.<br /><br />The BAD: This movie could be better, but the cast was awful. Most actors can't act, and Lindsay who did a nice role, didn't warm me as stripper either.<br /><br />Some details were too stupid, like the " time to make a phone call", or the peaceful way in which Dakota seems to take his situation <br /><br />The Good: The overall history, the photography, the way they portrait colors and his significance, the ending was nice also.<br /><br />I think the identity of the "bad" guy, is well chosen. I think people is mostly wrong in take the critics on that direction.<br /><br />Is a worthy movie, entertaining, strong scenes, but is intended to see it to enjoy it, not in critic plan , because that way is easily to stick on his flaws instead of have an entertainment moment with it.
