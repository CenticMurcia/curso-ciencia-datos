Instantly forgettable and pretty bad color "rock n roll" film that's deadly dull. It's got all the clich√©s, like the older generation who doesn't "get it", and young people dancing and strutting their stuff in revealing outfits. <br /><br />The female eye candy, in the form of pretty Mary Ann Mobley and her other girlfriends, are about all there is to watch in this deadly dull timepiece. Some of my favorite '60s groups, like The Animals and The Dave Clark Five, get to perform a few numbers on stage, but their material is just as underwhelming.<br /><br />*/****
