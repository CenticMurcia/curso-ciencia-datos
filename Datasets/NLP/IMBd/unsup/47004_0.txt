Apparently this film was vaguely based on a short Stephen King novel, and I did see an image from the film in a book about special effects, I think it was the leading James Bond actor that attracted me. Basically (possibly in a near future) Dr. Lawrence Angelo (Pierce Brosnan) works for Virtual Space Industries trying to make chimpanzees more intelligent using drugs, and virtual reality, but one of them escapes and he is forced out pretty much. He didn't get the chance to prove or perfect it to work on humans, but he believes he can turn his simple minded gardener, aka "the lawnmower man" of the title, Jobe Smith (Jeff Fahey) into a more intelligent being. Jobe agreed to it, and slowly he shows good improvement in intelligence, but of course it turns into a Frankenstein theme when he develops the ability to move objects, his voice sounds more like a computer, and he has turned evil. In the end he is defeated by his creator in the virtual world. Also starring Jenny Wright as Marnie Burke, Mark Bringleson as Sebastian Timms, Geoffrey Lewis as Terry McKeen, Jeremy Slate as Father Francis McKeen, Dean Norris as The Director, Colleen Coffey as Caroline Angelo, Jim Landis as Ed Walts, Troy Evans as Lieutenant Goodwin and Rosalee Mayeux as Carla Parkette. The special effects for 1992 I suppose are quite good, but I almost lost track of what is going on a couple of times, so not one I'd bother with again. Okay!
