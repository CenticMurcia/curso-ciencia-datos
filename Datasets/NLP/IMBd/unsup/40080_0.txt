I am not sure quite how this film claims to be based on Faulkes's novel Charlotte Gray. The story vaguely follows a similar chain of events, but much of the emotion in the book, is lost in the film. The producers/screenplay writers have added small details which do not aid the story, but just take it further and further away from the original story. <br /><br />I also think a Scottish person should have played Charlotte - I did not find the accent of Cate Blanchett at all convincing. <br /><br />In all, the film is not too bad to watch, but compared to the book it is a dead loss and a waste of time.
