Osama is the first movie made after the fall of the Taliban last year. It shows the story of a young girl who is forced to disguise herself as a boy so that she can work and feed her hungry mother and grandmother. Winner a Golden Globe for foreign language film is about 80 minutes long.<br /><br />I have got to say that this film will really give a massive shock to the viewers with some of the scenes. The severity of some of the actions and policies of the Taliban were really extreme and it sometimes is hard to understand how people could do this to other people.<br /><br />One of the first scenes you see in the film is that of a rally of women all asking for jobs so that they could feed their families. It is a breathtaking and powerful scene as you see hundreds of women all clad in their blue burkas. This I felt was one of the ways the director was able to portray the harshness of the rule of the Taliban in Afghanistan. You could see the peoples hardship and longing for a better life.<br /><br />I was rather pleasantly surprised to hear that all of the actors in the film are all locals of Afghanistan and do not have any experience in acting. They all did great jobs in putting across the material especially Marina Golbahari, the lead actress. I guess it was easy translating real life experiences to the scenes in a film. <br /><br />The director also did quite a laudable job of making a rather bleak atmosphere throughout the film. A lot of the scenes had dark lighting and not a single second of musical score throughout the film added to the overall dark atmosphere of the film. He also did a good job in making the Taliban a menacing force, which you would learn to hate.<br /><br />A good film overall and it was really effective in putting the message across even if the movie was just 80 minutes long. 80 minutes of powerful filmaking and its simplicity is the main reason that this film is a good one.
