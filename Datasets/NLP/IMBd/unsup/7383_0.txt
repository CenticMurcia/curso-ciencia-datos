The Flyboys caught my eye because of all the raving reviews it got on the IMDb. This seemed too good to be true. A totally unknown brilliant movie that Hollywood forgot? A story about kids? But wow, what an incredible fun film this is... for both adults and children!<br /><br />What really works in this movie are all the moments in which the movie leaves the normal clich√© story lines in order to do something refreshing. The first ten minutes, when we see how Jason and Kyle become friends, set the tone really. The new kid in town Kyle saves Jason from a bunch of bullies in a very believable but also funny and exciting way. These are real kids who'll have an adventure that will blow everybody away.<br /><br />All the performances are great. Not only the kid's. I very much liked Tom Sizemore. He's totally believable as the hard boiled criminal Angelo who is touched by the friendship between the two boys. There's a great scene in which Jason and Kyle play with toy guns in a luxurious playroom, not knowing that Angelo is watching. His observation reminds Angelo of all the good times he had with his kid brother (an also great Stephen Baldwin) - not knowing that Baldwin has betrayed him for money. J. Todd Adams - an actor I didn't know - does a very good job as the loser Lenny. His - let's say - character development is the key thing to the story. <br /><br />After an hour of watching you wonder when the movie will collapse. But fortunately it remains surprising and entertaining. At the end there's even an unexpected great stunt. It came as a total surprise to me. Great camera-work as well.<br /><br />In the land of big budgets, big computer effects and big disappointments The Flyboys is a big relief. This movie is by all standards very great entertainment. I'm looking forward to see more films by its director, Rocco DeVilliers!<br /><br />8/10
