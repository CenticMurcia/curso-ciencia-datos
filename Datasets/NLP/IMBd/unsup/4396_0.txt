This movie screened at the 5th Melbourne Underground Film Fest and I gotta admit! I got sucked in by the title! But the movie held up as well. Entertaining, engaging characters and convincing cast. Sexy women too!Sometimes all the crazy antics were hard to keep track of and sometimes the camera was a little too hand held,..but the film held together through its sheer energy. The film has that much visual color it is almost overwhelming, the camera never stops moving and the characters never stop scheming. My prediction is keep an eye out for this director."Bitch" is pulsing with ambition and confidence. This director is going to pull off something even bigger in the future..
