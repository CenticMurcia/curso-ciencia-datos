I absolutely adore this movie. You might be afraid that an attempt at a film would wreck the masterpiece that was the book, but it interprets it beautifully. Almost all of the actors work extremely well for how the characters were portrayed in the book. The acting is quite good. The costumes, scenery/setting, and music are all amazing. The story itself, of course, is beautiful-- and addresses the topics of romance and social customs of its time. I lovvvvve Mr Darcy :sigh: and Mr and Mrs Bennett are highly amusing. Lydia is an idiot and you have to pity poor pathetic Mary. The movie is rather long, but it is worth watching it all-- take it bit by bit! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. I'll watch it again and again.
