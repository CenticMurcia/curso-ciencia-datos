A very unintelligent comedy about a very unintelligent detective from director Paul Flaherty, "Harry Crumb" is a ridiculous, stupid comedy. The film borders on slapstick, parody and send-up, and is often very akin to "The Naked Gun". John Candy couldn't even save this film as the humour isn't even accidentally funny. Other stars including Jeffrey Jones, Annie Potts, Barry Corbin and Shawnee Smith are not able to help either.<br /><br />The plot from Robert Conte and Peter Martin Wortmann(derivative of "Ruthless People") is pathetic, as in fact is most of the movie. Don't waste your time.<br /><br />Wednesday, December 30, 1992 - Video
