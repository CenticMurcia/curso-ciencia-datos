This film was published in Germany on DVD, now playing the full 87 minutes including audio comment by Jean Rollin. You can buy it relatively cheap at Video/DVD markets (5-10 Euro). It is worth seeing if you have a taste for atmosphere. Yet it is not as surrealistic as other Rollin films. As mentioned in other comments before, the Italian actress playing Helene is absolutely marvellous. Though scene footage and atmosphere range from nice to elegant and dreamlike, Rollin should have spent more attention to the unnerving dialogues. The German synchronization/translation s... big time. At first glance, I had inspected more, but if you focus on the beautiful images, this is a fair deal. BTW, there is an extended gore scene at the end which makes you feel like Rollin is going slightly over the top, overplaying. Though the end (which results from a twist in the storyline) seemed quite odd and ordinary to me after I finished watching, it is different now. Re-thinking the whole story, it adds a nice perspective to the usual image of the vampire ... a new shade, a new breed beyond tradition and clich√©e.<br /><br />7 out of 10 (due to the weak dialogues)
