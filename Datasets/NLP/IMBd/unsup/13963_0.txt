So, so bad. I'll be honest, I didn't watch the whole movie; I simply couldn't put myself through the whole thing. It was that bad. <br /><br />The acting is horrendous. The dialogue is simple minded. The effects are definitely not of a 2009 film, even a low budget one. <br /><br />The attempt at humor was insultingly bad. There was one scene where a brute bog monster made fur slippers out of 2 dogs. Why the dogs were tied up in the middle of the road is beyond my comprehension. Why a mindless monster cares about footwear is another puzzle to the logical mind. <br /><br />Take my advice and do not watch this movie; you will only hate yourself if you do.
