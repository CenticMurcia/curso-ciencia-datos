I must declare my admiration for Hogan before teeing off with this review. One of the greats of the fairway, an inspiration, a role model. As played by Glen Ford, however, terribly lacking in character. How the filmmakers managed to make Hogan so uninteresting is a testament to their overly precious approach to the material. The film plays very episodically and didn't hold my attention. I got up to crack two beers open while it was playing and didn't fee the need to pause the disk. Not a bad film, but just not very engaging. Not Ford's fault, really, but blame can be placed at the feet of the writer. The wife complained that there was too much driving. car driving. Not fairway driving.
