Italian-American ethnic humor, and similar mafia-based spoofs are pretty passe by now, wouldn't you think? Even so, a clever, interesting, and especially a FUNNY movie is always watchable, even if not a hit. This could have been an "OK" flick. This movie, however, is a dreadful, horrible, depressing pile of junk. It is mean spirited, ugly, and worse than a waste of film-- it is a bummer and a downer. The only surprise here is how a group of talented and likeable movie stars such as Burt Reynolds, Dan Hedaya, and Richard Dreyfus, to name the ones I remember, got themselves hooked into doing this. Did they owe someone in Hollywood a lot of money, and this was the pay-back? Did they lose a bet? What? I had to walk out of the theater after half an hour it was so bad.<br /><br />Avoid this movie at all costs. I gave this a 1 out of 10. If we could give negative numbers, this trash would have gotten a minus three.
