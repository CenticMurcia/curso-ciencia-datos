Yes, cheated, especially when i reached the IInd half and realised all the gags were copied from 'Rat Race'(2001) with slight changes to cater to the desi crowd. Sanjay Dutt doing the bus driver routine (aka Cuba Gooding Jr.), Ashish Choudhary & Asrani in the plane (aka Amy Smart and Breckin Meyer in the chopper) and the final showdown where the large crowd gapes at them, the hot air balloon and even the digital display of the total donation amount!! I have stopped expecting originality after the 'jaane bhi do yaaro' days and am being probably a bit too harsh in saying that but I cannot help it as the Hollywood movie scripts copied shamelessly over (well the ones that can be, that is) are usually the movies that i have already seen. Hence, since last month, i have taken a break and have started watching Korean movies instead..that is till they run out of Hollywood scripts to photocopy. That said, a few gags in Dhamaal (choohon ka race?) does manage to bring a smile on your face and the effort deserves a 7. Watchable with friends who don't mind slapstick, goofy and over the top comedy capers.
