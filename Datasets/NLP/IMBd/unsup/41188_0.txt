The first 15 minutes were good, but the usually low budget, too much dioluge, and sappy made for TV quality. I watched 2 showa and the ending I could not stand the boredom this film produces. Who would have gussed in 87 that the Cold War would be over in 2 years. I guess when they open a Mc Donalds in Moscow the signs where there! 3/10
