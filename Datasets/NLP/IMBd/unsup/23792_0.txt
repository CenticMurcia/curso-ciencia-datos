Most people had already seen this film by the time it was awarded one of the 7 scariest horror films of 2008, but if not you most likely saw this movie genius on the Syfy channel which has been a gold standard for horror films for the past decade.<br /><br />Lake dead is not your average teenagers go on a road trip, messed up incest family tries to murder and rape them, American success story. In fact Lake dead has many plot twists that will leave you wanting more grandma-son heated make out scenes. <br /><br />One thing I did not like about the movie was the underling promotion of the Gieco caveman throughout this gripping horror film. From the RV breaking down to the raping of innocent teenage girls, Gieco clearly wanted another way to promote their insurance company.<br /><br />Lake Dead might not save you 15% on your car insurance but is worthy of a Syfy prime time showing.
