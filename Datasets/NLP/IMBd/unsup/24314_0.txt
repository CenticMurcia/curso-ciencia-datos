This show is the epitome of what I avoid by watching adult swim original shows rather than more mainstream comedy; predictable pop culture laden crap. The skits often follow a dull formula, a parody of some TV show movie or toy with some kind of violent sexual or poop related joke carelessly thrown in, that plays out like a claymation family guy joke. The bits are generally a a poorly executed carbon copy of the source material, but with the aforementioned stupidly obvious joke thrown in. And when the creators are brave enough to stop suckling on pop cultures nurturing teat for a few seconds, we often are left a 5 (or less) second clip of something so creatively dull and brain dead the only plausible reaction is that of total silence. I say often because there are sparse moments of amusement, but these are too rare to make the show worth watching. The show is and exercise in poor writing and voice acting, and mediocre animation. The visual style of the show is unique, but not really smooth in any sense of the word, often seeming crude and rough. I do like claymation when its done right, and there's none of that here. What irks me above all is the show's immense popularity and the fact that it is constantly on adult swim's weekday lineup while worthy, innovative, dynamic and unique shows are forced aside. Are people really that dumb that they can only appreciate the most dull and obvious humor? Well that's to be expected, looking at the awful Family Guy's popularity.
