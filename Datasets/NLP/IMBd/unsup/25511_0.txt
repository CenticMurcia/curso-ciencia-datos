Why, when mentions are made of productions of 'Jane Eyre', is this production never mentioned? I saw it when I was 11 years old, and fell desperately in love with Rochester (Michael Jayston). I then read the novel, my first ever classic novel. One thing led to another, and ten years later there I was with a degree in English literature. This production sparked an interest that never died. For years I have been hoping it would be released on video, and now at last I am the proud owner of a DVD copy. Yes, it has dated, the production values are those of the 1970's. But the performances are compelling, luring the viewer into the world of passion and suppression. The script is very faithful to the novel, the most faithful I have seen, with plenty of time for the childhood scenes so necessary to explain the adult Jane, and the relationship with St John Rivers fully explored. I was always amazed that Sorcha Cusack (Jane) seemed to disappear from the screen for many years, she is very talented and makes a sympathetic Jane. As for Michael Jayston, words fail me... I am still in love with him!!!
