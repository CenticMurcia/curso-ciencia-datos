I've seen a lot of bad "war" movies over the years, but this one takes the cake. I was surprised at how awful this movie ended up being with such a star-studded cast. Sam Jackson, Jessica Beil, Christina Ricci, what happened? Hands down, this movie contained the worst character acting I have ever scene. It was like watching an "80's" after school special. Only instead of teen pregnancy or drugs, it was about the Iraq war. Thankfully there was no political horn-blowing in the movie, but then again, there wasn't any plot either. Whoever wrote this film really missed the mark on reality. Next time, get a real military veteran to review the storyline before releasing such a piece of crap.
