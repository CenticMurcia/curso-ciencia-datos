This type of criminal(or gang-star)films have been made from 1920s, at first,probably in America, then everywhere in the world. There are some classics(as "God Father"),excellent postmodern variations(as "Pulp fiction")and also good Russian films in this genre("Assa" and "Brother").<br /><br />Egor Konchalovsky added nothing new to this genre because of inconsistency of style and lack of orientation in dramaturgy.<br /><br />As for style,plenty of video-effects simply make the film like serial of music clips with no serious contents, or some kind of parody of gangster films.If one wants to show drama,tell some story,then he must select only minimum needed effects which will not irritate viewers.The first half of the film is especially bad,the second half is better(less effects), but even this fact is only an another evidence of inconsistency. <br /><br />Then dramaturgy itself is inconsistent. I can't understand who represents what kind of world views or who has what kind of credo, and the meanings of all killing and shooting,including the revenge of Lis. Story is told, but it doesn't make me feel or think something. This same story could be told in another way, so that the viewers will begin to think something,to feel compassion for some character even they have little in common with him. Apparently director didn't care about it.
