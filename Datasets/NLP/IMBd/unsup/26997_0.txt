Thusday 18 May 2006 was the launch show for yet another series of Big BRother in the UK. This show is the most popular Channel 4 show over the summer. Inexplicably. The only time I see nay of it is at 2 am when I look for a few minutes in disbelief that everyone is asleep and they insist on continuing to televise nothing happening. THe only time it becomes interesting is whenever they substitute bird song for speech as the producers feel the inmates re saying something libellous. This occurred endlessly during the Michael Jackson trial. It arouses our curiosity as to what is being said. Otherwise just enjoy the birdsong instead of the inmates inane wittering. What started as a serious psychological study in the 1970s has been reduced to a bunch of unknowns stuck on TV for 10 weeks doing nothing and thinking they have a career. The launch show ridiculously hypes the next 10 weeks with a hyperventilating Davina Mccall shouting to compensate for lack of presenting ability.
