If we give up the realism on the movie, this title shines. Three North Korean soldiers and two South Korean soldiers join the care-free villagers whose life is totally out of concern about the war and politics. The message of this movie, in my opinion, seems to be the recovery of humanity via companionship based on the naturalism.<br /><br />Some scenes are very brilliant and mesmerizing in the middle of the cruelty of war. However, what lacks in this meticulously carved anti-war flick is the actualities of war, and the director purposefully neglected it in sole order to provide the third opinion on the war- companionship between enemies against the dichotomy of winner/sinner and/or victory/defeat.<br /><br />But why on earth should we seek for the companionship that is hard to imagine between enemies during the war? The movie adumbrate a cynic message that the Korean War is not declared by Korean folks, but by any other external races, represented by UN troops in the movie. Too naive perspective on the "enemy turns friend" issue spoils its own value as a report on the actualities of the Korean War, and it is really hard to dispute that the image of war and peace in this movie is totally based on the populism toward the North Korea which gains currency in South Korea now.
