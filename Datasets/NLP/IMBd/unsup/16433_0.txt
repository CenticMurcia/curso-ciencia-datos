When Home Box Office was in it's early days movies like this one & Outlaw Blues were among the films used to try to draw viewers. The main draw to this one was to see Linda Carter (Wonder Woman) out of that curve hugging outfit with her chest free to grace the screen. She certainly does that here.<br /><br />This is one of the films on HBO then which made me think that the "B" Hollywood films were alive & well in the 1970's. It was amazing how successful they were promoting this one. This film wets the whistle for seeing Ms. Carter do an X rated feature though I don't think she ever did one.<br /><br />Put your brain away and enjoy the natural assets on display here, don't take the plot too seriously of you will lose your perspective.
