I haven't seen a whole lot of this show, but I've seen enough to know it never should have been aired. Fox seemed to be trying to get a quick buck from a less-than-mediocre excuse for television. After the success of That 70s Show, Fox should have had the sense to realize it wouldn't work to do it for every single decade. It tried to copy That 70s Show, but didn't have the heart or the character. It's no wonder it only lasted half a season. They tried, but it was a miserable, miserable failure. I love That 70s Show, but this doesn't even come close to living up to half of it's predecessor. The idiot who came up with this should be completely ashamed. DON'T WATCH.
