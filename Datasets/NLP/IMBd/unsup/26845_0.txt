This is an excellent film with high production values and the two leading actors are superb. Don't be put off by the subtitles, a lot of it is in English with Michael Kitchen doing all his own speaking in English, so no captions for these scenes. I knew nothing about this political killing, but was gripped from start to finish. It's also one of those films that benefits from being watched more than once. Mikael Piersbrandt is terrific as the policeman who believes he knows what's going on, but can't make his superiors listen, while Michael Kitchen as the hired British hitman, provides a splendid contrast as he sets about his task in a cool, professional and frighteningly unemotional way. I was hooked right up to the last moment, and had to keep reminding myself that this wasn't necessarily what really happened. However, it's a very believable hypothesis, and gripping entertainment. Don't miss it, a real little gem!
