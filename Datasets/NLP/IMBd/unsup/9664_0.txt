This movie is beyond bad, I thought it could be a decent enough comedy with some hot latina-chicks.<br /><br />The latter there were plenty of, but the style of this movie is extremely childish so there aren't any sexiness going on, I mean just look at the rating: Rated PG for MILD sensuality.<br /><br />The story is as if taken from a Spanish-SOAP-OPERA and the acting is as over-the-top as that as well, I found SOFIA VERGARA funny in SOUL PLANE and ROSELYN SANCHEZ is good in WITHOUT A TRACE but they were as bad as the rest of the bunch in this "comedy".<br /><br />Comedy: Yes, but where are the jokes? Were there any? And did this movie even make me chuckle even once? No.<br /><br />Not even cameo's from talents DL HUGHLEY (Stand-Up-Comedian) and FREDDY RODRIGUEZ (Harsh Times) could make me enjoy this movie, it just made me think how on earth they got into this horrible movie.<br /><br />One thing that's even more confusing is the fact that FOREST WHITAKER is listed as a producer, to me he's one of Hollywood's finest and hopefully his producer-spot just meant that he financed the movie and wasn't actually a part of making this movie because that would have been a shame.<br /><br />I'm bagging on a lot of people here, but the biggest bag should be on the lead guy Thomas (played by Eduardo Ver√°stegui) whom delivers some of the worst acting I have ever seen in recent years, he is beyond bad in a way I can't even describe.<br /><br />There's one good thing about it though, without the start and end-credits the movie is only about 70 minutes long.<br /><br />If you want a romantic-comedy with latino-actors there is always SUENO (John Leguizamo, Elisabeth Pena) which I quite like.
