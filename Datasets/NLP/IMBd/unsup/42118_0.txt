It is seldom that I see a movie I really hate. The first movie version of The Lathe of Heaven was awesome, made for a pittance, and captured the ethereal nature of LeGuin's most enigmatic novel. This movie was just terrible. It was slow, didn't include anything even remotely like the novel, and completely left out the cool aliens from Aldebaran! The jellyfish motif was the only thing analogous. Also, is it too much to ask that in a movie about dreams that change reality, we might see the dreams themselves? This was one of the most effective concepts in the original version.<br /><br />James Caan delivered the most wooden and disconnected performance of his career, and Lukas Haas was a big lump. I like Lisa Bonet, her talent was completely wasted.<br /><br />TO GO IS TO RETURN! But to watch this farce is excruciating and an utter waste of time. Rent 'The Bride of Chucky' instead.
