This is an odd um- comedy with Frederick March, Gary Cooper, and Miriam Hopkins. March and Cooper play artist friends, writer and painter respectively, who meet Hopkins at the same time and find her abrasiveness cute. I'm thinking this must have been pre-code, because the word "sex" is used quite a bit, and listen closely, and there is even a cute "flockin'" flaunting of the F word.<br /><br />Hopkins bossily dates both of them, plays them against each other, advances their careers and somehow, by the end, they decide they like it. This naive ménage a trios certainly could not have helped the rumors about Cooper's private life.Cooper and March really are good foils for each other, Cooper playing the more passionate, less polished painter, and March, the more refined and verbal. It works. Edward Everett Horton plays a boring advertising Exec who has been the mentor of Hopkins and who is also in love with her, in his way.<br /><br />The premise really is not funny, and while this may have had some shock value in its day, because Hopkins certainly played it brazen, it is very hard to find cute. Hopkins has a gorgeous wardrobe, and the figure to wear it, she looks fantastic if she just weren't such a sharp tack. Naturally, two years later she played Becky Sharp in 1935s VANITY FAIR, and she was perfectly cast for the hard edged heroine.<br /><br />I'm a fan of Cooper, March and Horton, but the only thing I liked about this one was Hopkin's wardrobe.
