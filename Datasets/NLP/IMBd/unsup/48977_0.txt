I just saw this movie, and I regret it badly. I hoped for a good nice comedy, that would make me laugh, and give me a nice feeling after watching it. <br /><br />With this movie I didn't get that. MOST of the jokes was to lame for my taste, and not very fun. As the movie progressed my final grade became lower and lower, almost ended up at 1, which is the lowest grade. The only good thing about the movie was the Knight Rider scene, only because of that, and some SMALL laughs it get's 2 stars instead of 1. Also I wanna point out that the acting in this movie is not very good. Some scenes I find vulgar, and very disturbing. Not fun at all, you kinda wait now here comes the joke, and then there just comes nothing.<br /><br />If you think about watching this movie, my advice to you is don't watch it.<br /><br />2/10 stars
