Count Alurcard (Lou Chaney Jr.) comes from Hungary arrives in the southern part of the U.S. in Lousiana. He seeks the blood of a woman named Katherine (Louise Allbritton) who is obsessed with the Gothic and supernatural, she falls under his spell to be in love with him but her fianc√©e Frank (Robert Paige) gets suspicious of what she's become and now must join with Dr. Brewster (Frank Craven) and Professor Lazio (J. Edward Bromberg) to stop this creature of the night and Katherine.<br /><br />So far an improvement over "Daughter of Dracula", this third installment of Universal's "Dracula" series is a very worthy successor to the 1931 masterpiece. This is the first vampire film to show a bat to vampiric man transformation and has good performances even though Lou Chaney Jr. isn't too bad as a vampire as much as he is as The Wolf Man, it's not as excellent as the first one but it's a great sequel.
