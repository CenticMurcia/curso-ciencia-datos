I've loved old movie ever since I was a kid. I was 13 when this played on TV. I expected the worst but tuned in. Actually it was pretty fun! Seeing some "name" actors enacting scenes from classic Hollywood films with amateurs was...bizarre (but fun). The ones that stand out were Loretta Swit in "Werewolf of London"; Don Rickles (doing Marlon Brando) in "On the Waterfront", Ed Asner in "Psycho"; Danny Thomas (doing Burt Lancaster) in "From Here to Eternity" and Darren McGavin (doing Humphrey Bogart) in "To Have and Have Not". The show wasn't exactly hilarious but just fascinating to watch. The only bad thing is that Don Adams wasn't given enough to do. A fun short-lived show from the 1970s.
