In my 39 years of movie viewing, only three times have I fallen asleep watching a movie.<br /><br />1) FOOLS RUSH IN, and that's because I'd had NO sleep the night before and shouldn't have been there in the first place. Not that the movie was that good.<br /><br />2) MOULIN ROUGE Sorry, it just hated this movie. Couldn't take one more song with the two of them singing badly to each other on a rooftop. Yuck! Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz<br /><br />3) FEARDOTCOM. I think I slept towards the end out of a sheer defense mechanism, to get away from the embarassment of it all. I felt bad for the performers, I guess. I won't go into all the various reasons, but for a movie supposedly set in the US, why did it so BLATANTLY look like it was filmed in Europe? Could it be that the exterior establishing shot for 1) police station 2) her apartment 3)a victim's apartment & 4) his apartment were all filmed on the same city block? Just from slightly different angles, but it was amusing when we first saw the exterior of the police station, and then later the cop is driving to the Natascha McElhone's apartment and WOW, it's the same building. The story ultimately makes no sense, really, and it's just yucky. I don't mind gore one bit, if handled well. I even stomached stuff like DAY OF THE DEAD back when it first came out and people were hurling in the aisles. But feardotcom was so distasteful, so indulgent in its love of the gore (mild though it was) that I mostly felt a little dirty for watching, kinda like I'd watch a snuff film. And no filmmaker should actually want you to feel that way, but the movie is so amateurishly made that you feel like you're watching home movies of these brutal acts. Sounds good and edgy, some might think. But if you like something resembling COHERENCE in your movies, guess again. It was momentarily amusing to see Jeffrey Combs (he of the unusual but entertaining performances in REANIMATOR and FROM BEYOND), but in the end, he was pretty darn bad. Natascha McElhone, whom I usually like, generated no heat whatsoever. And I can only believe that it was actually Geoffrey Rush's untrained twin brother who acted in this movie and not the real Geoffrey Rush himself.<br /><br />Never have I wanted my money back more. Do NOT, NOT , NOT see this film!!!
