Troll 2 is just an aMEZIN film.<br /><br />I love how the guy who plays the dad acts in this film, it's up there with De Niro in Raging Bull, he clearly thought this was his big break, and for me, it was. The Mother is just Genius. how she says "JOSHWA" and Not Joshua, that's putting your own personal stamp on a character right there. The boy, Joshua, is just brilliant, every scene he is in he steals, and i am certain that the trailers for "THERE WILL BE BLOOD" that say "CITIZEN KANE SURPASSED" were stolen from the trailer for this movie for Joshua's performance. (Although, clearly the guy who gets turned into a plant spent months getting his part perfect, i mean the delivery of the line "OH MY GOD, THEY'RE EATING HER, AND THEN THEY'RE GONNA EAT ME!" just shows that this guy has the ability to get such raw emotion through the screen and into your heart. the terror i experienced on his behalf makes the exorcist look like an episode of the muppets. <br /><br />however, the best part, and the element of the movie that still, 18years on remains unsurpassed for me, is the Goblin masks. i think that the Jim Henson workshop have been embarrassed by this little film, who, with an Italian director who can't speak English, and hardly any budget, have managed to make goblins that have defined what one should look like. specifically i mean the one that the sister turns into when they are in the car. clearly the muppets stole the idea of "BEAKER" from this goblin. <br /><br />Jim Henson needs to take a long look at himself as i believe he has been truly outdone here by master craftsmen.<br /><br />the icing on the cake is Grandpaw Seth, whose every line reduced me to tears. <br /><br />i scoff now at the Oscars, which seems to be all political.<br /><br />Lets look at who won the Best Picture award in 1990..."DRIVING MISS DAISY" Troll 2 not even nominated.<br /><br />Best Actor? Michael Stephenson for "JOSHWA"?? no. Daniel Day Lewis for "MY LEFT FOOT"<br /><br />Best Director? Claudio Fragasso?? No, Oliver Stone.<br /><br />Its all a conspiracy!! why was this film overlooked?
