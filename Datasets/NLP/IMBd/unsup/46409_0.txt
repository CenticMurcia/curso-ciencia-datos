Out on video at last! One of the original video nasties that were banned by Britain. It was finally released uncut in 2003. Obviously, the Brits don't like cannibal movies as they banned five of them.<br /><br />This film was really bad on so many levels.<br /><br />It seemed as if time and distance were totally disregarded. For example, Monsieur Danville (Olivier Mathot) left for three days and seemed to come back in 30 minutes. The jungle must have been in Southern Spain, as it took everyone so little time to get there.<br /><br />If you are looking for titillating scenes, there is only one: Pamela Stanford taking a bath. Other than that the rest focused mainly on the eating of people's guts. Yech! They really didn't need to ban this as it is too awful to watch.
