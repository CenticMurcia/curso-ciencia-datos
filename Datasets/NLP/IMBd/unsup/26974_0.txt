I really have a question about Michael Levin, He was a substantially great actor ... and I can't find anything much he did after Ryan's Hope.<br /><br />I would so be interested in what type profession he found a liking for after Ryan's Hope ???? Would anyone know anyway to be in touch with his agent or self or fan base person ????<br /><br />Thanks. There is just nothing like the older shows... the character structure is never as Good in the shows of today, as it WAS with RYAN's HOPE. I miss stories of the Regular people, the Above Common characters on this show. I was so sorry to see the original drama go off air.<br /><br />They were the First Show Ever (to my study) to do a GHOST story with Mary Fenelli (Kate Mulgrew) returning to give profound truths and messages to Jack ! I loved those scenes and Am Now WAITING for them to return to that time on the soap-net reruns.<br /><br />I Have A Complilation Tape of Most All of the Jack Fenelli scenes ... <br /><br />Thanks to anyone who can offer information about Michael Levin.
