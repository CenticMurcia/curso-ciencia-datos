I have never left the cinema before the end of a movie, until now. How anyone can last through 3 hours of this film, is a true measure of how much the human body can endure. I for one (and an unprecedented number of others) couldn't take it.<br /><br />For a movie billed as a sensual & erotic journey of sexual awakening, this movie serves up a very long series of nature shots, badly & roughly chopped together with the worst sex scenes ever. The was more chemistry between Tom & Jerry that these two. The only thing that keeps your attention is the knowledge that something has to happen between these to characters soon. When it eventually does (after what seems like an eternity), you only see the first 5 seconds of the sexual encounter then you fade out to the aftermath. You only keep watching because you think that surely there has to be more? It can be this bad? But is it, more never comes. When some interesting events do happen, they are only told by the narrator (in subtitles because this movie is in French if you didn't already know).<br /><br />I don't know how this film ended and the worst thing is that I really don't care.
