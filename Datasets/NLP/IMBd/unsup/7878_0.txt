I relaxed in front of the TV tonight, and started to watch "The Other Me", The idea of having an identical duplicate of the main character, that they only know about has been around since Disney first made "The Parent Trap". Since then the formulae has been used so many times I have lost count, and few have been any good. For once though it works, this film is fun, amusing, well acted, and well worth watching.<br /><br />The crooks as always in Disney films are inept, but I would imagine are used that way as to not frighten the younger audience. The lead role, played by Andrew Lawrence shows he has real talent from the way he portrays the two different characters. There is no doubt that he makes the film work, and the supporting cast, do an amicable job. Well worth seeing if you get the chance especially as a family.
