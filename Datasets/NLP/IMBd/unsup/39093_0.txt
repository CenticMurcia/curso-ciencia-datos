I watched this movie , and i found it horrible. The only thing that made me continue watching the movie , was the acting of Russel Crowe The actress has a very good potential , but , the way the movie is written ruined it completely The bad guy is a terrible actor. This could be a great movie , if better made , but it was horrible in my opinion. This movie , is one of the worst I've ever seen. I don't recommend it to anyone.IF you are going to watch this movie to see if you have some "good movie time" , you better think twice , only if you're just having a good afternoon with your friends , if you are thinking of watching it alone i don't recommend , you will have no fun at all watching this movie (only if you pretend to make fun of it)
