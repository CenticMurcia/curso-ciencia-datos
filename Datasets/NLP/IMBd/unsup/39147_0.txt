Actually this movie isn't all that bad. It's fun and certainly not to be taken seriously. I recall an interview with Milius where he explains that he based this movie on the games he used to play as a kid. Apparently many in USA felt a genuine fear of an invasion back then (whenever that was).<br /><br />That aside, the movie is playful and the villains range from faceless soldiers to really clever counter-insurgency experts . <br /><br />OK, so teenage kids are the main protagonists. Big deal. The action is neat even though the FX are slightly weak my modern standards.<br /><br />And besides, who's to say that USAnians won't fight as hard as any Viet Cong or Mujahedin when their nation is invaded by a foreign power? Frankly, I think they would. Politics aside, I actually think that if this move was redone today, it would reall be way worse than the original...<br /><br />See it. Don't take it too seriously. Eat popcorn. Have fun.
