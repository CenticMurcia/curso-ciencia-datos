Well, I would suggest a simple test for my recommendation for this movie. I presume that you wanna watch a good horror movie. Stand in front of a mirror, and make some scary faces. Now, if you got scared by looking at your own scary face, then you should watch this movie. And if looking at your face made you laugh, then don't go for this movie, because it wont even make you laugh.<br /><br />Very poor dialogs, worst casting (esp the killer who is terribly unscary) and a lots of technical mistakes.<br /><br />I am still trying to think of at least one good thing about this movie...well I am done thinking...Nothing Good ! I mean it
