Please, stop comparing it to Guffman and Spinal Tap! Guffman is seemingly similar because it deals with a faux documentary on actors. But, my friends, there's little real truth in the Guffman characters, did anyone REALLY think they were real? Great movie, but no one was fooled by it and they weren't supposed to be.<br /><br />Lisa Picard is Famous, however, really builds on what could very well be real people. And while things get pretty crazy in the end, by then you're really enjoying the ride too much to mind. While you certainly don't have to be an actor to appreciate it, if you are you've seen people just like Lisa and Tate. You've seen the agencies and casting directors' offices. You've lived through the childrens' shows and "one man" shows. There are scenes in this movie that my wife and myself busted out hard laughing. The extra scene with Tate was one of them. Lisa's breakdown of "models" was one of them. I won't give anything away by revealing more.<br /><br />But, in the end, you do genuinely care for these people. You empathize with the very real situation of Lisa being on the cusp of fame and possibly having it snatched away (which is full of truth, too). You empathize with Tate's "artistic vision" eventually turned into someone else's vision, Hollywood style. You cringe and hide at Lisa's boyfriend's horrible timing. And, in the end, you want these "monkeys" to be friends and be happy.<br /><br />Look, this is BETTER than Guffman. Guffman mostly makes fun of it's characters. It wants you to laugh at them. They're so extreme in their small-town, wide-eyed ways that they just can't be real. Lisa Picard is Famous has people, believe me, that are right now walking the streets of New York, Chicago and L.A.. The performances are wonderful and you KNOW that these stories are ones that the creators witnessed first-hand as they embarked on their own journey to be famous. After this creation, the deserve to be.
