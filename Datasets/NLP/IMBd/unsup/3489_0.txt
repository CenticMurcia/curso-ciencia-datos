When I seen the trailer for this fillm I expected it to be loaded with action and dragons but to my dissapointment it wasn't. Ok you see a few dragons and get a battle with a dragon at the end but thats about it. As for decent action there is only one occassion where this can be seen. I would also say that it is far too short, it only lasts what and hour and a half where it could have easily been streteched to 2hrs at least with maybe showing van Zan killing his first dragon or whatever. Apart from these flaws I do actaully think this is a decent film, well worth viewing. Overall I give it 8/10
