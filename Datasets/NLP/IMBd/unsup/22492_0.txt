This could have been such a much better movie in much more capable hands. But it's too obvious this was done on a shoestring budget--I take that back--shoestrings are more expensive than that. Grainy, dark film quality does NOT make for an eerie atmosphere--in fact, it's downright annoying. Especially when you can't understand 90% of the dialogue, and what you can hear is the same lines over and over. Put these in Memorable Quotes: "What, no kiss goodbye?" "You're home early." "Do you still love me?" And put "repeated line" over each one. That's pretty much it for the only female in the movie. And the plot has one major hole: how does the lead male become a zombie? I can understand the others, but it's like he just woke up from his "zombie dream" and decided to start eating people--he never died! Too bad, so sad, I'm glad it was a free rental. Remember, folks, a good plot is a terrible thing to waste.
