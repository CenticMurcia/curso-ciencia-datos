The I Inside is a complex movie and while some may dislike it for it's complicating story lines others may just because of it.<br /><br />When Simon(Ryan Phillippe:Cruel intentions,Gosford Park) awakens in the hospital after a near death experience, amnesia has erased the past two years of his memory. He learns that his brother(Robert Sean Leonard:Drive,Dead Poets Society) was killed, he has married a young women he doesn't remember (Piper Perabo:Cheaper by the dozen,Coyote Ugly)... and he is haunted by mysterious visions of the women whom he loved(Sarah Polly:Dawn of the dead,Go). Soon he starts to uncover the truth behind his brothers death and unravel the unbelievable turns his life has taken! So in my opinion if you enjoyed the movies Identity, The Jacket, and Memento you will probably enjoy this Psychological thriller.
