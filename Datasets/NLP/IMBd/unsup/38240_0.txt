The two opera singers are SUCH bad actors, I wondered if they were out of budget for some competent ones. The lip-synchronization was TERRIFYING. They didn't bother AT LEAST watching some operas to see that a soprano cannot possibly sing all those high notes with her mouth almost closed and relaxed like she's singing Christmas songs in a family event. Even Kathleen Battle cannot do that.<br /><br />I wouldn't even want to talk about how RIDICULOUSLY WWI was depicted. Honestly! People DROWNED in mud in Passchendale (sp?) and here's we've got solid ground, tidy trenches, healthy soldiers, etc....<br /><br />Bad dialogues (i.e. 'I have lice')???!!!!! There are far too many fictitious characters. People had shell shock. Here, we've got plenty of characters that seem like Harry Potter counterparts. As somebody else also stated.<br /><br />NOT worth watching. EXTREMELY overrated and boring. By the time I watched half of it, I thought it was an avant-garde movie because it also seemed so naive, but the directors were clearly striving for a typical, joyful Christmas film. And they failed.
