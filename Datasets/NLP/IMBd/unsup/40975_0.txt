After doing five years of rehabilitation time, for killing his father, a still disturbed-looking Donovan Leitch (as Brian Woods) returns to town. The local newspaper, headlined "Boy Who Killed Father Released From Institution", is picked up by luscious-legged Jill Schoelen (as Paula Carson), wearing a T-shirt only. She promises her father she won't be "Cutting Class" while he goes on a hunting trip, or have brawny basketball boyfriend Brad Pitt (as Dwight Ingalls) sleep over. The action moves, mainly, to the local high school, where Mr. Leitch, Ms. Schoelen, and Mr. Pitt are students. According to some of their scripted conversations, the three have had some past relationships/rivalries.<br /><br />As dead bodies pile up, Schoelen is torn between Pitt and Leitch.<br /><br />Leitch, Schoelen, and Pitt do the best they can, under the circumstances. Leitch is the son of, not the original "Sunshine Superman", Donovan. Despite this being an early role for future superstar Pitt, he is too old to be playing a high school teenager. Schoelen, who played several roles like this, is also well past sixteen - but, bending over, she is still sweet. The three attractive "teenagers" are supported by the likes of randy Roddy McDowall (as Mr. Dante) and Martin Mull (as Mr. Carson). But, the best role (perhaps the film's ONLY good role, a manic janitor) is essayed by Robert Glaudini (as Shultz).<br /><br />**** Cutting Class (1989) Rospo Pallenberg ~ Donovan Leitch, Jill Schoelen, Brad Pitt
