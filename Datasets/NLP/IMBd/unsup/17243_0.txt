And you want to watch this film yourself, over and over, for the sheer drama of the story and for the tremendous performances by each and every person in it.<br /><br />Equally poignant were the appearances by the people who weren't performers: at the end of the series, there's a brief meeting with the real individuals who were portrayed in the six episodes, along with a "five years later" update on what actually happened to other characters whose real-life counterparts didn't live long enough (or live free long enough) to participate in the on-camera reunion.<br /><br />Dutton's direction is brilliant, presenting the cold facts of a deadly situation with great compassion as well as narrative force.

A universal plot, as timeless and as touching as Shakespeare's finest.<br /><br />
