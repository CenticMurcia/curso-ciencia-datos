I watched this film this morning and i had anticipated that it would be good, im happy to say that i was not dissapointed! The direction and plot had you puzzled, i realy do not understand why the bodies all vanished though, (yes i know it was within malcom's mind) and does anyone else think that timothy looked shifty from the beginning?<br /><br />I think that it was a very clever film, only critism being that the head in the drier and the con's death looked very very fake.<br /><br />I also loved the ending playing on paris as she was a hooker and so was his mum it was a clever film, throughly enjoyed it!<br /><br />love amz xx
