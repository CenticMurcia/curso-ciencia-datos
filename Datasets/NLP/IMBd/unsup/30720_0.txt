Most folks don't have things quite as bad as the anti-hero of this film. This guy is a Viet Nam vet, who exists with his wife and his mutated baby son in a dirty run-down apartment and can't get a job to save his soul. He wanders the streets endlessly looking for work or whatever, because thanks to being captured and tortured by the Viet Cong he's not doing too well with his mental health. There's no food at home and the baby cries all the time, and it's sort of a cross between a melted child's doll and the goat-baby thing from Eraserhead. We have plenty of drug dealers making a living though, and lots of desperate people out there wandering the streets through landscapes that are depressing and barren. Most notable is a junkie trying to get his fix with a coat hanger. This is by no means an uplifting film and yet it has a certain gritty nastiness about it that's compelling to watch, kind of like a car accident where you don't want to look but can't stop yourself from doing it anyway. Creepy and depressing, but still worth seeing if you can stomach it. 7 out of 10.
