If you think being an "actress" is so glamorous and wonderful and challenging, then you'll like this movie. The women in here seem to think acting is the best thing in the world. It's one of those movies that talks about how great acting is. I hate that. I like acting and all, but when movies go on about "being an actress" and "trying to make it big" and all that Hollywood crap, I lose interest fast.<br /><br />But just for horror movie value, the ice skating scene is the best, and most unique part of the movie. The mask is really freaky.<br /><br />The ending is lame. In fact, I just watched the movie last night and I had to really think about what movie I watched (I knew I watched SOMETHING!) for about a minute before I could even remember it at all - it was that bad.
