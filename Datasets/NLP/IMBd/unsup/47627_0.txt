This version of "Little Women" ranks right DOWN there with the most recent remake of "A Little Princess" for its deeply annoying distortion of the novel. Three examples: Contemporary feminist ideas that hold little in common with Alcott's "feminism" turn the character of "Marmee" (Sarandon) into a plastic caricature of the original. John Brooke is turned into a pert cartoon of a 1950's "beatnik", both in physical appearance and in his speech mannerisms. Professor Bhaer (impossible here to consider in his early 40's, as in the text) makes a mild sexual "pass" at Jo in the theatre which is fully at odds with his abstemious, classical German temperament. .. . I easily could continue with examples of how irritating I consider this film. I never shall waste the money by purchasing a copy. RATING = 0 stars
