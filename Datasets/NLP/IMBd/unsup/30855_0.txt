An indestructible seemingly-super human Israili agent (Adam Sandler) fakes his own death at the hands of an equally indestructible seemingly-super human Palestinian agent (John Turturro) in order to go to America to become a hairdresser and make everyone 'silky smooth'. The only job he can find is in a Palestinian hair salon which is being threatened by evil American businessman, Walbridge (Michael Buffer) who wants it (along with the rest of the neighborhood) out of the way to make room for a mega-shopping center.<br /><br />Firstly, congratulations MUST go to Dennis Dugan who has made not only one of the worst films of 2008 with this lame, unfunny and tedious bit of cheesy fluff, but has been making one of the worst movies of the years 2006 (The Benchwarmers) & 2007 (I Now Pronounce You Chuck & Larry). Back to the movie at hand, I found the 'film' to be overly long, tedious to watch and jaw-droppingly unfunny and like most films of this ilk way too infatuated in cramming as many nonsense cameos into the flick as possible. The story is embarrassingly bad and moronic. You don't watch the Zohan.<br /><br />My Grade: D-
