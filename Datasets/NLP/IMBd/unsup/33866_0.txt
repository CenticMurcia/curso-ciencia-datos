Well it is rather bad, but what can one expect from the Afterdark series I have given up on them a long time ago. I only watched this one because I have owned it for so long now when I quit watching the second series of Afterdark films. This movies are not to graphic for theaters, these movies are to cheaply made and for the most part bad for the theaters. This movie was so boring from the get go I almost fell into a coma during the first hour or so. Then near the end it finally picks up a bit and is tolerable. The story the world is just about gone as we have ran out of gas and this of course would spell the end for people who have to constantly have a phone to their head as you take one convenience away they fall apart. What is left lives here and there sometimes fighting for food and such. Well this roving band of survivors who live in a hospital and pick up a girl whose boyfriend was apparently killed by this one guy who gets away. Well they take the girl back to where they live, in a hospital and you get to see how their boring lives play out. Then a band of cannibals goes on the attack and begins their take down of those living in the hospital. Along the way you get the obvious surprise and a bit of gore, not to much though considering this is a cannibal movie. So you get a movie with most of the action confined to the end and not much of Vinnie or Michael.
