When people ask me why Dil Chahta Hai is on my list of great Hindi movies, i ask myself "What did i love the most about this movie?" Well, It's not the script or the acting or the direction, locations, songs and cinematography. All that stuff was really great, but what i loved the most about this movie was how REAL it was. The three guys were just like any other three guys i know...but thats what makes this movie great. You feel like you know the characters. A brilliant movie with brilliant acting and direction. More movies like this, and Bollywood would be producing movies that are actually worth watching. Go, DCH!<br /><br />9/10
