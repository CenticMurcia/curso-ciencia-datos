Writing, directing, and starring in this independent film, Neill Dela Llana and Ian Gamazon are definitely two people to watch.<br /><br />This is an exciting movie about an American who is brought back to the Philippines to do something for terrorist in order that he might save his mother and sister. The pace is face as we wait to see what he will be required to do.<br /><br />The film is not just about terrorism, but also blends in the grinding poverty in the Phillipines, where Adam (Gamazon) is introduced to the underside of this society children sell their bodies for prostitution, and the odor of a polluted swamp forces him to cover his nose; and the government's campaign against Muslims. It is more than a thriller. It is also an education to those who don't often focus on the plight of others in the world.
