Before I saw this movie, I was a person that would always argue pro-choice. After I watched this movie with my religion class, I was forced to rethink my position. Though I would say I am pro-choice still, this movie educated me in the horrors of partial-birth abortion. Never have I seen a movie that made me think this hard about where I stand on an issue.<br /><br />That being said, I am shocked at all the rave reviews the actors are receiving. I personally though the acting, especially from the lead actress, was atrocious. The defense attorney was decent, and the judge had little else to say but "sustatined", but the main character was played by someone with the skill of a mediocre high school play actress.<br /><br />As for the twist at the end, it was a good one, and it shocked most of the people I watched this movie with. Unfortunately, there were a few of us, myself included, that could see it coming from a mile away. The movie dropped a few too many hints as to what was coming.
