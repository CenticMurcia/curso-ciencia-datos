Basically this movie sucked. The major flaws was that it's story and characters were not even good enough to be called "B movie" actors. The lead character played by Lana Parillia was annoying at best and down right aggrivating most other times.(Lana who? don't worry no one else know who she is either!)The special effects were kinda cool but a total waste of money when combined with this lame half witted story. I gave it a 1 and would have given it a zero if I could have.
