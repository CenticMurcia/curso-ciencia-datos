I can't agree with previous comments raving about BETTE DAVIS and her, in my opinion, failed technique with comedy, nor ROBERT MONTGOMERY's lusterless and coy performance as the sort of cocky and arrogant snob he usually played in romantic comedies dealing with the battle of the sexes. He's at his least appealing here.<br /><br />Gloomy looking Bette looks as if she'd rather smack him than kiss him and gives a very dour performance, heavy with sarcasm (too heavy for comedy). And Montgomery looks as though he despises not only the fact that she is a career woman--but a woman he can't possibly think of as a mate. Put the two of them together in a trite, weak script that is supposed to be a "light as air comedy" and you get messy results.<br /><br />Bette is supposed to be planning the next issue of her magazine around a June wedding and using a typical family for the June issue. She's smartly dressed and coiffed but still has that matronly appearance that makes her unsuitable for what is supposed to be a light romantic comedy. Nor does she play the part in a lighthearted way. None of it is anything more than a waste of time. Even the supporting cast has trouble making anything out of a script that settles for a sexist ending to resolve the bad situation between Bette and Bob.<br /><br />FAY BAINTER tries hard, as do BETTY LINLEY, TOM TULLY and others, but it's a hopeless mess, unfunny and irritatingly performed by the star duo so that one becomes impatient for that supposedly happy ending in which the two stars stop fighting long enough to exchange loving glances.<br /><br />You'd think that after the whopping that WINTER MEETING took from the critics, Bette would refuse to work with stage director Bretaigne Windust again. Well, it's another loser. She's too heavy-handed with the comedy aspects and Robert Montgomery is no help, insufferable as her co-star.
