Everyone I know loves this film and I decided that it was time I saw what is considered a classic of horror. I was pretty let down. The plot is barely being held together by anything. The movie suggests causes for the events in the house left and right and quickly discards them. The actual events started off being subtle, but then we are quickly thrown head first into an array of crazy events that feel like they were there to cover up the many plot holes and show off ILM's command of the effects. The acting is mediocre and the effects, while impressive, feel out of place. I personally did not find the movie to be scary at all. So, why is it that everyone loves it so much? Maybe we just feel like we have to because its a "classic". I know that initially after the credits started rolling, I thought to myself, "did I miss something? That wasn't even that good."
