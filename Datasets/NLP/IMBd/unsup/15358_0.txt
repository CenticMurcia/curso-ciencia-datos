In this rehash of Roger Corman's "The Wasp Woman", Bobbie Bresee plays Lynn Roman, an attractive but aging actress whose career is all but over. Desperate to recapture her youth and hopefully rejuvenate her career, she injects herself with a serum devised by mad scientist Emil Zeitman (a weak looking John Carradine). This has the unfortunate side effect of turning her into a murderous insect-like monster.<br /><br />"Evil Spawn" is basically for those of us who aren't too demanding, or are able to derive enjoyment out of very low budget and low quality genre entertainment. If you can stick it out, the film will reward you with gratuitous nudity (Pamela Gilbert looks very good sans clothes), an overbearing electronic score, a very silly rubber monster, and crude but amusing makeup effects. The acting is exactly as uninspired as you could imagine, although Dawn Wildsmith as Zeitman's evil assistant and Fox Harris as Lynn's agent are a reasonable amount of fun.<br /><br />Overall, I found it quite agreeable. At least it doesn't waste time in delivering all manner of cheap 'n' cheesy goods. It's over pretty quickly and has a conclusion that's downright hilarious in its ridiculous and clich√©d way. It even comes complete with a not exactly subtle message about the dangers of vanity, and is blatantly self-referential, to boot.<br /><br />Be sure to watch for the fleeting Forrest J. Ackerman cameo as a pool guy.<br /><br />8/10
