I didn't get this movie... There's too much usual stories and plots in this movie which make it standard movie.<br /><br />Apart from that, the message is clear and plain, but then, the rumors about the director's sexual orientation which was connected to this movie somehow bothered me.<br /><br />It's about dealing with anomality; sometimes you reject it, sometimes you proud about it, most of the times you're trying to hide it. And it's everybody's dreaming to end your anomality in a grande-explosion which amaze many people (mostly ones who hates you or your anomality).<br /><br />But I can't get more than that.
