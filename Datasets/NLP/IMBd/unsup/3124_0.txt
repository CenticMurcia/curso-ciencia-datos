The one thing that I will never understand how he does it, but Seinfeld manages to find the little things that almost all of us notice, but never give much thought to. He picks out the smallest things that we may think about a few times, or all the time, and manages to make it a big deal. He is a genius at finding the little things and making them into comedy bits.<br /><br />I'm Telling You for the Last Time is basically Jerry Seinfeld's final performance of the classic and loved jokes from the sitcom. After this he would never tell them again. All of the jokes are still funny, most of them are nearly identical, although on some he adds more, or does it with different emphasis, but that is expected.<br /><br />The only problem with this movie is that the jokes are familiar, but they are suppose to be. Even though I knew every joke, they were still great. Pharmasists, old people, horses, medication, bathrooms, airplanes, everything you can compound into a random thought was on here (figuratively) So to keep it simple, if you like Seinfeld, and are a fan of the sitcom, watch this and laugh again and again at his jokes.
