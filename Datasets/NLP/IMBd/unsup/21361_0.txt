alright well i am still wiping the tears from my eyes, from practically one of the funniest films i have seen that meant to be a horror.<br /><br />From peeing on ghost to kicking kids, this move has a wide variety of funny moments. It has some great special effects for the ghost and it can still send a nice chill down the old spine, but nothing that can scare you i believe.<br /><br />I cant see how this movie is related to the eye series and the story seems decent towards the start but just drops from there, but overall a fairly entertaining movie and worth a watch.<br /><br />6/10
