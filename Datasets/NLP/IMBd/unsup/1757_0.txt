For all the crap that Final Fantasy VIII got by not being a 'fantasy' game, it truly is a unique and outstanding game that is undeniably unforgettable in the best selling video game Final Fantasy series.<br /><br />First, for a video game done in 1999, Final Fantasy VIII's FMV (Full Motion Videos) graphics were awesome! From the intro I was already swept up on my feet, hanging on to every last detail of the garden, brilliant fight scene, and glimpses of Sorceress Edea to the last and final ending FMV, which was completely worth the hours of gameplay. What's impressive was that for the intro, you're treated to an amazing training battle between Squall and Seifer, where both of them slice up each other's face...graphic but an awesome and def memorable fight scene.<br /><br />Second, the score is awesome! Again, the intro with 'Liberi Fatali' to 'Eyes on Me' to 'Man with the Machine Gun' to 'Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec' to 'the Oath', really the orchestration and score is moving and beautifully done! Worth buying the soundtrack!<br /><br />Third, need I mention the terrific FMV graphics again? Yes, there is a drawback to the game, the ingame graphics for FFVIII are terrible compared to FFIX and FFX, but you overlook these and you begin to appreciate the intricate plot lines and character developments. One of the most beautiful locations you go to is Esthar city, it's really breathtaking. Another FMV is the awesome Dollet clip, terrific graphics of machines and Squall's escape: it's one of my favorite scenes next to the dance clip!<br /><br />Finally, the story and its characters. You have your main character, Squall Leonhart, as the taciturn and reluctant hero and lone wolf who is, in my opinion, one of the best looking RPG characters there ever was, who's specialty is the kick butt Gunblade. The detail is amazing! Then you have your supporting characers, like Rinoa Heartilly (Squall's love interest), Zell Dincht, Irvine Kinneas, Quistis Trepe, Selphie Tilmitt, Laguna Loire (Squall's dad), and Seifer Almasy (Squall's rival and nemesis).<br /><br />FFVIII is a classic love story. The hero is aloof, yet underneath that tough guy act is a vulnerable 17 yr old, who tries not to care about anyone and the heroine turns his world upside down! After series of rescues and all, the ending FMV (one of the most memorable RPG endings of all time) will definitely sweep you off your feet and conclude this classic love story.<br /><br />The FFVIII story is set in a futuristic world full with sophisticated technology where an evil sorceress corrupts the world's largest military power through manipulation and deception, enslaving mankind to do her bidding. And it's up to a small, loose-knit group of SeeD graduates led by Squall and he must become the leader he never wanted to be, and defeat this sorceress.<br /><br />Yes, again, it didn't have your 'fantasy' elements like dragons and magic, save Sorceress Edea, but in a way, FFVIII is a 'fanasty'. First of all, it's set in the future, that's already your step to 'fantasy'. Next, the futuristic weapons and machines were wonderfully done, believe me, you'll come to appreciate the dollet scene, where Squall's on the sub and the wind is blowing in his face: terrific! The thing was that Final Fantasy fans were disappointed in FFVIII because it was no longer set in the 'past' like the previous FF games, but I think it's a nice change and definitely an awesome change, because it set the groundworks to FFX. The battle costumes to Squall's signature fur jacket outfit and Gunblade to Rinoa's blue costume with angel wings on the back...I loved it! Fans and new players should appreciate the captivating the story line, (great looking) characters, beautiful FMV, and moving soundtrack of Final Fantasy VIII. It was also a breath of relief for me, because the charactes were finally tall (at least compared to the other FF characters and just down right kicked butt)<br /><br />So, despite the complaints of FFVIII being to futuristic and the not so great inplay graphics; the music, FMVs, plot, and characters will make up for it and blow you away!<br /><br />10/10 GREATEST GAME I've ever seen, next to Final Fantasy X and VII, although I think FFXI will be just as awesome! Buy the game and play it out, it's worth the time and the money! Final Fantasy VIII ****/**** Stands alone as an awesome RPG game and in the FF series.<br /><br />What's amazing was that after the game's release was a sudden fad when people went crazy over the Rinoa angel wings, Squall's Lion symbols, and the beautiful song: Eyes on Me.
