I really wanted this movie to succeed, but it didn't. What started out as a mildly interesting premise grew into a disturbing and strange movie about a prep school drop-out making his way in a regular school by treating and prescribing for the mental health of his fellow students. It was not funny nor amusing nor entertaining. The acting struggled in several scenes, but the most obvious deficit is the lack of emotional connection between the characters. Our lead, Charlie, has a romantic interlude with the lead female character, the principal's daughter, and I couldn't imagine a more sterile, unromantic joining. They barely seem connected or interested in each other, and yet we're led to believe that they've made love. It's strange and pathetic. I felt like I was watching a movie trying to be a play trying to be significant, and it just wasn't. I'm sorely disappointed and wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.
