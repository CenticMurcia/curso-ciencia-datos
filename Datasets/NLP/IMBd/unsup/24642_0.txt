I remember that particular episode. It was very scary. We spent a lot of time at school discussing who the body in the glider came back at that precise moment. My friend Pat always claimed she thought some mental person kept and let it go just at that precise time. I always thought it was the announcer that set the mood for the episode. I found a few DVD's with some of the episodes (not this one though) and although they are kind of "hokey" by todays standards they are still entertaining.<br /><br />My personal favorites was the episode about the family curse. In the middle ages a nobleman has a village woman burned at the stake because he believes the woman bewitched his son into killing himself over love for her. As she is led away she places a curse on his family that the eldest son will alway die before the father. This happens throughout the centuries until the present (1959) when the current lord is dying. The eldest son is scared to death because of the curse. His younger brother tells him the stay in the library until their father dies and then comes to get him. When they leave him alone with his father's body he goes to the window to contemplate. When he hears a noise he turns around to see his father sitting up in the bed. He screams and steps backwards and falls out the window to his death. His father see this and falls back on the bed dead. Just a coincidence.... maybe. The current lord swears the curse will die with him. He vows never to marry and never to have children. I couldn't sleep for a week.
