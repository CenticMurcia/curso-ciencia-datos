I am so angry at the writers of neighbours. For years i have come home from school and watched this quality Australian soap. However recently it has gone down down down.<br /><br />They have introduced too many new characters, filled with too many clich√© stories, im not even going to waste my time explaining them. At the moment it is so boring and predictable to watch.<br /><br />The original characters are slowly fading away now and it really isn't worth watching.<br /><br />If you are a new neighbours watcher you will most likely watch this, if you were a loyal neighbours fan, probably haven't watched it for a while, don't bother watching it you will be deeply upset but its catastrohic downfall.(if thats spelt right)<br /><br />ARGH!
