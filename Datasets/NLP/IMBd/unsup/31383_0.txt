Floricienta is a comedic telenovela that can easily be watched by the whole family. <br /><br />It has the typical characteristics of a Cris Morena telenovela:the magic, the musical groups, etc, and of a telenovela in general: a poor girl falls in love with a rich man,a fake pregnancy...etc<br /><br />but it is fun to watch and can make you laugh.<br /><br />SPOILER however (if you don't already know it) fede dies and flor's prince changes(supposedly Fede returns to earth and enters the body of Max, or something like that) That is quite annoying because after all this trouble they went through they didn't even manage to get married really (unreal weddings-cris morena again!) But in the end Flor marries her prince and they live happily ever after while the villains end up in jail.
