The poorest Wisdom vehicle I've seen so far, despite being the only one with no pauses for song and even features the star in a dual role: Norman is a jeweller's assistant who, in order to buy a gift for his sweetheart, tries his hand at gambling on horse-races; his winnings keep piling up and the book-makers decide to outwit him and run off with the money themselves! <br /><br />While the plot had possibilities, there is very little going on here and none of it is terribly funny - despite the support of Edward Chapman (the first of 5 collaborations with Wisdom) and cameos by Margaret Rutherford (playing a dotty millionairess with a passion for animals) and Jerry Desmonde (his unbilled split-second appearance, though, is more of an in-joke than anything else)!
