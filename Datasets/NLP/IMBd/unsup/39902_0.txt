...absolutely, bar none.<br /><br />At best corny and clich√©d, at worst insulting to my intelligence.<br /><br />For example; when the baddie throws a passenger out of a 747 door whilst flying above the airport, on a stormy night, just to prove a point, the body just happens to fall through the glass roof of the control tower where the team are negotiating with the hijacker. 'nuff said.<br /><br />I feel sorry for the original audiences that will never regain those wasted couple of hours and bemused by anyone who would actually go out and spend money on the DVD. I see in the voting that some people actually gave this a 10? Presumably the director, crew and assorted family.
