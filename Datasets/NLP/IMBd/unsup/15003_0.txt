The Shawshank Redemption is my favorite movie of all time. I love it. I'm crazy for it. So on my 10th Anniversary DVD, I saw this little short and I decided to watch it and maybe get a good laugh. I didn't.<br /><br />I popped this in because I had read that it was a good parody of a great film. I watched the whole thing and from beginning to end, I was horrified. I had read also in the trivia section for Shawshank that Alfonso Freeman had several cameo's in Shawshank, and when I saw his name appear on screen in Sharktank, I thought I would enjoy him. I didn't. His acting is one of the worst performance's I've ever had to watch on screen. His character is essentially Red from Shawshank, and he portrays his father's role terribly.<br /><br />This short is horrible. The acting is terrible, the jokes are stupid, the music made me cringe--its a cheap rip off of the films amazing score. The whole thing is just so horrible. As a Shawshank fan and a huge cinema fan, as well as an aspiring filmmaker, I was so disappointed with this. Its terrible from the opening credits to the end credits. If you're a Shawshank fan, try not to give into temptation and watch this terrible short on your DVD. Its not worth it.
