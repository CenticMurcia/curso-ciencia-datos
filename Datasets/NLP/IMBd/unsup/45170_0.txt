This is a terrible horror film, that's very boring, and uninteresting. The acting is terrible, and i never really rooted for anyone, plus nothing happens until the last 15 to 20 minutes, and it's too talky with lots of extremely boring dialog. The twist near the end, is predictable, and dumb, and i was just thankful when this movie ended. It did have a couple of cool flashback moments, and Christine Moore is easy on the eyes, however, I was struggling to pay attention, since nothing happens!.I got this on a 8 horror movie 2 disc set. The Direction is terrible. Roberta Findlay, does a terrible job it's very bland,and the pace is awful!. There is a tiny bit of gore. We get a few bloody stabbings, and a decapitation. The Acting is extremely bad. Christine Moore, does good with the lousy script, however she had her off moments, still i liked her, plus she's gorgeous!,but her chemistry with, Gary Warner is off. Gary Warner, is terrible he over acts, and got on my nerves,and had no chemistry with Christine Moore what so ever. Overall AVOID! * out of 5
