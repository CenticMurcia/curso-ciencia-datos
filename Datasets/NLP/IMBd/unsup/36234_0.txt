The movie was alright..The used car man was hot! The salesman..those eyes. They don't make men like that in the 2000's. He is played by David Ott. Are there any other films featuring him (topless hopefully).<br /><br />The car chase doesn't last long enough.<br /><br />He's cute.<br /><br />Acting is OK but he is quite the comic relief.<br /><br />At first glance he looks like the late Michael Hutchance from INXS.<br /><br />Would like to see him today.<br /><br />Thought I caught him uncredited in Vanilla Shy but that is some years later.<br /><br />Possibly has short role in "Sex and the City"
