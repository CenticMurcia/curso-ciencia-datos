Yet another one of those whacky cross bred horror movies that scared me senseless as a kid but upon seeing again is a total crack up. In a nutshell a woman grows a goiter on her neck that happens to be home to an evil Indian medicine man. Wha wha wha what?? She's hospitalized and Tony Curtis mills around and the slop and glop-ola both start flying in abundance. Mr. Manitou is one heck of an ugly character and like I said when I was little he was enough to make me pull my blanket over my eyes. Nowadays I'd punt that annoying little navajo right out the hospital window. Far from a great piece of cinematic chiller but worth it for it's sheer absurdity and a great scene in which a stunt woman tumbles down some steps and her head busts through all the rungs on the banister on the way down. She's fallen and this movie can't get up. 3/10
