It has been 21 years since this great comedy/romance movie was made staring heaps of really great actors and actress like the dam great actor Tom Hanks,The really funny John Candy from the heaps funny movie Uncle Buck,Daryl Hannah and Eugene Levy.<br /><br />Eugene Levy does a good job at playing a scientist in this movie called Walter Kornbluth who is trying to catch the mermaid (Daryl Hannah) by chasing her around New York City to trow water on her which turns her from human back into a mermaid.<br /><br />Over all this this is a must watch movie and my rating is a big 7 out of 10.
