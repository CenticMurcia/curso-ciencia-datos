It's the sound of Agatha Christie turning in her grave!<br /><br />Yet another garish and poorly done segment in this series that changes Christie's wonderful plotting and characters into a laugh-worthy mess. Jane Seymour looks horrible (Lordy, the makeup!!) as the matriarch of a disjointed family. Every darn one of them needs Prozac and Shrinks. As in other episodes of this "New" Miss Marple series, all the characters are unbelievable. Does anyone really believe the housekeeper in a British well-to-do estate would be allowed to talk to anyone with disrespect? It of course happens here. There's more parading of silly characters that never existed in Christie's book. Isn't it FRAUD to name it "Agatha Christie's Miss Marple," when it has nothing to do with her books? Of course they're selling it so this is for profit....meaning FRAUD by deceit.<br /><br />Anyway, it matters little to people who don't know anything about Christie to learn that Miss Marple never was in "Ordeal by Innocence." They also won't see the radical differences between this badly done version and her book.<br /><br />I wish they would allow Geraldine McEwan and the other "stars" a reasonable amount of good lines. But no. Sadly, this time she looks even more silly. The makeup on this old gal!! Geez, we are to believe that this is a conservative spinster and daughter of a village pastor? She's made up to look (and act) like a vaudeville clown. Tons of pink blusher on her cheeks, curls, and perfectly tweezed eyebrows.<br /><br />Someone who directs these pieces must believe that eye-popping is part of acting, because Miss Marple and the main characters do a lot of it in in this "Ordeal." Many people stutter, but there's a character in this who does it and is basically so annoying that I just kept hoping that he was the one to get bumped off (I'm not saying he does or doesn't, I just wanted him out).<br /><br />Also in keeping with the new series of deleted, added, and changed characters, the murder is radically changed as well as the plot. It's so darn unbelievable when it unfolds.<br /><br />Okay, I've saved the best (or worst) for last. At the end PLEASE keep the nausea medication handy!!!! There's a KISS that will make anyone gag if not Hurl, Upchuck, Barf.....well, you get my drift.<br /><br />Please folks, if you really want this series, ask a friend to record it for you before you even think of spending money on it.
