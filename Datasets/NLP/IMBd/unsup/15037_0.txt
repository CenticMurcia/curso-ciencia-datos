I liked The Love Bug. I had seen it before, except I just didn't remember much about it, and my friend loved it a lot, so I knew it was going to be good when I was in for a re-watch.It turned out to be very cute and humorous at times, and Herbie was so sweet and cool as well.They also did a good job at building their characters, for all of them were really likable and nice. I got a little bored and uninterested with it at times, but The Love Bug managed to pull me back in sometime or another, and I thought overall this was a nice movie, that I'm surprised hasn't been watched by more people than it has, because it seemed like classic material, but I guess not. It's worth a look if you haven't seen it.
