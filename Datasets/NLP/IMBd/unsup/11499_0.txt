A too short series that was pure Stephen J. Cannell at the height of his television career. <br /><br />The hardboiled private eye excerpts from a series of mysteries that had Cannell's photograph on the back; the peculiar and wonderful relationship between the main characters; the longing for a different life; it all added up to a wonderful series that should have lasted for much longer. <br /><br />Jeff Goldblum was wonderfully befuddled, yet earnest in a most endearing way. Ben Vereen was tolerant and amused, drawn to this most unlikely private investigator. <br /><br />The humor was unusual and the scripts did not pander to the lower level. It was a most wonderful year that ended way too soon.<br /><br />An email from SJC himself states that he hopes to release it on DVD...someday. I think someday has arrived, boss. If you can release Renegade, you can release this one. Please?
