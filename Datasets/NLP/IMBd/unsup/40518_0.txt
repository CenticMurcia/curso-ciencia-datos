Even The Simpsons said that this movie is great, so I decided to see it. But with knowing the big surprise this film is just a laugh. I think that it was very shocking when it came in the cinemas but now with knowing what happens, this film is nothing but a big joke. The first half of the film is pretty boring, and I didn't check why Fergus and Jody had to become friends. Jody didn't seem to be so nice and friendly. All the cursing of him turned really on my nerves because it didn't seem to be necessary. Then there is this big cut in the middle and you think another movie starts. With the new haircut of Fergus and the change of the setting there seems to be no connection between the two halfs. With knowing that Dil is a man, you always have to think about the outcoming and you just can't wait till it happens. And when it happens there is no reason for watching the film anymore. You think about why doesn't he leave this pervert or when he doesn't how they are going to have sex. Also you think about how Jody and Dil might have had sex and you can't understand that Jody first wanted to sleep with Jude.<br /><br />The Oscar for the best screenplay is not earned because there are things I already have counted up. Also the nomination for best picture and best director seem to be not right. It is no good movie at all and the only thing worth watching it, is to see this girl's penis. Stephen Rea's acting is very simple so I'd like to question that nomination also. It is not bad, but I think almost anyone could act as good as this, there were no big challenges for him. Jaye Davidson really seems to be a woman, but with knowing, that he/she is a man you can see that the face is not woman-like.<br /><br />So I think with knowing what happens in the film before watching it, this is just a waste of time. And even when you don't know what will happen, which you now know because I said it, it is also not worth the time.
