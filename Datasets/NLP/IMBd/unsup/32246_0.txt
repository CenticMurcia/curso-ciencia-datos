I would love to know how to get a copy of the end credit song "Death Above Ground" by Scott Trammell. I believe the movie was typical yet good. I have read the other posts and say they concentrate on too many things besides first person viewing. I "heard" a lot of the same comments when "Evil Dead" first hit the scene, but they were smaller in volume due to the inability of a--holes to be able to post their remarks everywhere! Oh ell, to each their own. Most people here are probably renters who have seen the screener and like nothing more than to post their ridiculous views based on their unintentional love of the mass populous favorings. But that is just their way of saying hey, I have become a sheep.
