This is exactly the kind of quiet, complex storytelling that we all hope to find at the festivals. Films like this are the reason we turn away from the studio driven multiplex features in the first place. It is also one of the rare indies that doesn't try to overcompensate for it's low budget-ness with overzealous shaky-cam blocking. The filmmaker and his camera are present in the scenes just like a guest, like any one of us just sitting rapt, taking in the story. The first 15 minutes of the movie are interesting if unremarkable. But with the appearance of Jacqui Kim's character the film comes alive and gently lifts off, becoming steadily more engrossing straight through to the end. It is no wonder that she has been nominated for this year's Independent Spirit award. Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but I am truly baffled by the negative reviews that have been logged on IMDB. They seem utterly clueless. I'll have to side with Roger Ebert: This is a great film.
