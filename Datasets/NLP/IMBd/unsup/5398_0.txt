I saw this film several years ago..fell asleep and I missed the ending of the movie .... what happened after she fell??????!!!! Pleeeeese! someone out there has to tell me! I have waited years to find out and never saw this film on TV again! I enjoyed the movie so much..the story line was great and the scenes of the boat were just enough to get me out to whale watch and try my hand at sailing! The Overboard with Kurt Russell is on all the time, but this picture never gets replayed! Please put my years of wondering to an end and someone please tell me what happens to her! Also how do you find copies or contact the networks to get this replayed on TV..Great film
