I saw this movie today and can't believe I waited so long after its release to see it. I stumbled on it on my cable channel and was so taken by it, I interrupted my afternoon plans to watch it in its entirely.<br /><br />Not only was the filmography incredible, but it was so beautifully directed. I can't believe this was Mitch Davis' Directorial debut! How do you do a work so incredible on your first work? The characters were portrayed so beautifully that it seemed that they were real people and not actors. It reminded me of one of my favorite stories of all time...James Michener's "Hawaii", yet it had its own sweetness and own story.<br /><br />I will put this on down as one of my top ten movies and highly recommend it to anyone who loves drama, hope, truth and love...amidst a beautiful island people.<br /><br />I give this 10 stars wholeheartedly!
