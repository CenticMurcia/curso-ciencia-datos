Spiders is your stereotypical "creature-kills-group-of-people-in-small-enclosed-area" movie in the same vein as Alien (minus the suspense and intelligence). If you enjoy this increasingly lackluster genre, then perhaps this film is for you. For those of you who like these type of campy bad horror movies, I'm going to break it down for you on a scale of one to ten:<br /><br />Death: 9 (Many people get killed)<br /><br />Gore: 6 (A few decent shots of spider manglings and poisonings)<br /><br />Nudity: 1 (A girl in a white t-shirt falls in the water, and if you turn out all the lights, and look very carefully, you might see a nipple)<br /><br />Sex: 0 (None)<br /><br />Unintentional Humor: 6 (Some horrible lines that really made me laugh)<br /><br />Special FX: 7 (For a low-budget project, these effects, especially in the last scene of the movie are quite good. Beware, if they can do this with so little money, you're going to see a lot more movies like this)<br /><br />Acting: 4 (As expected and perhaps desired, it's awful).<br /><br />Overall: 5 (A good two hours of campy horror. Nothing too offensively bad, but nothing too memorable either.)
