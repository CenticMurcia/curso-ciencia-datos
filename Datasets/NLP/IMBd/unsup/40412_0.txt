I bought this movie at Wal-Mart for a dollar because it had Vincent Price on the cover. I love Vincent Price and love Horror so I bought it and was happy to add it to my collection. I went to look it up on IMDb and noticed it had a rating of 7.9 so I figured it would be good. I found out it was a Saturday morning show aimed at kids and was beloved by all that watched it.<br /><br />I just put the movie on a few minutes ago and I watched about 20 minutes of it  I am guessing it was the pilot episode that I watched but couldn't say for sure. What I can say for sure is that I was far from being impressed.<br /><br />This show bored the living daylights out of me, I never even so much as cracked a smile for one thing said. The characters were stupid and annoying to say it in a nice way. It was badly pieced together and sloppy. I can't imagine even in 1971 kids thinking it was funny. The jokes were a bit more adult like in my opinion and its obvious they were aiming it at both kids and adults alike.<br /><br />Vincent Price couldn't even save it for me. Seeing him do anything other than horror has always been hard for me to enjoy. In this one he just sat and said little stupid rhymes in between the skits. His motives for doing such a crappy show are beyond me.<br /><br />People, if you like this show please explain to me why.<br /><br />If you have never seen it, then avoid it.<br /><br />It's badvery, very bad!
