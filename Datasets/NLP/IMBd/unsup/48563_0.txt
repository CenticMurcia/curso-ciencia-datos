If this movie was early in Robert DeNiro's acting career, nobody would know who he is today. Nobody in this movie seemed to have any acting skills beyond the characters you see in college films. At parts where the movie was supposed to be serious, it turned into a comedy for me because I was laughing so hard at how bad the movie was. I especially liked how deniro and his partner (police officers) were approaching a red right during a conversation, and in the next cut were driving down the road somewhere else. I also liked how deniro's character, a cop, let a stranger into his house, didn't search her, turned his back on her, and let her take a few bucks ("I only a couple dollars. I won't steal your money and never come back!") without him watching. I also wish I had a woman as understanding as joey nova's girlfriend. Joey, "I killed somebody" Gina (in a calm tone), "Oh, honey, why did you do that?" And how understanding Michele (deniro's girlfriend) was. Deniro, "My dad's a baby killer, I haven't called you in a while, I lied that I do have a kid, oh and a grandson, oh and did I mention I'm a wife beater?" Michelle (in a calm tone), "Hmmm. You should have told me this before." As she then proceeds to twirl his hair in her hand. If you count the number of times the movie uses a dissolve between scenes, it will be more than the number of people that actually watched this movie. The movie jumps around, has no flow, and seems as if the director didn't what scene to use next. At no point in the movie was I curious to find out what was going to happen next. Save time by not watching this movie.
