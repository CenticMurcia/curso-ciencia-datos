One of the great documentaries of the 1970s . Manages to be both extremely amusing and fascinating thanks to an excellent collection of archival film clips ,a fine narration and some truly inspired original music. The message is clear - i.e. don't knock the guy who comes up with some crazy invention.... his next attempt at the same gadget could sell a million ! A landmark production which all students of documentary making should see . Just one slight "downer" .... the home video release of this title seems to be shorter than the TV version. I can remember several scenes from the original which definitely weren't on the video. A truly memorable and positive viewing experience.
