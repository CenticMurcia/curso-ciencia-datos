I had an inkling, despite the fine cast in here, that this sequel wasn't close to the original or it would have been better known. Few people even know this exists. That's not a big loss to them, as this isn't much. <br /><br />It was just too sappy and there was too much focus on this pouting teenager who had been abused at another institution, a place where the good Father Flanagan (Spencer Tracy) was going to expose.<br /><br />This one just didn't have the charm of "Boys Town." Too bad wasting the talents of Tracy, Mickey Rooney, Bobs Watson, Darryl Hickman, Henry O'Neil, Lee J. Cobb and others. Wait - I shouldn't say that about Rooney. He's the star of this film and puts in another good performance.
