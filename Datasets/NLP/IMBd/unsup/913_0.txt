This movie was written ahead of television technology, but on the computer it really leaves room for imagination. If you want to see into the motivation behind marketing,(Myspace,Google,Microsoft,etc...),check this movie out. It's not a movie that follows into any previous genre. Micheal Chrieghton never does. That's what's so great about it. It leaves you with a feeling of insight into the hearts and minds of corporate America. It is a must see. I saw this movie in the eighth grade. My friends and I were all raving about it. A real "Star Trek" atmosphere to it. The women were really sexy, especially at the age I was. I think the movie would be great for a college course in marketing. After seeing the movie you might consider where your mouse wanders, eh?
