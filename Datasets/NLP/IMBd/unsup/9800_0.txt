i saw this on Youtube and thought it was very interesting. Basically, its a documentary. A documentary on what people believe what really happened on 9/11 was a government conspiracy. now, being skeptical of the government is one thing, and it's good to be skeptical, it shows you're a human being with a mind and that your mind is smart enough to actually do research before you believe the truth. unfortunately for all 3 Loose Change movies, there a TON of facts they got wrong. (for more information, see "Screw Loose Change" on Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkh0Mx3bLDU ) writing this comment, people probably think i'm a guy getting paid to type this. well no, i'm not, i promise you that.<br /><br />Loose Change was made by Dylan Avery, a twenty something year old guy with a weird voice. now i give him credit, because he actually made a decent screenplay, if only he got more of his facts right. Loose Change for the most part is pretty boring, with some unnecessary info and a few non-resourced quotes.<br /><br />viewing this documentary, it depends on what you think. if you believe that the government had something to do with 9/11, then you might find it pretty true. but if you think it's bologna, and you want to check for actual facts like me, then you'll find it has a lot of mistakes in it, which is BIG when it comes to an even like 9/11.<br /><br />2 out of 10, because i liked some of the music
