James Cagney plays a permanent patron at a San Francisco honky-tonk, observing the ebb and flow of human traffic and occasionally getting involved in the tangled lives of clich√©d characters. There's the tap-dancing comedian, the penniless piano player, the former burlesque dancer, the lovestruck kid, the simple gambler, the hearty bar-owner, etc. It's hard to imagine which of these stock figures is the most annoying (my vote would be the fur-trapper who hails from New Jersey), yet the film, based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning play by William Saroyan, has garnered some good reviews. Personal taste will have to determine the picture's ultimate value, though Cagney's low-keyed self-assurance (some may say smugness) is rather enjoyable--and his presence is certainly odd in these corny circumstances. Saroyan's theatrical material just isn't well-suited for the screen, and the one main set and the clattering dialogue quickly tire both the eye and the ear. *1/2 from ****
