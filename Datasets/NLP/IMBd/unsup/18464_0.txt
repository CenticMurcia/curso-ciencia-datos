I picked up Jane Austen's book Pride & Prejudice while in high school and I couldn't make myself get past the first chapter... that and the fact that I don't typically like period dramas (they usually aren't done too well), I was hesitant when a friend casually mentioned that it was good, though long.<br /><br />I checked it out from the library and over the next week I probably watched it half a dozen times! I could not get enough of it! It is definitely the best movie I've ever seen and I pop it into the DVD player at least once a week now that I own it!! <br /><br />The complete cast was wonderful but I'd like to say that Mr. Collins was extra terrific- I don't think he's been given enough credit for the wonderful job he did! Though I've seen the movie dozens of times, he makes me laugh every time I see it! <br /><br />I've seen the new one and it isn't near as good..... and you can get it cheaper than $40, as I've seen mentioned a few times.... you can get it from Target for $30 or at Amazon.com for $20 on sale.... AND WORTH EVERY PENNY!!
