Nice movie. Billy Dee a heartthrob; no doubt about it. Richard Pryor a joy to see. Diana did a fine acting job. Even playing the teenage part in the beginning, she essayed it quite well. She brought forth the young-girl-skipping on the sidewalk, all the time the audience knowing that the would-be-rapist was looking for her. This was quite chilling, and only we knew or figured what was about to happen. The Mary Jane shoes, followed by the camera, would lead us to the dastardly deed that would soon take place.<br /><br />I do think Diana did a great job moving through the different age ranges. She also went from innocent looking young girl to well dressed cabaret singer. She went from shy beginning singer to confident entertainer. I think Diana's overall presentation was superlative.<br /><br />Scatman was a hoot. I had seen him in old codger parts, but as "Big Ben" he was quite a character. I realized that this was to shatter his stereotype of the nice old man. As "Big Ben", he was outrageously funny. Billie finally decided she had had enough of these 'tricks'.<br /><br />Scatman playing the john reminds me of Shirley Jones playing the prostitute in Elmer Gantry. Shattering the nice-character stereotypes is always good for the acting resume.<br /><br />I thought that Billie with her mother was good. Her mother really loved her, plus the fancy red hat, too. The mother was kind, and very sweet. She wanted Billie to have success as an entertainer.<br /><br />Best of all, Billie's beginning breakdown in the prison was quite believable and scary. This proves she is an actress who can act in a lot of different emotions. The straitjacket scene was heartbreaking.<br /><br />10/10.
