I've long held the theory that the level of sexism displayed on a DVD's front cover is directly proportional to the dreadfulness of the film itself. I should have been warned off by the stiletto clad legs on display on this DVD, but I was foolishly blinded by the impressive cast list. It's a shame I didn't heed my own inner alarm system, because I would have saved myself an episode of eye strain from the godawful editing and boredom from the godawful script. This DVD would serve the film industry and mankind to better avail by being used as a drink coaster.<br /><br />Utterly awful.
