Go and do yourself a favor and watch this anime. The truth is Cowboy Bebop is one of those classics shows that you can watch over and over again. By that I don't mean watch just one or even a couple of episodes, but the whole entire series and, if your up for it, the movie as well.What really caught me off guard about the show is how each episode was at least or nearly a masterpiece of all of the elements it had for positive reviews.Everyone's positive complimants concerning the music, storyline, and art direction is true. There's no way of looking for a negative perspective for this show and to be honest there is only one word to describe this anime........phenomenal. See You Space Cowboy
