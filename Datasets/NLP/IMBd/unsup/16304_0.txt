David Arquette is terrific in this film and the set design is amazing. I have read many books on the Holocaust, including the one on which this movie is based (Auschwitz, A Doctor's Eyewitness Account by Dr. Miklos Nyiszli). This movie shows a part of Auschwitz/Birkenau never seen before on film (the Sondercommando-Jewish work detail in the gas chambers and crematorium)and it is riveting. The scenes are graphic and authentic. The only downside to the film is that some of the characters are miscast (Steve Buscemi, Natasha Lyonne), though talented actors to be sure. This takes a bit away from the searing dramatic effect of the film, but it is still a must-see movie for anyone interested in the history of the Holocaust. If you like the film, I strongly recommend reading the book as well.
