Extreme Force was a movie with a lot of action. It was nice seeing Hector the world martial arts champion in a film. He acts very well,and his martial movements are awesome, I would think as good as Bruce Lee. I have seen Hector a lot in martial arts magazines, he really knows what he is talking about. I am a martial artist and I can tell all his movements in the movie are true and real, that's very rare to see now days! I thought the plot was interesting, although kind of confusing sometimes. I am looking forward to seeing this champ on the screen again. A real fan, Matt
