Vixen Highway looks someone got their friends together and decided to make a movie. The entire film is amateurish. Besides a bad script (was there a script?)and bad acting, parts of the films are overexposed, there are sound problems and the film editing was laughable. Most of the characters had no point to them and appeared to be thrown in just to take up space. Women, for no apparent reason, dressed provocatively; even a policewoman walking around with her shirt open. The only two who can act were Dave Quimby and the actor who played Bobby Brazzel (I notice that his character is not in the credits on IMDb, is it because he doesn't want to admit he was in it?) but even they couldn't shine in this mire of quicksand.
