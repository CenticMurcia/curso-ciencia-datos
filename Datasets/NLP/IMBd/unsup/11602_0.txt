Jonathan Mardukas embezzled 15 million dollars. The mob wants him dead. The F.B.I. wants him alive. Jack Walsh just wants him to shut up.<br /><br />Summary written by rcs0411@yahoo.com: Jack Walsh is a former cop from Chicago, who was framed by criminal he was investigating and about to arrest. He is now a bounty hunter based in Los Angeles. His boss wants him to find, Jonathan "The Duke" Mardukas, an accountant, who was working for Las Vegas mobster, who stole millions of dollars from him and gave it away. His boss was the one who bailed him out, and now unless he can get him back in L.A. in the next 5 days, he will forfeit the bond and be placed out of business. So he sends Jack to get him, which is Midnight Run or easy job in the bail bond business. Except for the fact that the man The Duke stole the money from, wants to get him, and he is also the same man who framed Jack. And also the FBI wants to get Mardukas so that they can use him to get his boss, so they warn Walsh not to get in their way. But Walsh nevertheless finds The Duke and is about bring him back but when Mardukas claims that he has difficulty with flying the airline throws them out of the plane, so they have to go back on the road. When Walsh's boss, learns that he didn't arrive when he was suppose to, he sends another bounty hunter, Marvin, who is Jack's greatest adversary, to get Mardukas. And when Marvin cancels Walsh's card, they don't have enough funds to make it all the way, so they have to scrape everything they have. And it doesn't help that Mardukas is doing everything he can to escape, cause he says that his former boss can get him even in jail.<br /><br />Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin are perfectly cast in their roles. The film is very good and underrated, for reasons that I don't know. I cant find it on DVD and wish it would get a re-release this is better than 80% of the action films out there.
