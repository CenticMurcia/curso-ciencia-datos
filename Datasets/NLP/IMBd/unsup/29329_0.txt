this is by far the best Romanian movie <br /><br />Mugur Mihaescu plays incredible the two characters : Garcea , a funny but stupid cop , and Leana , who's married with Costel (bou cu basca) and has two childs Axinte and Lila . Her hobbies are drinking , drinking , and least but not the last drinking. <br /><br />Radu petreanu plays also very good as Costel and the Russian colonel.<br /><br />The characters are very original and funny , like the retarded childs(axinte&lila) or the governor of sadova city etc<br /><br />This is a very spicy comedy , and I recommend it to everybody who wanna see a pretty good movie =)) .
