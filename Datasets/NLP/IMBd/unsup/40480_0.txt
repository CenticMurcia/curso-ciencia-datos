When I read the synopsis and viewed the trailer for The Living and the Dying I thought it would be a really good movie. Now that I have seen it; it wasn't what I thought it would be. It's what actually transpires after the prison break, so you need an imagination. Right from the start there is enough profanity and blood for ten movies. There are quite a few derogatory statements made against the female gender too. It was just to much, possibly an over kill. I didn't totally trash it because I thought some of the acting was decent and seeing a real SWAT team was pretty cool for a no budget movie. Another reason I didn't give it a low score of 1 because of a short that is on the DVD which in turn was pretty good. I also took into account that the film maker appears to have made a genuine effort in comparison to some of the other no budget trash I have seen.
