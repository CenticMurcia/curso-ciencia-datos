one thing I dislike about diving are the testosterone filled self labelled 'expert divers' that you will encounter on just about every organised dive you will ever do <br /><br />never mind the sharks. the truth is that people with heads swollen by the experience (which actually a senior age lady can do) are the biggest threat to your diving safety<br /><br />I just read a review by a dive expert that thought this film was scary and realistic 'just like real night diving'. apparently this person has dived on his own in open water, like the submariner, and therefore can tell you exactly what it must be like to be stranded <br /><br />guys like this will tell you they are ex navy seals and then be so rubbish at diving that they'll kick coral to smithereens (true story) <br /><br />personally i'm not sure why even a semi-factual attempt was made at this story. why not use it instead as the basis for a more extensive plot? nothing is known about what happened to the two people involved and it's most likely they lost their lives in a thoroughly un-Hollywood way, from exposure or drowning. the only surety is that the dive organisers and crew were totally incompetent <br /><br />the way the woman glides into the water at the very end of the movie, with sharks visually feeding on fish close-by to her, is extremely glamorised and unrealistic as is the whole emphasis on sharks as the lurking horror. the part where the dive camera is cut out of the shark at the end is wholly disrespectful, lacking in taste and really quite ridiculous <br /><br />if you want realism you may as well watch deep blue sea
