This movie is only watchable for the scene in which Barry Boswick shoots someone in the legs, and then states that he isn't "jumping for joy". That moment besides, the movie is a downward spiral into the abyss of film making. What possible reasoning any producer, director, or writer could have for involving themselves in this disaster of a movie escapes me. I would like to get in contact with the filmmakers and request compensation for my time and brain cells wasted. I'm having trouble thinking at which I would like to be compensated, but I can't imagine that I would settle for less than a Learjet. I suppose some of this can be credited to the werewolf/robot craze of the time, but I never imagined that the combination of the two would bear the twisted, disgusting fruit that is Project: Metalbeast. If I were to walk into a room where this movie was playing, I would kill those viewing it as an act of mercy, and then swiftly take my own life in order to avoid these travesty a second time. May God have mercy on the souls of those who actually payed money to see this movie during the four days in which it was in theaters.
