The plot itself is not bad. A treasure with the interest of more than one party. The way things are going are very bad. Michael Madsen is not a bad actor, but his role in this movie is just overdone. All these people that change clothes, like Mission Impossible, but here is not really convincing. All German speak English, without any accent. Even in Allo Allo it is better done. It is not that easy to speak German, but please, speak English with a some kind of (German) accent, if you cant speak German at all. Some scenes are so stupid. Walking around in German army clothing during a shelling and stealing a car. And nobody sees you? ? Get real. Oke, it is an adventure movie. But this is a little bit to much. Overall the movie is(was) a waste of time, 4 Me!! 3/10
