This movie has just been on UK BBC TV.<br /><br />When it started, outside it was snowing and the flakes were small and shardy. But, as time went by, they turned into quite large fluffy ones. There was quite a fair breeze too, blowing from the west. The weather forecasters have predicted that the flurries will be short-lived and followed by warmer weather with rain. So I don't think it will lie for long. It's a pity because we haven't really had any good snow in these parts for many a year.<br /><br />Must be something to do with global warming.<br /><br />Scotland, I believe, is the worst affected by the weather Â– it must be nice up there in the hills at this time of year.<br /><br />Then the film finished.<br /><br />I think it had horses in it.
