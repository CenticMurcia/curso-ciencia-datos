Hi.. I'm quit surprised with all the negative reviews this movie is receiving, i mean did i watch the same movie as other reviewers watched, i mean i thought that this movie is a really good one. Im not a Linsday Lohan fan, the fact is this is the first movie i watched for her, i must admit that this was a really nice and cool thriller, very very enjoyable movie. the script and plot were engaging and intriguing, it never dragged or slowed down or felt boring, kept me intrigued. Yes it did have some over the top gory scenes, but isn't that a good thing for adult fans of the genre, i mean how come SAW became so popular and recommended, if you don't like gore then don't watch it, but don't give bad reviews of the film because you are too weak to stomach these scenes, i totally enjoyed it !!! Acting was very good from most of the cast, as i mentioned before this is my first Linsday Lohan's movie i saw and i thought she did a good job. In summary, i thought that this movie was very enjoyable and one of the good movies of this summer, keeps you guessing till the end and has a good plot, so if you haven't seen this, my advice is to go ahead and watch it, it is totally worth it, i really don't get why too many people hate it, it succeeded as a thriller movie, what more do u want !!?? this was more enjoyable to me than : Captivity, Pirates of the Caribbean 3,Evan almighty and I pronounce you Chuck and Larry. so please guys stop the winning and just go watch another PG 13 Disney movie and leave the R rated adult movies for the grown ups !!!! 9 out of 10
