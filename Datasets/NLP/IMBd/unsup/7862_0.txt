Nothing spectacular in Disney's latest attempt to turn one of their theme park rides into a movie. I pray that "It's a Small World" is never filmed, but I digress.<br /><br />Eddie Murphy is good in the leading role, but his wife looked way too young for him. Special effects were pretty good, and almost made up for the flimsy plot.<br /><br />But did anyone else notice that this movie was set in Louisiana (the ride at Disneyland is in the part of the park called The French Quarter, and the cars had Louisiana license plates) and not one character had a Louisiana accent? Not even the guy who'd lived all his life in the mansion?<br /><br />Mindless entertainment, nothing more nor less. 4/10
