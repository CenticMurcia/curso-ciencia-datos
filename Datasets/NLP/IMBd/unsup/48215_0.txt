The art work was not bad but it could have been much better. The sound was poor. There really was no story line that made any sense. It looked like the cartoon was rushed into production. I think this group has a chance to make top grade productions in the future, but this first attempted was tossed together. They need better writers and more people who can rework the sound. It will be interesting to see what their second production is like. One area they have got to improve on is their public relations. They seemed to expect that word of mouth would bring out a huge crowed to see the movie and buy the DVD. It doesn't work that way.
