...in conversations about this movie who simply doesn't like it. When I say that "I hate it", everyone starts to praise the whole movie. <br /><br />Reasons I don't like this movie are:<br /><br />1) All too happy in a too sweet way 2) Soundtrack, which is the most stereotyped soundtrack I have listened to 3) Characters. The main character is simply a nut job 4) The overall look and feeling of it. Those zooms and tracking shots...<br /><br />I've always thought that if Amelie would have been an Hollywood movie, everyone would have said "It too sappy", but now when it is in french: "Aaah...it's so nice." Yet again, I feel I'm the only one who thinks this way. <br /><br />For some reason this movie just didn't work for me. I'm not a pessimist or anything, but all that chirpy and happy feeling just don't cut it. <br /><br />Having watched other Jeunet's movies, I think that his style just doesn't work for me.
