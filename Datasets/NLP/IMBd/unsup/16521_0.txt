Tobe Hooper's 2003 version of the Toolbox Murders is a fun little movie. It's a bloody good time to watch, although it's not scary, but the fun factor makes up for it. I haven't seen the original, but I'm sure it's better than it. The middle part drags a little bit, but once the main character stumbles apon the "hidden" portion of her apartment building, the fun and action begins! Props to Tobe Hooper for a great and well done opening sequence. Most films that have somebody killed in the beginning have the next scene take place somewhere else or on the next day, the scene after it takes place the second after it! I give it an 8 out of 10.
