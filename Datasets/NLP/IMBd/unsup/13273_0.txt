The intense and at times melodramatic Reflex Action is a movie that cannot be ignored. Starting with a harrowing depiction of the death of an African American soldier (and friend to Quinn Taylor) in the first Gulf War and all the way until the last bullet is fired, Reflex Action is the action/drama that won't let you rest. Reflex Action is yet another feather in the hat of writer/producer/ director Kevin Rapp. With Reflex Action, he has truly proven now to his critics that he can do it all, and well. The sparing of brothers Quinn and Lee Taylor has to be put aside as they will have to find a way to work together to save an innocent girl, and their family's name. Bottom line: Kevin Rapp has done it yet again.
