The movie goes in circles and the actors and actresses must have been loathing to do perform in it that anyone could take it seriously. One of the big stinkers, BUT well worth watching the first third to Irene Hervey, surely one of the most beautiful women in her day, in a very form-fitting leather, sharkskin gown.
