The title really does say it all. The film is about survival, has style, and is well worth 5+ (I gave it 5 + 4 here).<br /><br />There is always a question when you watch any film from a different culture as to how well it will communicate its themes, an issue particularly associated with Japanese films, fairly or not. This is compounded when it comes to comedies, which are notorious for travelling badly. SS5+ cuts across the boundaries effortlessly.<br /><br />It looks vivid and gorgeous, it's fast paced and filled with strange, near random story lines, but somehow easy to follow. It put me in mind of Trainspotting, if Shallow Grave had been one of its stories and there was more life after death. It has quality action scenes, weirdly solemn moments and crazed characters. Okay, Vinnie Jones isn't that great, but his interpreter makes up for it. Because of the humour.<br /><br />SS5+ is hilarious. No other word will do. I wouldn't dream of spoiling it for future viewers, so I will say only this: J's expression as the music rises. Daddy's look of horror at the thought of selling. Milk, Internet, Headache, and Monkey Records. I guarantee anyone who's seen SS5+ and just read that is curled up on the floor wiping their eyes right now. Catch it if you can.
