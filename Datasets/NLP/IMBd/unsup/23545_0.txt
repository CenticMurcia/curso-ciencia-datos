This is a very loosely biographical based movie on Vlad Dracula, and it was a very refreshing change.<br /><br />Roger Daltrey is the weakest actor, and he is pretty good.<br /><br />Rudolf Martin was perfect for the role of Dracula, what a mix of passion, and vanity.<br /><br />The story is fact based and if you know your history you can see it weaved though-out this tale. The sets are amazing for a fairly low budget movie.The fight scenes are fair to slightly above average, but this movie is so strongly written you can forgive the weaker fight scenes.<br /><br />One of the Best Dracula movies I have seen, and by far the best low budget historical(ish) Vlad movie I have seen.
