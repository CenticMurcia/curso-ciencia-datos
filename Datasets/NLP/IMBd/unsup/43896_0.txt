This was a really strange and confusing movie. I feel pretty bad saying this because I am a fan of Tori and Dean, not so much for their acting, but I do like their reality show. The movie seemed to be everywhere with the plot. I mean, the plot was good, but whoever wrote this didn't know how to make the plot work correctly. I think better writers and maybe if Tori and Dean would have gotten into their characters a little more, it may have turned out better. I think the acting was okay, but it seemed fake. You know they are acting, but when you can actually remember throughout the film that they are just acting, it's not really good. Well, at least they both got something out of the movie, a nice relationship.
