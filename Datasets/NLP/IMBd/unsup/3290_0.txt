The DVD box made it look like a watchable flick, but it was terribly misleading. It was a piece of crap. We get to watch some dope get led around by the nose for an hour or so by some terrorist wannabe on a cellphone. They want his money, they want him to blow up a building, and they will cut off pieces of his mother and sister to make it happen. The guy is told to close his bank account and give the bad guys the money. They couldn't get into the bank to film, so we get to watch a little kid eating a happy meal. How creative. The explosion at the church/mosque/whatever was equally impressive. Fast forward though a few phone calls and long walks and we get to the end. Same kid, same happy meal, sharing with grandma. How sweet. They couldn't bother to have an explosion sound effect and shake the camera a little? Then he goes home, talks to his cheating girlfriend, and curls up in bed crying....the end. What a waste of time. I got it as a freebie from Blockbuster, and I still feel cheated.
