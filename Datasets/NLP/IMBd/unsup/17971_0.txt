Dennis the Menace is among the few films on the video shelf that is able to keep the entire family amused. In the film, we see the newspaper cartoon of our youth come to life with a cast that could not have been more perfectly chosen. Walter Mattheau and Joan Plowright are ideal as the neighborly object of Dennis' affection; he the loveable old curmudgeon and she the unfulfilled neighborhood grandmother. Mason Gamble embodies the spirit of the spunky menace you cannot help but love. Margaret and Joey appear on the screen just as you had always imagined them, as do the parents of the menace.<br /><br />Of course Christopher Lloyd gives a fine performance as the true menace to this sleepy village. Lloyd may be just a tad too scary for younger children, and some of the riverside scenes with Lloyd and Gamble may be the stuff of nightmares. Parents beware.<br /><br />If your young ones are not easily scared or influenced to devilment, this will be the film to provide an evening of fun for all ages.
