This is a real diamond in the dirt. The kind of movie that gets out to video too soon due to marketing failure. I saw this on video and thought that it was one of the best gangster movies I've seen, ever... You've got to give the best credit to the casting - Sean Penn, Gary Oldman, Robin Wright-Penn, Ed Harris, Nick Turturro - whoever did this piece of work was really ahead of their time. The action sequences are stunning and realistic. To summarize this movie - probably the most 'atmospheric' modern gangster movie since the Godfather.
