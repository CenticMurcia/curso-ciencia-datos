"The Trial of The Incredible Hulk" was not bad at all. Although, like the TV show, there were a few flaws in it. For instance, David Banner(Bill Bixby) has a beard at the beginning. When he "hulks" out, The Hulk(Louis Ferrigno) is clean shaven. At one point on "TIH" cartoon I saw the Hulk with a beard and mustache. Sounds strange from what I saw, but that's how things go in the made for TV movie. At least they got one superhero right. Daredevil(Rex Smith), the blind lawyer/vigilante crime-fighter who stops evil in its tracks. Then there's Wilson Fisk(John Rhys-Davies)AKA "The Kingpin". Of course they can't use that name because this man has hair, The real Kingpin of crime is BALD! He's battled Daredevil in the past, as well as Spiderman, The Hulk will smash him up, easily. Not a worth fiend for the Green Goliath. I liked the part where Daredevil went into the trap that Fisk has sent for him, and The Hulk smashed the little window and took out all the assailants. That was great. This movie is exciting all the way, it could have added more action to it, especially with the jail break scene. And the courtroom scene was great as well, if the sandals Ferrigno wore didn't give him away. Other than that, I enjoyed it very well. Rating 3 out of 5 stars.
