I think the problem is too many people are comparing this movie with other movies and failing to realize thats its not SLC Punk or Fightclub. Anarchist Cookbook deals with a more philosophical and physiologically aspect of Anarchy over anything else. The whole movie starts with comparing Hippies to Anarchy, the idea of accomplishing anarchy by means of peace, respect and intelligence. Puck believed that was Anarchy, then Johnny Black shows up and basically takes that whole concept and says it will never work. Johnny Black was right in sense too, the fall of the system could never be acquired by means of peace. Johnny Black believed the only way to bring down the system was to use violence, aggression, and destruction. This meant going out and openly attacking the system by aggressive vandalism, attacking people, and altering peoples judgment by addiction. The movie does this by comparing Johnny Black to Nazi's, and rednecks. Puck not only didn't agree with this method, but it also opened his eyes to the truth of Anarchy, and thats why in the end Puck just left the scene. He knew the truth and he knew the real decision to be made was not to how to carry out Anarchy, but weather or not Anarchy could be carried out.<br /><br />Watch this movie if you got an open mind and are searching for a philosophical aspect of Anarchy, otherwise stay away because you'll just misinterpret it and think the movie makes no sense.
