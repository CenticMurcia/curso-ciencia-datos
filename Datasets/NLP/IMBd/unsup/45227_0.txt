Although I like the actors in this movie, I found it to be boring. I chuckled a few times but they were few and far between. The previews made this movie look like a funny romantic comedy but I found myself nodding off toward the end.<br /><br />The movie does not fit as a romantic comedy. The chemistry between the main characters is lacking and as far as the comedy goes...well there wasn't much. So if you are looking for a romantic comedy, I say look elsewhere. If you want a movie you can watch and step away from every now and then while doing your chores or other errands, this is the one to do it with.
