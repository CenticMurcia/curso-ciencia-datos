This is a great movie and I've seen it on TV. I cannot understand why there is no DVD or video -- except that Vanessa Redgrave once told me that he movie was "banned" in the United States because of her support of the Palestinians.<br /><br />I told her I had seen it on TV and that her last scene at the liberation of Auschwitz was extraordinary.<br /><br />Another reason I liked the movie was that it was the first film even to mention my personal heroine, Mala Zimetbaum, about whom I have written.<br /><br />My story about Mala can be found at: http://www.ideajournal.com/articles.php?id=15
