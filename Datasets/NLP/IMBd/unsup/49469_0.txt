Generally I think I like feature-film spin-offs of TV sitcoms more than most viewers. But this is a dire example of the genre.<br /><br />I suspect the actors were forced into performing in it for contractual reasons beyond their control. As revenge they then conspired to make a comedy that contained no laughs. If this was the case they were successful.
