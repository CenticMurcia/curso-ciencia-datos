Buñuel still has yet not to surprise me. I find his surrealist films putting me in one curious situation after another, and I can only wonder what went through his mind each and every time. "The Phantom of Time" exceeds our expectations of realism in a way that makes us question whether or not what he shows us can really happen. For instance, Buñuel puts us in a world where religious folk smoke and gamble, or where a convicted serial killer becomes the center of fame to the point where attaining his autograph becomes a must for the public. For myself, a particular favorite from this film would be when the professor lectures on morals and so forth, and Buñuel cuts to a sequence where the kitchen and bathroom swap roles  both brilliant and comedic!<br /><br />Although these situations seem very unlikely, I believe Buñuel's overall intentions are to make the point that, despite each individual's expectations in any given situation, anything is possible. In addition, most cultures differ from one another to begin with, so differences are inevitable.
