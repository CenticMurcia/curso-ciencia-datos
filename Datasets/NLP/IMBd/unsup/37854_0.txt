Three stories (all bland and emotionless) unfold in Red Shoe Diaries 2: Double Dare, a terrible anthology filled with loser episodes from the series. The first stars Steven Bauer and Joan Severence and follows their turbulent sex-only relationship. The second is laughably, horribly bad starring a VERY unattractive actress as a cop who wants to get kinky with a guy she never met before. And the third is a so-so story of a game of double dare played between a man and woman who work across the street from each other.<br /><br />If you liked the original, like me, you will hate the lack of emotion these stupid anthology stories give. One Star out of Four.
