I could not believe how bad this movie was. It starts out okay, with Combs as Lovecraft seeking the Necronomicon inside a monastery, but when he finds it and starts reading it, the unfortunate viewer must endure 3 tales that are dreary instead of frightening, dull instead of engaging or morose. These stories will not satisfy Cthulhu fans -- they are void of Lovecraft's skill or imagination. This is an hour and a half of my life I'll never get back, wasted on a miserable and unsatisfying film.
