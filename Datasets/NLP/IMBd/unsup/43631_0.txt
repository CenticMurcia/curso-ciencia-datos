This movie tried really hard to be a good little gay themed movie and coming of age film in general but it was done in by its flaws. The actors were all excellent, especially the two brothers, but I never believed they were in High School. And that's where the problems with this started. They seemed more like college frat brothers. It was as though the screenwriter/director forced everything to fit what was written, which causes the viewer to go, "Huh?"...When the viewer starts going "Huh?" you've got problems. And by the end, the "Huhs?" started coming fast and furious. The film started reaching for emotional moments it hadn't really earned because they'd never been established during the story and then it tried to cover way too much ground following Dorian from High School to college (in Greenwhich Village yet, where he manages to keep away from men for two years! Please!). The other major problem was the characterizations of the parents. The father was such an unrelenting asshole and the mother was such a zombie you just couldn't become emotionally involved in the family plot lines. Seriously, these boys could've given the Menendez brothers a run for their money with parents like that. Actually, the guy who played the dad used to be on the soap "One Life To Live". He played Brad the tennis pro who raped his sister-in-law, the ex-prostitute, played by Judith Light...which is weird, since she's so involved in the Gay Rights Movement. Interesting.
