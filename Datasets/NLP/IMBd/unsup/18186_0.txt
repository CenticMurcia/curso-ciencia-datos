I found this going for $1 at the video store, and, as the cover looked vaguely interesting (a priest and a stripper), I bought it, hoping it would be worth the buck I spent for it.<br /><br />It turned out to be worth a fair bit more. Hidden behind the sexploitation is actually a little gem of a movie, with a good story and a great central performance from Brad Dourif, who I haven't encountered before. He, along with a supporting cast, put a surprising amount of effort and passion into 'Final Judgement,' considering practically no one's ever seen it.<br /><br />Worth at least $2!
