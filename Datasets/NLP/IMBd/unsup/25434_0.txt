I am surprised to see so many highly negative reviews of this movie. I thought Whiteboys was one of the funniest movies I've seen in months. In addition, it took some creative finesse and a heap of guts to even attempt to extract humor from such a racially charged subject. Sure, this is not an outstanding film that would win any of the overrated awards of the day, but it does deserve credit as a simple but entertaining movie.<br /><br />Geez people it's just a movie. It didn't claim to be a documentary on life in Iowa nor a siren call for world peace. Basically, if you didn't find this movie to be mostly funny you are taking life WAAAYY too seriously! Lighten up - you'll live longer.
