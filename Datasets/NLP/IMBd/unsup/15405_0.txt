Its not a big production and we could see more nudity or more romantic scenes, but it is worth to see.<br /><br />The story of a college boy with strong values such as responsibility who falls in love with a whirly girl. The girl made him forget the consequences and start doing some risky things for her, and actually his attitude changed this girls life who changed her meaningless live and finally found something worth in her life.<br /><br />It's mainly a romantic story puts the reason and the principles of this boy against his feelings.<br /><br />I really enjoyed.
