I read the story of Yacoubian Building so I couldn't wait to watch it in the movie theater but I thought it will be like any other story. not as good as the book. I just loved this movie.. the Casting was so genius and every actor did his part in an amazing way. The Old Classic ones and the new generation. Even Mohamed Emam. this is his first movie and he was able to make me believe in him. This movie should be nominated for an Oscar. Even the soundtrack, the picture and the dialog just so good. this movie had me thinking all night about it and made me live it. this movie made me laugh, cry, bothered, It is a masterpiece. I just hope the movie industry in Egypt keeps on bringing those types of movies. those movies which remind us of the 70's movies where at least 2 or 3 big movies stars act together. Now I'm thinking to take the rest of my friends to it so i can be able to watch it second time. It is one of the best movies I've watched this year.
