As self-assured a film as any I've ever seen, Vince Rocca's Kisses and Caroms gives me just the boost I need to start my own career as a independent filmmaker. Threesomes, porn stars and billiards? What more could anyone ask for? The flick follows in the path of Kevin Smith while at the same time blazing it's own unique path by putting a spin on the classic romantic comedy rules, i.e. the boy spends the whole movie trying to get the woman who he has no chance of getting and instead puts the female character in that most unenviable situation. Why exactly this movie wasn't excepted to Sundance or Slamdance is beyond me, as in this world of low quality crud, we need more movies like Kisses and Caroms out there. Definitely deserves a 9.
