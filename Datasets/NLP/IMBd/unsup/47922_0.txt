The dudes who work for YTV show this every Christmas. i still have yet to see the whole thing again. but i saw most of it and it still gets in my bloodstream. and that blood goes into my eyes, and they turn red. Why does this happen? Well, let me dedicate a paragraph to the reason why.<br /><br />Pernie had this covered perfectly in one sentence...Fairies who painfully narrate the story...And i have to agree with him. Those sprites of the northern lights are always the burning flesh on my tongue when i drink a hot chocolate. they're annoying, I hate them, I'm sure everyone else does too, although there might be that random girl who sort of takes interest in them. Moving on, To add them to the story was also a mistake because you don't just add fairies to help some random reindeer go help find his girlfriend.<br /><br />But Also, It's not right for me to just say whats negative in this flick, i must say i was impressed with some of the characters, such as the tough talking buck who's hittin' on rudolph's doe, Zoe. I nicknamed him razor, after the bad guy in Need for Speed most wanted, cause that's how i'm reminded of him. either way, some of the script was great, the actors great, but some things could use a few changes.<br /><br />anyways, Rudolph ends up with his red nose - and it doesn't make him any better. he loses a race on account of his red nose, and runs off feeling like he doesn't belong. thats where the story really begins.<br /><br />According to what i've heard, this movie spent 3 weeks in select theatres before they realized it was a piece of crap and decided to release it before the theatres threw it out.<br /><br />So bottom line, at least see this once....but i guarantee you'll go mad when you hear about those sprites of the northern lights.<br /><br />2/10
