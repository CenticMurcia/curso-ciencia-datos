Well... granted I think this movie is geared towards kids but for what's it worth, it pretty much stunk. Martin didn't do anything funny besides getting hit by basketballs and this movie accomplishes nothing we haven't seen done better already. Horatio was severely underused for such a funny guy and the kids were just SO typical and predictable.<br /><br />The plot was garbage and each step was more predictable than the last. In fact, its so bad I was predicting which kid would make what shot in the basketball game. That little brat from Even Stevens is in this movie and his gimmick is that he constantly vomits. I wanted to vomit with rage at the stupidity of the character. Then there's some chick on the team named "Big Mac" and her trademark is that she's a bully, bigger than all the kids on the team. These clich√©, overdone characters made for no comedic situations and overall a lousy dose of comedy.<br /><br />This is just another "the funniest moments were in the trailer" movies. People came looking for a good time with Martin Lawrence and Horatio Sans and got a big letdown. A much better "coach" movie would be Coach Carter, which is just coming out on DVD. Much better spent money and far more entertaining. Overall, Rebound was not a complete flop, but there are FAR better movies out there. Certainly the worst I've seen of Martin Lawrence.
