Just caught this on late night Lifetime channel. I know it's usually a women's channel but I have always found Markie Post to be very attractive & she was smoking in this film. Made for TV movie also featuring Candace Cameron who is repeatedly abducted and probed by space aliens is desperate for help. Markie Post is reliving nightmares as well and then it comes to her that she also was abducted and probed by these evil space aliens. They then realize a common thread regarding the abductions and join forces to stop them once and for all. Post manages to get abducted in Cameron's place and finds out exactly what these pesky aliens are up to and pleads with them to stop their research and things get quiet...for a short time...Must see movie.
