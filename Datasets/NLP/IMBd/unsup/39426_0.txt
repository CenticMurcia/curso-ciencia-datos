In one word the movie is PATHETIC!!!. It seems director had some wild weird kiddish imagination which he portrayed in this awful film. The script is very weak and the sense of humor was very cheap and bad . The movie was suppose to be in the same genre as that of euro trip or American pie but alas! it lacks the slightest of the humor when it comes to comparison with them!. Extreme movie is extreme waste of time. By the time movie ends you will realize you hardly laughed anywhere. The acting was o.k. Ryan Pinkston did fine but then movie is too bad to be covered up by the acting only. It has one use for sure .if you have an enemy gift him the DVD of this movie and you wont regret it!
