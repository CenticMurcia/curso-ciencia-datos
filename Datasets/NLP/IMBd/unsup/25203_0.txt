One of the best silent movies if you'd ask me, as The Black Pirate offers action, romance and suspense.<br /><br />As the only survivor of a pirate raid, 'The Black Pirate' (Fairbanks) goes 'undercover' with that same group of pirates to avenge his fathers death. They enter a ship that has a princess on it, but the black pirate decides to help her and escape the ship. Unfortunately, they have him sorted out and things don't look well as the black pirate has to 'walk the plank'.<br /><br />But all ends well when the black pirate survives and saves the day and his princess, who he asks to marry him. Well, you kinda guessed what she's going to answer...<br /><br />Lovely movie looks fantastic in it's restored, colorized version as this is a one to watch for all of you old movie buffs. Go and see for yourself!<br /><br />9/10.
