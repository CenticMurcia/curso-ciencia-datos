Here's a light-hearted frolic of a movie made over 20 yrs ago with the creative blessings of Spielberg. It is an enjoyable and fun movie by no means in the realm of excellence, but a mix of English actors doing a decent job as well as some early ILM and Pixar effects sequences at the time that were pretty high-end. The narration and the boy who played Watson always remind me of Peter Billingsly and A Christmas Story in appearance. Young Sherlock played here pretty well by Nicholas Rowe stands out amongst the others by some degree. The story however seems like a rehashed Indian Jones sort of caper/hybrid. There are some good set pieces, backgrounds, and costumes of late 19th/ early 20th century London. The music is perhaps a bit above average as well. Purchased it cheaply for occasional watching. Worth at least one look, but don't expect a thinking-person's movie. Enjoy it for what it is.
