I really don't know what I expected going into this movie. After all, it's directed by Ruggero Deodato, the genius behind *Cannibal Holocost*. Here's the story in a nutshell: Hess, a rapist/killer, and Radice, his dimwit buddy, are two low-lifes who crash a high society party, and rape, torture, beat and humiliate everyone there.<br /><br />This movie really doesn't have much going for it. Hess is very scummy, and Radice...I don't know what his problem is. The rest of the cast, the victims, are fairly unlikeable, and are very difficult to sympathize with. If you're able to sit through 90 minutes of terribly depressing exploitation, you may enjoy the ending, but I suspect your finger will have pressed "stop" long before then. For Masochists Only.
