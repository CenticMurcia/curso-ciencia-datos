I really do not like being harsh but this movie is awful! I mean sometimes I find at least one good thing to say about a movie but there nothing good to be said about this one. There is a a lot of senseless action in the movie that has no flow, people die needlessly and repeatedly, there is scary music when there is no need for it, importance is placed on certain roles and then they are removed from the movie by being killed off, and the action scenes involving the lead actress is like watching a Barbie doll trying to defend herself. Especially at the end when she plants the ankh in the neck of the woman! It really looks like she does not have the strength to hold the ankh let alone drive it through someone's neck. Also let's not forget how she evades the mummies at the motel. She can play an intellect in front of a camera but someone put this actress in a class that teaches how to act out action scenes. <br /><br />I usually keep a copy of all my movies but not of this one. I am deleting this one just like I deleted Gargoyles by Jim Wynorski.
