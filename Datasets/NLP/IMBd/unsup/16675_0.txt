One of the earliest works of Woody Allen I have seen, well, probably it's because of my age. As this movie is actually much older than me, I'd like to recommend it to anyone who likes sweet, personal and somehow British-like comedy, although I failed to persuade any of my friends to watch it--they think it's just wicked to watch a movie made in 70s which is not famous. Woody is absolutely lovable, I almost choked when watching this movie while I was eating because of uncontrolled laughters, especially the scenes of his first date after the divorce. Diane is very pretty in this movie, although I think now she looks rather cruel when she is serious, but man i liked her dresses so much I hardly noticed her acting (sorry, can't help it as a girl). <br /><br />It's easy to watch, cos' I have to confess I never quite get the greatness of the famous "Anne Hall". If someone from China like me who is still learning English can get this movie, I AM SURE you guys who like the style of Woody Allen, will totally dig it.
