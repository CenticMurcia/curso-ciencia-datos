These reviews are obviously biased in some way. 10 out of 10. Seriously. This is the Godfather of Green Bay not The Godfather. I'm giving it a 1 just to offset you people. This movie is a complete waste of time. It has been said that it takes a miracle to make even a bad film. Well, congrats go out to the makers of this movie. They did perform a miracle. A really pointless, unfunny miracle. I know that it probably was done for a very small budget and it is an independent film, but that doesn't excuse some things. <br /><br />The two main characters that are supposed to be comedians have absolutely nothing funny to say and every attempt at a joke is awkward. The lead, Pete Shwaba, is so wooden. He brings nothing to the screen. How did he get Lauren Holly for this mess. I felt so sorry for her while watching this movie. Of course Mr. Shwaba and her have zero chemistry. Miss Holly, I hope that check cleared. For someone who I am told claims he is a comedian, Mr. Shwaba couldn't deliver a punchline in this movie. The writing is ridiculous. The mac-arena... come on. Doesn't work on any level, kitsch or otherwise. The directing is amateurish at best filled with close-ups and awkward staging. I've used the word awkward twice now, but it sums it up. If you see this movie, beware. You will have that weird feeling in your stomach. It is awkwardness. Awkwardness that you spent money on this experience. Awkwardness about how to leave the theater discreetly. Don't worry. You aren't alone. Everyone else will have it too.
