The stooges are launched into space, land on a distant planet and (after the usual stooge shennanigans, save the world from alien zombies (a young dan "hoss" blocker") The only reason i give this movie a 1 is because that is as low as the ratings go. The stooges in space can be a funny idea, but to pull it off you need THREE stooges, not 2 and the very unfunny Joe Besser. Imagine what Curley could have done with what is politely a bad script. Heck, even shemp or Curley Joe DeRita could have probably salvaged at least a few chuckles. Instead we are subjected to the annoying whinning of Joe Besser. This is a stooge short ( along with just about any other Besser shorts) that even the most die hardstooge fan (and i definitely count myself in that category) could not recommend.
