Could they not find any octogenarian actors to play the teenage roles of Romeo and Juliet? This movie was about as believable as High School Play. I want two hours of my life back.<br /><br />Also, What was that horrible cheesy music being played during the "love scene"? I also the love the juxtaposed images of birds in flight, stars, flowers and streams trying to denote sweet love making!!!<br /><br />I'm watching this movie while I write this and still can't believe this wasn't filmed in jest.<br /><br />My suggestion if you are ever stuck watching it make sure you have a box of Ritz. It's too cheesy to watch without crackers.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert. The movie sucks and they both die in the end.
