Less than awful. My cat produces better viewing fare from his behind without even trying. The people who made this atrocity should compensate viewers for the time lost watching it. It's just BAD film making across the board. Pitiful acting, terrible sound quality, no perceptible direction or production qualities (they must have been drugged out porn capitalists with money to burn) it's hard to believe that there were any professionals involved in this thing at all. Perhaps the makers of this poor excuse for a movie were simply high on their own egos. That would be my best guess. It's the sort of thing I would be embarrassed to find under my name on an internet search. Not even worthy of irony.
