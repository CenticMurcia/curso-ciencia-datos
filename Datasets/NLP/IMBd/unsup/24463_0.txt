If this preposterous dud were concerned with anything like a definable three-dimensional reality, the old lady, Doris Roberts, would have been robbed and murdered within minutes of taking these mutts and Skells into her home.<br /><br />The "homeless" are just that for a *reason*: nobody who ever knew them wants anything to do with them--- where they are not out-&-out psychopaths they are predatory sociopath drunk-addicts who would kill their mothers for their next hit.<br /><br />In fact the term "homeless" is a misnomer: in proper English the "homeless" are those afflicted by some calamity beyond their control:natural disaster---earthquake, flood, fire, etc.--- or war: bombardment, violent civil war, invasion.<br /><br />That's not what's depicted here: these bums---which is what they are---have the behavior code of jackals. They do the first thing that pops into their heads, and they have all got the rap sheets to prove it. Nothing is too low for these lice, they know no limits.<br /><br />Sentimental contraptions like this are a treasure-trove of laughs for grown-up adults with wide-awake minds: These---these *things* are produced in such profusion for a REASON, and infest the schedules of IFC,Sundance,Logo, MTV, BET: All have this much in common as a unifying concept: they are obvious, grindingly predictable sentimental wish-fulfillment slop granting insight and self-awareness to life- forms who have none of either. Their lives---scratch that: *existences* is a more appropriate term---are devoted to Immediate Gratification at an exponential level.<br /><br />This film caters to thin-skinned anxious types who feel sorry about a lot of things and wish the world was different, and have theories and philosophies galore about "justice", "fair play" and---cello and strings here---The Human Condition. That's 70% of the population---they derive succor and self-validation from stuff like this. Scary, no?<br /><br />NOW HEAR THIS: These are the people our parents warned us against, for all the right reasons.<br /><br />TWO STARS for laughs provided---but the heartwarming wise-homeless-guy fairy-tale is getting a bit old now: the current run began in the 80s with DOWN & OUT IN BEVERLY HILLS which was based on a French film of the 1930s, BODOU SAVED FROM DROWNING.
