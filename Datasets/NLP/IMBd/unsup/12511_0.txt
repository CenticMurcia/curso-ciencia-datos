O.K. so this DVD isn't loaded with features and doesn't really have anything but a simple menu, the quality is pretty ropey as well.<br /><br />That's the negatives out of the way.<br /><br />This film is a masterpiece of filth, it's so funny, if you hate the political correctness that we live in today then rush out and buy this. Nothing on this DVD is the slightest bit correct, it's offensive, sexist, disgusting and I'm afraid racist too but it's so outrageous refreshing to hear Peter Cook's vicious wit and Dudley Moores fits of hysterics.<br /><br />Remember to watch out for the Wigins sketch, this is so uncorrect it's unreal but it'll have you rolling.<br /><br />Cooke and Moore produced the best recorded comedy ever, period!
