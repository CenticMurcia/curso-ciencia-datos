this movie is something that you would watch if you have nothing better to do and you are stuck in a baking desert bus stop, with it being your only form of mental stimulation. The comment above is totally wrong. this movie is the same as the 1st and nothing has changed except the actors get worse and the budget is minuscule. Anyone who has seen this movie will agree with me that love when your young does not happen in the way portrayed in this movie. not that it was ever meant to portray a true sense of young love. moreover, the scale on which they portray love and relationships is beyond fairytale proportions which Walt Disney himself could not have conceived. in closing i would not recommend you wasting your valuable time watching this movie. if however, you are stuck in a baking desert bus stop think of this article and laugh as you watch it and say isn't that something.
