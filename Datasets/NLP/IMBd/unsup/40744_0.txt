Jaw droppingly bad. The verbs and adverbs don't exist to describe this utter tripe. I actually feel a little bad reviewing this because I feel I'm only advertising it somewhat...like a lot of people curiosity got the better of me after reading the reviews...I have to say though it's a work of genius from the director to film a LOW low budget film and then come on here and deny he knew what the final cut of the film looked like...that had me on the floor...what great directing that is... The acting is bad to the extent that it simply cannot have been serious. The three girls in it are outgunning each other to see who can play it worse...I give it to the girl with the glasses simply because of the glasses..they just add that bit of unbelievability that clinches it for me...the plot is thinner than Kojack's wig...the script was written by someone clearly drunk...and the score...well...defies belief. The front cover of the DVD bares no resemblance to anything in the movie at all...the killer when revealed looks about as convincing as...well...something not very convincing...all in all a totally ghastly load of rubbish that's worth watching to see how not to make a movie... every single thing that you could do wrong is included in this film. If it is played as a double bluff I might just say well done...if it was filmed as a serious piece I'd be pointing Mr Tapio Kines towards a padded cell, a table, some straps and four electrodes...and even that wouldn't be enough.<br /><br />Regards.
