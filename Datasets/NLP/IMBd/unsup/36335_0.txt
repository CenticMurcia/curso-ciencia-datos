This is the third and final film in Baum's personally produced Oz trilogy of 1914. The three pictures are all essentially the same childishness, with magic, a journey and animal costumes. The camera-work and pacing is static and primitive even by 1914 standards while the performers are quite the opposite, both of which can get annoying and boring. We get poor framing, from a generally stationary position, and the shots linger on much longer than they should, while the performers, except for the literally cold-hearted princess, are in constant motion, mostly broadly gesticulating and doing some knockabout nonsense. Most of it has nothing to do with anything imaginative or with adventure, and I don't see how it could be humorous to anyone but a child. There is some trick photography, but nothing new; in fact, these tricks (superimpositions, stop substitutions, a fish tank between characters and the camera to represent being under the sea, a tilted camera to make them appear to be going up and down stream) had been in use for near a decade or more even by then. At least, the makers of this Oz trilogy put some care and energy, albeit a nauseating excess of it, in front of the camera although not behind it.<br /><br />I wonder how popular these films were, although, apparently, they weren't popular enough because Baum's production company was short lived. There doesn't seem to have been many movies back then which were so specifically targeted at children. The industry at the time, which was even before 'The Birth of a Nation' (1915), was still struggling even to attract middle and upper class women to theatres. Times have certainly changed.
