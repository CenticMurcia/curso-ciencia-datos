This was a great script in the way that it all fell together, it was very natural and generally unpredictable. There were lots of great characters and plenty of strange scenes. You HAVE to understand the lazy "welsh" accent in order to get a lot of the jokes. If you don't know nee 14 means nearly 14 then you might be confused in some parts. The more you understand of this movie's dialogue the more you will appreciate what a cool movie this is. It starts off one way and then becomes a completely different experience, and it's a fun ride the whole way through. I recommend it fully, this movie is unpredictable and weird, a real charmer if you kick back and let it unfold.
