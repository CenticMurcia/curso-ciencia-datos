This movie changed my life in so many ways, that it makes me upset when I read some of the negative reviews of it, declaring it just another "Teen Movie", This is so much more than that, I have read comments by viewers on websites, saying this movie "changed their life" and I cannot agree more, I really think Charlie Talbert is destined for stardom, he is just sensational, but unfortunately, he has never gotten the recgonition, or the parts he deserves, he has so much range as an actor, I definitely think Hollywood should take a closer look at him, and start sending scripts his way, and the rest of the cast is fantastic, This movie is truly a miracle.
