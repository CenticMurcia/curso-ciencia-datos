I liked this movie simply for its imaginative action scenes.hardcore JC fans will eat up the non stop action which only runs at about 82 minutes.It has this terminator/Mad Max kinda feeling to it.Yes there was a lot of rip offs(nailing in the desert)but all are tolerable with a mix of Van Damme and slow motion.The chase and final sequence are great and filled with cool stuff. The speech in the opening sequence was used in the song "Judgement day" by method man,so i know i'm not the only one that scene this.This one opened the door for JC and sci-fi,later he would star in 2 of his best movies Univesal soldier and Timecop(which was critically acclaimed as his best role.)A guilty Van pleasure. Van Damme 7.5/10 Van story 3/10 Van Damage priceless
