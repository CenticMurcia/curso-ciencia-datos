Another stupid slasher film from the 80s. Basically it involves a bunch of idiots at a summer camp (in November!) unwittingly bringing to life a monster who likes axing his victims...or something like that. Who cares? The movie is crap!<br /><br />All the characters are annoying and (with the exception of Gaylen Ross from "Dawn of the Dead") the acting sucks. There are some truly ridiculous scenes--a man gets his head cut off and, a few minutes later, a girl comes by, looks at the bloody headless body and says "Are you OK?"; a couple are making love in a tent--their friends outside tell them to come out--the guy yells "COMING!" etc etc.<br /><br />There are only two highlights here--the death by the hood of a trunk and a nice shot of a guy's butt while going into a hot tub (it's rare you get any male nudity in a horror film). But that's no reason to see this.<br /><br />I saw it at a theatre back in 1982 full of high school students (despite the R rating). They laughed all the way through and thought it was a good comedy! And there's even room for a SEQUEL (which never happened).<br /><br />As it stands it's almost impossible to find a copy of this now--that's a good thing! Avoid.
