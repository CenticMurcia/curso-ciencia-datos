If New York Minute were just that, a minute long it would still be a waste of life. I can't believe Hollywood continues to waste money on making retarded films. Who the hell read/wrote this script and thought it was a good idea? I saw this movie free on HBO and it still felt like I was ripped off. The Olsen Twins should stop making crappy ass movies. Aren't the billions they've made from crappy ass products with their names slapped on it enough? God bless the poor souls who see this movie. The Olsen's are money whores and should be jailed at once. If God really does judge us on things we do on this Earth, well then Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are going straight to hell!
