Loads of criticism has been going around for this movie but allow me to say that this movie is not really for everyone. The feeling and believe in love has to be strong to get into the trance of Saawariya...<br /><br />If you have been in love then after watching this movie you will easily say that this movie is a "Fairy Love Tale". I say this because the characters and their chemistry can make you feel that it is out of the world.<br /><br />The character of 'Saawariya' itself is sketched with such perfection that it can actually make you feel the power of LOVE. It is the way too pure.<br /><br />The songs are so beautifully choreographed that it makes you feel the purity of the Artist, SLB himself. It is indeed a totally new way of making a movie and for me it strengthen the believe that if some one can bring Oscar to Sub Continent then it has to be SLB's art of perfection...<br /><br />Overall, a master piece of SLB. Just don't go to watch it; I request you to FEEL the FEEL of Saawariya!
