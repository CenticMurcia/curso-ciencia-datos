I stumbled in to "The Mind of the Married Man" after HBO had the unmitigated audacity to cancel it, so critiquing the show is pointless post-mortum. Nonetheless, I absolutely love the TMOTMM, and it cuts deeper than practically anything I've seen of late on television, despite the fact that it's a comedy, black as it may be. Tell me, does anyone know where I can get a list of the songs that play in the background during the closing credits? I've heard about five songs that I really like, but I don't know the name of the songs or the artists. (I recognize the Marc Cohn sings the terrific title tune) I think "U2" sings one of them, and, I must confess, I have never jumped on the U2 bandwagon.<br /><br />I think the reason that the TMOTMM didn't make it is because wives wouldn't let their husbands watch it, which is perplexing since husbands don't mind if their wives watch the predictable pretentious, "Sex in the City." Since married Johns didn't watch it, who's left to tune in? I guess I'll have to listen to someone other than Jake to get advice on my marriage.<br /><br />Mark
