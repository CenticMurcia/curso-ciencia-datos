I am not going to sit here and go on yet another tirade on how sub par this 1989 version of Agatha Christie's novel is. We all know! I do not even mind that we have some (albeit CRAZY) fans of this film that think it is a true masterpiece. But the reviewer who wrote "Good Movie" and rated this film 10 stars needs to be thrown in jail, never to see the light of day again.<br /><br />Obviously, there are people on here who do not take movies or these open forums seriously. If you liked the movie, fine. (Actually, I do feel it is much better than the horrendous 1974 version). But 10 stars out of 10!!! Even if this film wasn't based on a classic Christie novel, it would still NEVER, EVER deserve to be garnered with that amount of stars. What do you rate "Gone With the Wind" if you rate this campy, TV movie 10 stars? And to say that it is BETTER than Ms. Christie's novel. That comment made me regurgitate my entire lunch about 5 times. Better than the novel... I could at least respect, if still disagree, if this commentator had said they liked the original film version better than the novel. But this tepid piece that plays like a middle school drama club production? AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!
