OK so I decided to go too blockbuster the other day and get a movie, and remembered Black Dawn was a Seagal movie I had yet to see. So I thought might as well give it a chance, thats if they even carry it. Anyways they had it for sale for 7 dollars. WORST 7 Dollars I have EVER spent.<br /><br />First of all Steven DOES NOT FIGHT AT ALL!!! I think there might be one scene where he throws a karate chop to a guys throat and that is it. A 90 minute movie and he throws one hit.. The rest is all a stunt double (if you get the courage to rent this you will see what I mean) the gun fights were horrible as usual..... Fire off 50 rounds and not hit a single bad guy..... Seagal is also the heaviest he has ever been in this movie. This guy loses weight for some projects and gains it back for other projects..... this one he just looks flat out in bad shape.<br /><br />Anyway from beginning to finish is the worst thing I have ever seen.... My friend wants to watch it with me, and I just don't think I will be able to sit through it again... One thing I will say is, it is good for a real laugh.... seeing the stunt double work and the horrible hair on the stunt double, and the loss of 40 pounds haha its painfully obvious... TERRIBLE MOVIE!!!!
