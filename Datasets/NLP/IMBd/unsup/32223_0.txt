One of Allen's best in my opinion, not all laugh out loud funny, but all smirk enducingly absurd, Burt Reynolds on the inside of the body during sex is my personal favorite. There's also a fifty foot breast, and a Rabbi indulging his fetish of watching his wife eat non-kosher food, and parodies of Italian films, American sc-fi, and games which are pretty spot on.<br /><br />The only slight mis-step in the film or at least something I've always wondered about the "What Is Sodomy?" section? Because in this film Sodomy is synonymous with Beastiality and either Allen is telling some kind of joke about how people know nothing about sodomy and incorrectly identify it, or somebody needs to buy him an anatomy book...actually the scene in question with Gene Wilder (that's Willy Wonka to most) and the sheep he's come to love is priceless. One of Allens best comedies, a minor classic.
