Bad acting, bad camera work, bad set-up, bad story.<br /><br />There isn't much good about this movie, besides that they actually persuaded someone to get in on a DVD and even -export- it abroad.<br /><br />Now, I can take bad acting, camera work, set-up and stories, but what irked me most as a horror-fan, is that For Heaven Sakes; is you are going to use zombies in a film, at least make it believable.<br /><br />My reason for saying that is; how on earth can you kill a zombie by breaking its neck? Have the people making these movies -ever- before watched a horror film before making this atrocity? If you know nothing about a genre, at least try to find out -before- making something. That's one of the basics you learn when you are being taught how to create/design something. If you don't know what it's like, then how on earth can you describe it? I support the movie industry by spending money on movies, instead of downloading them. But in this case; I should have just downloaded it.
