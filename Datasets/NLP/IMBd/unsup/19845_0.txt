I am very sorry if someone did like this movie, but I found it awful. How many % of population would think about this solution if a relationship wouldn't "work" properly? From the beginning to the end. No sense, no logic, no reality. I don' t think that in real life people who find having problems in their relationship should not look for extremely strange solutions for save the relationship. I believe that maybe there are some examples that do that, but not for the same reason. sessions to long without any word or sound. pretty boring. no dynamic. it seems very unreal. I expected much more. actors are OK, their contribution is good as it can be in their role. scenes of sex are difficult for them, they are too young. everything is extended. hard to stay focused because it is not interesting at all. I wanted to watch until the end because of commenting otherwise i wouldn' t.
