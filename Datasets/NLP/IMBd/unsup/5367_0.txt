I was looking forward to watch this film when I knew the local TV station was going to air it because I liked the book. Then I was a bit confused when the 'mother and daughter' tagged along and Gideon and Herbert were nowhere to be seen. Then I couldn't stand it anymore when Pencroft and LeMay ( <--who is this?? ) encountered a giant grasshopper just as they arrived. I turned the TV off. The only similarities to the novel are the title, some of the characters, and the main plot. I do not recommend this film at all. And as I remember there were no 'treasures' or 'monsters' in the island? Lovers of the book would not be satisfied with this adaptation as it is just so different. And I also think that the quality of the acting is not as satisfactory as I would have expected it to be. The novel is turned into a fantasy adventure in this film with all the treasures and monsters ( and not to mention the corny opening. )
