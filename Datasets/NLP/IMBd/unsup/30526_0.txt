In my opinion, Stage Fright is a great film. Like Under Capricorn and Suspicion, Stage Fright is very underrated. Stage Fright focuses on the point of view. We travel with Eve Gill (Jane Wyman) and her father Commodore Gill. We collect what she collects.<br /><br />False Flashback scene is important, because Jonathan (Richard Todd) is trying to convince Eve Gill that he is innocent. Jonathan wants to survive, so he tells the false story to Eve. He knows that it is easy to tell a lie, because they were old friends.<br /><br />It is also False Flashback that is responsible for some of the major events in the film like Alastair Sim (Commodore Gill) putting the blood on the doll to frighten Charlotte (Marlene Dietrich). <br /><br />Jane Wyman, Alastair Sim, Michael Wilding, and Kay Walsh were great. The romantic scene in the car was beautifully acted and beautifully filmed.<br /><br />The MacGuffin in Stage Fright is Doris Tinsdale.<br /><br />In the Car Scene, Michael Wilding (Inspector Wilfred Smith) tells Eve Gill that he and police were looking for Doris Tinsdale. Only the audience, Eve Gill, and her father knows that Doris Tinsdale doesn't exist. Doris Tinsdale is the name Eve Gill used when she started working for Charlotte Innwood (Marlene Dietrich).<br /><br />Its just like "George Kaplan" in North by Northwest. And George Kaplan is one of the MacGuffins in North by Northwest.<br /><br />Marlene Dietrich was alright. Richard Todd's performance in the end makes this film more special. He reminded me of Ivor Novello in Hitchcock's first masterpiece The Lodger and Norman Bates in Psycho.<br /><br />But one of the major plots twists in the film was when Smith tells Gill that Jonathan was acquitted for an earlier murder when he claimed that he killed in self-defense.<br /><br />I liked the way the movie was done. I definitely give this film 9 out of 10.
