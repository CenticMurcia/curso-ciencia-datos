I have been a Robert Duvall fan for many years now so when this movie showed up on my DVR I naturally watched it. The beginning was pretty much what i expected but then the tango was introduced along with the beautiful dancing of Luciana Pedraza. It was then that the movie made a turn and the wonderful tango dancing became the high point of the film. Not only can this women dance like no other but she has a natural way of delivering her lines that was simply mesmerizing. The scene in the restaurant when Duvall asks if he was younger could he have a chance with her was priceless. I can only wonder why Luciana Padraza has not been seen since.<br /><br />David Glatt
