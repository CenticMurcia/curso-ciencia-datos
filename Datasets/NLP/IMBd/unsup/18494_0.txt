This is a delightful movie. The concept, REALISTICALLY speaking, is ridiculous. Of course it is!<br /><br />So trying to rationalize how Johnny could have met up with Samantha and gotten her to fall in love with him, or how Johnny and his mother could exist in a little "bubble" of the 1920s is counterproductive. Take this film without questioning it too deeply... suspend your disbelief.<br /><br />If you can manage that, you will discover this to be a charming little film that is well worth watching.<br /><br />The period language, dancing and music were a real treat.
