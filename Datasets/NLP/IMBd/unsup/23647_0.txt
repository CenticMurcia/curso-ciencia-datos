My first impression of The Unknown was made within the first ten minutes of the movie. There is an old quotation: "A picture is worth a thousand words." This movie is a tribute to this quote. Being as how my previous experience with silent movies was spotty at best, I was impressed with how the actors portraying Alonzo, Nanon and Malzabar were able to effectively use nonverbal communication in order to get their points across to one another. Although the cast itself was small and a couple instances of plot lines were a bit iffy, the movie still kept me in anticipation of what was coming next. The Unknown combined the elements of romance, mystery, tragedy and suspense quite nicely to make a picture that would in my opinion still be worth watching even today. The only change that I would make is have the actors speak instead of having words projected onto the screen. Another modification I would make is to perhaps change a piece of score or two. Otherwise, a wonderful film and great example of how less can be more in the film industry.
