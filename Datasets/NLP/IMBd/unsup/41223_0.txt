this movie corrupted all that was good about the hobbit.<br /><br />the music was frightening.<br /><br />the script was a product of too many late nights of white lining.<br /><br />it gives you a brief, misleading summary that not even a child could enjoy.<br /><br />at least it is better than Ralph Bakshi's LOTR.<br /><br />apologies to those who actually finished watching the movie.
