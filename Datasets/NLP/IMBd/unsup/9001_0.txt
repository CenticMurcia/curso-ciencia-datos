I had never even hear of City of Ember, but when my mother asked my husband and I to go see it I decided to go. I was not expecting this at all! City of Ember was a wonderful movie! I can see how people who have read the books are giving this bad reviews. With any movie that comes from a book there will have to be some changes, even if just for the fact of editing for time. After seeing City of Ember I couldn't wait to get to the store to buy the books! I'm glad that this movie had this effect on me and will probably inspire others to do the same. Instead of criticizing how the movie doesn't follow the book as much as you believe it should, you should just enjoy the film for what it is and then you can re-read with new visuals to think of!
