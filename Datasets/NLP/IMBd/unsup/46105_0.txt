This is simply awful. A load of sloppy dildo-humor and incoherent lines of dialog. The movie lacks definite focus to a point where you wonder if the film ever had a script, the ending is by far the most idiotic resolution I have ever seen. Stay away, or you might have nightmares; this movie is simply the definition of a "failed comedy" film... The acting is decent and the directing is OK, but this does not save it from being extremely painful to watch, I would rather burn alive than see this piece of crap again. The obvious targeted costumer here is a middle aged Swedish old lady who thinks movie like "Shindlers list" and "The Godfather" is too serious and violent. Conclusion: Swedish films generally suck. I know, I'm a swede.
