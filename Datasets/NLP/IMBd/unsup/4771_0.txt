This movie is well made and well acted, its set in 1965 and the style of this period is captured perfectly. There is no blood, gore or boobs, despite the setting been base at a girls school. In one scence, a girl hangs herself, yet no-one around her, acts to help her, were they either fleeing or looking at her corpse hanging there. In another scence, a lone police officer is busy searching for missing girls, yet strange enough, when he is killed, it seems he is not missed at all. <br /><br />Its great to see a well made horror story with a good budget with good actors, instead of the poorly made backyard jobs you see littering the selves at the local video store.
