This movie was stupid and boring. I noticed that whenever Sofia VERGARA comes out in a movie, it is usually not a big hit. She really needs to enroll in some acting lessons. I think she needs to improve her English because her accent makes it very difficult to understand what the heck she is saying. I think she should stick to making calendars; the only thing she knows to do best. I remember when this movie first came out, it only lasted two weeks and it was directly sent to the dollar movies like a bullet. That is so embarrassing. The main problem is that now a days, people choose an actor according to their physical beauty. Many do not keep in mind that beauty and acting skills are two totally different things that should not be confused when choosing a great actor.
