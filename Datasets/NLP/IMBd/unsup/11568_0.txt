"Death on the Nile" is a most entertaining crime and mystery story based on one of Agatha Christie's Hercule Poirot novels in her classic "who did it?" style. But besides the plot this movie was filmed in beautiful and real Egyptian locations that make a great and unusual atmosphere all around. As usual in the "Queen of Mystery"'s plots some events occur too coincidentally perfect so that impossible situations and alibis become possible for the story's sake, but this was Miss Christie's trade mark and no doubt that she had a great imagination and skill to make most interesting and "catching" plots in the genre.<br /><br />Though Peter Ustinov doesn't fit physically with Chrisitie's description of her Belgium talented detective (a sort little insignificant man, bald and with an egg shaped head), Peter Ustinov has managed to be identified with the character with his classy and skillful acting. The usual star's cast playing the suspects that distract our attention in this one has the always reliable David Niven, the great Bette Davis, Mia Farrow, George Kennedy, Jane Birkin, Jack Warden, Jon Finch, Olivia Hussey and a magnificent Angela Lansbury (as usual). Lois Chiles is the spoiled rich heiress that is murdered under strange circumstances (she looks for it all the time).<br /><br />In my opinion and along with "Evil Under the Sun" this film stands among the best in Miss Chrsitie's novels movie versions. Don't miss it if you like the genre.
