I met Randy Quaid many years ago, when I was bartending at a bar in Toronto. I was surprised to see how very tall he was, and felt a little nervous around someone with so much physical presence. Truth is, he's a pussycat. But not in this film! Mr Quaid's presence is massive, and I mean that in the best way. His laconic Aussie is frightening from his first entry into this two-hander, and he ably sustains that looming, brooding character right through to the end of the film. Along with Jay Baruchel, another terrific actor born to play this role, the pressure begins with our initial encounter of hit-man and loser, and never lets up. I have to say that I'm glad that I saw this film, and the level of acting showcased - with major props to Jayne Eastwood, a Canadian acting legend, whom I've followed for decades - should be mandatory viewing for aspiring actors/actresses who want to see what a great actor can do with a great role, and the right acting chops. As an aside, the soundtrack of mainly Canadian musical stars of the 70's adds a melancholy, nostalgic feel to the experience. Amongst the musicians showcased are the Jive Five ("What Time is It?"); Abraham's Children ("Goodbye, Farewell"); LightHouse ("One Fine Morning); The Stampeders ("Sweet City Woman"); Chilliwack ("Fly by Night"); Trooper ("Two for the Show"); and The Tragically Hip ("Scared"). Also used to great effect are Nilssen's ("Without You") and a taste of Erik Satie's "Gymnopedies #1". This film will make you think. It may make you reconsider what 'luck' is. And it may make you see your world a little differently than it looked at the beginning of the day. To quote Ruben's character (Quaid); "Actually walking away at the right moment - how often do we do that?"
