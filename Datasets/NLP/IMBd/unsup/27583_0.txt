i don't know what everyone has against this movie. sure, it isn't the best thing i have ever seen and probably won't win any academy awards, but still...the return of the crocodile dundee character was wonderful. linda kozlowski has been missed from the big screen as well. what great great performances husband and wife played in their recurring roles. i urge anyone and everyone to go see this movie.<br /><br />
