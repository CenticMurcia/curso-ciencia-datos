If you've seen enough Abbott and Costello movies, then you should know that the actual plot is unimportant; the whole movie is really just an excuse for Bud and Lou to get into embarrassing situations and be silly. You'd better believe that they do that in "Buck Privates". They play a pair of street vendors who inadvertently end up in the army. To make matters worse, their drill sergeant is the cop who went after them. Once on the military base, Abbott tries to be serious, while Costello somehow manages to do everything wrong, often incurring their drill sergeant's wrath.<br /><br />Aside from Abbott's irritation and Costello's gaffs, there's some extra entertainment by the Andrews Sisters, as they sing "Boogie Woogie Boy in Company B", among other songs. But like I said, the whole movie is really all about Costello making a mess of everything.<br /><br />Just how many movies can there be about some goof-ball joining the army and raising Cain?
