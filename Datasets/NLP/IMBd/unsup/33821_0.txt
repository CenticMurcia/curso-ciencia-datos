Some little green men (I'm not kidding) from outer space invade a small town. Good thing the "teenagers" (all of them obviously in their 20s) are out to get them! <br /><br />I saw this on TV when I was about 13 or 14 and loved it. I distinctly remember the crawling hand scaring me. Now, over 20 years later, I hated it! It has some atmospheric scenes, but... The plot is laughable even by 1950s standards..."little green men"! Ha ha. The acting is horrible...look at the cast...all unknowns (deservedly) who remained unknowns! The "special" effects are mind boggling--they are so BAD!!!!! The aliens look funny, not scary and, I swear to God, I saw the wires pulling the "crawling" hand! This isn't even bad/good--it's too boring for that. Young kids (VERY young kids) might like it, but it's too boring for adults. A waste of time.
