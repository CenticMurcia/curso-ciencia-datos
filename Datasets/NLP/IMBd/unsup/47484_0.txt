Released in August of 2002, the Touch cannot receive good comment from critics and audience. Although Peter Pau got his first Oscar for wonderful cinematography, his direction skill is not ripe enough. We've got great views from the adventure movie, but a common story and terrible effects. The story has a few logical problems and the fighting need more edition, although I understand Michelle had practiced hard for her own film. It is also odd to Asian audience that all the Chinese in this movie speak fluent English. It could be quite entertaining, but please don't treat your dear audience as fools.
