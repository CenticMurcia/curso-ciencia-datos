I screened Dreamer: Inspired by a True Story on August 23rd in Washington DC. This beautiful film, a Truly Moving Picture, teaches children that they can achieve their goals despite any obstacles that may stand in their way.<br /><br />Set in Lexington, Kentucky, this is a story about perseverance and empowerment in the face of hardship. Cale Crane (Dakota Fanning) dreams of having a race horse on her father's farm again. Although the family does not have enough money to purchase a new horse, Cale's father Ben Crane (Kurt Russell) acquires an injured racehorse named Sonador, the Spanish word for "dreamer." <br /><br />The story that ensues encourages all children to reach high. Despite their economic setbacks, everyone on the Crane farm believes that they can nurse Sonador back to health. Although there are age and cultural differences among the family members and farm workers, they all find inspiration in Cale's unwavering determination. While working towards the goal of healing their injured horse, broken relationships within the family are healed.<br /><br />In addition to providing an inspirational message, this film also succeeds in vividly depicting a rural lifestyle in which horses and people are closely connected. Children who view this movie can learn about the deep bonds between animals and humans.<br /><br />Because of the positive messages this film exudes, it has been chosen as the upcoming featured film for a new joint project between the National Collaboration for Youth and Heartland Truly Moving Pictures. The exciting project, F.I.L.M. (an acronym for "Finding Inspiration in Movies and Literature") includes a three step process in which children screen select films, use activity guides for each film, and then partake in service learning projects.
