Hollywood needs to take notes - this movie was great. Excellent plot, dialogue, acting, a perfect blend. This movie is about the lives of 3 families living in an apartment complex. Right off the bat, you can tell they are all unhappy - merely surviving and going along with their daily tasks. **SPOILER** When the son suffers a heart attack, it transforms the relationship within the family unit and also tightens the bond with the neighbours/friends.<br /><br />This movie was an emotional rollercoaster - laughter, compassion, happiness - life's twists and turns.<br /><br />The ending was perfect - it was not the average hollywood 'Happily Ever After' scenario, but you just had that feeling that they would be okay. I especially loved the fact that there were not too many characters, but we got to understand them and were able to laugh and sympathize with them.<br /><br />Great - I loved Neville!
