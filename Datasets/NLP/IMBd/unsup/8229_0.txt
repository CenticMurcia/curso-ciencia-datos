One of the scariest movies I have ever seen. Absolutely bone-chilling! Makes 'Paranormal Activity' look like the cheap piece of garbage it was.<br /><br />The acting and editing sells the story as a real documented paranormal experience with all the twists and turns needed to keep it's audience on their toes, gripping their seat.<br /><br />Somewhere between an episode of 'Unsolved Mysteries' & 'The Blair Witch Project.'<br /><br />An original new look at the way ghost stories can be told. Just try and watch it alone! Lake Mungo is almost too creepy!!
