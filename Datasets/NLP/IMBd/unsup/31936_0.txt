The Secret of the Sword movie first introduced us to She Ra. I have not seen this movie for years, but I can still remember it. He Man and She Ra have and will always be my favorite cartoons ever. The best part about this movie is how He Man must battle the forces of Hordak, in order to save his sister Adora from beign one of Hordak's puppets. My favorite part is when He Man gets captured by Hordak and is chained up in Hordak's castle. Adora comes into the room and is confronted by the Sorceress. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to enjoy the magic of the cartoons they remember from when they were kids. Todays kids would not even now who He Man and She Ra. Lets hope they one day return to TV so kids can see what a real cartoon is.
