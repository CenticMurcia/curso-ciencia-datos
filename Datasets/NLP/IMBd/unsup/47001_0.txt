Andrew Bergman wrote and directed this very dry comedy about the fear of marriage. Alter-shy Nicolas Cage, in Las Vegas ostensibly to marry girlfriend Sarah Jessica Parker, instead winds up in winner-take-all poker game with wealthy James Caan, a slick gambler who eventually wins the hand of Cage's lady. Nutty comedy relies on stray eccentricities to put it over, but aside from the three leads, nothing about this scenario is very interesting. Cage--encouraged to overact--mugs for laughs, while the finale (with the flying Elvis-impersonators) was used as the film's sole advertising gimmick. Bergman isn't desperate, he's just relentlessly uninventive. *1/2 from ****
