This movie rocks, especially if you update the music a bit, and why not when Silent accompanists just adapted the standards of their day? All of Lloyd's '20s films are good, but this one is up there with "Safety Last" and "Why Worry?" and it might even be better. It's nicely paced and the writers put in a wide variety of gags. Cultural historians who want to know what a Vamp and a Flapper were need look no further than this film. (A bit with the Mary-Pickford type got cut, but you can still see some of her as the third town girl in the opening scenes.) <br /><br />Lloyd's nebbishy everyman has been reworked many times, not least by Woody Allen. But this everyman could do stunts. He does most of the tricks in this one. The big chase at the end is a feat of invention, daring, and humor. In "Safety Last" Lloyd got the comedy through timing; in this one he gets it from kinetic invention. What he goes through to get the girl makes the kid in "The Graduate" (which rips off this film) look like a putz by comparison, and the girl (Jobyna Ralston) is funnier and cuter. <br /><br />Also of interest are many scenes from pre-freeway L.A. The old streetcar system is used in the chase. The climax was shot at Harold's own house. <br /><br />This is one of the rare Silents that can be recommended to people who hate the idea of watching a Silent.
