The Extra is about a man seeking fame through acting. He wants to be an actor but can only secure roles as extras. He wants to dine with the ladies and get attention. Jimeoin is 'The Extra' as his name isn't mentioned throughout the whole movie. I understand the quote on all the billboards and things now... 'No one knew his name, they still don't'. The storyline isn't that great. It wasn't as interesting as I expected, especially with all the top notch Australian actors. (Rhys Muldoon, Shaun Micallef, Bob Franklin) I was hoping for a little more humour as it's called a 'Romantic/Comedy'. I think I only laughed about 2 times; when he kicks a door and it hits back into him, and Russell Gilbert, the cameraman and his crossed eyes. Last year I went to the filming of 'The Extra', as an extra, and I was excited to see the film. But honestly I thought it was a waste of time and money because it just got boring! Jimeoin's a funny man, I was expecting a lot more humour and it's not what I got. He was the writer of the story and I'll say that his ability to write movies isn't that crash-hot. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this as a good film to watch.
