Sorry to say, but I just got through watching 160 minutes of pure garbage. What an awful movie. There was absolutely no plot at all. The movie was just one bad musical performance after another. There was no story, the characters were not developed at all, the acting was bad, and each scene had nothing to do with the next. Want me to go on? I can't believe that this movie is actually considered a classic. I gave it a 1 rating and I was being generous. Avoid at all costs
