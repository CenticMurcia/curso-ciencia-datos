I spent 3 weeks in France on a foreign exchange/home-stay program and happened to see this film. I was only a second-year french student, but despite the language barrier, I laughed.. SO HARD.. at that movie. I'm sure my host family thought I had lost it. This is one of those movies you wipe the tears from your eyes after laughing so hard about. I'd give my right arm for a DVD of it. It brings to mind a sort of Inspector Cleauseau funniness. These kids are horrible pranksters, and the things they came up with don't quite hit you until the prank is pulled off. All in all, its just a fantastic movie. I wonder if I'll ever see it again...
