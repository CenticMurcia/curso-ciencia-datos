"Mortal thoughts" is the kind of picture from which I never saw a good critic from, but God what a movie it is! The acting is superb from the beginning till the end. The story is about Cynthia (Demi Moore) and Joyce (Glenne Headly). Both are married and where as Cynthia has a workaholic as a husband, Joyce has to fill her hours with a swine, superb played by Bruce Willis who is swearing, fighting, sniffing and talking about sex during the whole movie. But the fun doesn't last long as he got killed.... But the question is : who did it? Demi Moore or Glenne Headly? And the question to that is what the film is all about, done in interogationstyle by cop Harvey Keitel. Demi Moore tells her story with flashbacks and bit by bit we know more about the history...and believe us, the plot is totally different from what is supposed to be in the beginning. Great art? Perhaps not, in fact it surely isn't but all the characters are played with tons of style (you will always remember the presence of Bruce Willis here). Sole thing which makes us wonder is who the hell was responsible for the clothes....it's made in 1991 but all we see are Duran Duran, Cyndi Lauper-haircuts...and Demi Moore looks awful in her stonewashjeans! But brilliant picture that is....
