This is clearly one of the dumbest films I 've ever seen and surely the dumbest I've seen this year and that's only because I haven't seen any Uwe Boll disaster so far this year. I'm pretty sure a real zombie would have made a better movie than Rod Zombie did. The story is completely laughable, the characters...well...what characters, there's no suspense and there are only lame shocks and so on. With the exception of the make-up FX everything else was just uninteresting and unbelievably boring and annoying. By the way, I'm sorry for Karen Black for having to make films like this to make a living. And to the director of this abomination I can only say: Welcome in Uwe Boll territory, Mr. Zombie.
