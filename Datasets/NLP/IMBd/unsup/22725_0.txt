Most of the time, 99.9% of the time, I find comedy embarrassing and corny. No doubt this is because comedy is the hardest thing to do. Therefore if it is so hard, a lot of people are going to fail. And a lot of people do. You need to be intelligent to really be funny. Once again not many people are all that smart either. To give you an idea of some things I find funny: I like David Letterman but not Jay Leno. Find South Park and the Simpsons amusing and think 'The Office is one of if not the funniest things on television ever. In my opinion 'Live In Concert' is the greatest stand up comedy performance of all time. Add this to the list of things you MUST see. Pryor has got it all, voice and the way he uses it, facial expressions, acting ability, intelligence. One of the best things I notice about his style is that you are never aware when he has moved on to the next joke. The transitions between jokes are as good as the jokes themselves. This is something that the best speakers have, the ability to move from one topic to the next so that the listener is not aware of the transition. This is achieved by the speakers ability to relate topics.
