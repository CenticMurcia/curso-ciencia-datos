I'm not sure if this was supposed to be a horror drama or a comedy. They did so much editing - poorly - that it's hard to tell what they had in mind. In the version I saw on DVD, it appears there was a lot of stuff cut out which may have explained what the heck was going on. As one viewer said, it's hard to differentiate the heroes from one another as individuals. They also throw in way too much martial arts just for the sake of showing action. If you want to make a martial arts movie, than don't try to be a spooky picture at the same time. The two just don't blend well - at least this time!<br /><br />I thought the oriental take on the vampire theme was interesting and had hopes that there would be some chilling moments, but when even the undead are flying through the air throwing kicks, it's just cheesy. Don't even get me started on the crappy monster designs. Go back to the drawing boards fellas, you've got potential. You've also got a whole other aspect of monsters in Asia that Americans are not familiar with from your own mythology. And I don't mean Godzilla.
