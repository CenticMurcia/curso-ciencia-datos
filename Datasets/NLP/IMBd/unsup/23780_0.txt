Drivel about a couple of (admittedly hot) sisters and their stepsister who inherit an old motel out in the middle of nowhere. The stepsister arrives early to check out the place, and is violently attacked, and then thrown into a lake and drown. The two sisters arrive the next day with friends of theirs and begin the usual fun-in-the-sun activities by the lake, but when two of their number disappear and they go looking for them, they find them dead, hanging from a tree. They are then the targets of a couple of inbred hicks who apparently are distant relatives of these girls, and are trying to "keep it in the family", so to speak. <br /><br />Scenes and ideas lifted from Friday the 13th, The Hills Have Eyes, Motel Hell, Mother's Day, etc. thrown randomly about, but this movie is without any charm or style of its own. The inbred hicks, the lakeside setting, the bad cop, the elderly mother who's responsible for nearly everything are all present and accounted for, but it's all shown here with little enthusiasm or style, so what we're left with is a veritable checklist of horror movie clich√©s with only a few brief scenes of any real suspense or creativity. <br /><br />It's well photographed, and I liked when the guy beat one of the killers over the head with a wooden chair while he was still tied to it, and a couple of other scenes, but as soon as the movie would come to life, it would quickly fall back into a familiar predictable pattern of said earlier movies in the very next scene. The two inbred killers look like mechanics in need of a shower and shave, nothing more. So no effect was put into their makeup, that aspect ended up being very unconvincing. The climax wasn't very memorable either, as the film makers completely screwed up the killing of the bad cop, we don't even see it on screen, nor do we find out if the antihero survives or not. Kelsey Wedeen is cute and likable and always fun to watch, but she can't carry this entire movie by herself. <br /><br />*1/2 out of ****
