...or if you got the tickets free. I'm not sure if it is worthwhile even then. The first half is such a drag that I thought 2 hours has passed whereas in reality it was just an hour. There were really unnecessary sentiment building scenes where these 3 jokers try to almost kill the kid and then turn in a new life just like that. And after that they all behave like a bunch of teenage girls who're all gaga about the kid. There is some tasteless so called "humor" scenes to introduce a kid into a bachelor household. There are stupid songs slipped in between for no reason at all. There is nothing new to look forward to from this movie. The story as everyone knows is a horrible variation of the original Trois hommes et un couffin which was hollywooded into 3 men and a baby.<br /><br />The second half has some good scenes by Akshay kumar but not worthy enough to be called as "Saving grace". The kid is cute no doubt.<br /><br />It's been quite sometime since I've been to a movie and felt the need to advice people to stay away if possible.
