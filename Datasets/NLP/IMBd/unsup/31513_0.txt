Somewhere in "Gloomy Sunday", instead of a distant dream, love triangle could be so harmonious as to be possible.<br /><br />As I put it like this, there's no intention to protest against "one-on-one relationship", just can't help saying- kudos on Rolf Schubel!<br /><br />With a somewhat experimental modos operandi, "Gloomy Sunday" does add a more humanely layer which diversifies the definition of love and human relationships. Such love is definitely unwordly and beautiful- second to none as well.<br /><br />However,here comes the realism catch- no man could ever conquer envy(I refer to Andras), which accompanied by fragility, resulted in his self-destruction. It's also an artist's perfectionism to blame. Otherwise, he could have survived to keep Ilona's company. <br /><br />The triple binds each to each with pure(Ilona), kindness(Lazlo), and beauty(Andras). Just as a perfect blend of touching story, melody and scenery shown in the film.
