I used to watch this show at my grandma and grandpa's house when I was a child. I used to believe it was "real" but when I was older I realized it was not. It tackled some controversial topics, however, and I would like to view some of these episodes again. Here are the episodes I can remember.<br /><br />* An episode that dealt with two boys who had played blood brothers and one had HIV/AIDS.<br /><br />* An episode where a young man took the courtroom hostage and the judge talked him down explaining that he knew what it felt like to be shot, in a war I believe. If memory serves, the young man turned the gun on himself, but never went through with the act.<br /><br />* An episode involving a child supposedly bearing the mark of the beast.<br /><br />I am sorry I can not remember more.<br /><br />If you happen to come across this small gem, check it out. It's not top notch by any standards, but the topics discussed were pretty deep, especially for 1980's daytime TV. Peace.
