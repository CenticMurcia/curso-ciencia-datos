This film has the carry oners on holiday at a caravan park. Immediately, you get the feeling you've been here before. I tried to like this film, but I just didn't find it very funny. I found the humor somewhat forced and obvious, which you expect, but they have in the past still made it fresh. The silly factor is major here, which normally is fine, but it doesn't work here. The jokes are here, but it wasn't the kind of film where they are many and, again, they seem forced. I would recommend other Carry On films before this, many of them. Not horrible, and there are some amusing moments, but not up to their usual standard.
