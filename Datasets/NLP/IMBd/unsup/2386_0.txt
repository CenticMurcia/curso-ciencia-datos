Spirited and supremely sexy Sondra Currie is Lacey Bond, a tough lady cop assigned to bust a crime wave perpetrated by women. The ringleader is aged Maude (Elizabeth Stuart), who happens to have a much younger boy toy (Phil Hoover). And Lacey has her own love interest in Lt. Frank Mitchell (Tony Young).<br /><br />Enjoyable drive-in action flick definitely has its moments. It gets off to a lively start with a prison break sequence. It also has its fair share of cat fights, and we even get to see Ms. Currie wipe the floor with the almighty William Smith, who plays a karate instructor. Action scenes are fairly well done; at least there are some good vehicle stunts. The supporting cast is full of attractive young ladies, and the story is pretty straightforward and entertaining. Currie is an engaging lead, even if she's not that much of an actress. She does look like she's enjoying herself. Stuart and Hoover are very amusing in the villain roles; Hoover even bares his backside at one point.<br /><br />It's true that this film comes up short in the sleaze department. There's not that much in terms of sex or nudity, but it's still an entertaining film. Exploitation veterans Wes Bishop (who also appears on screen as Raymond) and Lee Frost (who plays a Catalina attendant) keep it moving and keep it interesting. I certainly wouldn't consider it boring. As action flicks go, it does its job. And it's also got Jeanie "T.N.T. Jackson" Bell along for the ride, so that's worth something.<br /><br />7/10
