Godzilla vs Hedorah is one of the Godzilla films from the Showa Series that I never thought was one of the best.<br /><br />Godzilla battles Hedorah in this one. Hedorah is basically made up of pollution. He goes through a metamorphosis in his life starting off as little tadpole like creatures, turns into a lizard like form with four legs, then becomes a flying saucer like form, and finally an upright walking form that is taller than Godzilla. He has the ability to change into his saucer like form and can shoot laser beams out of his head. I really just was not that impressed with Hedorah. Just a pollution monster, not my favorite type. I guess the message of this film is that if you do not watch out and not pollute, then the result could be a giant monster made of pollution.<br /><br />Godzilla looks like he did in Destroy All Monsters and Godzilla's Revenge(in the non stock footage parts). I guess this costume is OK, I just think that Godzilla has too short of a tail and looks like a person kind of. Godzilla comes to save Japan, so he is a good guy. He gets help from the army, really odd. But not as odd as Godzilla flying around in this film using his radioactive breath. Yeagh, Godzilla flies in this film using his radioactive breath. That was something that they should have left out. Ridiculous.<br /><br />Basically pollution is a problem. The whole film is dark because of the pollution problems. THey really send the message that Pollution is bad and you should not pollute. So this is really like a documentary on not polluting.<br /><br />Monster action leaves a little to be desired. There is a lot of standing around done by Godzilla as well as Godzilla constantly rubbing his nose at Hedorah. This left me a little confused. Also the scenes with Hedorah can be disgusting. Shoots mud like sludge that makes a mess everywhere. Also Godzilla digs into Hedorah pulling out a few white balls that I guess are eggs or something. So this Godzilla film definitely has the most disgusting and disturbing scenes. <br /><br />SO this film is not one of my favorites. Hedorah is not that good of a monster, Godzilla Flies, and overall this is one that I really do not recommend.
