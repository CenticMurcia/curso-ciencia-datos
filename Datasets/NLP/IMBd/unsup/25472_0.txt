I know for a fact this was SHOT on £3,000 which is nothing and parts had to be dubbed and done again costing £7,000 in total. The whole story and idea of it is a pretty damn good one, the dialogue is not brilliant in places, but it is a good film tho. Not the best film obviously, but i liked it. It shows what can be done with feck all money. The acting isn't great, but you cant afford top actors when you have no money, the actors conveyed the story well enough to be watched. Uri geller....foock man what the hell....oh well. The film was not a Hollywood multimillion dollar project, it was a few thousand pounds shot on 16mm, so you cant expect the best things ever from it. Its not a bad film none the less. If you like your small budget Indy style films, and know what to expect from them then you will be a lot less critical about this film than others. Not really a scary film, some bits may make you jump, but it needs a little bit of thinking to understand the film properly, but it is good don't get me wrong. Mr Roberts new film forest of the damned is supposed to be a huge jump from this one. I am looking forward to it muchly. And I hear from certain sources that the film in the works station 13 is going to be much much bigger budget and will be one to really look out for. Watch this film, and bare in mind it was shot on almost nothing, and is a quite early attempt at film making by the director(s) watch the other newer films and watch the progression. wow i wrote a lot.
