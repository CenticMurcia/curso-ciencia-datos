God will forgive them etc..., This is the best line in any film i have ever seen from the very outset of the film you have no doubt that Richard (Paddy Considine) is uncompromising in his attitude towards revenge . I live in this area of England and the stark grey images combined with the lush green fields work fantastically well on film , the characters are your everyman types that everyone knows or knows of in their town .It shows the dark under belly of small towns in central England , its stark imagery doesn't glorify violence in the way usually associated with this type of film . The characters that Richard reeks his revenge on are likable in there own way and comedic at times , i think thats the winning formula you don't hate the characters and want to see them die but you don't mind that they must .Its a fine balance that most films don't manage to achieve , all in all its one of the best revenge flicks i have seen in years . Paddy Considine plays an excellent anti hero who you sympathise and empathise with in equal amounts knowing all the time what he is doing is lawfully unacceptable but morally just . Altogether a fantastic film with an excellent engaging storyline , its not 'Hollywood' so will have its critics but its a step in the right direction for British film .
