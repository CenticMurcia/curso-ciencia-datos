It almost hurts to say that because of the fact that it is a remake, but it's true. With so many horror films being remade we lose the flavor of the original but the essence of the original is still here in this flick. With so many people from the first film being involved with the remake it's easy to just label it as an "update".<br /><br />I find the characters to have a lot more depth in the remake. The zombies have more of a vacant sadness and the setting is a lot creepier. This is one film out of only a handful that I find truly scary, even to this day. It definitely stands the test of time and is bound to be just as much of a cult classic film as the original.<br /><br />Not taking anything away from the original which is definitely a masterpiece. George Romero has gone above and beyond any other horror director in cinema history and Tom Savini is a welcome addition to the zombie tradition (now if he would just get back in the director's seat).<br /><br />If you're looking for a fun, scary, thrill ride of a movie, look no further. Tony Todd and Patricia Tallman give the most memorable performances of their respective careers and Romero and Savini come through like a horrorcane and deliver the greatest horror film ever conceived.<br /><br />With today being Halloween, this is my pick for a great creepy movie to watch on this Day of the Dead 2005.
