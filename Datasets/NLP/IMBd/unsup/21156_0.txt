Legend of the Demon Womb is one Japanese animated feature which is far too stupid, ridiculous, and removed from reality to be either offensive or misogynistic. In the movie's infamous beginning scene, a cyborg Nazi mad scientist operates a monstrous "death rape machine" for a bizarre Satanic ritual in which naked women are hooked up to a gigantic engine and systematically raped with metallic dildos over and over again until they climax in a final orgasm of death - to summon a demon from another dimension called the Evil King to Earth! Years later that scenario is replayed again, but conducted by the late scientist's now grown son who has become an evil sorcerer. STUPID enough for you? This is a continuation of the first film, Legend of the Overfiend while bearing little in actual continuity (wasn't the earth being destroyed at the end of the first one?). But like the first one, the graphic depictions of demonic rape is rampant throughout, but now with mechanical rape added on. Graphic violence, blood, and gore is generously splashed across the screen. This film belongs to a category of adult anime called "erotic grotesque" in which sex and violence are combined and played out to the most absolute mind numbing and shocking extreme. We basically get a front row seat to view the twisted sexual perversions of Satanists, demons, man-beasts, and other supernatural beings. The film is beautifully animated, insanely imaginative, and incredibly disgusting. Storywise, this film is like the fevered wet dream of a perverted lunatic. To sum it up, Legend of the Demon Womb is a lot of extremely ridiculous, sadistic, soft core porno nonsense in the guise of fantasy anime, but basically harmless if viewed by sane adults (as it should be).
