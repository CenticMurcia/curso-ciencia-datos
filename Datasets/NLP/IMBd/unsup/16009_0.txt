Martin Scorsese is always going to be remembered for his gangster pictures and his collaborations with Robert de Niro. However, people shouldn't think that Scorsese's talent ends there. With this bizarre and unique production, he proves himself to be a dab hand at the jet black comedy.<br /><br />Griffin Dunne is excellent as a New York businessman who hits on a girl in a restaurant. The girl (Rosanna Arquette) invites him on a date, but when he gets there he finds that she lives in a really seedy district of town, sharing an apartment with a flirtatious female sculptor (Linda Fiorentino). One thing after another begins to go wrong and Dunne decides to ditch his date and go home. But fate conspires to muck-up his evening, and try as he might he just can't seem to get out of this crazy neighbourhood.<br /><br />Dunne's misadventures begin to resemble something from a violent. modern day uurban version of Alice in Wonderland. The people he meets are increasingly wacky or unhinged, and the situations into which he stumbles range from outlandish to nightmarish to life threatening. Throughout, this film is a deliberately oddball affair. Most of the time it is too disturbing to pass for an all-out comedy, but it remains compeeling thanks to its edgy script which never allows you to guess what is coming next. The pace seems deceptively slow on the first screening, but on repeated viewings it becomes clear that not a moment nor line is wasted, and that every little action links to something yet to occur or something that has already passed. After Hours is an accomplished and memorable film.... not to be missed.
