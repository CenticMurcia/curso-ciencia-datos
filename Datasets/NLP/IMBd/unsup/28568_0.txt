Enzo Castellari's B movie "Quel maledetto treno blindato" is nowadays probably most recognizable because its English title "The Inglorious Bastards" inspired the title of Quentin Tarantino's 2009 movie. Castellari's movie contains a similar plot, with American GIs killing Nazis. In this case, our heroes are about to get taken to prison at the beginning, when their captors get killed by Nazi gunfire. So, the now free convicts decide to make their way to neutral Switzerland. Along the way, there's plenty of goose-stepping goons to shoot, and there's even some hot women. The main point of the movie is to show Fred Williamson off as a cool tough guy.<br /><br />So, this isn't one that you're supposed to interpret as a Fellini-style film. This is pure, unadulterated fun. Really cool.<br /><br />I bet that Brad Pitt's comment at the end of Tarantino's version not only reflected what Tarantino probably assumed about his movie, but what Castellari probably assumed about this one.
