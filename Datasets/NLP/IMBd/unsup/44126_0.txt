OK, lets be clear-I am not a fan. This show is way too derivative (think Buffy, etc.) plot heavy and poorly written. On occasions, the dialog is so silly that I can actually see the actors trying to stifle their smirks. Hmmmm-distracting. The plot lines are so outlandish that its difficult for a mere mortal such as myself to get interested. I hear tell that Shannon Doherty was pretty good in the earlier episodes (I'll bet she was, since she's a witch in real life too). But, you ask, you watch the thing! Of course I do--Aaron Spelling, the maestro of jiggle TV provides us with THE viable alternative to intelligent story lines--three nubile young witch ladies dressed-always-in (1) skin tight sweaters, (2) skin tight jeans, and/or (3) skin tight cute cocktail dresses (usually in black, let it be noted). The setting is perfect- San Francisco, then and now the actual witch capital of the world (I should know, I live one hour away from the vortex of arcane power). I see witches every time I go there. Now, back to the dramatic center of the show, those teeny little costumes. I notice that Alyssa Milano (the ring leader, I think)usually has the sexiest outfits. This is way cool, since she's one of the shows producers, too. This suggests to me that some of the back stage drama here is just as interesting as what happens on screen.
