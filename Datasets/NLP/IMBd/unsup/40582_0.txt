This movie features two young actors who will hopefully be seen in more films. The teenage "good girl falls for boy from the wrong side of the tracks" story falls short of explaining the psychological factors that would cause a relatively stable girl to defy her parents and cause a hardened juvenile delinquent to open up so easily to his girlfriend. The writer hinted at some of these, but she never delved into it thus making it a predictable story that could have ended thirty minutes into the film.
