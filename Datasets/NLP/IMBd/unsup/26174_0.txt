I was not alive when this movie was made but i LOVED IT!! I admit, it was "old acting" but they casted great women for the lead rolls. They REALLY under rated it though. My friends agree with me b/c of "Jane Curtin's" striptease. Susan's characters was not as good as Jane Curtin and Jessica Lange's. Susans character was very ditsy most of the time. WHO brings their kids to a robbery!!!!! Jessica Lange's character was the smart one and Jane Curtin's Charator was clever. I recommend this movie to people who can deal with chick flicks. Its not very chick flicky but a lot of it was about romance. The beginning was boring but it got better as it got into it. You should really rent this movie!
