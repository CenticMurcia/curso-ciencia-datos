Ang Lee creates another finely crafted movie.<br /><br />Lust Caution takes place at the beginning of World War 2 in both HongKong & Shanghai, It was filmed in mainland China as well as Malaysia. His attention of periodic details, settings, costumes is amazing,we have seen many WW 2 films about life in China,most if not all of them were in rural sections, featuring the so-called peasant classes. This movie is about city people in well-to-do situations.<br /><br />We start at a Mah Jong game between 4 women & we learn much. it then goes back 4 years & we find out one of the ladies was a student involved with some revolutionaries. It becomes imperative that she meets the husband of one of the other women.<br /><br />The Husband superbly portrayed by Tony Leoung.(one of the leading international actors of today.<br /><br />They begin an affair (which is reason for the NC 17) The sex scenes are very graphic.<br /><br />It is a long movie almost 140 minutes, BUT it moves fast,<br /><br />Many exciting scenes,with some typical humour of the times.<br /><br />The subtitles are excellent & quite clear.<br /><br />Ratings: ***1/2 (out of 4) 95 points(out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)
