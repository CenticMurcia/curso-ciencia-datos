What we have here is yet another undercooked look at criminals in the UK. There is plenty of killing but, hey, it's all okay because just about everyone with a gun is really a good person with a nifty sense of humor. I was especially appalled by the gratuitous murder of a carefree young Buddhist woman. Real nice.<br /><br />Hans Matheson plays our hero Virgil Guppy. He's pretty bland in the role and his transformation into a confident and cunning crook didn't convince me for a moment. Anyway, the story goes something like this. Virgil buys a Jaguar from a used car dealer. The car breaks down after only 4 miles and he wants his money back. The guy who owns the dealership actually obtains his cars from an auto theft ring and he doesn't like people trying to tell him what to do.<br /><br />Next thing you know, our hero has been framed for the murder of a prostitute and he now needs to find out who the real killer is before he's locked away.<br /><br />Virgil ends up getting hit by a car which is driven by Tiffany, played by the marvelous Charlotte Coleman. Surprise of surprises, she steals cars for a living and often deals with the guy who owns the aforementioned dealership. Well, that guy is soon murdered and the bodies keep piling up.<br /><br />I guess if you're into the whole humorous British petty (or not so petty) criminal genre then you won't be offended by anything you see here. It's all rather tame and except for the Buddhist's murder there is nothing shocking. The humor is, of course, quite dry and draws the occasional laugh. Charlotte Coleman is the stand out performance here. She is at once strong, charming, determined, touching and beautiful. Her character is the only one the viewer actually cares about and she showed what a stunning actress she truly was.<br /><br />When the true murderer is revealed, it is disappointing to say the least when their motive is given. "Because I can." That should give you an idea of just how much thought went into this screenplay. I was mildly entertained but nothing more. 3/10
