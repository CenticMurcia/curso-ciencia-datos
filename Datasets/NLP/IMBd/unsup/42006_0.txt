I've seen both versions, 1939 and 1954, more then once or twice. The only saving grace for the latter is that the supporting cast is pretty good. I respect his outstanding war record, but Murphy was only a mediocre actor on his best day. Even when he portrayed himself in "To Hell and Back" his acting style is plodding and dull. Stewart could play a role low key and then show a range of emotions when called on to do so - he was a true artist in that regard. Murphy seems almost dull witted at times. Stewart had an outstanding military record that was, at times, used to lend credibility to some of his roles. It was unfortunate that Murphy was exploited just because his war record was deemed to be a box office draw, but he just couldn't act.
