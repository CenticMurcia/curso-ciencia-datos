Even though I watched the film only for JTT, I found out the whole movie was great! The performances were realistic and I also like the fact that the characters were not casted by stereotype( gay people are feminine ( boys) or masculine ( girls). None of characters were stereotyped. Brittany Murphy played a discharged woman from the NAVY but she didn't act all masculine or had short boyish hair, JTT played a star swimmer who is going to Harvard ( the stereotype would be him playing a boy in the Drama society and the swimmers or the jocks would make fun of him, but he was a sports nut himself and the last one ( which I didn't see too much of). Being gay has nothing to do with how masculine or feminine people act. I liked JTT's segment more since the story hit close to home ( I am not gay but considering he is a senior in high school going of to college). I wish the director or the writers expanded more on the fact that he is going to Harvard. I truly loved Brittany and Jonathan's performances since they are much more younger and less experienced than the actors in the third segment. Their acting was well-done and very convincing. JTT's performance after he was beaten and raped was very sad and moving not to mention dramatic. I like Brittany from Clueless and in this movie, it showed off her dramatic skills. I like dramas and stuff.
