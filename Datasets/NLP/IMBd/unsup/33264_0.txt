.......Nor particularly noteworthy on the filmographic CV of Gary Daniels sadly, although he does at least get to show off some pretty cool martial arts moves. Unfortunately, the film carries an ominous air of boredom to it throughout; It's almost as though no one involved had any faith in the production from the very start as evidenced by the lazy performances, generally bland action sequences (for a PM production) and a meandering 'plot' which goes no where.<br /><br />There's really very little to recommend this in fact other than for Daniels completists who may at least derive some welcome enjoyment from his aforementioned fighting skills. For a much better PM vehicle starring our Gary, check out instead the OTT and outrageous, Rage and also Riot - both much, much better flicks.
