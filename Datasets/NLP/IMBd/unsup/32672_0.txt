Let me just say that a nice introduction is not needed in this piece of leftover meatloaf that needed to be produced by a Fishcer Price karate team.<br /><br />3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain had a plan in it's motive to be produced. It wanted to show compassion. It wanted to show teamwork, brotherly love and it wanted to show Hulk Hogan's acting abilities. It all failed in that.<br /><br />Three brothers who happened to be in an amusement park will save the day because the amusement park is taken over by terrorists! There are also subplots of Hulk Hogan's character being a has-been (so is he) and the eldest ninja who'll get the heart of this ten-year-old girl. Lame! Colt is played by this kid who will become the future Canadian band Moffats-parody lead singer. Tum-tum is a little Hilary Swank stuck in a Baby Gap model's body. Rocky is this over-the-top, meant to be "cool" punk who can't kiss at fourteen.<br /><br />The supporting kids are just as weird. The computer girl had not a cinch of fear since there was a four-minute bomb inches away from her face. The "roller coaster-Come save me!" girl was the miscast of the entire debacle. Can she even stand still? Why is it such a good idea for terrorists to take over an amusement park? Why cast a has-been wrestler who can't even say his name right? Why are Jamaican men such good computer junkies? Why cast a toddler (who yelps like a strangling cat) into saying those damn "Ay-Ya's" over two dozen times? <br /><br />I liked these ninja movies. The first ones? Great. I was like three when that came to video. But this? This is the limit of underdeveloped. It looked like it was directed by a damn pro-kids pedophile! I would just say that the hype, the story, the climax and the stupendous fight scenes (where the kids close their little eye-dy widey's to kick the bad goons) take the cake as making this pure garbage.<br /><br />Don't waste your time, I did.
