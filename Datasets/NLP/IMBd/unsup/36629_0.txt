"Wow" is truly the only word to describe this movie, and not in a good way. First, the animation is clearly cheaply done and looks more like a fifteen minute show on cartoon network than a film. Leonard Nemoy does give his voice talents, however "Mountrouds" voice is horribly annoying, especially after about an hour of watching the film. The story is bad and extremely confusing, especially for youngsters. Also, the "educational" trip through time fails to mention all-hallows-eve, the real history of Halloween. Oh yeah, and I forgot about the redeeming message in this film --- I'm still trying to figure that out. Friendship maybe...hmm? All together a terrible movie for adults and children alike. Do yourself a favor and rent out a disney film. 2/10
