Melanie Griffith is horribly miscast and would fool not one Hacedic Jew in Crown Heights with her undercover role. Tracy Pollan deserves a special Golden Turkey for the single worst supporting performance in a pivotal role in a drama. She single-handedly ruins any credibility the film might have ever had. The "oh-now-I'm really-beginning -to-appreciate-the-beauty-of-the Hacedic-culture scenes" are forced and contrived, especially the big family meal. John Pankow delivers the movie's most interesting performance in a thankless role.
