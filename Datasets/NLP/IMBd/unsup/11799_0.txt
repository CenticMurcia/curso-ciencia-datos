This movie is very very good. It is highly enjoyable, definitely a couples movie. David Wenham and Suzie Porter are great as the leads, they are definitely one of the only screen couples that actually had chemistry, it was amazing to see. It is very funny, and very sexy, and very Aussie, what else can you ask for in a movie?<br /><br />The direction in this movie is very well done, the story is good, I really loved this movie. And at times this film is better than sex! Congrats to the Producers you have yourselves a winning movie. 10/10 from me!!!
