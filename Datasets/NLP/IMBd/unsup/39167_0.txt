C.H.U.D is a bit more higher budget than your regular 80's horror flick, but not necessarily much better. It's interesting enough to watch but not particularly great or unique. The best scene is where a woman is taking a shower and blood sprays out of the plug-hole all over her. The story is mildly interesting and the C.H.U.Ds themselves are sort of humanoid monsters with glowing eyes.<br /><br />I can't really say much more as there was little in this film that grabbed me - it's an OK time waster, and that's about it. I don't really understand why everyone else rates it so highly.<br /><br />4/10.
