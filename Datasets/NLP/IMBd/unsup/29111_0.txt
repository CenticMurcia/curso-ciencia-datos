A group of friends are out partying one night, when they decide to try out an Oujia board and contact some spirits. Whilst doing it, they do get in contact with someone, a demon who is back from the dead and has gotten into there world. The only way for the demon to go back to where it came from is if he kills whole group friends who let him out in the first place. A strange old man who happens to be the landlord of there house claims that one of them has the demon inside of them, but no one believes him. It is true though......<br /><br />Long Time Dead a good British horror/thriller movie, with some creepy moments in it, like the flashback scenes. There are also some little twists along the way as well. The acting from everyone is good too. If you enjoy movies like this, then I'm sure you will enjoy Long Time Dead. I give Long Time Dead a 8-9/10.
