I actually had no intentions of seeing this movie when I'd first heard about it. Yet another You Got Served, Drumline, etc. But as fate would have it, I obtained a job working at AMC Theatres in Tenlytown, DC, during my summer break. If you don't know that theater, they only show about 5 films, and only two are new releases. I worked three or four days a week, and since I usually arrived for my shift hours earlier than I needed to...well. I decided to sit in on a showing.<br /><br />What a surprise! It was an interesting portrayal of an "urban" dance style, shown in a way that didn't bore the viewer. Actually, Krumping reminds me of a dance style that's unique to DC called Go-Go Dancing... which is probably why I find it all so interesting.<br /><br />Anyway. Great documentary-movie, definitely check it out if you can.
