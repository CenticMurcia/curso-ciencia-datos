I wonder about Liberation Entertainment, the film's distributor. Along with last year's "Stephanie Daley," they have proved to have great film taste. But do these guys know anything about marketing? Both films came and went in a flash, and after seeing both these films, it's hard to believe that could be possible. Thankfully, something like NetFlix exists, because otherwise, I would never have seen either picture. And as "Stephanie Daley" was probably the best little-seen movie last year in America, I think that "honor" is going to go to "Shotgun Stories" this year.<br /><br />A modern day Hatfields versus the McCoys, with a bit of a twist...they're also related to each other. Understated plot and performances...this is a gem of a movie that film fans will find well worth the effort to seek out.
