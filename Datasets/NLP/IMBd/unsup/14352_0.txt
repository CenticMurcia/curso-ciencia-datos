For people who like the stage and enjoy a lot of "talk," this film is right up their alley, but it is not a "gangster movie" as we know it, and as advertised and put out as such as part of a DVD set in January of 2005. Yes, there is a gangster (Humphrey Bogart) involved in the story, but really this is just a play where all the action is in one room and it is talk, talk, talk with just a little action in the end.<br /><br />The best part of the film, to me, was Bette Davis, who I have found very alluring when she was young. After 1940, she lost her physical appeal and began playing a lot of ruthless characters. Anyway, she looked good and her character was interesting. I enjoyed watching her.<br /><br />The worst part of film was the star of the movie: Leslie Howard, whose character just rambled on and on and on about his Liberal viewpoints of the world on numerous subjects. Some of the stuff he was interesting but most of his statements were just plain annoying and idiotic.<br /><br />This was Bogart's first "starring role," if you want to call it, as some have. The truth is he didn't enter the film until over halfway through and even then didn't have many lines. He was so primitive looking I almost didn't recognize him. His voice, however, gave him away. As usual, "Bogie,"" was riveting when on screen.<br /><br />In all, a liberal-feminist gabfest. For those who enjoy this sort of thing: great; for those looking for "gangster" movie, skip this one.
