This film was perhaps one of the most boring horror films I've ever sat through, the plot was boring, the characters were boring, even the deaths were boring! With a name like Shrooms you imagine this will be a horror film with some sort of 'Trainspotting' appeal in places but this film lacked any sort of interesting concept whatsoever! The film is based around a group of American teens visiting Ireland with one purpose to take magic mushrooms & have a good time. They are meet at the airport by main character Tara's (Lindsey Haun) on/off boyfriend type Jake (Jack Huston), he appears to be local although he too has an American accent. The group head off to the woods & get high & soon enough they're being killed one by one.<br /><br />If anything this film did two things make me laugh at the poor acting, particularly Haun's wooden acting & it also made me slightly angry at the representation of Ireland. Why make a film set in Ireland & then cast all main characters as American I'll never understand but it explains why the film was so obsessed with promoting Ireland as some sort of drug paradise.<br /><br />I actually had to force myself to finish watching the film as I hate to not finish a film & my attention was wandering constantly. The villains were like something off Lord of the rings & the ending seemed like the writer was getting bored & thought just end it quick I'm fed up. The twist should have been suggested a little earlier in order to hold the audience's attention because honestly I think that was the only slightly interesting thing out of the entire film. My advice give this one a miss, you'll be bored within minutes & feel cheated by the boring ending & the poor acting displayed. Plus if you are from or have ever been to Ireland the representation of 'the locals' will only insult you somewhat.
