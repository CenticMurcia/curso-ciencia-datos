I always saw Bruce Lee as an enigma. This movie lays that feeling 100% flat to rest. It is so well done I was glued to the set even though all they show are clips and the remaining scenes to Lee's last movie: "Game of Death."<br /><br />The scenes in "GoD" are very well-done even for a marginal MA fan like me. However, the pauses were too long, but Lee's mastery made it worth waiting to see his moves. The scene with Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (the last recorded piece) was better in the later part of the fight and even turned convincing.<br /><br />John Little did an excellent job of directing this documentary. He allowed first hand witnesses to speak freely. It is clear from the start of the film that it was made as a reverence to Mr. Lee - a world class person and martial arts master. A sadness permeates this movie because you feel that Bruce Lee was taken way too early.<br /><br />- Zafoid
