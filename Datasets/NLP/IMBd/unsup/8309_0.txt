Me and some friends rented this... "Why?" I hear you ask... We thought it was fate that had lead us to this cinematic piece of art. Little did we know that it in fact, actually did (believe it, or not) SUCK! I have seen some bad movies in my time... but this is without a doubt the worst ever. It actually made "Tale of the Mummy", Trance (aka Kiss of the Mummy w/ Christoffer Walken) and any given Mr. Ed episode look like cinematic art that could surpass each and everyone of the Lord of the Rings Movies.... My movie-taste feels raped, and it's unsettling to know that money was paid to watch it :-( ... That's probably the most kind words I can use to describe that thing I refuse to call a movie...
