Okay, what is there to say about this episode except for "WOW!" and "I can't wait till part 2 of 'all hell breaks loose'". I am a great fan of this series and I usually root for Dean but today I'm rooting for Sam because something BAAAAD is gonna happen and Sam got all to do with it. His death is not without a real good reason. because if you pay attention to the different points raised during the season, we know that GOD, LIFE AFTER DEATH, Sam and their mother, their dad too and obviously HELL and the Yellow eyed demon will be key factors in part 2. I just hope the inevitable doesn't happen, Sam going darkside and SUPERNATURAL turning into Sam vs. Dean ... Evil vs. Good. because even though Dean is tough he is no match against a possible 'demoniac Sam'. I think I've said enough and most of it wasn't about this episode. all I've got left to say is i feel sorry for Sam, I empathize with Dean and i'm disappointed with Ava's reappearance and missing Jo Harvelle ... she is gotta appear again.
