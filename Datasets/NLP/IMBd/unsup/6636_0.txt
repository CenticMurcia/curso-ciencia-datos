Like I said, my friend and I decided to watch The Prince and Me and The Prince and Me 2 back to back to see what they were like. While, the second Prince and Me started off fairly like a sweet movie, it turned from a teen audience into a little girl's fantasy world. Especially more like a typical Disney princess flick that was unbelievable and I couldn't take seriously, even for a little kid.<br /><br />It takes off where Paige is now in Denmark and is learning the language, the culture, and the perks of being a queen, including the paparazzi stalking her 24-7. She's also studying still to become a doctor. Edvard is working hard as well to become a good king and is doing the best he can to contain a good king image. But when an old childhood royal friend, Kirsten, gets in the way of the relationship believing that it should only be royalty who becomes king and queen... you can take off with the rest of the plot.<br /><br />The new girl who played Paige was totally unbelievable as a workaholic study bug, and didn't have the same presence and grace as Julia Styles. The guy who played the prince actually looked irritated to play the role again, I think he knew that this film was a mistake. Oh, well, for the little 5 year old girls who love fairy tales, this is the film for them, let's just pray they don't make a third installment, otherwise with all the making out these two do, it'll be a porno.<br /><br />1/10
