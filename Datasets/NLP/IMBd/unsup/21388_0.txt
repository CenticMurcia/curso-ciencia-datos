This is an okay Svankmajer short that comes with Conspirators of Pleasure on the Kino DVD release.<br /><br />It's worth seeing for that movie but seems much longer than it actually it is.<br /><br />What's interesting is how each chapter seems to deliberately pare itself down in the level of detail given each chapter. The first segment, "Breakfast" is uniform in it's depiction of each actor's "meal". "Lunch" (the most obviously meaningful of the three) moves along a bit faster and "Dinner" just crams as many brief encounters into a couple minutes as possible.<br /><br />Svankmajer, it would seem, is pretty serious about breakfast and pretty lazy by dinnertime, but I like Dinner the best.<br /><br />7 out of 10
