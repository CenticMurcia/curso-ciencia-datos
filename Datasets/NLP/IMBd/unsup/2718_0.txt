Most actors act horribly, the entire satire and humour from the book have been cut. It is blasphemy to make movie from a masterpiece like Bulgakov's m&m like this. The computer effects are even present when they are absolutely not necessary and look terribly. Behemot, the cat, as if it was from some kindergraden theatre, Lavrov is too old for Bulgakov's procurator, Abdulov (Koroviev), the oh-so-expensive-superstar seemingly just reads his text down without playing anything. This all is surprising, since the budget present was high. However, Basilashvili, Alexander Galibin and Filipenko (Azazello, master and Voland) are playing surprisingly good. These are the only ones. Do not watch this piece of junk before reading the book!
