I could not finish watching the entire movie, I got about 3/4's of the way. First of all, the movie is way too long(100 minutes), and the blood effects are just way too fake, I mean I know low budget is low budget, but the killing scenes are just too comical. The ape looks like a retard making comical grunts, and posturing, and the costume is just plain lame. I did love the opening credits, great job there. The acting was very bad, and when the ape lifts the cop car, that was just too ridiculous, it looked so fake, I think this film would have been better if a different approach to the ape was used, and they limited the blood and gore, the movie had potential and that's why I give it a three. Finishing a film is an accomplishment and these film makers did just that.
