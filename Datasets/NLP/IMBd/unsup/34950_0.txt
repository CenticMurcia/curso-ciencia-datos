Maybe I am just too old. Maybe it's because I am not an Aussie, and I did not get all the subtleties of this film. Anyway, I did not like it.<br /><br />Seeing 'Fat Pizza' was to me kind of like trying to listen to rap / hip-hop music. I am 50+, I belong to the rock generation, I love all kind of music and pretend to be a liberal, but rappers still are beyond my taste. I have nothing against, I respect the right of other people to listen and like them, they are just too far away from my universe and taste for me to enjoy their work. I cannot follow all their texts, I do not like their music (ar lack of music), they are too fast, I do not share their feelings.<br /><br />Same with 'Fat Pizza'. The film is apparently inspired by a TV series. What I did like was that it's different from your usual TV comedy stuff. The film does not try to be politically correct, which is really spoiling many American comedies today. The rhythm is crazy, and this is the main problem in my opinion. It is so crazy and fast that you do not have time to follow the jokes. There is not too much connection between the gags either, no line of action or humor, and the result is unfortunately no better than in a less than average sitcom.<br /><br />That's too bad. The watching experience is different but the result is not better than bad comedy, scarcely extracting a smile now and then.<br /><br />But after all, it may be just me. Perhaps after seeing a few more rap comedies like this I will get to understanding better and even enjoying the genre. Same as with rap music. The question is whether they will get me watching or listening to them.<br /><br />4 out of 10 on my personal scale.
