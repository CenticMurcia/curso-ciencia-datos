I really enjoyed seeing Henry and June again on the satellite  15 years after its release. The relationship between June and Anaïs - and between both of them and Henry is dark, sensual, and at times, graphic. This is a very "steamy" movie for its time. From time to time characters seem to just disappear - especially Henry - leaving Anaïs and Henry to explore their feeling and passions.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey has a very small role here- only a hint of what he will become.<br /><br />The classical music used for the opening scene is by Stravinsky - Le Sacre du Printemps - it's perfect for the mood. The musical score has several "smoky" and sultry French songs that make you want to have been in Paris back in the 20's. There are a few jazz tracks and scenes in jazz nightspots.<br /><br />The filming captures the "look" and "feel" of Paris in the 20's - with a hint of a war to come. The antique cars barely fit between the buildings - just as today! <br /><br />If you have not seen Henry and June - find it and watch it - after the children are in bed.
