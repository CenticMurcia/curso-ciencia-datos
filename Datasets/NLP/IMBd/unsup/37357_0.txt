how can you guys say its a great movie??? sorry, but it really sucks.. the plot is very poor of ideas and just to fill it a little the director has back-troubles? Is that really the best this movie can give us? I think it sucks.. you get absolutely nothing from seeing this movie. And I think its sad too, to see Sigourney Weaver in a role like this. She is more talented than this plot will ever be.<br /><br />Come on, go compared it to a real movie and admit that i actually isn't any good...<br /><br />I could say many things that i don't like about this movie. But it wouldn't be the time worth..
