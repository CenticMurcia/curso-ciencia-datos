I was introduced to this movie by a friend who brought over the DVD one night as part of a collection of movies we could pick to watch. Since none of us had admittedly heard of it before, we decided to watch and give it a chance.<br /><br />While it might not appeal to the big-explosions-special-effects-only younger crowds of today, the film is well-paced, witty, and is one of the few movies that has hit my capacity for sarcastic and bizarre humor hard. Unlike most of the movies of the aforementioned genre, WWHTKB actually takes time to develop its characters so you might actually have an opinion on them (vs. the mindless automatons of most of today's features). There will be many moments that leave you saying "what the...?", which might not be for everyone, but it contributes to the overall style of the film (in my opinion, at least).<br /><br />Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed myself and hope to see more productions from the same director in the future.
