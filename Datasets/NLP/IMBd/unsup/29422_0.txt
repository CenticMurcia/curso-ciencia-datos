****Excellent<br /><br />***Good<br /><br />**Fair<br /><br />*Poor<br /><br />Antonio Banderas and Angelina Jolie are two very talented actors who both should have done another project that would have taken advantage of their talent. Banderas perhaps took this role to do something different from his Spy Kids role but Angelina Jolie I don't understand. She keeps on accepting roles in mainstream adult films. <br /><br />The film I think had potential to be a very good erotic thriller. However, the plot and characters are underdeveloped while the sex scenes take center stage. In my opinion the only reason you may want to check out this film is to see Angelina Jolie naked. But for that you shouldn't waste your time in viewing this film.<br /><br />RATING: 1 STAR
