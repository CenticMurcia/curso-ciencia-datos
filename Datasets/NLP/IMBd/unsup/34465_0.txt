Bad characters. Bad dialogue trying to pass as witty. Just a bad, bad movie. Painful at times. Not far off from a talking heads movie, yet the conversations were slow enough that even if the movie involved gunfire they'd still be boring.<br /><br />And, no, the characters would have been stereotypes back in 1981 as well. A bad movie is a bad movie, no matter how one tries to sell it as a "well, you had to be there". Well, I was there. It wasn't like that. It didn't suck this much. No excuses, please. See "Last Days of Disco" if you want relative accuracy... 200 would suck in any era.
