As one character says, "This sounds pretty hokey to me," which is a good description of this overlong, overwrought, pretentious diatribe on reincarnation.<br /><br />This might, I say, might, have made a middling episode of a TV series like 'Tales from the Darkside' or 'Tales from the Crypt' but as a film it's far too slow and dull. Nothing really happens until the final part of the film and before that it's just talk and more talk. Nothing wrong with that but it's static and too much time is taken with endless shots of the leads looking at each other and explaining the plot.<br /><br />More a drama than an actual horror film but lacking any tension or suspense. You can see the end coming from the start and it's just a matter of waiting till it happens....eventually.<br /><br />The style of acting reminds me of amateur dramatics at the local Church hall, very intense and earnest but quite boring for the audience.<br /><br />This type of stuff has been done far better in other films with a reincarnation theme. This is one that I don't want to come back again to watch!<br /><br />Plus it also has one of the worst closing credits song I have ever heard!
