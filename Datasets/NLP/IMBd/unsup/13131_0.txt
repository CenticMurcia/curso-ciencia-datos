This is basically just a rehash of the novel Sharpe's Tiger, with some minor recasting with Sergeant Hakeswill as Sergeant Bickerstaff, The Tippoo as Major Dodd, and Lieutenant Lawford as Harper. But in the book, the point of infiltrating the fortress was to rescue Colonel McCandless, who knew about that mine planted in the western walls. Because the new plot is to rescue some girl, It just doesn't hold up. And historically, there WERE no major uprisings in India after the Napoleonic war, so any historical accuracy is out the window. Sean Bean, Darugh O' Malley and Toby Stephens all did well, but any time one of the girls or that French guy opened their mouths I just thought "You probably should've done more than one take of that scene." I liked the flashback to Sharpe's Triumph when Sharpe was almost killed by Dodd, but the idea that Dodd would have been allowed to live for 14 years is just ridiculous. Equally as ridiculous is the idea that the french would help Sharpe not 3 years after Waterloo. The explosions were fabulous and the production values were the highest they've been for any Sharpe, but the story, script, and supporting actors were the weakest they've ever been. If only they'd done "Sharpe's Devil" instead. This gets a B/B-
