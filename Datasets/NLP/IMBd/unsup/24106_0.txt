i had very low hopes for this eight and final installment in the original Pink Panther series of films.i just didn't believe Roberto Benigni would be a good fit.i'm happy to say i was wrong.Benigni was the best part of the film.he was brilliant,exceptionally funny.the man is a natural born comedian,with great comedic timing or at least it looks that way in this movie.beyond that,though,the slapstick sequences actually work much better here than in the previous movies.i laughed out loud a lot during this film.i don't agree at all with the the undeserved(in my opinion)current rating on this site of 3.5/10.for me,Son of the Pink Panther is an 8.5 1/0
