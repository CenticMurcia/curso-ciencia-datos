Hi all,<br /><br />this is the perfect example of YASM = yet another stereotype movie. Movies like this only contribute to increase the bad image that people in the world have of such a beautiful land like Sicily.<br /><br />As a Sicilian man living abroad, tho, in Finland, I have been listening for ages the comments on movies like the Godfather. Incredible but true, people still think that in Sicily we live like that. Luckily enough, this movie will not be able to make as many damages as the world-famous "Godfather".<br /><br />The movie, set in the '70s, is sort of a biographic story of a girl, with Sicilian father and Finnish mother, and a younger sister. They moved to Sicily and ... since then the movie can be summarized in four words: Sicily = hell Finland = paradise<br /><br />Sicily is not the perfect world and Finland is an indeed very nice country. In fact, I live here. But you cannot give such an unbalanced picture of the world. The result? I can already read "motherly advices" of other users, who are Finnish (swedish speaking, which is probably a benefit, if they need to specify it) but are more retrograde of the Sicilian characters of the movie. <br /><br />The movie has already done the damage, because the motherly advice consists in considering the relationship with a Mexican guy, apparently on the basis that he is Mexican (and therefore, almost Sicilian, here the comment is not clear). <br /><br />Sorry for breaking a bit the rule of not commenting other posts, but I did it to give an example on how the movie can spoil the image of Sicily. <br /><br />My recommendation: if you want to watch it, it is your choice, but BE CAREFUL that Sicily is far other thing. Go visit it if you don't believe it. BR Simone Italian-speaking Italian. (Often pronounced as Simone by my beloved grandmother, who was Sicilian-speaking)
