Painfully dull Euro-horror thats a retread of the Karloff Mummy set on a cruise ship.<br /><br />Ages ago a voodoo priest who was having an affair with a married woman kills the husband in a fight. The woman is decapitated and the priest is put into a wooden coffin and buried.<br /><br />Now. The coffin is dug up and put on a cruise ship. The dead priest comes back to life and begins looking for his reborn love at the same time he's chopping off the heads of some of the passengers.<br /><br />Its slow. Its dull (with the opening bit about the affair replayed over and over and over again with an all but obscuring red tint) and it has some of the worst paper mache heads you'll ever see flying all over the place.<br /><br />Cinematic sleep meds.
