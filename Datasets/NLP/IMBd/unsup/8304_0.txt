This movie didn't make a lot of sense but if you pay attention you'll understand the ending. Most people cannot do this because they are to slow to keep up with the Bachelor and Survivor reality shows. I'm sick of reading people comment and rave about sorry movies like Spiderman and rip independent horror movies like this. There are a few twists so if you get lost while watching Weakest Link avoid this. To me it doesn't get better than this. I like independent movies and I like horror movies but any movie that has Jeffrey Combs, Seth Green and Alice Cooper is my kind of movie. Definitely rent this is if you are a fan of Jeffrey Combs.
