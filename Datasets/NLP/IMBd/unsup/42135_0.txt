After finishing watching the movie my friend said to me: do you realize that we just watched over 2 hours of video about nothing. The movie is basically escapist: showing reality in makeup and looking like whore, very much like Hollywood movies. The main character is "very good person", faithful husband and a father and cares about people (through building railroads). So how do put this man in a romantic extra-marrital affair without damaging that ultra-good view of him? Well, you make his neurotic wife run away with somebody else, and then make him get mad when the girl puts on his wifes clothing and only later give in to his feelings. Really, a true story of devotion to family values and decency (makes me sick). The whole movie is also very zany, with childish humor (like teletubbies). And to make it powerful in the end there's the whole dramatic separated lovers story. So what you get is a movie about life before and during war, where nobody dies, main character has a romance, full of slapstick humor. How's this related to anything real. I see it only as a sickening reality-obscuring movie.
