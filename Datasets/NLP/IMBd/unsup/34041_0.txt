A series of vignettes that go back and forth signifying nothing that we didn't already know about the Hollywood types and the like who live there. With apologies to the good Hollywood types and the like who live there too. Sooooooooorrrrrrrrrrry!<br /><br />A while back I did a review on JUMPER and called it pointless. This movie is pointless too. No plot, no story, absolutely pointless. I kept waiting for this to start for surly there must be a reason this was made. Wrong again. No reason. Later I was waiting for something else: for it to end. They say a watched pot never boils, but actually it will in time. But continually watching this movie I saw that nothing here would ever boil.<br /><br />Now, not all was bad. The acting by all was excellent. Maybe they thought they were part of a larger movie, score, epic. Hmmm..Wrong. But, the acting was terrific even though the performances didn't relate to everything else going on. Well, actually, they did, but loosely, verrrry loosely. Just not enough to be called a story. <br /><br />I must say Kim Bassinger's performance outdid anything she ever did in the past. Really good in this pointless mess. As for the rest of the cast, all were very good in this pointless mess. <br /><br />You will see: a Director or Producer (Thornton) trying to get back with his wife(Bassinger) to stave off the 50% she will get in a divorce; college kids doing drugs and sleeping with everyone and I mean everyone; a father and son trying to reconnect and failing; a rock star with such ugly, disgusting and shameful behavior; and last but not least a failed kidnapping of a child for ransom by Peter (Rourke). I kept thinking that maybe this is another version of CRASH, and they will all somehow come together at the end. Not to be. Like I said: Pointless. <br /><br />The title. The rock group was called The Informers. Maybe no one could decide what the title of this mess would be and settled on that. Again: pointless. <br /><br />You will also see a lot of nudity. Maybe that will hold you. You will see simulated sex. Maybe that will hold you too. OK, OK I plead guilty. Hey, there's not much out there these days. <br /><br />Violence: Yes. Sex: Yes. Nudity: Yes. Language: Yes.
