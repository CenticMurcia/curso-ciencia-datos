It's a good movie I saw with Patrick Swayze. However, there was some typecasting. But what did I care? This movie was great. The art of revenge, defending one's honor, that's what this movie was really about! Patrick Swayze plays Truman Gates, a Chicago cop with Bluegrass roots, who goes to Kentucky to find out that his brother was killed. The witness was a friend and partner of the brother. Why did he got spared? Who knows? Liam Neesom plays the other brother, Briar. He was bent on revenge big time!The same man that killed their brother kills a son from a family he's married to. So if you think the Gates family were out for blood? Well, think again! Mr. John Isabella(Andreas Katsulas, "The Fugitive") is the other vengeful one. The final fight scene is memorable. The hillbillies versus the mob. The home-front advantage went straight to the Gates. However, the final redemption went also to the Isabellas as well, when the father killed his son-in-law. A divorce that's fully final. The cast are great, the plot is fulfilling, the results is an all or nothing smack-down for the honor of family. 2.5 out of 5 stars!
