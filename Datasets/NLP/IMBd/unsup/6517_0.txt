this is the first Simbhu movie i've seen and wow!i just keep watching this movie over and over again.is it because of Simbhu himself?is it the songs?is it cuz Simbhu wrote it?or is it because of the twist? i must say the twist at the end had me shocked.i didn't expect it.i believed the whole thing to the twist.amazing.i loved Simbhu in both characters.more so Manmadhan than the twin.i loved Simbhu as a psycho.can't wait for Vallavan (the sequel).this movie is highly recommended.Simbhu is too good in this one.Jyothika is awesome.everyone else is perfectly casted.songs are amazing.i love En Asai Mythiliye and Thathai Thathai the most.the most amazing movie i've seen in a while.
