So, it's a Troma pick-up, which can sometimes be a good thing, but not lately & definitely not in this case. First off, one must sit through Lloyd Kaufman's increasingly annoying rants, and then, the pay off, a really bad movie. Gosh, what more could you ask for? Plenty, really.<br /><br />There is no attempt here for any actors to look like the ages they're supposed to be, with horrible wigs, fake mustaches, etc. The only ones that fare well in their roles are the ones that are SUPPOSED to be teenagers, so they kind of look like it.<br /><br />The gist is that there's a campsite that is overrun by raccoons, and they're not just any raccoons, they're raccoons with a taste for human flesh. Which is, in itself, a great idea for a horror movie parody, but the rest of what goes on is so amateur and rinky-dink that it just defeats any other purpose.<br /><br />The raccoons themselves are all real, but obviously deceased, and someone provides evil little chuckles for the things as they pop up here & there.<br /><br />There are a couple almost funny moments, like one teen losing his virginity to the girl of his dreams, while she's being attacked by raccoons....the realization of her plight while he's still busy is probably the highlight of the movie, such as it is.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who is going to watch it without the benefits of some heavy-duty substance abuse, in which case it might be worth a chuckle or two. I, however, haven't done that stuff in a long time so I was merely envisioning putting this one straight into the trade-in pile when I was done watching it. 2 out of 10.
