It was a very moving experience for me to finally view this movie. It is definitely, without, a doubt superior to the already great 1937 version. Belle Bennett is absolutely brilliant in this role. It is only the second silent film that, not only brought tears to my eyes, but overfilled them, until almost bawling. It is that good. Even without the spoken word, the actors were able to display the emotions even better than actors whom had spoken their words.<br /><br />I have been begging TCM for a couple of years, now, to please, air this movie. Mainly, because, I would love to know more people out there would get the chance to see this movie. If you haven't had the pleasure to see this movie, try to find a way. It won't be a waste of your time.
