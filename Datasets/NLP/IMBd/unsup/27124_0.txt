This movie really succeeds at one point only, to be a really bad rip-off. The makers of this movie even had the nerve to steal the classic scene from Alien where the creature bursts out from the chest. This movie steals pretty much everything from the alien movies, the look of the monster is also very similar to the monster in Alien. The cast and acting in this movie is at its best poor, you don't really care if the characters get eaten or not. My recommendation is: Don't watch this crap, stick to the original.
