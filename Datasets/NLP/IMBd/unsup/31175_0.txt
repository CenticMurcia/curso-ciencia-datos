This movie was an unexpected hit for me. I really enjoy every minute of this film from start to finish. It had a feeling of From Dusk to Dawn to even a Quentin Tarantino film. It's the first horror/monster movie that I have seen in a really long time that was actually good. I do not understand why it's having a hard time getting distribution. There are so many crap films out there right now that get distribution, especially films in the horror genre. Please people if you get to see this movie go and see it. It's worth your time and money. It's very funny also and never takes itself too seriously which helps the movie in the long run. The monsters never are called anything else but monsters and that's refreshing. No drawn out back story, just right to the point action, comedy, and suspense. Please again if you get a chance to see this film go see it. Spread the word to help the director, writers, and producers of this film to get it some distribution. If you were a fan of the Project Greenlight television show then actually go see the movie.
