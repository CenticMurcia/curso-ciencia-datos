Oh how I would love to see this picture again! I saw it on TV I guess around the time it was made, and have never seen it since. I wonder if it even still exists? I remember it as being fantastically eerie, and the primate members of the cast were magnificent! Some other reviewers have pointed out that the movie was called "A Cold Night's Death" when they saw it - that was also the case as far as I was concerned. Perhaps that was just the UK title. If anyone who reads this knows if it exists, even on VHS, I'd love to know about it! I've given it a 9 because that's what I would have given it at the time - if only I could see it again through more adult and educated eyes - maybe one day?
