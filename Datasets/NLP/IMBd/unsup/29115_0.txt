It was an impulse decision, I wanted a scary movie and I just grabbed this from the shelf and I am glad I did. Its been a long time since I have seen a low budget British film that I have enjoyed and this came as a pleasant surprise, it is well filmed but doesn't go down the route of trying to be too clever. It just shows you what you need to see, avoiding most of the gruesome events and instead showing you the result. It entertains, suggests and of course scares. If don't have the preconception that you are going to watch an extremely clever horror and are just looking for a back to basics horror then you should enjoy this.
