i just love this film, it's such a shame it isn't on DVD yet. and a copy on VHS recorded years ago (before i was born probably). films of this quality are a rare treat, i can only compare it to those of monty python and the 1980's hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy TV series (the recent film was good but felt a little short).<br /><br />---POSSIBLE SPOILER--- one of my favourite bits is the part where 'the bbc' turns up and announces the news ---SPOILER FINISHED---<br /><br />if this film was re-made i doubt it would be as funny as the original and i'm sure they'd be told to remove certain lines of the script for reasons of political correctness.<br /><br />just hope the DVD is out soon a must for anyone that likes monty python style jokes
