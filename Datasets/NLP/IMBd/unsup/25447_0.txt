I saw previews for these films and I thought it was a comedy but it is so much more. This movie is one of the best movies written and made. It deals with subjects that people don't want to see or talk about. It is not just a sterotype when cops are racist or when The movie is so real each character could easily be a real person. Someone said that it is just a sterotype of white boys but it is not because there are really people like Flip, Trevor, and James who want to be black for some reason. With all the realness of this movie it is still funny as heck. The movie is well acted by the whole cast which makes it even more real. It breaks many raicial bounderies, and lets people be aware of what really does hapen in some ghetto's. I think everyone should wacth this movie, they can laugh and then see the world as it really is so times. This movie reminds me somewhat of SLC Punk! in ways that the main character is searching for who they are. In SLC Punk! the lead character Stevo (Matthew Lillard) is searching for who he is and what he belives in. In Whiteboys Flip is searching though differt racial personalities and finding who he is.I give this movie two big thumbs up, it has become one of my favorite movies.
