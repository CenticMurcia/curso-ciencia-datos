Unlikely characters and situations mar what might have been a fine idea for television.<br /><br />The harsh, inner-city, verbally abusive patter among staff in the psychiatric hospital is unlikely to be tolerated in the professional work environment displayed (unless the writer has some personal knowledge of this particular psychiatric ward) and makes the show a bit of a joke.<br /><br />The stereotype of the evil psychiatrist performing wicked procedures on their patients is hackneyed as well. And what about the two hospital workers having sex in the TV lounge 3 metres away from someone taking her tea break? How old was the writer for this show? Was there a writer?<br /><br />Definitely not worth a second glance.
