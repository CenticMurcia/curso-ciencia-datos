The John Wayne marathon.<br /><br />Now, this is real Grindhouse fare. the lines in this film are comparable to such classics as Satan's black Wedding or Diary of a Nymph. John Wayne as Ghengis Khan!<br /><br />I would not waste time talking about this film as i don't recommend anyone seeing it, but there is an interesting story behind it.<br /><br />It was filmed in Utah. The military had been doing atomic bomb testing near the location before the film, and the area was still hot. Several of the people involved with the film - over 100 - died of cancer. I kid you not:<br /><br />John Wayne: lung & stomach cancer, Susan Hayward: brain cancer, Pedro Armend√°riz: suicide, after learning he had cancer, Agnes Moorehead: uterine cancer, and John Hoyt: lung cancer<br /><br />Tose were main characters. The rest of the deaths were crew.
