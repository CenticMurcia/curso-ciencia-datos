Old Bobby De Niro strolls through this film with a role he seems so comfortable with. It must surely be one of his funniest performances (ranks up there with Midnight Run), & Billy Crystal provides a cringe worthy 'tough guy' parody later on in the film. You can't help but snigger and snort at some of the dialogue which is delivered effortlessly with perfect comic timing. If you got a bad case of the blues this is certainly a film to watch. I nearly choked on my custard doughnut when De Niro's tough guy character attempts to communicate in 'Psycho Babble'. The plot revolves around counselling a 'made' mafia guy and helping him to get in touch with his true inner self leads to some hilarious and ludicrous scenes. De Niro's sidekick 'Jelly' played by Joe Viterelli, comes out with some great one liners and Lisa Kudrow doesn't do too badly out of the whole affair either playing the stable well adjusted wife to be to a tee.
