Terribly unappetizing stew from Bert I. Gordon, an adaptation of H.G. Wells' story concerning a band of campers fighting off rats and chickens enlarged to monstrous proportions. The dark, clammy 'woodsy' setting is visually ugly, not helped by the film's low budget and really rotten special effects. Yes, it's a Grade-Z horror movie, but for a film in which the effects are the drawing-card, this one fumbles the ball right out of the gate. Surely Gordon didn't spend all his money on the cast: Marjoe Gortner, Ralph Meeker, Pamela Franklin, and most especially Ida Lupino all look as if they'd rather be elsewhere. Shockingly, the picture did attract some business, creating a small cult which lead to a quasi-sequel in 1989. NO STARS from ****
