1st watched 4/6/2008 - 4 out of 10(Dir-Sean McNamara): Harmless fluff, but poorly done at times. In this 3 Ninjas entry, the guys are spending time at their favorite amusement park for Tum Tum's birthday. A group of bad ninjas just happen to be attempting to take over the park for a ransom while they are there. The bad guys are led by Madusa(played by Loni Anderson) and assisted by a rare non-comic Jim Varney, who actually does a pretty good job as a villain. The movie starts with the 3 hero's doing a pretty cool obstacle course at their grandfather's place but learn a valuable lesson when he turns off the power and then makes them attempt it backwards. The lesson they learned, supposedly, is not to get a big head because they aced it going forwards but couldn't cut it backwards without power(believe it or not!!). This is later used by the guys in the final showdown with the baddies, which kind of brings their lesson back to them and creates kind of a purpose for their grandfather's teachings. I won't let you know what happens the 2nd time, in case you want to watch the movie yourself, but you can probably guess. This predictability, some obvious mistakes in the production(boom mikes and wires being visible) and the low acting expectations from most make this attempt at a fun kids movie even dismal to most kids, probably.
