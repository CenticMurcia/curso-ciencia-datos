When i got this, i was expecting some sort of knockoff wannabe of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" or such from the title "The Pod People". No such luck. A better title of this would have been "The Egg People".<br /><br />Oh jeez, what a stinker. And a pointless stinker. I felt sorry for the little alien kid, Trumpy, left alone in the forest at the end as i could just imagine it thinking, "What the hell did *I* do to deserve being abandoned like this?"<br /><br />Pointless story. Pointless "acting". Pointless editing. Everything and everything completely pointless. And why is it impossible to find a kid to do the dubbing voice for a kid? A woman's voice sounds like a woman's voice, not a little boy's. To hear a little boy speaking with a woman's voice was a bit startling. And a bit freaky.<br /><br />However, the movie wasn't a complete waste. The cat actor did an excellent job of being the cat hiding under the bed. Should have won an academy award for being "Best Supporting Cat Hiding Under a Bed in a Foreign Film."<br /><br />If you see this movie in a dollar bin, spend your hard-earned dollar on something else with actual value. This movie will just make you groan how you foolishly wasted good money.
