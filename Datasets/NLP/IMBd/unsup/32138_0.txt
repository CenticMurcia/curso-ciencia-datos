This was a pretty good PPV! The main event was the dream match with The Rock and Goldberg.. That was a entertaining match... I am a big Goldberg fan, so I enjoyed it all the way... But the best match was Lesnar/Cena... They are some kick ass wrestlers, and the match was very good! The worst match was Sean O'Haire vs. Rikishi... That wasn't very good.. But it was a good PPV.. Especially if you are a Goldberg fan! If you are a Goldberg fan, make sure to check out Unforgiven, Survivor series, and Bad Blood from 2003... But there is something special about Backlash... It was Goldbergs very first match in WWE... Some of the other matches at Backlash was the six-man tag match with Triple H, Chris Jericho, and Ric Flair vs. Booker T, Shawn Michaels, and Kevin Nash.. There is also a great cat fight backstage with Stacy Kiebler and Tori Wilson.. Make sure to check that out! Enjoy folks!
