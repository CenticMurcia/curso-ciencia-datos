I enjoyed high school musical 2 it is even better then the first one which sometimes doesn't work and the whole thing nose dives. The acting between Vanessa and Zak is 101% you could almost believe that they are head over heels in love when singing "you are the music in me" and "I gotta go my own way" Every member of the cast in fact gave a 100% for me. I loved it who said you have to be a child/teenager to watch and enjoy, Im 42 and I already cant wait for high school musical 3, its so nice to see young people enjoying life instead of all the hate and violence in society today and they managed to get their first kiss "cheers for them" maybe some young girls will be a bit disappointed with this or wish to be Vanessa or the boys wish to be Zak, ah the young, I was smiling remember my younger days too lol. Anyway don't take my word for it watch the film and see for yourself byeee
