Why is that when a director decides to make a "Cool" film they completely ignore the things that make films enjoyable, ie a decent story and interesting characters. The Doom Generation has no real story, it is just a road movie in its most basic form, the characters just stumble from one scene to the next. Basically it suffers from the worst complaint a film can suffer it is just boring.
