I went in to the cinema not really knowing what to expect of this film. I thought it might be another badly acted emotional film that bores you for 2 hours. But I was wrong. This film is superb. Will smith plays his part great and although it was very touching many parts of it were very funny.<br /><br />The story line was great and to think that the film was based on a true story it made me think about how lucky I was sitting watching a film on a 80 inch screen spending over £30 when this guys entire money was £20.<br /><br />When i got home that night and went to sleep i imagined what it must have been like for him and i felt as though i was a part of this mans life and thats what made the film so great.<br /><br />Throughout the film you wanted things to be good for this man. When things went bad you felt as though you wanted to help.<br /><br />I loved this film and i think many others will too.<br /><br />I hope you found this useful.
