Whomever had the bright idea to cast Jamie-Lynn DiScala as the notorious Hollywood madam deserves to be fired on the spot. The girl is hot? yes. Can see act? No Her attempt are laughable and her refusal to disrobe leads the director to have the most obvious body double I have EVERY witnessed. This barely passes muster as a TV movie, the "unrated" version is beyond laughable.Steer clear, this film blows harder the the real Mrs. Fleiss did when she was getting started.<br /><br />Eye Candy: Most of the time when you see Jamie-Lynn DiScala naked it's a body double (I know BOOO!!), but the first time when she dances for Robert Davi you can see a nip slip, not much I know but the best you gonna get; also Emmanuelle Vaugier shows her ass <br /><br />My Grade: D-
