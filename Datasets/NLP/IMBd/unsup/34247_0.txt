i went into this expecting a documentary, or a biopic, or at least a drama that examined the events that occurred around this guy. what i got was a crappy comedy that played like a rip-off of catch me if you can. it seemed to me like they filmed several separate "incidents" that they found funny, then remembered that films are supposed to have plots, so they threw in one scene introducing his roommate as some guy smoking pot on his couch, and then we were expected to have an emotional reaction later on in the hospital scene when he's there and malkovich is pretending not to recognize him? the subplot with the escort service went nowhere and neither did the newspaper one. this director needs some practice.
