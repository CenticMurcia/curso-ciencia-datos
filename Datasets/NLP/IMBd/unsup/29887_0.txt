What is and never should be is great insight into the character development of the two main protagonists. I love how the show talks about Dean's need for family stability; Sam and Dean's relationship is glued by their work; They are so different they complement each other. Dean's over confidence cause the show trouble, and his duty and honor is his salvation. Dean's life would be one of trouble if he never had the outlet of hunting. The monster is well done. The ending gives the reason for the mission, and create round characters out of Sam and Dean. 10 out of 10. Watch the summer rerun. What is and never should be is a fresh and different episode which build depth for the series.
