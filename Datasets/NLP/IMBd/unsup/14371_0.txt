This film has very well-written script. The characters are nicely-paralleled, simultaneously mirroring one another in their fundamental psychological struggles and diverging in their drives, desires, and ideals. The whole storyline is a psychotic eruption of social inadequacies combined with the ever-present question of whether or not our actions are to be judged by an absolute morality.<br /><br />With regards to character development, the script may have been better carried by stronger acting -- the internal development was present, but was not sufficiently layered within the characters.<br /><br />Overall, the film is sufficiently suspenseful to hold the attention of the audience.
