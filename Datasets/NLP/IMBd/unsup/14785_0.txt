I believe that Karan Johar has amazing capacity to make people laugh or cry.<br /><br />In this melodramatic movie he has put very nice and humorous patches of comedy. But I strongly believe that the movie is with plenty unforgivable loopholes. I cant understand how a person with such a serious heart trouble can run like Carl Louis, dance like Michael Jackson and sing like Enrique.<br /><br />Please make some realistic hindi movie like Satya.
