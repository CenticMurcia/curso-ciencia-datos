Duped! Yeah, totally duped... You know Dimension Extreme has given us all some really great stuff, but they have also given us some really, really, REALLY bad stuff - Steep Trap falls into the latter. Now coming from someone who is very much into the horror genre and can usually find some shining moments in the worst of the worst gore or scare flicks, I really can't think of one nice thing to say about this one except for - It was so bad I laughed a few times... But not in the way a Troma movie is so bad it made you laugh. No, no, no, Steel Trap was just really bad. At a upscale New Years party on the top of an abandoned high rise, several extremely annoying individuals are invited down a few floors to where the "real party is at". The unlikable ensemble quickly find out that this is no party at all as one by one they all begin to suffer very uninventive and forgettable ends to their miserable lives. They all must play the killer's game till the end or suffer an ill fate at the hands of a truly laughable silver masked maniac. Horror fans, do yourself a favor and skip out on this one. There are no inventive deaths, no well built suspense, no likable characters, atrocious acting - good and evil, and worst of all the dialouge is so forced it will embarrass you to no end.
