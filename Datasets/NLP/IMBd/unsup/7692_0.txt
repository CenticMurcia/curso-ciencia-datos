I loved this movie as a kid. It's a great suspenseful, spooky movie without any gore because of the time period it was made in. <br /><br />Back then they had to rely on a plot to get the audiences attention.<br /><br />I am desperate to buy this movie on DVD.<br /><br />I hope someday someone will put it on DVD.<br /><br />It's a treasure that should not be lost.<br /><br />If anyone comes across source we can buy this from, I hope they will post it to let us all know.<br /><br />At this point I have to fill in the 10 lines of text this thing says I have to have to post a comment :-(
