Meryl Streep was so poor and rigid in her role as the therapist, that I almost left the theater before it was over. I could say that the movie looked more like the the takes rather than the actual movie. Uma was silly and stupid and the role was just not believable. The young man did well for having such a poor cast to work with. I think it was a great idea for a story but poorly cast, poorly paced and could have used much better direction and writing of the plot. The dialog fell short and flat. To name the many problems with this film would take far too much time and frankly doesn't warrant any more of my thought. I wouldn't waste any money to see this, if you haven't already. Very disappointing.
