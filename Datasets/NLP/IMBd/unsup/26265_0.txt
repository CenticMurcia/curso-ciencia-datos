Well, I would've given this a half-point, if I'd been able; one is being generous. This makes John Carpenter's 'Vampires' look like fine film, and 'From Dusk Till Dawn' look like an academy award winner. Barely a plot, dialogue, uh... did anyone go to school?, special effects imported from a bad video game, vampire teeth that were 100 for 99 cents, characters that were such low-life losers that I was hoping the vamps would get them, just to put me out of my misery.<br /><br />Someone should keep Daniel Baldwin away from the buffets, and let's hope the producers of this mess never get it into their heads again that they should make a movie. It wasn't even bad enough to be funny. Best line in the film? "Don't let him bite you!"
