This show was, surprisingly, a huge disappointment to me---the self-proclaimed best "The Nanny" fan this side of the Mississippi! For one, no true mention of why "Niles" was missing was ever mentioned and I truly missed him. I found this distracting wondering throughout the show if there may have been a dispute and he refused to come on or, worse yet, he was suffering from some deadly disease! "Niles" was a huge contributor to the hilarious, unique and inimitable success and humor of the show and it would have been awesome to have seen some interaction in real life with him and "CC". Also, "Mr. Sheffield" barely acknowledged "Brighton" and I cringed when I could visibly see the hurt in his (Brighton's) eyes. I wanted to hear lots more from "Sylvia" who I also adore and, of course, "Val" who was the epitome of "Ethel" from "I Love Lucy". It was nice as always to see Fran's real parents who are a blast. To me, the show was hastily put together with no thought to detail and what the fans wanted. All in all, it should have been longer, more detailed and could have used many more comments from the show's cast members rather than centering on "Mr. & Mrs. Sheffield". Incidentally, where were "the twins"
