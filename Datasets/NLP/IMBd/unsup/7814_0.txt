I am a fervent fan of the genre of horror / suspense and for that, being Argentina, interested me much the plot of the movie. It is not a masterpiece but I liked the plot. As there Master of Horror in an episode that just deals of former Vietnam veterans returning to life to exercise their vote. Not that it's a similarity, but they are realities. Besides I liked the shots made in Patagonia, Argentina. Very consistent with the film. I speak Spanish, but sometimes talked so fast and closed it is not understood. Of course each one has his accent. The name of the movie also liked me, Appeared Vs. Disappeared. I think that the end is the best.
