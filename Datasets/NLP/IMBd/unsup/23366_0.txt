I first saw this DVD about three weeks ago - nestling in the bargain bin in Morrison's supermarket.<br /><br />It was cheap t Â£2.99...though the packaging looked anything but: and the striking image on the front of the box interested me. Two Korean Soldiers...with different uniforms, stood in front of the massive turbo-prop of an American fighter. I didn't buy it at the time but it registered within my weary , troubled mind.<br /><br />The word 'Dongmakgol' stayed with me and I remembered to check it out on the internet movie database - a brilliant resource for film fans.<br /><br />I took the plunge a fortnight later & added it to my collection... ... I've now watched this movie twice in the space of four days. What can I say? Well, it has a most marvellous musical score...which I thought I'd heard before. As time went by I realised it's the same music used in Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan'....which I think was shot before 'Dong' but I'm, not sure...we might have a chicken and egg situation here because the films are, in my opinion of equal merit...and I loved 'Ryan' and its message with a similar evangelical zeal.<br /><br />If you're the type of person who does not mind subtitling and are prepared to invest a couple of hours and more into the cinematic experience then I'd urge you to buy this little masterpiece. I say 'little' but it isn't really...everything about this production says big-time to me. I do not know how vibrant or productive the Korean film industry is but if this example is anything to go by I need to find out more.<br /><br />Set during the Korean war it tells the tale of some disaffected troops from either side. The Communist north, and the 'puppet' army (according to the commies) from the south who are being aided and abetted by western forces. It's September 1950.<br /><br />By chance the stragglers find themselves ensconced in a small village, both isolated and remote. It's people are hitherto untouched by war , or indeed much of the outside world. Some of the English used in the captions is quite comical, and there are several smile out loud moments - if that makes any sense. There is also violence, and graphic death by gunfire. All of which is essential to the telling of the story. The contrasting nature of the worlds in collision here...from peaceful serenity and unconditional humanity, to brute force and ignorance.<br /><br />The innocence and naivety of the villagers is captured by the film's female lead. A delightful teenager who wafts in and out of scenes with flowers in her hair and wide eyed with a simple outlook on life. She's not quite 'the full shilling' yet somehow has a soothing, calming effect on almost everyone she meets. Her sweet, innocent face is a picture of all you'd want to celebrate in this often worrying world.<br /><br />Also taking refuge in the village is the downed pilot of a UN recconaisance aircraft....brilliant 'crash' scenes incidentally...gut wrenchingly terrifying.<br /><br />The hostility between the groups is tangible for a while, and an incident with a hand grenade results in the total destruction of the villagers food store. The film constantly surprised the unwary. They all pledge to helping the locals replenish stocks...as winter is fast approaching.<br /><br />The six who form the warring factions form an uneasy alliance as the story moves on. The simple life of the villagers, and the life they lead soon starts to lull the protagonists into believing they've been there for years! They are welcomed to Dongmakgol.Smiles abound, friendships are forged and the incomers weave their way into the tapestry of village life. Especially after helping overcome a quite terrifying wild boar...this sequence was stunning, yet simplistic and I realised I was watching a master film maker open mouthed in near wonderment. How I enjoyed watching my wife view the same scenes a day or two later...she too was captivated.<br /><br />The good times cannot last of course and soon paratroops are invading the area ahead of a bombing raid which threatens to annihilate the village and everyone in it. Sacrifice is called for , and the recent arrivals are not found wanting in what amounts to a fitting, poignant climax to a memorable movie. What now emerges is a band of brothers newly united in a common cause.<br /><br />This is the first Korean film I've seen , it perhaps will not be the last. I loved almost every moment of it & have elevated it toward the near top of my league...yes! it really is that good.
