The film has an identity problem. Is it an action flick or an adventure flick? Is it a film noir? Dialogue stilted. Action scenes out of the Saturday serials. And what about the title. There are almost no women in it. Vincent is great as an over blown actor. Not worth seeking out but if it is all that is on, it is fun to watch good actors try to make something of this. Not one of Howard's best efforts. Mitchem is Mitchem and Russel is almost not there. Plot is unbelievable. the evil German doctor would have been better played by Peter Lorie. Perhaps he was busy. This was the 1950's and stereotypes were the norm. A little more thought and they could have written something worthwhile. Too bad.
