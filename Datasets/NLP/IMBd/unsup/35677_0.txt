The Invaders (a Quinn Martin production!) is widely regarded as one of the best sci-fi shows of the sixties or ever. I only ever saw it in re-runs here in England, but I just loved the original show. So imagine my excitement when I started reading in genre magazines that a new Invaders was going to be made. And Roy Thinnes was in!<br /><br />Oh. Dear.<br /><br />The pre-credits sequence was actually pretty good. Somewhere out in the desert a huge and interesting-looking mothership is unloading some aliens and stuff, and there watching it all is none other than David Vincent.<br /><br />And that was the end of any hope of a good series. The rest is quite frankly too bad to detail. The effects were cheesy, it was PAINFULLY slow, and worst of all, Roy Thinnes has a total of about ten minutes screen-time across the first part and then vanishes. So that's it? They get Roy Thinnes to reprise his near-thirty year old role and THAT'S IT!!!<br /><br />Roy Thinnes as David Vincent was the only reason I was interested in this. Richard Thomas is pretty good - although he still looks about 25 and as if he just wandered off the set of The Waltons.<br /><br />All in all, give your money to a homeless person, you'll get better returns.
