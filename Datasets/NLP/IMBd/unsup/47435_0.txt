It's hard to image a major motion picture any worse than this turkey.<br /><br />Absolutely NOTHING makes any sense. Action sequences are so poorly<br /><br />executed, you wonder if perhaps they hired brain-damaged high school<br /><br />students to do most of the work.<br /><br />Some favorites, not already mentioned: <br /><br />The ranch-hand must ride on the outside of the helicopter. Dumb enough, but why<br /><br />then fly DIRECTLY over the mouth of the volcano? You must be kidding.<br /><br />-And when the guy predictably falls, we first see him fall backwards away from the 'copter, but them the immediate cut-away shot shows him clearly falling in a FORWARD roll. oops.<br /><br />I also enjoyed seeing telephone poles fall over without anything hitting them, and as they fall over they don't looked cracked at all, just perfect horizontal bottoms that weren't really even in the ground.<br /><br />Some guy's whole back catches on fire, and he rolls around for about ten<br /><br />seconds. when they finally put out the flames, only a small part of the top of his jacket is scorched.<br /><br />two people are flying past the smoking volcano in a helicopter. It suddenly<br /><br />explodes with a loud crack and flames. Neither person reacts at all.<br /><br />You could go on and on and on. Every few seconds there's another blatant goof or monumentally stupid scene.<br /><br />You know, if someone made an edited DVD of this, with all the boring "personal interaction" scenes deleted, and ran a commentary along with the action, this would be possibly the most hilarious movie ever put out.
