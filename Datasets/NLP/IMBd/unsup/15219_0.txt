I wish I haven't watched even one part of this movie. There is nothing special but violence, rape and great amount of blood. It was incredibly disgusting. I do think that the movie also had the worst reputation ever by the viewers. As far as I remember, it was on theaters only for two weeks. What an unfeasible investment!!! I've seen it on TV, I do tried to be patient during the movie just to be able to criticize in the end. Wathcing the whole movie may be the best way to torture yourself :) I remember the movie Clockwork Orange , and the leading actor who was sentenced to watch such war violence scenes for hours without being capable of closing his eyes.Turkish directors have presented a number of good films which deserve appreciation. Try any of them but "Barda"...
