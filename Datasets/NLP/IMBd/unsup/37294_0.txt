As far as these "true death" documentaries go, I've seen a few of the "Faces of Death" films and one of those "Death Scenes" tapes a while back, but I can't say I am really "into" these. It's mindless "shock" and if you like stuff that will upset you than, by all means, seek out "Traces of Death", but this type of "entertainment" doesn't really "blow my mind". So, as most people have come to learn, the majority of those "Faces of Death" movies were faked, so it seems that "Traces" wanted to just pack as much REAL death and injury footage as they could - probably in an attempt to 'make up' for "Faces" deceit. There is occasional narration in this one and some repetitive keyboard music (I haven't seen any of the sequels but I hear they switch it up to death metal) over home video and news reel footage of animal attacks, racing accidents, suicides, murders and stock autopsy footage. Most of this actually bored me as I can only watch so much cadaver carving before I am ready to watch something else. These scenes go on way too long which just led me to believe that there wasn't enough images to display to last an hour... Of course, the notorious pig scene is what everyone talks about - a gruesome bit of animal experimentation where some guys take a flame thrower to a shaved pig until it's skin melts off... Yeah, okay. At least "Faces of Death" had that so-called doctor on there adding some commentary to the scenes and without that here in "Traces", it just moves along slow and is just ridiculous to actually sit through... Unless you enjoy gross imagery, "Traces of Death" will most definitely leave you unimpressed and unfulfilled...
