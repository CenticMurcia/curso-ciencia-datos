I first saw this movie a few years back on sky movies. At the time I was really in to the paranormal and other stuff like that. I stayed over at a friends house and we watched this movie and I was so scared at the end I didn't even pay attention to the end credits and see they were all actors. I found out it was a fake because of the research I had done on the film when I was looking for it online. I finally got to see it again last night and it's not as scary as I remembered. Sure there were parts to it that made the hairs on the back of my neck stand on end but it didn't freak me out as much as it did back in the day lol.<br /><br />The film itself is shot much like the Blair witch project. I.E it's all shot "amateur-ish" by Tommy McPherson at his family's thanks giving dinner. So out comes a lot of wobbly camera action as he tries to catch it all on film.<br /><br />This film has all the classic abduction scenario's with the family suffering from loss of electricity, loss of time, cow mutilations in the field, nose bleeds, marks on their bodies etc. But it was all done well enough to lose yourself in this film.<br /><br />If you're looking for a good fun movie to give the chills and make you think about whether or not there is life out there and are they as hostile as the ones here, then watch this movie. I guarantee after you watch this you will be a bit more hesitant to venture out at night during a power cut ;-)
