I'm afraid I learned nothing from this movie. It isn't a smart satire on the detached upper middle classes and how they put up a gate between themselves and the violent world outside. It isn't a dark comedy of manners. It's really just a slow paced slasher movie promoting and celebrating mindless violence for entertainment. It has about as much social significance as I Know What You Did Last Summer. I particularly despise the use of killing a child for nothing more than shock value. If you are distracted by the art house aesthetic and use of cinematic and audio editing techniques and don't agree then I'd like to present the classic horror/slasher/suspense scenario for your consideration. <br /><br />Spoiler: One of the victims escapes the clutches of the psychos and runs into the deserted neighbourhood only to flag down a vehicle driven by - yes you guessed it, one of the psychos who brings her straight back to the house where she was originally imprisoned. It's played a little differently as he isn't the driver of the first car she sees but it's the same tired old trite clich√© you've seen before so many times.<br /><br />As for the excruciatingly predictable ending, I really could have written the last line myself half way through the movie, (sealed in in an envelope and posted it to myself and it would have been delivered before the end of the movie which felt like forever in arriving). And it has one of those endings that you think to yourself 'is that is?' And unfortunately 'that is it'. A movie about two motiveless two dimensional psycho killers with no explanation or conclusion to satisfy the viewer. It addresses the issue of violence and its affects on an ineffectual society just about as much as the latest Rambo movie does. It seeks to do so and aims but misses by a mile. Just glossy violence and nothing more.
