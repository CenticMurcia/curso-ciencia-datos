The first time I saw this movie, I sat there scratching my head, thinking: What am I watching? The movie plot is so far out with non-sequiturs that it has to be good, right? Hydrophobic (no, not rabid, actually harmed by water)monsters, who in turn are controlled by amphibious aliens. This stuff is great. Side note: I liked the nod to Ridley Scott's "Alien" on the young girl's hat, which read USS Nostromo.
