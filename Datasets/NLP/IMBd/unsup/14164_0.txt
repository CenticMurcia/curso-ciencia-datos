Night of the Living Dead (1990) was the feature length directorial debut of Special F.X. master/Actor/Stuntman Tom Savini. He made a fun remake/ update of the seminal zombie/apocalyptic horror classic. Even though the film had a low budget, the effects were amazing. Tony Todd and Patricia Tallman play the leads whilst perennial cult villain Tom Towles co-stars as well. The film for the most part is a scene-for-scene redux with a few changes (that I found quite refreshing I might add).<br /><br />Some fans of the original have been critical of this movie for some reason. I was stoked when this movie came out and when I left the cinema I was satisfied with the end results. Tom Savini did very well and I hope he gets a chance to direct in the near future.<br /><br />Recommended for genre fans
