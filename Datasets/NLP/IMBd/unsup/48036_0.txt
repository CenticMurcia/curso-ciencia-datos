Sorry, I really didn't care for this movie. I wanted to very much. I just couldn't make myself like it. <br /><br />All of the plot points center on a shower in a vacation house on the Cote d'Azur. So much happens in the shower that not titling it Le Douche is almost false advertising. If the shellfish referred to in the French title--and in song--have some sly double entendre meaning, it went over my head. Are they referring to males and females acting like males and females? Oh. How clever.<br /><br />The comedic slash farce-like plot never interested me for one moment. <br /><br />I didn't like the characters very much either, all of whom were self-centered and deceiving each other in some way. I particularly disliked the son who is, I think, supposed to be sexy and cute and the main attraction for us gay guys. I found his nonstop petulance and chip-on-shoulder teenager act really irritating but not quite as irritating as his ridiculous lion's mane hairdo. And I usually like guys with long hair. . . . .<br /><br />But the worst, for me, was seeing the characters "step outside the frame" of the movie and sing songs directly to the viewer. Let me tell you, Umbrellas of Cherbourg it ain't. It only happens a couple times, thank god, but that was more than enough. Could this be intended as a self-referential tongue-in-cheek comment on French films by a French filmmaker? I don't think so, but that might be one explanation. . . .
