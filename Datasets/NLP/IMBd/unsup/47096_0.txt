Story was relatively boring. Directing was definitely boring. Some of the dialogue was a little too predictable.<br /><br />The one clever item was the deal with "Ritz" and trying to figure out for a moment how someone found Henry after he took off by himself. (I won't write a spoiler.)<br /><br />This movie is _not_ worth the two hours spent on it.
