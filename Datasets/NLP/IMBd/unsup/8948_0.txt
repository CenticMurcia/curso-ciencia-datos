Some of the other reviews adequately cover the actual synopsis - I just wanted to comment on the way that Jim Mickle and his team (especially the actors and camera crew) seem to have pulled a rather good rabbit out of a low budget hat. <br /><br />Using the camera well with a lot of close ups,speeding things up when appropriate to cover for lower budget make-up effects - which I thought were pretty good anyway, creating characters that you actually care about (loved the 2 old guys), and some really nice and clever ideas, like the photo of the 3 main characters held by the army girl, fading over to a different picture from the same film, owned by her father, was very nice. The characters are not idiots, and what a pleasure it was to see people react to danger in a way that you would like to think you would too - instead of the usual imbeciles.<br /><br />I'd heard that they had to film the outdoor New York scenes on the hoof without permission, but the way it was done, I never really noticed, as I was too drawn up in the story. (I'm in Scotland, so I wouldn't be aware of any technical errors in the locations).<br /><br />Well done people, a really enjoyable experience. What a contrast to the last film I saw (My Wife and My Dead Wife (1/10)), thanks guys for restoring my faith that there are some film-makers (and indeed talented actors) with intelligence and creativity who can use low budget challenges in a positive manner.
