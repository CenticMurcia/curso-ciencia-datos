After a series of silly, fun-loving movies, 1955 was a big year for Doris Day. That year saw her handed the role of singer Ruth Etting, who made it to the top but whose personal life suffered for her success.<br /><br />The film begins with a chance meeting by Etting at a dime-a-dance joint with gangster Martin Snyder, brilliantly played by James Cagney. Cagney, with his connections, brings stardom to Etting, but she loses her freedom to a miserable existence dominated by Snyder, who ultimately marries her, after a memorable fight on opening night at the Ziegfeld Follies.<br /><br />Day's singing was never better. In addition to the old Etting favorites, she sings the new song I'll Never Stop Loving You.<br /><br />Cowboy movie actor, Cameron Mitchell, turns in an equally strong performance as piano player, Johnny Alderman, who leaves Etting, out of disgust for the way she is being dominated, only to encounter her years later, when the two of them are working on a movie. Their revived romance leads to near tragedy.<br /><br />Cagney received a well-deserved Oscar Nomination. To this day, I'll never understand why Day and the film were overlooked for Oscar nominations.
