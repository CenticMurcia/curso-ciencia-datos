This works more as an advise than a proper review. Even if you're a fan of the series, stay away from this movie.<br /><br />And I say it because I AM a fan of Death Note. Read the manga from beginning to end, it's superb! I thought, after watching the movie preview, that it would as good as the manga was, or at least fun.<br /><br />I was wrong, the acting is as poor as it gets, reminding me of Japanese tokusatsu. The characters get so distorted in relation to the manga that it is painful to watch it for too long, and I don't mean that as purist fan, the characters just lose all defined personality, all traits that would make them lovable. Instead the movie forces you to hate them. I didn't want to, but I do.<br /><br />I can't really see a reason to like this movie. I gave it a 2 just out of sympathy for the series.
