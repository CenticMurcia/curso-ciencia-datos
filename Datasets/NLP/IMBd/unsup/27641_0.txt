This is one of the better Tom and Jerry cartoons to prominently feature music. For some reason, whenever music was a focus, the short was usually excellent (examples include, Solid Serenade, Johann Mouse, Pecos Pest and, obviously, The Cat Concerto). Here, there's a hilarious song at the outset, over the opening credits and a bit later, Tom does his best impersonation of a cross between Tex Ritter and Milli Vanilli. Jerry, for a good many reasons, does his best to destroy Tom's romantic intentions (hey, what are "friends" for?) and largely succeeds. At cartoon's end, we leave amid the strains of another musical interlude and a twisted variation on an old cliche of the western genre and a good time is had by all, except Tom, of course. Well worth tracking down and most highly recommended.
