Sorry, I dozed off for a minute just *thinking* about this one. Which is hardly surprising, since my girlfriend and I literally dozed off watching the video last night-- and have no desire to try revivifying "Arn" again this evening.<br /><br />There are some commendable production values on display here from time to time, and perhaps these are significantly augmented during in-theatre presentations. But no venue is capable of injecting nuance, breadth or development generally into the opaque characters who march through this thing, most especially the hero.<br /><br />In short, the endless, sententious and overblown "Arn" comes across like an epic dreadfully in need of an attack by the Monty Python company. Otherwise, bring a pillow.
