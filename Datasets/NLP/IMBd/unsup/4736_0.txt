Romantic Comedy doesn't get much better than this. A well plotted, captivating, and 21st century mature idealism of blossoming true love. A film in the same vein as Sleepless in Seattle to which this movie pays homage. Kate Hudson is simply great and more beautiful than ever. Matthew McConaughey really surprised me because he has played this role before without conviction. Also, it was fun watching both Bebe Neuwirth and Mr. "Sun Spit Morning" himself Robert Klein in their small but important "boss" roles. This wonderful chick flick (for chicks who love movies and guys who love chicks) is a real keeper.
