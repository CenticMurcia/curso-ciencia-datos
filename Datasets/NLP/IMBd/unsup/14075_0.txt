Perhaps the most bizarre murder(?) case I've ever heard of, it was fascinating to follow on the news. When I heard they made a movie out of it, I was skeptical. Fortunately, it has been done the right way. No major names in the cast - a huge plus. No Steven Soderbergh, Gus van Sant, or Spielberg as director (nor would they ever dare touch this kind of subject matter). The photography is appropriately dark, somber. Having the main characters speak English with a German accent (i.e. have German actors) was an okay choice, too, the alternatives being American/British accents or German with subtitles (bad options). The idea of having Russell as a sort of physically existent narrator was okay, as well. The story is written as a drama, which then, of course, turns into horror. However, no graphic showings of severed limbs or penises flying through rooms, which would have cheapened the overall effect. Fans of "Saw" should stay away from this: it is not an idiotic/illogical thriller about torturing innocent people. GL hasn't got quite the level of realism of the terrific "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer", but it's head-and-shoulders above the vast majority of wannabe gloomy movies that are out there, in this regard. GL is also surprisingly brief, under 90 minutes. Considering how much there was to this case, perhaps a little short, but on the other hand, it's tight and never dull.
