This movie is one of my favorite movies. It is a 10 out of 10. Comedy, Drama, Nostalgia, and the multiple plots being introduced throughout the movie. Never mind the other critic, I have shown this movie with English subtitles to over 15 non-Yugoslav friends both male and female and they loved it. I've watched it over ten times, very very funny movie. The best comedy is between the soldier Paunovich and his lieutenant. I recommend this movie to everyone, but especially to the Yugoslav folks who enjoyed their life in the Former Yugoslavia because it will give you a good feeling of being there for 90 minutes. The reason I've watched it over ten times.
