Overall this film was well acted, at least on the part of the main characters.<br /><br />The major issue I had with the film was the fact that after this guy, Max, admits to raping Julietta (she is indignant and mad for a whole five minutes) she forgives him. At this point she is pregnant and doesn't know if it is Max or Jiri's kid, but breaks up with Jiri for no real reason and has dinner with Max. As a woman I found this whole part to the story to be completely far-fetched.<br /><br />I also found that the film's language was a lot stronger than I thought it would be and the sex scenes were quite...detailed.<br /><br />On the whole I didn't enjoy this film - the storyline's fault.
