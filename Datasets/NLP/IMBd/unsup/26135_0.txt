Not saying this isn't an excellent film, it is just bluntly honest. I remember in English class in high school, we were learning about racism in the 60's, and how horrible it was. The worst part was that I am from a very racist town, unfortunately, and watching the beginning of the film terrified me because I felt like this world hadn't changed since I felt like I was living that film. Being one voice sometimes can either be helpful or get you into a lot of trouble.<br /><br />I didn't want to see this film again because of the awful situations I saw or heard of. Now, I am out on my own, and I had the chance to see the movie once again, and felt that I could see it. It's a terrific and very powerful movie that can get anyone to cry unbearably. It's not just the actors, but Gene and William's characters, I wanted to be just like them, they were able to stand up even though the many times of being knocked down and caring so much just to try to in some way save that town.<br /><br />I honestly feel that everyone should see this movie, it can change your life or make you look around and want to change things. I know this comment feels more like a lecture than a comment, but that's how much this movie got to me. I think we all can do something right in this world, it's just a matter or standing up. Even if this film isn't historically accurate, it's accurate enough to see how people treat other people. Hopefully, we will have a better future for generations to come.<br /><br />9/10
