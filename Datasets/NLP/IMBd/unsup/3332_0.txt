Saw The Hurt Locker 7 days prior to watching Tunnel Rats. Tunnel Rats wins in a big way!! There was no main character in Tunnel Rats, and these guys were all regular Army. I was on the edge of my seat AND emotionally attached to these characters. There were at least 10 characters (3 or 4 of them enemy) that had some sort of character development and that takes place in the first 45 minutes of the film. It was slow at first, but once the first person enters the tunnel you'll feel like you're right there in Nam INSIDE THAT TUNNEL!!! I felt like I was crawling in there alongside these guys fighting my way through just trying to survive and find my way out. The tunnel confrontations were incredibly tense and gripping! I liked how the "Gooks" were portrayed as well, especially the female. The production values were well above B-movie grade. The cinematography was well done with some very thoughtfully choreographed shots with the Huey and the scenery. The soundtrack was quite appropriate as well. The DVD release takes out the really gory kill scenes, but you will have seen enough to imagine what just happened. When the really gory deaths occur there is a freeze frame and sometimes a brief drop to black. If you want to see all the gory deaths later on you can choose to do so in the Deleted Scenes section. The gory deaths are so horrifying that I think it's a good idea that they were cut out so that you don't just zone out and miss the next 20 seconds of intense action and suspense! If you enjoy war movies or are a student of Vietnam War history, this is a must see!
