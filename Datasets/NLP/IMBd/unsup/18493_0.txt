If this movie ever plays at your local art house... or you happen to find a screening copy on video -- do yourself a big favor and check it out. <br /><br />In this day and age when most young directors get their first shot, they make some wannabe post-Tarantino gangsta film. But the filmmakers here decided to take their shot and create a celluloid love letter to a bygone era. Their vision is much like the main character of Johnny Twennies, a man literally out of time with the modern world. But like the movie, Johnny has more style and charm than anything that came out of the 90's. The homages to Harold Lloyd, the Marx Brothers and black and white film noir in general are simply brilliant.<br /><br />This is the kind of charming movie that Woody Allen USED to make. Too bad "Man of the Century" isn't more widely available. Whoever owns the video rights to this is sitting on a gem.
