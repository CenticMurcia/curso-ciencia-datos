Angry spoilers ahead After what seems an eternity, finally this movie was apparently coming to an end, but the worst was yet to come: Lambert's wife, who is also imprisoned, is about to give birth to her child. As if in a parody of the Argentina of the 80's, the Government wants to steal the children from her for some hideous purpose. The funny thing is that they don't wait until the woman brings her baby in the world naturally. Oh, no: they're going to use a saw to open her womb and take out the baby while killing her. When she realizes what's happening, the woman starts shouting and calling for her husband, who was precisely running along the prison two corridors away, hears hem and says something like "I'm coming, honey!!" This movie is THIS sophisticated, from the beginning and until the very end. If you find it on TV, DVD, or whatever... Please don't waste part of your precious lifetime in this
