Angus is a film in which some might identify with...you have all those fun issues as a child..angus addresses a few with respect. I could watch this film over and over. The cast is great, not too over-acted ..just right. First time I ever wanted to hear what George C. Scott had to say..and now I must watch again to hear him again..Point is this movie is a gentle look at the life of a kid with a few problems that only others seem to have. Ohh..and great soundtrack also!!
