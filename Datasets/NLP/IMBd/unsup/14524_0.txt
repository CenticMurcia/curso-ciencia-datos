I saw this film when I was just a teenager and I loved it. The characters are believable and the story is interesting. Jessie, although only 13, isn't treated like a baby, even when she messes up. The teenage boy isn't a disrespectful, selfish dummy only out for one thing and he's still sexy and cool.<br /><br />Now that the movie has come out on DVD and I have a daughter of my own in her early teens, I can't wait to watch it with her. As a family movie, it will give parents and kids the opportunity to talk about why it's important to be honest and that being okay with who you are is always a better idea. Highly recommended.
