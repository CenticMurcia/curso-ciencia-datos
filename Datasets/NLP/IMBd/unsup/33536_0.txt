This movie is well meant but poorly made...<br /><br />I don't know how much sense that makes in English, but i hope it's pretty clear what i meant.<br /><br />Indeed i appreciate his (by my knowledge) original idea but Max became at some point annoying. He kept repeating himself (although he disliked that...) and come on... every killer must have a reason for his murders (even a hidden one or something...).<br /><br />After watching this movie (and even while watching it) i kept asking myself why am i torturing myself?, and my only answer was that i can't hardly wait for it to end so i can make some sense of it...<br /><br />That never happened and i was left (at the end of the movie) in almost total darkness. Or maybe i did not understand what they meant to say... Maybe...<br /><br />However, i have rarely seen more uninteresting movies...<br /><br />In the end i would like to apologize for my bad English (i' not a native speaker), and i hope i made my point clear. For constructive criticism, feel free to reply!
