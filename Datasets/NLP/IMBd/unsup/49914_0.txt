I am a big big fan of "Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain". In fact, it's one of my favorite movies of all time. A friend told me about Odette Toulemonde and since she loves Amélie too, I got the DVD and just watched it.<br /><br />And I am feeling very sorry and most of all disappointed now. While the movie was clearly inspired by Amélie (to say the VERY least!), it never ever gets there. Not even close.<br /><br />The story is totally made up nonsense. It's actually SO made up, the characters are SO two-dimensional and uninteresting, the whole thing is SO senseless and boring it actually started to hurt physically.<br /><br />And while Audrey Tautou is just totally cute and lovable and Amélie Poulain is a multi-faceted, well constructed character, Caterine Frot - sadly - has no comedic talent whatsoever and her character Odette Toulemonde is dull, uninteresting and flat.<br /><br />The acting in general is way beyond terrible, so at least it's not Caterine alone that makes this movie an epic fail in my book. <br /><br />Forgive my rave, but I expected something soooo different - especially since it tries so hard to "be" Amélie. I realize, that (reading the other comments) not very much people will agree with me, but nevertheless it's how I feel.<br /><br />And oh, I got a DVD for sale, if you are interested ;-)
