I've read some the reviews that people made in regards to this movie and all I can say is take it easy - this movie DOES NOT deplict the average latino but it does reflect a funny view to the Casanova that is actually a nice guy who actually falls for 3 different ladies.<br /><br /> If this movie was made with pure white/anglo/european actors and it was called Chasing Stud - I'm sure the anglo community wouldn't be so agitated by the flick.<br /><br /> In the DVD the director mentioned that that she wanted to capture the goofy and fun-loving interaction from the movies in the 60's like What's Up Doc with Barbara Stresan and she succeeded with this movie.<br /><br /> As a latino - I do not find this movie at all offensive to my latin culture (Puerto Rican/Colombian) and everyone (family/friends)I talked to about this movie found it to be cute and funny.<br /><br /> So, sit back, watch, crack up and enjoy the movie!!!!1
