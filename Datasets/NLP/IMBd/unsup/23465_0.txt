Yeah, yeah, another slasher film with a killer killing people. It's great that the movie centers around mostly a gay cast and I did enjoy some of the twist and turns, some scares and gross outs, and the acting, but you would think that by today's standards, in the era of the 'smart' horror film, we would get an answer as to why the killer is killing and who is he. I've seen all the horror films where people kill just to kill and I'm bored of that. If a reason was stated why this guy was killing, I would have most likely told people to see this movie. I felt just like the guy at the beginning of the movie who was getting a you-know-what, when the film was just about to reach climax, it cut its own head off!!!
