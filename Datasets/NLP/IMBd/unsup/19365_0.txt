I have recently spent many an hour watching the feature length films of Charlie Chaplin and have grown to appreciate just what a fantastic film maker he truly was.having now watched 'The Circus' for the first time in it's entirety,I believe that it should be ranked amongst his very finest works.<br /><br />The plot of the movie may be a little flimsy and it could be described as a series of sketches rather than a feature film.But that shouldn't detract from the many merits that this film has.There are so many scenes of creative brilliance;the hall of mirrors,pretending to be an automaton,the chase in the circus ring,the fabulous tight rope segment.These all go to show what a great movie legend Chaplin was and he should be regarded in the very highest esteem.<br /><br />'The Circus'may not be Chaplin's very best movie,but it is a joy to watch,especially when you consider the turmoil he was going through while he was making it.
