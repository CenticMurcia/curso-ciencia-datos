This is one of my five favorite comedy movies.<br /><br />Mary Gross gives an inspired and hilarious performance as the nerdy, neophyte, near-Fed.<br /><br />Rebecca De Mornay is perfect as the straight foil for Mary, and Fred Thompson did a much better job of impersonating an FBI instructor than he ever did at impersonating a Senator.<br /><br />Tony Longo as the sailor in the bar was also outstanding.<br /><br />It also had a great beat, and was easy to dance to. I give it an 80, Dick.
