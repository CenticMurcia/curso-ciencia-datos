I saw Pandora's Paradox and was most impressed. The production values are very high - it is a high quality, professional film, as good as you can get with 16mm. I'm looking forward to seeing what Matthew Saliba will do next - perhaps with Super 16 or even 35mm (and possibly lip-sync!) The lighting for Pandora's Paradox was really quite remarkable, and the overall visual style and mood it produced was fantastic! Actually, I think the lack of lip-sync worked well, as I can't imagine what these characters could possibly say to each other amidst such bizarre behavior, in which their actions speak far more than words. There's certainly lots of psychological material there to sink one's teeth into (as it were), and come up with a variety of explanations, but the central theme is pretty strong and the message comes through clearly without hitting you over the head.
