I have a feeling that strict horror fans are the ones writing positive reviews of the Masters of Horror episodes, as they have been mostly abysmal thus far. This episode in particular is particularly awful - the first half absolutely does not make use of its creepy setting. The reasons for why the kids go there is questionable, and the backstory surrounding the protagonist and his father is absolutely idiotic. Halfway through, the episode completely shifts gears and turns into a vampire story, and gets even more ridiculous when the revelation is made about who the head vampire is. The show practically caves in on itself by the time the end credits roll. What a waste of time. Avoid like the plague.
