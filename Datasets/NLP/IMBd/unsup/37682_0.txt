This movie is not just poor it is down right rubbish! At no time does the movie have you gripped with suspense or even bothered about what happens next to the characters, it's just not entertaining! On the cover of the DVD people are quoted as saying 'unmissable'! what are these people on! What makes this movie so disappointing is the fact that the storyline is a good one. Perhaps in the hands of someone else the outcome could off been different. A few of the actors in the production give good performances but these tend to be killed off early, for example the senior cop what a waste having him eaten at such an early stage! There is no reason to go into a major review of this film as it is utter rubbish, save yourself some dollars and re-watch your copy of Dawn Of the Dead for the 50th time at least you will enjoy it!
