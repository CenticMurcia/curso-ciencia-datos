I agree with most of the other comments. The filming was amateurish, and I'd hope that all the actors in it lied about being in such a joke.<br /><br />I agree that the dialog had a 'Woody Allen' flavor. In fact, his name is mentioned in the movie. I'm wondering if he really directed it, but knew later that it would be such a horrible stinker that he took his name off of it.<br /><br />Neve is a beautiful woman, and they used her beauty to fill the theaters. Her character was also masochistic. Her 'Ratso Rizzo' boyfriend was a sleezebag who did nothing to help the film. In fact, the Count's character was the only redeeming part of it. I thought he was believable as an aging billionaire who usually got what he wanted. Although he could have gotten prettier and more intelligent women for far less than a million bucks.<br /><br />All in all, it stank<br /><br />EverJack<br /><br />I've seen few films that I would call terrible, but this is one of them.<br /><br />EverJack
