The story has been remade so many times very few people know of the original, and the best, in fact I had not even heard of it until I found a copy in my dads huge collection of old video tapes, and I decided I might as well watch it, what else to do, in the end it ended up being one of the best films I had everseen. Filled with amazing power, and the best visual effects that I have seen in any film from the thirties, much less the twenties. It also has some wonderful performances by its hole cast, and is expertly directed, in almost a Spielberg way, with the talent of Alfred Hitchcock. No matter how against watching old movies you are, you should watch this masterpiece, I have watched it over and over again, it never gets old.<br /><br />If you enjoyed The Lost World, you might also like, On the Waterfront, Its a Wonderful Life, and Jurasic Park.
