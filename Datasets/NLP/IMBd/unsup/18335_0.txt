Very enjoyable and involving noir. John Hodiak plays a WW2 veteran struggling with insomnia and not many clues to go on. It's captivating stuff and the pace is just right as we struggle, as does he, to work out what has gone on. As more people become involved, the plot really thickens and we are in the familiar territory of seedy clubs, ruthless hoods, car 'accidents', clairvoyance, a sanatorium and a wonderfully evocative dark and dirty dockside. Great dialogue throughout and witty too. Nancy Guild is by no means stunning as the co-star helping Hodiak in his desperate race and I understand that Mankiewicz had to coach her individually to help her with the delivery of her lines. Despite this and because the story is so good her slightly faltering performance can take nothing from this thriller.
