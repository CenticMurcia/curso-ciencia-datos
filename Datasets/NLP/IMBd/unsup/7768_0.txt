The Title of this film is how one could describe the time that the cast and crew took out of their lives to make this stinker of a zombie flick. Dead Life barely looks like a movie. It looks like it was shot on Super 8 film and director William Victor Schotten apparently has no idea how or where to place the camera. His shots make Kevin Smith's early work look like a Scorcese film by comparison. Not that better camera placement would have helped the drab, absolutely non creepy environments the flick was shot in. Oh, and if you're going to shoot a film in Super 8, don't bother adding computer graphics. Special effects on a lower par than those of a Sci-Fi Channel original series just make a crappy film look crappier. In Dead Life, zombies start appearing with no real explanation. One of them falls into the lake, and suddenly it's a nationwide epidemic. The only hope for a small band of white trash misfits is a guy who mainly just drinks beer in front of a half built house he claims to be working on. The script is terrible. The acting, even the zombie acting, is downright embarrassing. Everyone in Dead Life talks like they've only been awake for ten minutes. Have you ever tried to talk to somebody after they wake and bake? If so, you can imagine what the communication in this film is like. Not only is Dead Life poorly made, it fails to make any kind of sense. How can a zombie falling into a lake contaminate the whole continent? Who would find a zombie eating one of their neighbors and then casually start f#@king it in the ass? Come to think of it, what kind of person would let anyone, living or dead, get their mouth anywhere near their genitals after seeing that same person gnawing raw human flesh right off the bone? Give horror fans a break! We're sick, we're not stupid! Dead Life managed to almost bore me to death and insult my intelligence at the same time. This piece of crap deserves nothing but ridicule and disdain.
