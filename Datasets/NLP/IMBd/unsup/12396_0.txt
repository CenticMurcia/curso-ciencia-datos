I watched this movie often as a kid growing up in the 80's and it was and still is one of my favorite movies. It's one of those movies where when it ends, you actually feel better than when it began. You go on a journey with these people and actually find out a few things about yourself along the way. I'm thinking that most people can relate to at least one of the characters in the movie and even though it is similar to an after school special, it's so much better than that due to the acting of both Richard Pryor and Cicely Tyson. The children are great as well, when needed. I LIKED the music score. There were some scenes that I could have done without, particularly in the last 30 minutes of the movie, but overall I could watch this movie on a Sunday afternoon, before Goonies and after The Toy.
