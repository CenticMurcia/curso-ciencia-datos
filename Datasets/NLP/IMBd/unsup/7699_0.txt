Beautiful Peggy Ann Garner, not the plain little girl that played Francie in "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" is all grown up and plays the part of a female predator out to get her man in her first drama in living color. She plays the part well with lots of emotion and shows that she is a master of her craft.
