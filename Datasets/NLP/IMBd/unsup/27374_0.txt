Thanks, now i know how to kill somebody and be a good serial killer. <br /><br />I strongly recommend this film to idiots who want to be a killer and don't know how already. Everything covered in this movie is mind blowingly stupid or things we have heard already.<br /><br />It basically ruins the fun of horror movies to begin with.<br /><br />First of all saying that Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers were ordinary guys who made a reputation for themselves. NOT a good idea if they were planning to make this movie successful. All 3 characters had intricate back stories.. they shouldn't ruin that.<br /><br />Secondly i didn't think the use of a hand-held camera was a particularly good idea. Even though the characters were filming a documentary i think they should have used it for the whole film it would have given a better perspective on things. Other movies have made better use of this for instance "Diary of the Dead" and "Cloverfield" which i recommend. Anyway why would these people volunteer for filming this in the first place they must be screwed up. What were they doing in the first place anyhow? Giving a step by step killing guide. Okay it may look fun..you think it'll hold up in court?<br /><br />I did like the twist near the end when they discover who the real virgin survivor girl is all along. You could blatantly see it was coming but made the movie that little bit more entertaining. <br /><br />Overall An Awful movie, with the bad acting adding to the disappointments. Worse than Friday 13th Part 7! Yes, that bad.
