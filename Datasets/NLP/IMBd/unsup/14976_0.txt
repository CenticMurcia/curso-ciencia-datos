This is an extremely well done film using combinations of clips of statements made by Bush, Cheney, Powell, et.al justifying the invasion of Iraq, along with commentary by many highly reputable CIA analysts, ambassadors, and other government officials explaining the false basis of these justifications. The film demonstrates what many people have known intuitively--that the invasion was totally unjustified. The film is made with precision and integrity.
