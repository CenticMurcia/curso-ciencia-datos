I saw the other user comment on this movie and just had to add my own. This movie was terrible. Seeing that Juliette Lewis and Brad Pitt were both in it I took a chance and watched the film that my sister purchased in a one dollar movie bin, and let me tell you, not worth one dollar. Maybe it's because of the fact it is a made-for-TV movie, although I have found many other made-for-TV movies much more enjoyable. The story and dialog are poorly written, and the plot is unbelievable and mediocre at best. The performances were not so bad, but were not enough to carry this film. Lewis plays a girl who gets caught up in these crazy circumstances and never seems to get things right, while Pitt plays this mean nasty character who takes advantage of this poor girl. The only good thing about this film is Lewis' t-shirts which are pretty cool. Do your self a favor and skip it.
