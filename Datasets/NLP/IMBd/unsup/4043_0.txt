(CONTAINS SPOILERS) The action classic DIE HARD gives us what we expect.<br /><br />Bruce Willis plays the character as John McClane, a tired, confused, irritated but very deadly cop who gladly kills some men to save his wife whose being helt hostage.<br /><br />STORY: Christmas in town! NYPD cop John McClane has come all the way to Los Angeles just to make things up with his wife this Christmas. Holly (wife) is working in Nakatomi Plaza and there is being held a Christmas party and under that, 12 uninvited guests appears. Twelve German terrorists high-jacks the skyscraper and declares war against everything and everyone. They've expected anything...except John McClane there you see, that is running in the fire stairs with his serving gun and he's p***ed off!<br /><br />"Come to the coast, get together have a few laughs!" Bruce Willis' performance as the cop couldn't have been done better so I'm not complaining about him, no - but the show gets stealed by the villain, as too often - Alan Rickman as Hans Gruber. The movie ir brilliant in the most ways and entertains you perfect! In the same time being a funny movie it's violent, exciting and tough as nothing else! We're waiting for the fourth Die Hard movie to come, but that I think is going to be a big mistake! Without doubt the best movie in the trilogy...great and simply tough and funny!
