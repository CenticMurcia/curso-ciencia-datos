We love movies. We average 10 movies a month on Netflix...we are also good people, and are spiritual sorts.<br /><br />But...this movie is one of the worst pieces of garbage I've ever seen. The plot is thin and transparent, the messages are bludgeoning, and delivered with the finesse of a sledgehammer. The acting is wooden, predictable, forgettable.<br /><br />Strange that it has an over 7 average rating here, a nearly 5 star rating on Netflix! The only excuses I can think of...zealous churches are encouraging their flocks to go rate this dribble up...or the Fox Faith (huh?! new one on us) people are stuffing the ballot boxes.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs....we finally found something that makes Patch Adams look like a deep work of art!
