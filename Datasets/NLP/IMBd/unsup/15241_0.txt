Rated TV-14 for Language and Sex and Drug Content.<br /><br />Before Judd Apatow was famous for directing great films such as "The 40 Year Old Virgin" and "Knocked Up" and before producing "superbad" and other comedy films, he made the TV series "Freaks and Geeks".I used to watch this show back when it was on during 1999 and 2000 but I was young so I didn't understand all the references and jokes.Watching it now I understand all the jokes and find the show to be an interesting and accurate portrayal of high school life.The show has all the high school cliques such as Geeks,Jocks etc.There is also a good mix of comedy and drama.The show also jump started the careers for many of the cast members such as James Franco(spiderman) and Seth Rogen(knocked up).If you can find this show anywhere like in syndication or something, watch it!.
