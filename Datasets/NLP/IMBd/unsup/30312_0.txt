First of all, I saw the preview of the movie before it came out and it had the scene where Nicky silently urges Pammy to run away with her from the hospital, to The Ramones' "I Wanna Be Sedated". That alone blew me away. Then I bought the 2 LP soundtrack before the movie came out and listened to it over and over. By the time the movie premiered, I was more than ready for it. It showed for two weeks at a local theater and I saw it once a day every day for two weeks. I really had no life! I ordered the VHS tape sometime in the 80's and paid $60 for it. Now I own the DVD and enjoyed the commentary. I don't have the CD and wonder if The Cars' Dangerous Type is on it.<br /><br />Anyway, I don't have to tell you I loved it very much. <br /><br />I know the editing was clumsy and they cut out so many scenes that sometimes it didn't make any sense, but it is such a fun movie. the soundtrack is the best ever. The Ramones, Suzi Quatro, Patti Smith, Pretenders, Robin Johnson, Roxy Music, XTC, Desmond Child & Rouge, The Cars (not included on the soundtrack), etc. This movie introduced me to New Wave and punk. There are so many neat scenes in the movie: - The seduction - non-verbal with only Ramones singing "I Wanna Be Sedated - of Pammy by Nicky to leave the hospital. - The card game on the street "You snooze you lose" - Running through the adult theater. - The hilarious hold-up - Dropping TVs to The Cars' "Dangerous Type" - "Your Daughter Is One" - Any scene with Tim Curry - "Life, more than Television."<br /><br />- Both performances of "Damn Dog" - "Hit me again, you're a big man" - Pammy dancing to Lou Reed's Take A Walk On The Wild Side.<br /><br />- Waking up to Suzi Quatro's "Rock Hard". - Tim Curry dancing to "Rock Hard" - "I may be brave but you're the pretty one. I'm a freak of f**king nature"<br /><br />- Pammy dancing to Desmond Child & Rouge's "The Night Was Not". - Tim Curry's poetry. - The Sleaze Sisters and their imitators wearing trash bags.<br /><br />- The opening credits to Roxy Music's "Same Old Scene"<br /><br />- Stealing the ambulance and getting away with it. - "M-e-t-h-o-d-i-s-t- e-p-i-s-c-o-p-a-l" "Take a p*** you a**hole"<br /><br />Do I love this movie or what?
