Let me set the record straight right off the top. "The Private Eyes" is no comedy classic. But it is a fun film that will amuse adults and make kids laugh and shriek with delight.<br /><br />Tim Conway and Don Knotts play a couple of bumbling (what else?) Scotland Yard detectives assigned to investigate a murder at a castle in England (actually North Carolina). While in the castle they stumble across loads of creepy characters and situations.<br /><br />For anyone who has enjoyed this type of film ("Hold That Ghost" with Abbott and Costello, and "The Ghost and Mr. Chicken" come to mind), "The Private Eyes" delivers the goods. Of course if you sit there and try to analyze it too deeply you are apt to dislike it. Just sit back with the family and have a good laugh.
