I saw this movie three years ago and thought it was terrible. The kid follows a group of thugs from the bush to Sydney, hooks up with the daughter of the new US ambassador to Australia, and it basically goes silly from then on. The scene where he goes with her to get diplomatic immunity was unrealistic, due to the fact that the boy (I refuse to say his name) is not American, and would be turfed out in a second, while the American girl gets immunity. Also, the end of the movie is also stupid, with the thugs turning out to be brainless.<br /><br />If you want to watch it and find it funny, switch off all touches with actual reality, and it may become enjoyable.
