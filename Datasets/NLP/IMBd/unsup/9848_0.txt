They can seduce anyone, the tag line reads. But it doesn't seem to apply to virgin nerds as they keep resisting. A college campus is current home to beautiful aliens out to seduce young men. A difference in body temperatures usually results in the guys being left frozen stiff.<br /><br />Enter our virgin nerd and his ability to resist the naked charms of the aliens (even when he thinks they are normal). The real question is not why the aliens are here, but are they good or bad. Are they intentionally killing guys or is it an unwanted side effect? That question helps drive the second half of the film.<br /><br />When all is said and done, this really just seems like a college sex comedy. Sure it has aliens and death but there is no real tension to make it really qualify as a horror film. No real comedy either (but that is common with a lot of sex comedies). There is a sequel in the works that is either just trying to make a quick buck or might actually explain some of what happens in this movie. Good for eating popcorn to as it requires little thought or attention.
