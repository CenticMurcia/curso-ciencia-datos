Tom is out for a fun day at the beach, but everything turns out to be a disaster, right from the start when his bathing suit gets stuck in the door! Then he dives into the ocean, but the tide goes out and he hits nothing but sand and a bunch of tin cans and other garbage.<br /><br />One thing after another goes wrong, but Tom, to his credit, remains upbeat. Then he discovers Jerry in the picnic basket eating all the food. Jerry then takes big bites out of poor Tom, to gets further bitten by a crab, on and on and on. Tom - and the crab - gets a few licks in on Jerry, too, but only a few.<br /><br />This is non-stop action, almost wearing you out in just seven minutes. The frenetic pace is almost too much.
