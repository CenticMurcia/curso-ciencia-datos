Bad. Very bad. I wouldn't suggest it to my worst enemies. Through innuendo this movie basically describes America and its inhabitants as bloodthirsty and greedy. Even those who originally came from foreign countries eventually became tainted. (There are some people in this country that match that description, but not every single person) The direction of this film was also poor and it left decent actors (not the best, but what kind of talent would sign on to this project) with no chance of helping the film. Do yourself a favor and skip over this film when you are looking to rent something.
