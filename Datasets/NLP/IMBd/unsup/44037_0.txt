Now, I understand this movie is made for fans of Trama Studio's work and is a cult classic. But this movie is horrible. Cult classic or not, there is no reason you should enjoy a movie made on a budget that's less than many people make in a year. The special effects are the worst ever, there are constant mess-ups and errors, the sound is atrocious, and the video quality is horrible, even for a movie that's over a decade and a half old. The plot is just...unbearable. For unexplained reasons an innocent kid kills his father in the very beginning and eats him. Now, this might be more understandable if the kid was in a satanic cult or they were on Indian Burial Grounds or some other nonsense Trama might use to explain the storyline better, but there isn't. There is no reason at all.<br /><br />It's been mentioned that many people might take offense at this movie, I didn't. I think it's horrible for other reasons. But there is children being slaughtered, extreme violence and gore, murder, nudity, and even rape. There is no reason or explanation for much of this. This is in my opinion, the worst movie ever and I think the one that we are forced to give it is overly generous. Avoid this movie as well as Trama's other work as much as possible.
