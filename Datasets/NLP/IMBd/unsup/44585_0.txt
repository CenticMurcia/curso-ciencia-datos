First of all, let's get one thing straight....I love foreign films. I even love Iranian films (at least I loved Colours of Paradise). And yet I didn't think I would ever get through this movie and it's not that long. I would have no idea what it was about if I hadn't read the back of the box.<br /><br />In brief, the "movie" consists of a long series of interminable vignettes, usually with no dialogue, no character development, and no point. Every 20 minutes or so (seems like longer), there is an actual scene with some interesting characters who for the most part are not heard from again. Then there's some nonsense about a Palestinian woman who gets hold of a Police CB. I was looking forward to seeing a Palestinian film to see what a Palestinian director would have to say...Not necessarily about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict (though that would be interesting too...) but about SOMETHING, damn it! This film was a huge disappointment. Don't watch it unless you are expecting a documentary, and a dull one at that.
