It's been more than 48 hours since I watched this pitiful exercise in ego masturbation disguised as film, and I still can not erase that truly vile scene of the narrator receiving oral sex, out of my mind. While I can admire anyone willing to open up and bare their soul on camera warts and all, throughout the entire movie, I never once got the feeling that the director/star ever felt a bit of remorse that his obsession with hookers lead to the demise of several of his relationships with women. He also comes across as an egomaniac as well: none of the real women he was in relationships with look anything like the porn stars he used in the reenactments.<br /><br />Find a better way to waste 90 minutes of your life.
