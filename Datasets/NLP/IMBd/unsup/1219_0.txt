This "Twilight Zone" like story is of a man who kills a woman and dumps her body on the back of a passenger car on a train leaving town. Weather conspires against him and he ends up in a boarding house, biding his time. Unfortunately, there is no way out of town and the boy living at the same house saw him dump "something" on the train. Pieces begin to be put together and he must start covering his tracks. The boy is no fool, but starts by feeling an alliance with the man. Once news of the murder gets out, lots of stuff happens. The problem is the old word "verisimlitude.' It's just hard to believe that the events could transpire as they do. There is a relationship with a restless woman which confuses things, and, of course, this boy is going to be hard to silence. There's also a story within a story, where the young woman who is eventually murdered is being counseled by an old psychic man aboard the train. I won't say any more. It's a reasonably good movie with some nice twists and turns.
