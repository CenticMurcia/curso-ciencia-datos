An eco-friendly cash-in that recycles music and chunks of animation from the TV series in order to introduce She-Ra, He-Man's twin sister from another dimension and an attempt to target the silly girls in the audience. For us boys there's little to get us jumping up and down in our seats: the regular characters don't make an appearance until halfway through, the movie instead setting up a near-identical premise on the other side of the dimensional gateway. Eventually Skeletor turns up and starts causing havoc, armed with a few funny lines, and things pick up a bit, but on the whole this is ropey stuff. Hordak's slime pit toy was a corker though, wasn't it?
