The movie is an absolute waste of time. As in all bad heist movies, the actual heist is all of 10 minutes. The cast has big names, however, Don Cheadle is wasted in a meaningless role that does not contribute to the film. Woody Harrelson's character of a cop is a mockery to the actor's potential. Well, Salma Hayek's curves are eye candy, however, does not justify having to sit thru this travesty of a film. If salma is the reason, you can always hire From Dusk to Dawn again and again. Pierce Brosnan sleepwalks to the role that he has essayed many times before ---a smooth, slick operator who has thought of everything and for whom things fall into place as if my magic. There is a force fed twist in the end, but its so plastic that it ain't funny. Guys, please don't waste rental money on this one.
