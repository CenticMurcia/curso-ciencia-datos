Please don't try to compare this to anything from Hollywood. They stopped making good movies a long time ago. Here in New Zealand we don't have a lot of contact with the French character but I have just had the pleasure of hosting a young French lady who is a top line hairdresser. While I was watching this movie I only had to close my eyes and I could see CÃ¨line, my guest. In other hands this would have been a minor movie but in the hands of the two principals it was to say the least delightful. The story was very simple and at every turn I knew what was to come but in every way I was wrong. I have not seen very much of Luliette Binoche but now I'm a fan. In the beginning Jean Reno was a most unlikely partner but by the finish you could actually like him. Beilliant.
