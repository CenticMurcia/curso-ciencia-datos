i watched this movie on TV on thursday night and I couldn't believe what i saw. this movie made me cry but for all the wrong reasons! Every 2 seconds I was saying, "What the crap?!" because i just couldn't believe that all those bad things could happen to Rocky so fast. I mean he just got back from Russia and he finds out that his idiot friend, Paulie, signed some paper, which made the Balboa family bankrupt! they lost their estate and all their money, and ended up living back in the area they were living in for Rocky I. I also could not believe how Rocky's son from Rocky IV looked about 8 years old when Rocky left to fight Drago, and then when he gets back, his son in Rocky V, (who is Sylvester Stallone's real-life son) looked about 13 & dorky! It seems that all Sylvester tried to do in the last 2 Rocky movies is somehow get his family involved in the movie, which is not right. Though Rocky's son in Rocky V does look more Italian, it was just not the same. I will never watch this movie again because the plot made me so angry. If they do make a Rocky VI, which i highly doubt since Sylvester Stallone is 60 now i think, i will watch it just to see how it is.
