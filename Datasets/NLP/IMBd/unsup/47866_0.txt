When this movie was made - in 1971 - Sean Connery was certainly best known for playing the ultimate good guy - super spy James Bond, who kept the world safe from every bad guy you could imagine. I can understand why Connery would want to re-image himself, especially since his time as James Bond was approaching its end. What I have a hard time understanding is why he would choose such a poor movie to do it with. Here, he plays Duke Anderson - a career criminal who has just been released from prison and immediately begins plotting his next job - robbing the six wealthy residents of the apartment house in which his prostitute girlfriend (played by Dyan Cannon, in a role that accomplished little except to give a sort of logical reason why this place would be targeted) lives. He puts together a team made up partly of guys he knew on the inside, partly of old cronies from the outside and one guy from the local mob. Throughout the movie, it seems as though everyone's being taped (thus, the title) - but to no end, since the tapes really end up playing no role whatsoever. And, in the end, I wondered about the police - it looked like half the NYPD was on this job!<br /><br />I thought this movie was poorly written, poorly acted and poorly paced. It's hopelessly dated, reeking of the 70's and with an absolutely dreadful musical score. It lost me right from the beginning with the silly scene of Anderson's last group therapy session in prison. It was dull throughout - a total waste of time. 1/10
