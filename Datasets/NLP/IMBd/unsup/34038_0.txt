This is a pretty pointless movie about how shallow the 80's were. There is sex, violence, drugs and some bad behavior in this, but the plot is so pointless you just don't care and feels like a waste of time. The only good part about this movie is when it shows Amber Heard naked, but after those few scenes the rest of it is some more shallow and boring stuff. Besides Amber Heard naked, the awkwardness of the film got a bit of my attention especially from the beginning but that is about it, didn't live through the 80's nor do I care, maybe someone who did might enjoy it or people that are fans of the book. But I doubt even that, just about shallow people being connected to one another in some way.<br /><br />4/10
