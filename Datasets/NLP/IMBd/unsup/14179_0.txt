Professional and surprisingly successful remake of George A. Romero's groundbreaking horror milestone with the same title, that retells  in color  the simplistic, yet still very unsettling premise of recently deceased corpses that rise from their tombs for unknown reasons, and go after the living. Remakes usually are a curse for us, horror fans, but "Night of the Living Dead" is a different story, since director Tom Savini obviously made this film because he wanted to tribute the original instead of using the idea of a remake as an easy excuse to further exploit a profitable franchise. This new version also is a full-blooded and genuine horror film with loads of tension (even though you mostly know what'll happen next, it's still scary), good acting (a lovely B-cast with names like Tony Todd, Tom Towles and Bill Moseley) and excellent make-up effects (although, it has to be said, the gore is a less outrageous than expected). Of course, the original can't be topped anywhere, since the initial shock-impact has gone and since Savini can't create the same unbearable atmosphere of mystery and despair. However, even if you swear by the original and know it by heart, I'd still like to encourage you to watch this version for the following reason: after about sixty minutes of sticking loyally to the original, Savini's "Night of the Living Dead" all of a sudden stops being a homage and NEW script-elements, either specifically added or recovered ideas that didn't made the final cut of the 1968 version, are brought in! Barbara's character, for example, is a much stronger female lead here that courageously assists Ben in kicking zombie-butt. The entire ending is different as well, and leans closer to the events in "Dawn" and "Day". In fact, you can almost state that the last half hour of Savini's film is a tiny third sequel, rather than a docile remake. Either way you look at it, this film is warmly recommended entertainment for horror fanatics.
