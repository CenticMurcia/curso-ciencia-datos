The second of director Jeff Lieberman's trilogy of perfect B thrillers, the others being Squirm (1976) and Just Before Dawn (1981), is a clever shocker given some interesting spins. <br /><br />A young man stands accused of murder when one of his friends goes crazy during a party. He flees the police, discovers that other similar killings have taken place and that a brand of LSD is behind it. But what can he do to stop the power of 'Blue Sunshine'?<br /><br />Highly stylish, off-beat psychological thriller may just be the best testament to Lieberman's film making talents. Lieberman gives this film a haunting atmosphere, moments pure strangeness, and startling violence. Lieberman's story is a weird tale, tense with mystery and powered by an original concept. Charles Gross provides a beautiful and truly odd musical score that complements the mood of the film perfectly.<br /><br />The cast is quite good as well. Zalman King is the best as the film's rather unlikely hero.<br /><br />Blue Sunshine has become a bit of an underground classic, much like the other films of Lieberman, and it rightfully should be a classic. For those seeking an original horror-thriller with some weird twists, you won't find better than this!<br /><br />**** out of ****
