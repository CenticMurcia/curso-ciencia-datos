Barbara H: pretty sad, dear. Neither the youth nor the presence to carry your role. The film is painfully aware of its aspirations -never approached in quality, sadly - of successfully passing as a mere mediocrity. Dream on. The would-be female lead seems to have used all her resources, all the accrued influence available at the autumn of her career- not to entertain but rather to keep her "credit" from the leading titles, ...BH only admitting to having perpetrated "Eva" at the final moments of film. <br /><br />Without a better performance (and any high school drama aspirant could readily cough up a more nuanced and convincing effort than did BH... the film is worse than bad.<br /><br />Not all are to blame: Mike Starr (a standout in Mad Dog & Glory) never does less than fine work: an underrated actor who deserves better than this stillborn wet poop. <br /><br />The screenplay is awful, the direction is amateurish, and the cinematography ... is actually quite good.<br /><br />All in all, a painful and humiliating waste of time. It was much more fun to pan it than to watch it. <br /><br />Try a little less lipstick, BH? (It gets farther and farther from her mouth.) -------------------------------------------
