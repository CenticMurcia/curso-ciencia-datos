The Attic Expeditions is painful on viewers who demand to have everything sorted out for them in sane, palpable order. Its plot is coy, but definitely not vague.<br /><br />Sure, it's a horror movie, but the paranoia and the absurdity come first. Few comedies have so satisfying a sense of humor.<br /><br />The vivid dollhouse-like color schemes are reminiscent of Edward Scissorhands, but the surreal nature of the film's universe is a schizophrenic A Life Less Ordinary.<br /><br />If you shy away from nudity or language, shy away from here...otherwise, give your mind this gentle frappe and thank me afterwards.
