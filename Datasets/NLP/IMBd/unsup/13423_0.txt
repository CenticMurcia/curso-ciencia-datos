I just watched the last half-hour of this movie on cable TV. It's a likable bit of romantic froth, worthy as a step-off point for Tom Hanks and Ron Howard to move on to bigger and better things. I think I saw Viggo Mortensen (from "Lord of the Rings" fame) in a bit part. It's in that scene where the scientist with the mustache goes to see Madison in her tank, and is greeted with a big surprise (she is not there). He is accompanied by a few other men, and it looked like the future Aragorn was one of them. I can't be sure of this, because I checked the cast list on the IMDb listing, and his name wasn't there. Can anyone verify if it's Viggo in that scene?
