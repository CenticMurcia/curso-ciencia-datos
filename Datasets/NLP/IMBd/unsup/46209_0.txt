I had no idea this movie was rated "R" until I got on this page to rate (lowly) this movie. You know you're in for a heap of trouble when a movie starts out with a man driving a Jetta drinking out of a bottle of Jack Daniels just after being paroled. Charley Taylor gets paroled on the understanding that he'll take employment with a wealthy woman who works in the area of rehabilitating freed felons. Once he meets this woman, he finds out that she has another use for him than just legitimate employment - and he spends the rest of the movie trying to figure out what's really going on.<br /><br />This movie was nothing except a serious attempt to make a porno movie into a decent film. I'll admit the plot had SOME merit, and the only reason I kept watching was to see how it ended, but cheesy acting and the concept of every character sleeping with each other (9 separate sex scenes) made it mostly unbelievable - as well as some plot loopholes.<br /><br />If you're up late on a weeknight with nothing else to watch, or you're with your woman (or man) looking to set the mood, then this is a decent movie for you. Otherwise, this isn't worth your time unless you watch for the skin - cause that's exactly what you'll get, but don't expect to get any entertainment out of it other than laughing at its unrealistic qualities.
