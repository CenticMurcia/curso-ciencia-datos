This is so bad that I wasted so much free time on this bad special effects film.The bees are fake which don't look scary.Remakes are just not so good these days personally because special effects are what is ruining ferfectly good remakes. Special effects just destroy remakes. This is why Killer bees looks so bad for a remake.The Sheriff of a small town just goes around telling everyone that killer bees are coming and will get everyone.Even the Sheriff looks like an ass doing this. The bees are highly unscary.Also they are laughable for even me to watch.Flying in a swarm they look like little tiny dots. This looks so phony. Here this movie was just sad. If I WANTED something better I would have went for a stroll. Awful remake.
