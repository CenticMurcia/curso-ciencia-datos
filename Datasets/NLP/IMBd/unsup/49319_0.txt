This was the film Bruce Lee was working on when he died. He had stopped working on this film to work on Enter the Dragon and never had the chance to come back and finish this. The good news is that Lee shot a good 30 minutes worth of footage for Game of Death. The bad news is Robert Clouse came around and tried to make an entire film leading up to the Bruce Lee footage that was shot including Bruce Lee look-a-likes and cardboard cut-outs. The entire film is pretty awful since the story is lame and the acting is over dramatic. I'm surprised Sammo Hung agreed to be a part of this at all. The archived footage of Bruce Lee just seems forced and thrown in to try and make a buck while the actual footage of Lee's funeral just feels tasteless and inconsiderate. Clouse would unfortunately give birth to something that would spawn many films including Bruce Lee clones starring the likes of Bruce Li. The actual Bruce Lee footage is some of his best, but is shown in its entirety in the documentary A Warrior's Journey included in the special edition of Enter the Dragon. If you're a Bruce Lee fan, don't waste your time with this. Stick to the films he actually completed and watch A Warrior's Journey to see the reconstruction of Lee's intended cut of this film.
