Pretentious slop about a student filmmaker who is so hip that no one "gets" him. Robert Forster plays the student and his performance is limited to smug expressions and wooden stares. I don't blame him, though, since the script is so godawful. The gist of the plot is that Forster's character wants to push the boundaries of realism in films, and while making a new film manipulates his cast and crew to perform unknowingly to his master plan. Actually, it's not a bad idea and anticipates the JERRY SPRINGER SHOW to some degree, but as put together the film plays like a very, very bad student film. This was shown on FXM recently, apparently in an R-rated form. The film was released to theaters as a PG film.
