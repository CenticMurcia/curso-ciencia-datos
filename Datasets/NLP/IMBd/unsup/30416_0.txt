A perfect little gem of a film, which the other posters here have attested to quite well. Peter O'Toole fans and those who can remember that time in our history would do themselves a great service in seeing this movie. It gets shown on TCM once and a while (good on them), this is where I had re-stumbled upon it after many, many years. I am also delighted to hear that it was released on DVD a couple of years ago, and I am eager to check it out.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite movies. Reason being, I remember seeing this as a kid with my grandfather, who was very much a part of that era. I've never seen anyone laugh harder at a movie, ever. Seriously. Though he passed away a long time ago, it's one of my favorite memories, of him just laughing out load in uproarious delight. That's what movies should do.
