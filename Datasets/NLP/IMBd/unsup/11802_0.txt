Director Pete Travis gives us a pulse-pounding, quick-cut action movie. U.S. President Ashton(William Hurt)is in Spain to address a global summit on terrorism. Just after stepping to the podium in the crowded town square, he is hit by an assassin's bullet and almost immediately the crowd is rocked by a bomb. In the confusion the leader of the "Free World" is kidnapped. Secret Service agent Thomas Barnes(Dennis Quaid),previously wounded taking a bullet for the president, back on duty quickly takes a look at a tourist's(Forest Whitaker)camcorder thinking the shooter can be identified. Sigourney Weaver is a CNN producer, who also has a point of view of the event. The movie you may say unfolds as it "rewinds" the same chaotic minutes from the view of several involved characters. The most exciting sequence happens when Agent Barnes ends up in a thrilling car chase after one of his own, Agent Kent Taylor(Matthew Fox). Quite an amusement park ride of a movie. Others in the cast: Bruce McGill, Ayelet Zurer, Edgar Ramirez, Zoe Saldana and Eduardo Noriega.
