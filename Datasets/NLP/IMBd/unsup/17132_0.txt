This is movie depicts the typical characteristics of Turkish villages and draws attention to the social relationships between people engaging in humor. Another pro for this movie is that although it is a local movie, it draws attention to pure feelings such as love and innocence. <br /><br />Especially Turkish people should see it as soon as possible, that is because this movie is referred to the Turkish audience firstly. I do not know if another versions of this movie in other languages exist, but if it does, then everybody who sees cinema as an interpretation of pure feelings must watch it. <br /><br />Personally, this movie provided me with the knowledge about the life outside the urban areas and gave me a great happiness. <br /><br />Thanks to the director for such an admirable movie.
