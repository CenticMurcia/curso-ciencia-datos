One big damn mess... I was duped into believing this to be a horror film but it is just a dumb mystery psycho-drama with plenty of bad acting, predictable plot development, and an absolutely absurd premise that hasn't got an iota of credibility or realism to it. Birch organizes a "hole" excursion so she can starve everyone to death in order to make a guy fall in love with her?!! What a load of crap. What's worse, the entire British police force and its detectives and psychologists can't figure the mystery out, and are deceived by a half-crazed teen who hasn't eaten or drank much for a fortnight! Can you spell "DUMB"? This whole teen horror/slasher/mystery genre just keeps digging down to new lows. At least De Palma's and Hitchcock's nonsense can occasionally be entertaining, whereas these kinds of films have no value whatsoever.
