This pilot was awesome. I downloaded it from CW. Too bad "jumpthesnark" didn't like it. This pilot reminded me a lot of Smallville's first episode and the excitement it created in me. I am so frustrated that CW isn't picking this up. They are nuts! I know this show would be a hit. If you haven't downloaded it on ITUNES... DO IT! It's really great. For every 1 person that says it's not that great, there's hundreds that have loved it...I thought the plot was very interesting and the characters that were being developed were ones that I wanted to know more about. I didn't get that feeling like I do in other Pilots where I'm like, maybe I need to watch a few more shows to see if I like it. This one I enjoyed so much I thought, I need to tell others about it!!! Anyway, go buy the pilot, it's only a buck ninety nine. It's worth it.
