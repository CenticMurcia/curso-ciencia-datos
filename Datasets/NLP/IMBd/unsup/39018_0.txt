Sleazy, short-lived (thank God) and cartoon-like reality-show from the anal-retentive Hollywood obsessed E!: Entertainment Television station that was intended more or less to be an unscripted (yeah right) update on the ditsy, southern-tinged, child-like and obviously obese former Guess Jeans and Playboy Centerfold-cum-plus-size Lane Bryant model Anna-Nicole Smith as she attempts to piece her crumbling and severely unstable life back together after numerous career failures, long public court battles with a former son-in-law over the would-be inheritance (supposedly worth millions) that she was supposed to receive when her *shudders* 90 plus year old billionaire oilman husband died back in the mid-1990's. And be it inadvertent or not on the part of the producers is questionable as it also became an extremely off-center portrait of the very strained relationships she shares with her grown son, lawyer, homosexual personal assistant, varying private makeup artists and all sorts of other creepy annoying people that seem to float in and out of her life faster than you can say: "Trim-Spa Baby"! In a strange, pathetic, surreal, cringe-worthy and I'm sure unintentionally laughable way it manages to be a triumph-over-the-odds/comeback story (of sorts) which ultimately invokes an unsettling combination of both sympathy and revulsion in whomever watches it. Altogether, it's pretty easy to compare watching the now-defunct "Anna-Nicole Show" to taking an unplanned detour through a nasty southern trailer park populated with toothless illiterate rednecks and crazy overweight derelicts in tube-tops! I know that's how I felt when I tuned in, and to be quite frank, I could only hope that no one ever makes the huge mistake of offering someone like her the opportunity to have their own reality show again! What were they smoking err...thinking I ask you?
