This is the WORST musical ever made, for film or stage. First off it's COMPLETELY biblically inaccurate. The best voice is a random slave, who looks like he's actually Native American. THere is NO age progression on the queen of Egypt, or Moses' mother, in acting or in make- up save for her horrible wig that becomes gray. The choreography is atrocious, as is the set. Most of the interesting effects are done for the DVD, therefore i'm not sure what the audience even got to see at the Kodak theater. <br /><br />It seems as though a bunch of people who meant well and really liked musicals ( MAC makeup, Max Azairi(costumes), Travis Payne(choreography)) got together and attempted to make one of their own without even trying to learn how beforehand.<br /><br />Lastly, every time the original Ramses king is on stage, he glows gold in a really odd way, especially from his crotch. whenever he came on stage my friend would scream "I LOVE GOOOLLDD" a la Austin Powers. Honestly i wanted to shoot myself the whole time. I collect horrible movies for entertainment value and this is definitely the crown jewel
