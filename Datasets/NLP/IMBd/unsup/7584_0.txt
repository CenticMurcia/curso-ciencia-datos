With this "Blood Cult" sequel's jump to 16mm, the analogy shifts from infomercial to movie-of-the-week, with no reduction in gore implied. The images are prettier and so are the gals, and they even spring for a half decent dog amulet this time. But money can't buy you brains: learning nothing from their real mistakes, they still throw logic to the wind at every opportunity, this time working from a script by Jim Vance, the first movie's hipster boyfriend. While they spend great chunks of time rehashing plot points from the first movie, don't pay too much attention because they alter details at will; for instance, Julie Andelman is nowhere to be seen in spite of part one's tease ending. The plot centers on a list of names the now-nutso Ellis apparently slipped his deputy, but that canny device flutters away before they've crossed two names out. There's a dude on a dirt bike who keeps showing up Â– is he supposed to be scary or something? And after we spend the whole movie watching Wayne earnestly trying to solve the mystery, he duplicates the first movie's fatal conceit by announcing himself as a cult conspirator at the very end, thus transforming "Blood Cult"'s dubiety into outright fraudulence; it doesn't just make no sense, it is a frontal assault on the viewer's intelligence. And we STILL don't get to see the corpse-effigy.
