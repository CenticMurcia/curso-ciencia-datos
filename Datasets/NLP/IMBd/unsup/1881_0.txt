Back in school they worked hard to convince us that recreational drug taking was bad, bad, bad for us. Not only would we suffer dire consequences at that time, but our children would also suffer hideous deformities because of our ruined DNA and we would forever be at risk of having a flashback at a most inopportune time. (Let this be a warning to you.)<br /><br />I think this movie triggered my first flashback in 25 years. <br /><br />The murderer in the Nixon mask? hahahahha The suicide on the glass table? hahahhahaha The Dimwit who kidnaps the wrong girl? And his choice of instrument for torture? hahahahhahahahhahahahhahaha<br /><br />Don't expect greatness from this one, but don't think you are going to forget it tomorrow. <br /><br />And isn't that what a movie is really all about?
