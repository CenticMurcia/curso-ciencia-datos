This is a moving and educational look into a period of U.S. history that has gone largely unrecognized by Hollywood in recent years. We all know the words 'suffragette' and about the 19th amendment. But herein we learn that our own U.S. citizens, 'guilty' of only exercising their 1st amendment rights, were treated so harshly that the U.S. would have been in violation of numerous articles of the Geneva Convention had it been in effect at that time. Human rights violations such this are are why the ACLU exists today. The same resistance tactics were used 25 years later by Gandhi, who liberated roughly the same number of people, and he is a household name. Why isn't Alice Paul equally recognized? This should be required viewing for every American, before they claim to understand what the words 'freedom' and 'liberty' truly mean.
