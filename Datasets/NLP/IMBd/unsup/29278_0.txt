It is one of the funniest episodes of CSI. Full of funny characters, turnarounds, weapons, and even theme song is humorous . Peter Stormare, from Prison break plays Russian accented brothel owner. The whole episode is about one murder. A murder of ex-boxing champion. <br /><br />!!!SPOILER BELOW!!!<br /><br />Many people tried to kill him, with different things: crowbar hit to the head, crossbow shot through the neck, fellatio administering shrimps, injection of a snake venom, but at the end it was not possible to determinate who really killed him. There were three people who tried to kill him. Bartender, brothel owner, and "pleasure" worker. Episode locations are Brothel and trailer park outside of city, CSI lab, and interrogation room. 70% of scenes are at brothel, which is unusual, since most CSIs are usually at lab.<br /><br />Must see!
