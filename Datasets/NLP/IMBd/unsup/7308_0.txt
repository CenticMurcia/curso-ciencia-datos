If you're looking for a fun movie that will make you laugh, this is it.<br /><br />Michael Riley gives a great performance as an ordinary guy who works at two hum-drum jobs and lives a pretty boring life. Robbie Coltrane comes into his life and changes it for the creative better. As always, Coltrane is over-the-top with his portrayal of a failed, but always hopeful restauranteur. The dialogue is witty especially from Kristina Nichol, who has a minor, but standout role. Eugene Lipinski, who also wrote the original story and co-wrote the screenplay, gives a hilarious performance as the jealous, slightly-psycho 'Hopeless.' Kenneth Welsh is equally funny as the obsessed-to-win hockey coach and boss.<br /><br />The list of memorable performances goes on. The cinematography involves unique camera shots that are creative beyond what I've ever seen.<br /><br />Definitely, a must see. I give it a 10 and a spot on my favorite movies of all time list.
