I think I'd have loved this film when I was 9 or 10 but now I can only watch it in disbelief while I shake my head and mutter "Oh, come on!" A throwback to the 1930's screwball comedies, this has a very flimsy plot which allows the aging cast to act like complete nincompoops, particularly as the film goes on.<br /><br />I'd say that Cary Grant (a screwball comedy veteran) and Ginger Rogers had zero chemistry as the married couple and I also thought Charles Coburn uncharacteristically walked through a part he did many times before in better movies. But I think Marilyn stole the picture whenever she appeared, not that it was that difficult to do in this case.<br /><br />We were not amused!
