I must say that this film was a great surprise, not only because of my personal taste for sci-fi / fantasy flicks, but because this production is flawless.<br /><br />I believe Howard McCain is set to be a true revelation as film maker and screen writer. There is no single bad moment in all the film.<br /><br />Great work in photography and editing make of this film a visual accomplishment.<br /><br />James Caviezel, John Hurt and Ron Perlman performances are excellent.<br /><br />All FX are achieved, and the score by Geoff Zanelli is one to remember.<br /><br />Maybe is something that we all have seen before, but never with this kind of achievement.<br /><br />For all sci-fi / fantasy fans, this one is a MUST!
