I've come to expect sub-par sci-fi made for TV movies, but this is one of the worst acted flicks with stolen scenes from another disaster movie. While watching the earthquake destruction I noticed very familiar scenes of buildings collapsing and freeway ramps breaking apart. The footage is straight out of Dante's Peak! The horrific acting on everyone's part is annoying and keeps you from being able to get into the story without looking at the clock every few minutes. The fake Russian accents make it sound like everyone is developmentally disabled, not Russian. The children of the lead characters not only have different accents than their parents, but different from one another. It ends up being the age old story of the husband who did the family wrong and wins back the heart of the ex-wife by saving the children and restoring her trust and love. I know...original, huh? I want my last 2 hours back!
