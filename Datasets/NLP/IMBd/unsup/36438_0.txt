Thou it's started like a comedy and social criticize of the famous Singaporean 'No U-turn', Jack Neo's movie turn, itself, quickly in a poor copy of Black Edwards' comedies when Fann Wong and Gurmit Singh exchange their souls to find themselves in each others body. Without this 'deja-vu' effect, Neo would have reach his moral easier and more originally.<br /><br />Neo's direction still looks like a newcomer film student who wants to play with the effects and have more the aspect of a TV film than a cinema feature. Even during a serious scene (Gurmit's daughter hit by a car), the cheap special effect starts laughs among audience instead of fear.<br /><br />This movie should have been be produce for TV with a cheaper budget, maybe this could have let a chance for others, and better, Singaporean filmmakers to produce a higher quality feature.<br /><br />But you know they let him do. It's just because, long time ago, Jack Neo made laughs...
