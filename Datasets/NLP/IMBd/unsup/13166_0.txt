Finally!! SciFi has actually produced something that is worthy of its name. The Lost World is a gorgeously produced, beautifully directed and wonderfully acted production. It even is adorned with a rare great music score by Robert Kral.<br /><br />The mini was spellbinding, the plot kept you wanting to see more, and on top of it all, it was intelligent.<br /><br />I'd be giving unsparing kudos to SciFi if not for one thing: why did they not promote it? I remember when the soporific Taken was put on how it was all but impossible to know when the show was on, or even the boring Triangle. Boy did I know about that show. And of course, let's not forget the extra-super-hyped but mind-numbingly bad Battlestar Galactica. Millions seemingly spent to promote it.<br /><br />Yet, nary an ad for The Lost Room.<br /><br />Why? Is SciFi afraid of shedding its image as a low-quality channel? In any case, it's great that they finally put money towards something worthwhile. let's hope they do it again.
