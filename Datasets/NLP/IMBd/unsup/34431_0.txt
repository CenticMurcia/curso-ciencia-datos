I watched this show for about 5 minutes (I was 15) and joined millions in turning it off. (Funny, I did the same thing to "Caveman" this year.) <br /><br />The rumor I heard was that the head of ABC actually canceled the show BEFORE the first episode ended. (At 13 minutes into the show, supposedly the head of ABC told someone this was the ONLY episode ever to appear on the network.) That would have to be a record for anyone.<br /><br />Although, if ABC had any taste they would've done the same for "Caveman."<br /><br />Alas, poor Tim Conway had found a way to get onto yet another falling rock!
