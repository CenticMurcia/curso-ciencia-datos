I was a bit confused. I mean, they changed the whole story. It was a bit annoying. Now Jason can take the form of other bodies? I wonder what it would be like if he took the body of Gary Colman? Hehe! I should have stuck with the comments here on IMDb. A lot people said that this is the worst sequel. They were right. I would not really recommend this, unless you are on the same journey as I am. Have I converted to the Jason side? Nope. I don't think the 10th sequel is going to change my mind either. I will still watch and hopefully enjoy "Jason X". But I will be honest, Jason is a very cool killer. He just needs better movies. And they kept up with the traditional blood, gore, sex, nudity, stupid teenagers, and a silly plot. So, I simply must be kind.<br /><br />2/10
