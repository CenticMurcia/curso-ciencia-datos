Picking on our government and certain corporations with regards to debt and credit policy is like shooting fish in a barrel. So, the movie stuck to the easy stuff (credit card companies are bad and the government is ignoring the problem - both may be true) and the emotional stuff (people with sever psych problems or depression brought on by their spending habits who take their own lives) and skipped over what would have been a really good investigation.<br /><br />I'd like to know how people get into debt and what the process is. This movie completely ignored the "consumer" on focused on everyone else involved - and the blame was on the companies and the government. I'm not saying that those two aren't to blame at all, but there is a person who is spending and they should be held accountable.<br /><br />Finally, I would have liked to see more about the "typical American" with almost $10k of credit card debt. Find those "normal" people (not the extremes, which is what we were shown) and talk about their problems and why they get into debt in the first place.<br /><br />This movie missed so many opportunities and told so many half stories, that I was frustrated at at the end.
