Lucilius (William Lundigan) switches allegiances from Brutus (Robert Griffin) to side with Mark Anthony (Raymond Burr). When Anthony seeks an alliance with Cleopatra (Rhonda Fleming), Lucilius is not so convinced. Cleopatra has her own motives............<br /><br />It's an interesting story and that's the only reason to watch the film. From the beginning, when both the narrator and Lundigan refer to "Cassius" as "Cashius", you realize that it's going to be a moronic production. The acting is staged, the dialogue is phony and the sets don't quite work. It's all a bit tacky....and the music cheapens it somewhat more. I'm sure that Cleopatra's make-up is also wrong but like I say, it's the story that keeps you watching. No need to see it again.
