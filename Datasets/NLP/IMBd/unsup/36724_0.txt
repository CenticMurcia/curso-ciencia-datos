Atrocity is the one word definition for this film. I dare say even Hellraiser: Bloodline and Hellraiser: Inferno are better than this film. While Pinhead's greater presence in this one than in the last is a welcome change, the Hellraiser movies were never originally about him or the Cenobites, even though they seemed to have evolved in that direction, which, with proper directing and writing, could have been a good thing.<br /><br />Where to start? The acting is subpar at best, even compared to B-movies, even Ashley Lawrence, who did an excellent job in the first two films, delivers an underwhelming performance, let alone the job done by the protaganist Trevor. (I'm sorry I've made no reservations to learn any of the names from this film.)It's not to be blamed all on the actors, though. Sometimes a great actor or actress is hindered by the writing (i.e. Natalie Portman by George Lucas' dialogues, see her in The Professional or something else). And a warning, the writing is indecent, jerky and unnatural. The movie also doesn't feel quite at home carrying the Hellraiser title, aside from Pinhead and the Cenobites' presences and the occassional flash of the Lament Configuration. It doesn't possess the masterful storytelling of Clive Barker's imagination. Warning to the die-hard fan, your nit-picking will be far worse than this general, though wordy, comment (such as Pinhead's costume, if you're very observant, you'll know what I'm talking about). If you're hoping for a return to the roots, prepare for disillusion. I've loved all the Hellraiser movies, thus far, except III, which I've yet to see, but even this one wrenches my gut. Save your money and your time, go to the movies and put down the eight bucks for "Red Dragon" or whatever else floats your boat.
