Now I admit that the acting was a bit shoddy, but I believe that overall it wasn't that bad for a no-name cast. Also the soundtrack to the movie was very good. I mean, opening up the movie with "Strange disease" by Prozzak? That was not only great, that was also very fitting to the movie. And I never thought that I would live to see a movie where the song "Magic Chicken!" by the Aquabats would be fitting.<br /><br />The movie was funny. Very good for a made for TV movie, I just wish that I could get it on tape so that I could force all of my friends to watch it.
