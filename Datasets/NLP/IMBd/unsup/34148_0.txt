It is incomprehensible how this footage ever saw the light of day. I cannot believe a TV station would dare air it, even TBN, as just happened in Dallas. This work is so poor, in so many ways.<br /><br />More recent critiques and comments in this area do offer some needed explanation for the failed script, acting, directing and all technical aspects of this... film. Even low budget indy writers and directors I know, would never make the rookie mistakes displayed here. They are simply inexcusable.<br /><br />The concept for this script is so lame, I cannot imagine anything making it salvageable.<br /><br />I cannot even justify a further investment of time to comment on it. What an embarrassment.
