After watching such teen horror movies as Cherry Falls and I know what you did last summer, I expected this to be similar: Too gory, too boring and too badly acted.<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />Long time dead, A film in which a group of friends decide to have a night out, making out, getting high and dancing in the process, release a djinn (arabian Fire demon) accidentally while using a Ouija board. Unfortunately for them The evil demon doesn't like the idea and pays them back by killing them one at a time......<br /><br />The film to me, seems much darker and more evil than "i Know what you did last summer" with scenes in places that would creep you out if you had your whole family with you, it doesn't help that they live in an old house with a "strange" landlord. This also brings a few faults into the film by more of them later.<br /><br />The plot is pretty good and the way the students get killed is impressive, while many parts of the film can be quite scary.<br /><br />Faults: Well the fact that they are always in scary places ruins the plot, I mean if someone's trying to kill you, would you go into dark rooms? Or go ANYWHERE alone? me nether....<br /><br />The other bad part of the film is that we quite often see the characters running away from the evil demon which does get a bit annoying after a while.<br /><br />All In all I think this film is very good, better than many I have seen.
