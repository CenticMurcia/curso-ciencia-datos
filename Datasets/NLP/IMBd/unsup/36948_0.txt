One word - horrible. Don't waste your money, spend it on something else. This movie is dry, boring and even with Jason Biggs, it can't be saved. Very very poor script, the acting was as good as it could have been, with this pathetic script. Too bad maybe next time. At least they had nice scenery of San Francisco. Very predictable.
