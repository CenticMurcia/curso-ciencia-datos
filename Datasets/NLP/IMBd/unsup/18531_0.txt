Sci-fi keeps getting worse with these so-called original movies. PU did this one ever stinks. They must use the worse CGI, as their monsters are looking worse movie after movie. They take gator and mix his DNA with a Dinosaur. Did they mix in a mass murder as well? The so-called Supergator is not eating the people in the movie. He just killing them and moving right on to next victim. Don't insult our intelligence in these movies. Gators are not on the move right after a meal and since gators are from the dingo age. I'd say whatever dinosaur they mixed in would be relaxed right after killing and eating as well. Not Supergator. He kills one victim and two seconds later he's on top of another and another. The plot was terrible using an active volcano and people checking that out and getting killed along the way. The volcano blows at the end. Made no sense and if you missed this piece of crap. I recommend missing it the next time.
