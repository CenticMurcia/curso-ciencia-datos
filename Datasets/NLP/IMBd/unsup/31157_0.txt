Feast was super cool to watch. A local rundown bar in the middle of nowhere is a barfly and lowlife hangout with one out of town slick talker. Little does the motley crew inside getting tanked know whatsa coming there way. A family of creatures hungry for human flesh flavored with beer. A ton of blood for fans of gore. Feast don't try to be no Saw. I LMAO for real at a jokes they said. It was way funny how the own of town talker gives those lame pep talks you heard in high school about being a team player. I never took my eyes of Feast. Didn't wanna miss any gore or jokes. Coolest was when whatever those creatures were had porn sex outside, Funny as all hell. Tell a friend about Feast.
