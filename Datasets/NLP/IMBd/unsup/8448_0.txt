Honestly, despite the crap people here throw on Hook, I've always enjoyed watching this movie when it comes on TV. I still cry during the scene where Pan goes back to the tree where the lost boys hid out in the original cartoon. He starts to remember this past of how he was orphaned, taken to neverland, and watched his best friend Wendy grow old as he forever stayed a young boy. Reaching deep into his past of sadness and happiness, Pan (Robin Williams) evokes real emotion from the audience. Perhaps this is not one of Spielberg's better films, but to me, this is saying alot about the man. The fact that love one of his lesser effort as a childhood favorite, makes me want to watch all the rest of his films, such as Encounters and the Color Purple. Spielberg is truly a great director, and this movie, while not showing every facet of the man's ability, is truly an enjoyable and memorable ride. Please watch this movie (with an open mind) and judge it for what it is, not as a flawless work of a master director. As for me, this movie has a true treat, an fantastic heart-warming family movie like we all need every now and then. (8/10)
