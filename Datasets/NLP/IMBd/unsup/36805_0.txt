The film that we see shows a great deal of disrespect to the real people portrayed, the graphic novel upon which it is apparently based and its authors, to history, and to the audience. The real inspector Abberline was not a drug addict, nor a psychic. Mary Kelly WAS murdered.<br /><br />These were real people to whom terrible things happened. The movie sells these peoples' suffering to us as entertainment, yet does not even show the respect of caring what really happened. I hope the Hughes Brothers et al are haunted by the ghosts of history.<br /><br />As a movie, this film is also a disapointment. Depp cannot do a cockney accent to save his life, the result being distracting. There is a half heartedness to all the performances.<br /><br />Basically this film offended me. If you care about truth, integrity, love and honesty, don't bother with watching this move. Check out the real From Hell - the graphic novel.
