Irwin Allen produced a pair of memorable disaster epics in the early '70s, "The Poseidon Adventure" and "The Towering Inferno". However, Allen hit rock bottom with his final theatrical film "When Time Ran Out...". This movie is not up there in the same league as those two blockbusters. In fact, this is an embarrassment to all involved. The great cast that's featured here (Paul Newman, William Holden, Jacqueline Bisset, Ernest Borgnine, Red Buttons, etc.) deserved a good movie here. Instead, they're in a movie that features inept acting, inept dialogue, and especially inept special effects. See "Dante's Peak" or "Volcano" instead.<br /><br />* (out of four)
