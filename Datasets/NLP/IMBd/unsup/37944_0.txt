It takes Sheriff Pat two hours of movie time to hunt down Outlaw Billy. Along the way, each has isolated, random encounters with an assortment of characters that do nothing to move the plot along. An aimless and uninteresting Western, showing Peckinpah's continued decline after the peak of "The Wild Bunch." Every now and then some breasts are bared to perk things up but a better script would have been more helpful. Bland Kristofferson uses two facial expressions in playing Billy: Smiley Face and Not Smiley Face. Dylan's role seems to be an afterthought; he mumbles only a handful of lines, the most significant being the reading of food can labels. The only good thing about this clunker is cameo appearances by a Who's Who cast of character actors.
