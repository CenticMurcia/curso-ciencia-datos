the film had loads of late 50s surfing symbols which had a lot to do with the surfing explosion of the mid-60s on the east coast. it had a sun loving and easy going lifestyle feel which accurately summed up California attitudes of the day. yes, glossy and middle of the road, but a huge surfing film nonetheless. in addition, there are subtle references to booze and sex. for nostalgic value, there isn't a boomer around who wouldn't be immediately mesmerized by this swinging movie. for surfers, the long boards are of interest. car lovers will love the vintage cars. the concept of the surfing shack was something not present on east coast beaches, and one wonders if the the local beach patrol would have allowed such a building to be built and occupied on a public beach. maybe in hawaii, but not California. the beach is assumed to be the famous surfing beach, malibu; however reference is made to santa monica. whatever, we know the movie is taking place in southern cali. if one were to guess the year, one is tempted to say early 60s--say, 1962 or 63. but the film is significant because it documents a solid, burgeoning beach culture which had been in place since the years immediately following W.W. 2. this film is a rich summation of what transpired on the beaches of southern California in the 1950s.
