Slaughter Studios pictured itself a horror movie--it also tried to be campy and funny--unfortunately it missed on all counts. I found it lacking on all counts--with one exception--the movie bad guy was not expected and for me was the only high point of an other wise forgettable movie. My suggestion would be to rent as a last resort
