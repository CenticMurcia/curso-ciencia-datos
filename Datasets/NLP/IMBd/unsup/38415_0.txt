Anybody who wants to know what really happened that fateful night in 1873 when two Norwegian women were murdered on an island off the coast of New Hampshire won't find out by watching this movie. There was an article written by a woman named Celia Thaxter who lived on the islands at the time of the murders and personally knew all of the people involved. Celia also saw Maren after the murders and talked to her. The article was called "A Memorable Murder" and was published in the Atlantic Monthly. You can read it at this website: http://seacoastnh.com/smuttynose/memo.html In it she describes the evidence that was found at the scene and on the person of Louis Wagner that clearly point to him as the murderer instead of the outrageous and contrived story that was told in the movie and showed Maren as the murderer. For example: his bloody footprints were found in the house and around the island. He was also found with property that belonged to the Norwegians that he stole the night of the murders. There were also witnesses who saw him coming back from the island. Don't know why the movie makers decided to portray this ruthless murderer as someone who was innocent and wrongly put to death. They instead took hard working and innocent Maren and assassinated her character by portraying her as some crazed and twisted lesbian and incestuous creature. What should have been put to death is this badly written and fictitious screenplay.
