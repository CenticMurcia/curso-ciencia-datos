I am a die hard Bruce Willis fan (no pun intended) and it certainly wasn't him or Mos Def that kept this movie from being spectacular. Bruce Willis gave a very good performance, despite the fact that his role closely represented the same character he played in "Sin City." Mos Def performed incredibly well. Certainly his best performance to date.<br /><br />The performances of both Bruce Willis and Mos Def are probably the only element that kept this movie from completely bombing. Any other cast and it would have been a flop (duh).<br /><br />"16 Blocks" is a great action movie if that's what your into. The way I like to put it however is it's a good "twist(s) on an already overdone and cliché story line." I would go into further detail but I wouldn't want to spoil it for all of you. With plenty of suspense there isn't a dull moment that I can remember. This movie is definitely worth seeing if you like Bruce Willis or Mos Def. If not, then save your 9 bucks and rent a movie instead. If you are a Bruce Willis fan then maybe its worth it. If you're only a Mos Def fan and don't like the Bruce man then maybe the matinée price would better suit your tastes.<br /><br />Enjoy.
