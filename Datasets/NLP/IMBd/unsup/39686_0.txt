There were a few interesting aspects, especially for the film's era. The scope was pretty (overly?) large - even if a lot happens off-stage. However, there were some pretty horrible bits of acting as well. PLENTY of material for the MST3K guys. For a while I kept thinking it was FAIL-SAFE but done as a subplot on the Love Boat.<br /><br />I especially love the 8 women to 600 men left in the polar research station who get RIGHT to the obvious point. As morally distasteful as it is ladies, we have a planet to repopulate and lots of men with needs...<br /><br />Short straw gets George Kennedy.
