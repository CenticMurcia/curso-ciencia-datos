Alright. So...had they done this film for 500 dollars, i would have given them props for trying and said it was pretty friggin' excellent. But it says they spent 500 000 British pounds on it. What the hell did they spend it on??? That's almost a million US dollars. That fog machine and the spotlight behind the trees must have been pretty damn expensive. Not to mention the consumer camcorder they filmed this dog crap on. A soap opera looks better than that. Anyways, to the story...I guess the man in the hat was supposed to the villain? I sure as hell was cheering whenever he beat the crap out of that ugly ass blonde big-nosed whiny twit. All she did was scream whenever she was lucky enough to be getting away. Total moron, and a crappy actress as well. She totally deserved to die, and in a perfect world, she would have died in the first 3 minutes into the film. Also the brunette he brought over that kept on screaming for 3 days, I was really hoping he'd slit her throat and not just cut her tongue out. Man was she annoying. The end was also fantastic, I'm not even going to get into it. Please avoid this film like a plague, this garbage isn't even bad-good.
