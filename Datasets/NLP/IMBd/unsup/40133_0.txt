don know what they are trying to say through this movie. I don even feel like talking about the story. There is not even a single character in the complete movie who is normal. Every relationship is shown with a distorted point of view. when the movie ends one feels why did i even bother to watch it. As for the story the the widower who owns a restaurant finds a prefect girl for his Canadian born son but ends up getting attracted to her. Then his son has his own secrets. The daughter in law(Nandana Sen) has a family secret when her brother comes in the picture. So things are all entwined and make no sense. It does not give a good feeling after watching it. Good actors like Nandana and Mohan Agashe have been wasted in this movie thoroughly. They wanted to talk about some sexual taboos but then they distracted to some other topics by bringing in some utterly bogus plots.
