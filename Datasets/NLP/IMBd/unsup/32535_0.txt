Allan Quatermain and the lost city of gold is the sequel to King Solomon's mines that came out and flopped the year before.<br /><br />Richard Chamberlain is back as Adventurer Allan Quatermain, this time he along with lover Jesse (Sharon Stone) are back in the wilds of Africa searching for his long lost Brother after he disappears seeking a lost white race.<br /><br />But having seen this I can say there is NO lost city of gold - It's a building that looks like a Hospital and the 'race' consist of about 50 people in white dressing gowns, and there is no gold to be seen apart from a cauldron of sludge which is presumably Gold and the villain of the piece played by Henry Silva hamming it up in a pathetic Diana Ross wig.<br /><br />Many people on here has asked how Quatermain manages to melt the Gold at the end through a Mixture of Axe hitting the roof & some Lightning, I have NO idea and nothing is explained. <br /><br />How they managed to hire Oscar nominated James Earl Jones to appear in this I'll never know.<br /><br />'Lost city of gold is yet again made by the prolific masters of mindless action Golan/Globus and their B Movie studio Cannon Films.<br /><br />Most people seem to despise this and it's predecessor, because they seem to ask too much of a B-Movie - This, like the last is NOT supposed to be of Indiana Jones quality for Pete's sake - All a B-Movie has to do is Entertain, something which this does from start to finish.<br /><br />Yes you can argue It's got a low budget, poor acting, plot holes and cheap and cheerful visual effects, but give it a break, and I'll say it again - All that Golan/Globus films attempt to do is entertain.<br /><br />'Lost city of gold was another flop which put paid to this franchise, which if taken in the right frame of mind, is cheesy fun.<br /><br />** out of *****
