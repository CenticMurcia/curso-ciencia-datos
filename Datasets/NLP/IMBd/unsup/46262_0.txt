I saw the VidAmerica VHS of this as Deathgames (video box title)/Death Games (video title).<br /><br />A dreadfully boring movie that doesn't make much sense anyway.<br /><br />A newsreel cameraman for some reason decides he is going to make a film on a wealthy entrepreneur who generally doesn't grant interviews. He films a woman surfing topless while he waits to board the entrepreneur's yacht along with his girlfriend.<br /><br />On board the yacht, there is a big party. The cameraman films a woman dancing topless. The entrepreneur grants an interview, but he seems very sleepy and drunk and says something about killing, and rambles on about various things that seem unimportant. Later, the cameraman is on the beach, apparently drunk and/or stoned, filming the moon. He sees the topless dancer running topless with blood on her. He passes out, and someone takes the tape/film out of his camera. He later looks at the footage (apparently replaced), but it lacks the scene of the woman running and some of the things the entrepreneur said.<br /><br />Nevertheless, he and his girlfriend get invited to the man's penthouse. They get hit on by the entrepreneur and his mistress. They get drunk and their drinks get drugged. The girl is seduced by the mistress, and the entrepreneur plays various "games" which involve his guests apparently killing each other. Whether anybody is really getting killed or not is unclear; it may be an act for his own amusement, to watch on tapes recorded via his security system.<br /><br />The slow pacing of the movie, the way relatively nothing happens, and what does happen doesn't necessarily happen was pretty tiresome. The ending is not very satisfying at all, and does not clear up what the "games" were.
