First of all, I have to admit that this movie is 10 times better than the original. I've been told by numerous people that it isn't, but, I have reasons to support why I think so. 1. The pop-out Zombie in the cemetery is brilliant. 2. The make-up is outstanding. 3. Barbara doesn't just sit there. 4. The first scene in the movie is shot on a nice spring day that creates the atmosphere (for those who don't know) that it's going to be a nice movie. I could list more but there are just too many. I would also like to mention that the original film from 1968 is great as well. And something that I like about both of them is that they were shot not too far from my home in Pennsylvania. Watch both versions of the film. But I give this one a 10/10.
