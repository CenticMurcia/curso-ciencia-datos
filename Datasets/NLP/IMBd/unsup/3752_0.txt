In the Year 1939 you would have to visit the movie theater for about twelve weeks in a row in order to find out the complete ending to this film. This film involves three Circus Stuntmen who are acrobats and one of their brothers is killed which is caused by #39013, Harry Crowel in revenge for Horace Granville sending him to jail who was his former partner in his business. Carole Landis, (Blanche Granville)"I Wake Up Screaming" is the daughter to Horace Granville and finds out about a wicked scheme that #39013 has planned against her farther and if she tells her father will die. There is plenty of action, secret doors, secret panels and plenty of bombs being set off, with water rushing through tunnels and more and more. Great Classic film from 1939, this one you will really enjoy.
