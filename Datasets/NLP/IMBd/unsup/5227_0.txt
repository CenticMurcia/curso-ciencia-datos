Another round of mirthless antics from Ernest P. Worrell, a character considered lovable and endearing by only Jim Varney and the handful of in-bred yokels who make up the audience for these films. You have to feel sorry for Ron K. James, Varney's co-star in this mess, who has little to do but spout dreadful dialogue and look uncomfortable while Varney's gurning face hogs all the close-ups. The only entertainment value to be found as Varney mugs endlessly and destroys everything around him is in the hopelessly slack direction, which leads to such lapses in logic as a cannon rolling for miles along a completely straight road, a sequence that is topped only when the cannon bursts into a garden but leaves the fence behind it completely intact. The constant references to other films might be a distraction if they didn't remind you of how much better they are than this one.
