I just watched the laugh-fest that is 'Flight 93'.<br /><br />The most hilarious thing about that BS was the fact that just about all of the relatives receiving phone calls were holding small babies when they took the calls! I was just thinking 'bloody hell, how many more of these people are going to be holding babies?' when the Mark Bingham call was made. The next scene was at the Bingham's residence, and they were all holding babies! Not just one, but about three or four; f&#956;ck!ng hell, I lost count there were so many! Still laughing now! But the clincher was when that light aircraft was reporting a visual sighting of flight 93. "Take evasive action" ground control radioed to the GA pilot. Then the light plane flew right around and over flight 93, as it was in a 450kt+ decent! I nearly pi$$ed myself! What a fantastic movie! You do believe me, don't you? lol.
