Now days, featurettes are fairly common for just about any DVD (most of them are for promotional purposes only and are painful to sit through). Back when HALLOWEEN 4 was released on DVD in 2001, it was somewhat of a new thing. This documentary, directed by Mark Cerulli (who hasn't directed since), is only interesting if one is looking for a comparison of just how comprehensive DVD documentaries have become over the past five years. 'HALLOWEEN 4' FIANL CUT keeps information to a bare minimum. There is very little meat. With the exception of actresses Danielle Harris and Ellie Cornell, all the participants look as if they want to say what they have to say and leave, making the short running time boring to sit through. Screenwriter Alan B. McElroy shares limited insight into his craft of writing the script. All he says is that he was a fan of the franchise and seems to be extremely impressed he was able to write the script in eleven days. Furthermore, there is no mention of the input by the three other writers on the project that came up with the story. Credit should go where credit is due. HALLOWEEN 4 director Dwight H. Little gives the most insight into the making of the film though he doesn't seem to passionate about his work. Worst of all is executive producer Moustapha Akkad, coming off as a complete business man and nothing of a fan of the genre. I respect him for trying to keep the series alive, but come on, show some interest. Overall, a very disappointing documentary that should have been much longer and thorough. I'm giving it 4/10, since it slightly better than the average fluff piece.
