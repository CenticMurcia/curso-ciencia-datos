Powder follows a well-established formula: outcast develops special powers, finds love, gets vengeance on his tormentors. Many good movies have been made on this theme. Powder is not one of them - after a promising beginning, it turns into one of the worst films I have ever seen. The film wallows in its victim mentality, and one emerges not with a sense of victory but of depression.<br /><br />Rating: skip this one, see Phenomenon instead.
