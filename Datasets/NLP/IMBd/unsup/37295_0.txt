This is the most nastiest piece of junk I've ever seen. Forget Faces Of Death, this is all real and very graphic footage of well, let's see, Medical Operations, Accidents, Autopsys, plus pictures of suicides and police photographs. The shockementary is badly edited and is clearly meant to be exploitative and as sick as they, the producers, could get it. It's that badly edited in fact, that it just looks like a 2 VCR editing setup with a MIC attached. The commentator only rarely speaks, and when he does, his comments are gibberish and just to poke fun at the mayhem what unfolds. (During a scene of 'death' pictures) Comments include, " You will witness visions so incredibly graphic that your brain will surely comprehend the ghastly images it will receive!". Although, this footage is supposed to be 100% real, you won't know what the circumstances behind the scenes were, and therefore I found it boring and just vile. At least in Faces of Death, the commentator explains each scene so you know what has happened. Traces Of Death also includes the televised suicide of Bud Dywhite. This scene is replayed in different angles, replayed slowed down, and plainly just played till it would make you sick. If your after a rambling collection of death scenes this is your dream DVD!. However, if your after a serious documentary, then don't bother with this. I see its also banned in the UK, normally I think censorship is abhorrent, but in this case the BBFC (British Board of Film Classification) should be given an award instead of the baseball bat!!!!. At this point I'd also like to point out this part does NOT have any death metal music. It's sick, vile, disturbing, and is strictly for adults over 18 what has a open mind, In my opinion, if you want a real shockumentary, Get Bumfights Presents: Terrorists, Killers & Middle East Wackos. Be warned, this is very graphic. I'll give Traces of Death a 3, because of it's pure exploitation!
