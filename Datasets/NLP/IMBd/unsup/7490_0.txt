Philip Kaufman is a director whose films are hard to connect. He's made three of my all-time favorite films, Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1978), The Right Stuff (1983) and The Unbearable Lightness of Being (1988). His follow-up to The Unbearable Lightness of Being is perhaps too similar in focus and subject. Henry & June, much like TULB, is based on European literature and set in Europe, very artful in its creation, and about sex. Actually, this film is all about sex. A lot of people don't seem to like it because it doesn't seem to have much point other than the sex. But I think there's a place for erotic art, and, damn, this film is one of the most erotic works ever made. I bet you a dollar you can't make it through without touching yourself at least once. I never found it boring; I was utterly absorbed by the beauty of it all. Maria de Madeiros, whom you will remember being pleasured orally by Bruce Willis in Pulp Fiction, is the star (she plays Ana√Øs Nin). I have to wonder, watching this movie, why she didn't become the biggest star in the world. She certainly is one of the sexiest women ever to appear on screen. Her eyes are maddening. It almost doesn't matter for this film, but she gives quite a good performance, too. Uma Thurman is also quite sexy, and also gives a fine performance. I'm not a big fan, truth be told, but this is one of her best performances. I was less impressed with Fred Ward, who plays Henry Miller, and Richard E. Grant doesn't quite pull off an American accent. I don't know. I don't think I can ever see him as anyone besides Withnail again. Kevin Spacey is also good in a small supporting performance.
