I saw the title of this movie and read the synopsis. It looked like It might be alright. I do love a good stoner movie. What followed was one of the worst 1 hour and 30 minute movies I have had the displeasure of watching. <br /><br />As I watched I wondered why they would want to make such a movie. Are they trying to set back marijuana legalization 20 years? How could any producer back this? Why would Anna Farris star in this? I wondered if anyone associated with this movie had ever even smoked weed.<br /><br />There were so many bad moments in this I do not know where to start or even care to try.<br /><br />How did the director ever make it this far?<br /><br />How is this movie getting slightly more than 5 stars???<br /><br />I will always scratch my head after watching movies this bad. At least it inspired me to write a review, I suppose.<br /><br />Stay away from this one. I recommend Cheech & Chong's Up in Smoke, Nice Dreams, Next Movie, Thing's are Tough All over, or any other well-known and well-liked movie about smoking pot.<br /><br />This was garbage. Nothing redeeming about it at all. Shame on you Anna.
