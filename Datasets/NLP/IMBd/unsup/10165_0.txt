Blackadder series 1 was ok, 2 was very good, 3 was pretty good, but this, series 4 is an absolute masterpiece.<br /><br />It is so side splittingly funny, even 10 years & countless repeats later, that you hurt laughing while watching it.<br /><br />The hilarious gags are just constant & the characters sensational. The final episode (6) should be shown once a month as it is the greatest half hour of television ever.<br /><br />This series is TV at it's best, it's humour at it's best, it's just everything at it's best.<br /><br />It's an absolute privillege to have watched 3 hours of comedy, excitement, sadness & a quite brilliant portrayal of WW1, that is Blackadder series 4.<br /><br />If you've never seen it, make the effort. You lucky sods! You'll never see anything better. Alongside Fawlty Towers, the greatest piece of TV ever.
