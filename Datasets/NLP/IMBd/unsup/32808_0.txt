Before watching the movie I looked on the "reliable" IMDb site to see what type of movies this is.<br /><br />"Comedy / Romance" ???? are you people crazy??? Comedy??? I was really in the mood for something funny and enjoyable, and instead I found myself watching a Drama/Romance , a story about broken, sad people.<br /><br />I only had the patience to watch half of the movie, probably I missed a great ending, probably...<br /><br />I wanted something funny, the category in which this movie was placed was "Comedy", I ended up watching something totally different.<br /><br />If this is a Comedy then it's the worst I've ever seen.
