What should I say about Days of Our Lives. I started watching it when I was a teenager.. about 5 years ago.. I think I was 15 at that time. At first I found it boring but as I persisted watching the show I realised it that it's not that boring after all. That show is fun to watch and interesting as well. As the days passed by, I became addicted to it, i really got into it. I left watching it for a while, cause I've been busy.. but then I got into it again. I think the actors in Dool are amazing, they know how to act. My fave couple used to be Belle and Phillip, but I don't feel that way anymore. As the years passed by, I became a fan of the teenage friends Will and Mia. They are fun, so far I'm loving the storyline.
