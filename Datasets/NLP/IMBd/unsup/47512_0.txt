Aside from a few good jokes here and there this one was rather dull. No wonder it won an award for most boring comedy of the year in 1995. I chuckled a couple of times, but for the most part I just wanted it to be over. Mel Brooks was most definitely not at his best for this one as at times you forget it is supposed to be a comedy and it takes it self to seriously.
