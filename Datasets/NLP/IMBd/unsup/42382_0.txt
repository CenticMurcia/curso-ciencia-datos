Best described as the poor man's version of Total Recall. And I'm not saying that a movie needs a big budget to be good, but in this case the script, the set and the actors are poor as well. It's like the cast from 'The Bold and the Beautiful' are trying to fill the shoes of Arnold Schwarzenegger. But what I hated most about the movie was the horrible side-kick. Save yourself the time, do something useful like watch paint dry or something.
