I just saw this feature film at London's frightfest film festival, the best horror and genre, fantasy and thriller film festival in Europe in my opinion.<br /><br />The director Jordan barker, who looked really young introduced the film and Gabrielle anwar was meant to be there but unfortunately she couldn't make it.<br /><br />the film feels like an old fashioned horror m,movie from the 80's and as far as i'm concerned that is a great thing.<br /><br />The acting was great, Gabrielle Anwar, who has just vanished since her star turn in the Al Pacino 'hoo ha' movie, and I have always wondered what happened to her, but she is great and still looks beautiful, but she can really act.<br /><br />Forest Whitaker is always good and the director was steady and precise, the director talked after the movie and he said he had unique problems on this film as it was a much bigger budget than his previous film, but I still think he did a good job.
