It is a fine first effort, or a mediocre second effort, or horrific life's work. The plot was a little thin. The action was a little choppy. The effects were not half bad. The video was slightly grainy. Better than a student film. But It was fun. This is not the type of film one finds at Sundance. This is the type of film one finds at a SciFi convention. If you want 90 min. of light hearted distraction, this is it.<br /><br />If one goes by the writing style, this film is the first in a series.<br /><br />I look forward to the second film in the series.<br /><br />Perhaps the lighting and cine will be better polished.
