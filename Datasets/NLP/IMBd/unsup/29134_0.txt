remember when you would hear a song & try to claim it before anyone else saying "that's my jam"? well "this my movie".<br /><br />not too many people know of this one which in a strange way is a good thing. we don't want it to be spoiled by mainstream biters.<br /><br />i myself just happened to stumble across this one when doing the typical back and forth at the blockbuster a few years back. i saw the cover and it looked appealing - let's see, a romantic comedy without meg ryan? black peeps who are professionals with upper mobility? a story that's actually not about the stereotypical thug?<br /><br />it's an original, creative story made by very talented actors, producers, and music biggies. soundtrack is on-point, characters are likable, even the cameos are well-chosen! overall it's a funny feel-good flick smoothed out on the r&b tip wit a pop appeal, appeal, to it.
