First off let me say that I decided to give this show a chance based on the amount of positive reviews on this site. I gave it seven painful 40 minute viewings before I decided to call it quits on this show.<br /><br />Utterly formulaic. Every episode proceeds in a manner identical to the last. Bret Harrison awakes to discover that he is affected in some strange way by his "demon-sense". He goes to work, and manages to run into the devil. The devil gives him, in the vaguest manner possible, his assignment. He receives a box. Somehow his demon-hunting manages to delay the inevitability of his love interest with Andi.<br /><br />Nothing about the writing in this show makes any sense. A canvas of hollow, poorly constructed characters interact in a manner completely abstracted from the reality in which social interaction actually occurs. Nothing so much as the motivation or background of the characters is properly accounted for, reducing the characters to moving plot devices. <br /><br />It was actively arduous to watch the writers delay the painfully obvious love connection between the male and female lead. Every episode is another exercise of giving the audience hope, and then somehow spoiling it. This is obviously done to create a plot arc between episodes in a series otherwise devoid of continuity and purpose.<br /><br />The show earned three stars because it wasn't the actors' fault. I sincerely believe it was the fault of the writers.<br /><br />Avoid this show like the plague, H1N1, herpes, and the clap. You might trick yourself into thinking it is mildly clever after one or two episodes, but you'll soon realize this show has less tricks up its sleeve than a magician in a nudist colony.
