Do some research people. You gotta love Hollywood taking liberties with everything. I guess they think there is no one out there who knows anything about Denmark. I'm not even Danish but I know that one prince is married to someone who is not Danish, she is from Austalia , they were married in 2004, so the entire story line is unbelievable. And also, speeding around the streets of Denmark like the prince (or king as they called him) was, he would have probably hit one of the hundreds or thousands of bicyclists that ride in Copopenhagen everyday. 10 minutes of research would've helped this film a lot, But the again the acting was so brutal, they could've used the Library of Congress and still made a horrible film.
