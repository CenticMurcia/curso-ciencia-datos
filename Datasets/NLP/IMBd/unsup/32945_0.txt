Is everyone blind, or just afraid that they missed a nuance that would appear obvious to the learned? ; Rest assured you did not - this movie missed the mark completely. No, Japanese pants are not different; Yes, the love scene was horrid; No, you don't die jumping only 4 feet with ARMS EXTENDED in ANY swimming hole; Yes, the background music was interesting for about 30 seconds and then quickly became unbearable. Yes, this movie is embarrassingly(unintentionally) racist. This movie was just a mistake - period.<br /><br />Oh, and is it just me or was anyone else completely unmoved by the "tragic" turn of events? There was no emotion or love in any of they're scenes together, in fact, Collette has more emotional energy in the scenes by herself afterward(odd)?!
