I think many people that see this don't realize is that much of the dialog is not scripted. The actors are given information about what there character is like and they themselves create the scene. I place this on the same level of comic genius as "Who's Line Is It Anyway?".<br /><br />This type of comedy is not for everyone and that is why some people feels this comes off as quirky. I have to be honest and say I have never seen "The Office" so I cannot comment on any of the comparisons.<br /><br />I am happy that this series has been picked up for another season (3). I do have to admit that I could not see this running on one of the major networks, but TBS is a great place for it. I would like to see about five or six seasons then have a made for TV movie type conclusion.
