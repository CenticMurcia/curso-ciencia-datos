Maybe this film is not the greatest danish movie ever made, but it sure is funny. Around the cinema people was laughing at all times, when they once in a while got hit by something they recognised. And then once in a while there was a one liner, that made the whole cinema laugh. When you leave the cinema, you can't help it - you're happy and you believe in love, and it's capability to make everything right. Cliche? yes but isn't lovely once in a while to believe, that somethings in the world, can make all the wrongs to rights?<br /><br />I haven't heard a danish film being discussed and laughed at among friends and work companions, as this movie. Not even the dogme-movies!
