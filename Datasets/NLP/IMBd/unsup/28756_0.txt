Once again, I'm sick and tired of seeing comments from people expecting a better storyline. This is a SOFTCORE PORN FLICK! Give me a list of softcore porn flicks with great writing! They don't exactly hire David Mamet to write these things! Besides, do you want (and this question is only for straight men or homosexual women) good writing in a film like this? What would be the use?<br /><br />Of course, some people don't appreciate the simulated sex scenes. I think they look pretty realistic. All the guys and girls really look like they're getting into it. I personally find no enjoyment in watching a guy's hairy testicles bang against a woman's buttocks, which is why I most prefer this tasteful brand of porn. But if you like seeing the hardcore stuff, then hey that's your taste. The box for this movie wasn't labeled XXX. In fact, the one I rented was R-rated (despite the fact that the nudity and sex was pretty explicit and covered about 90-percent of the film's running time). So don't say you weren't warned.<br /><br />I always love Surrender Cinema's movies, because they have some of the best-looking girls EVER! And I can honestly say, this movie has the most beautiful women out of all Surrender Cinema flicks. I didn't have to worry about having the urge to fast-forward to the next scene. Each woman stimulated me almost equally. Of course, the pinnacle of the film would have to be the sultry "Asian massage" between Jacqueline Lovell and that Asian chick. Hot, hot, hot!<br /><br />If you ARE a fan of the Surrender Cinema flicks, you should have a great great great time with "Virtual Encounters"! Damn, I can't wait to see the sequel!!!<br /><br />My score: 10 (out of 10)
