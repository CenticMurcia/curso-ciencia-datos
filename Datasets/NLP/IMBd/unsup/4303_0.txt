This was possibly the first Hindi movie where the young generation of India was so realistically depicted and because of that I can relate to this very much as a young man. Three friends with three different personalities ... incredibly funny at times! ... yet it also has some very sad moments which genuinely touches the heart! I love this movie very much. I can watch it a hundred times and never get bored. All the characters were great! Aamir Khan, Akshay Khanna, Saif Ali Khan, Preity Zinta, Dimple Kapadia, Sonali Kulkarni ... each one of them had unique roles. As a huge fan of Aamir Khan, I can't help but be biased in saying that this certainly was one of Aamir Khan's finest performances ... and to me personally, I think this was his best performance after Lagaan! I also became a fan of Dimple Kapadia after watching this movie. Her role in this movie and her performance was simply amazing!
