Worth watching! It is funny, romantic, and a really good script - New York city's dating game and on location on the streets of NY, great fashion by actresses and actors and Ed Burns 's words and acting are just super! I love the documentary style and narration, 6 people in the city in these interlocking relationships, very captivating, the background photography were great with natural lights in the city, and of course the soundtracks fit the movie very well. I watched this movie many times, the reasons are that the story is very interesting. The interplay between different characters in their witty ways, and also the great acting by all the actors in this movies, of course, the handsome Ed Burns, the pretty Bittany Murphy are the lead actors. In one scene, when Ed is having dinner with his date in the movie with the background music of lush life - such a romantic Jazz tune!
