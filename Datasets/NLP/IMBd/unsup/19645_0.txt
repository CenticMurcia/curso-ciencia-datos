'After the Sunset' is about Pierce Bronsan, a retired jewel thief. At the beginning he steals a diamond, but the heist scene isn't very good at all, and neither is this movie. So the movie starts where most heist movies end, in paradise. This movie is so stupid because Pierce Bronsan doesn't really want to steal the diamond until this idiot of an FBI agent comes and tricks him into it. The whole movie is pretty dumb, its just Brosnan, Hayek and Harrelson goofing off on an island, then eventually some sort of plot picks up, Don Cheadle recruits Brosnan to steal the diamond, then he gives Don Cheadle the plans on how to do it, but he really is just using that as a decoy so he can steal the diamond. This film has a very loose plot that isn't very gripping, and the actual heist scene is very childish and simple.<br /><br />I spit on this movie, Mwahah!
