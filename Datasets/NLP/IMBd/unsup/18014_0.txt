I remember when this video came out in video stores like 1987-1988. I would have watched then, but the cover was misleading. The front cover showed what looked like to be human/animal sacrifice, the back of the cover said something like "this video isn't for the squeamish" or something like that and I thought it was gonna be all bloody and stuff. Thats why I never watched it years ago. Recently my friends had showed it to me and it had NOTHING to do with human/animal sacrifice or anything bloody and gross. Instead I was introduced to REAL Satanism and what is truly is and what it is not. I had always wondered if this was an attempt to sabotage the World Church of Satanic Liberation because they weren't like the Church of Satan. Maybe Paul Valentine would have made a better cover boy than the late Herman Slater, but the fact is Paul Valentine wasted no time in telling what his organization is all about, what he does and what the WCSL stands for. ( Goto youtube and watch his videos! Scream Greats 2 is on there!!) He will tell you what Satanism is and what is not. Also, he points out the fallacies of Wicca/Wiccians, why Christianity doesn't not work, and its OK to think for yourself. Its a MUST see!
