Very disappointing. As much as I love Al Pacino, the movie writing in this movie was bad. It promises to keep you on the edge of your seat but didn't deliver. Got confusing at times, trying to throw off your suspicions but was just a loss of direction. The suspects were too numerous and got me thinking he had the wrong person in prison. It was too unbelievable and too many twists to be considered worth while watching. It was stupid to think that he had all of his students suspect and outside people too, from the doorman and the motorcycle guy following them around all the time. It should have had clear direction and writing, that's all I can say. I was expecting a 10 and got a 1 out of this movie. Maybe if this movie had backwards time drama like, "Vantage Point", it would have made the movie more intense. For now, try another movie.
