I was getting ready to go to bed and saw this was coming up on TV. I decided to stay up and watch it-Keri Lynn Pratt has an ambiance about her that I find mezmorizing. Anyway, after the PAINFUL 2 hours I can honestly say I feel dumber. While watching this movie I think my IQ dropped about 20 points and I suffered ireperable damage to my stem cells....<br /><br />Terrible acting, a cheesy plot and INCREDIBLY weak character devolpment make this move a trainwreck. If you're into movies with nonsensical ramblings of unskilled actors and actresses-this movie is for you. Simply having Keri in the movie was enough for me to stand the entire 2 hours, but for many this will not be the case. Do not invest any time or money into this one, you will be SORRY!
