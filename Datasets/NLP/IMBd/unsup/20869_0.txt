Absolutely brilliant, occasionally queasy-making, gut-bustingly funny comedy. Matt Lucas and David Walliams have created a cast of curmudgeons and ne'er-do-wells that are astonishing in their range -- Lucas, in particular, melts into his various roles with an almost eerie changeability. The humour is actually relatively simple (a tiny man with giant props! the PM has a gay aide with a crush on him! a hypnotist manipulates his friends and neighbours!), but is executed with such subtlety and wickedness that it never gets old. Some of the characters, such as David, the only gay in the village, are destined to be cult classics, and deservedly so. Only complaint: some of the skits have the usual faint whiff of misogyny we've come to expect in British sketch comedy. But I have to admit that even as an inveterate feminist I tend to chalk these moments up to "cultural differences," and keep watching and laughing all the same. Please keep making "Little Britain" till the end of time!
