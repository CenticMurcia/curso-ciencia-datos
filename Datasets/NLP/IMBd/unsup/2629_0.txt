I never tuned into Meerkat Manor until a few episodes before the Season 1 finale. I was addicted to it right away. I figured a documentary on MEERKATS couldn't be worth watching. But it most definitely is. I love this show.<br /><br />This all follows a large group of Meerkats called the Whiskers who fight for survival in the rough Kalahari desert. Several rivals clans surround them and they're always on the lookout for predators. Being so little, Meerkats have many.<br /><br />Flower is the dominant female of the Whiskers. And she has one of the largest group of Meerkats in the manor who she leads proudly with her loyal mate, Zaphod.<br /><br />I guarantee you'll be addicted to this wonderful, fascinating show that teaches you so much about some of the smallest animals on this planet.<br /><br />Watch it. You won't be disappointed.
