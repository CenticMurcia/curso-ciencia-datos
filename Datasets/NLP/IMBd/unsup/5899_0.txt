For those who haven't read the book (which is my case as well) you will find a very cute and sad movie, very much worth your time. It has excellent acting, a convincing plot and heart-breaking moments all over the place, and sometimes it even pulls a laugh right out of you.<br /><br />Even though the young Henry doesn't really convince you that much, the scenes are so adorable that you overlook the petty details. The plot seems to have a few holes, but might be just details that were better explained in the book and the writers/editors/director decided to leave out of the film. This was still hardly ever a problem.<br /><br />To sum up: a cute, sad and enjoyable film for those who like to be moved a bit. 8/10.
