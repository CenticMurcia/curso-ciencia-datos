This movie is only getting two stars because nobody gives two stars for movies and I wanted to distinguish myself.<br /><br />This book was one of the few books I have read in my life time, and to see it impugned so ruthlessly by the movie makers hurt. A lot.<br /><br />Entourage watchers: Do you remember when the Variety columnist told Johnny Drama that he took a star off his "Five Towns" rating as soon as he saw Drama in the show? Well, apply that idea to Paul Walker, and make the one star three stars.<br /><br />I really want to see Crichton's Prey on the big screen, but I fear after this debacle it wont happen. Great.
