The plot of this movie (two ill children escaping the bubble they live in to take on an endeavour in the outside world) is very thin and failed to sustain my interest. Perhaps, the symbolism didn't get to me. Many times, I asked myself where all this was heading. The poetic aura left me emotionally disconnected and questioning the purpose of my viewing. It is however, a very unusual and gutsy film for which the director should be praised. For those easily offended, please take note that the children, portraying the title characters are nude for nearly the entire movie.
