It really really sucked!! Thank God for the "Friday The 13th" movies! I really enjoy them... =) I almost felt sick after the opening scene... Who wants to se a girl loose all her legs and still keep on running? Silly as hell. I want them to be a bit more serious than that even though they don't have to be "good". Ugh!!
