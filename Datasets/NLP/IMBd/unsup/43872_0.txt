Charming it is but the comedy's scarce. Just about all of this film leaves you wondering what went on. The plot is patchy to say the least, and the film doesn't seem to have the cohesion of other early British comedies you find these stars in. It came across as a complete mish-mash of experimentalism and surrealism, leaving you thinking everyone involved in it was on an illegal substance. Looking at what the director went on to do in his career, this film can be forgiven for being an example of early directorial teeth-cutting.<br /><br />Margaret Rutherford was well cast, but it felt the director somewhat smothered her talents and over did the 'dotty' approach (and where did all the kids come from giving you that 'St.Trinians' feel in the last 5 minutes?). Richard Hearne left me wishing they had cast someone, not only with a personality, but with a skill for improving a lacklustre dialogue - Alastair Sim could have really done something to improve this film. And Sid James waddling along always moaning about his 'KNITTING'? - I ask you!. As for the Police? They would have been better cast in The Wizard of Oz as the Wicked Witch's bodyguard.<br /><br />For individual talent, this film was interesting for observing what the cast can do on screen as an alternative to how you have normally seen them. As a film on the whole, it's pretty bad. I would say it's a cross between anything made by Fritz Lang and whoever came up with On The Buses. It just leaves you feeling slightly uncomfortable.<br /><br />Get it just for the library, and leave it there.
