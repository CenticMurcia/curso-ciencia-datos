I do know that the Eurovision song contest isn't supposed to be taken seriously as a song contest otherwise the 1990s would have seen Blur , Oasis or The Verve as the UK contestants while Ireland fielded U2 with Air representing France etc . In short this contest is not supposed to be taken seriously but come on at least pretend you're voting for the song you liked best , but alas politics comes into it . All the countries of the former Yugoslavia voted for one another which can be seen as part of a healing process but be honest , do you think the ghosts of 278,000 dead Yugoslavs can be exorcised by a camp and cheesy song contest featuring more often than not Euro-trash ? Neither do I . All the Nordic countries voted for one another while Greece and Cyprus gave each other maximum points as they do every year much to the disgust of the gathered audience in Turkey . Talking of Turkey I thought their entry was probably the best on the night , a sort of ska inspired track played by an actual band , but the winner was The Ukraine which seemed to have stolen their style from that sword and sorcery show from New Zealand <br /><br />A well staged and organised musical event but an event that is well past its sell by date and which should hopefully be scrapped in the near future
