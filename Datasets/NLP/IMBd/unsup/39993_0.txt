This movie on the back says that it is in vein of Dawn of the dead and Shaun of the Dead. Somebody lied!! This movie is completely opposite. The only good thing about this movie is that the girls in it looked good. The rest had really nothing to do with zombies. Do Not rent even if your bored. Stay Bored, go play with yourself or something, anything would be better than this crap. Now I will say this; the weird guy with the camera, i think his name was lucky, got to see the girl topless and then recorded it on the camera. Whats funny though is the fact that 5 seconds later we see him sitting on a rock by himself playing a challenging game of pocket pool, but before he can finish flogging the dolphin he gets scared and runs away. Even though this is sick it just shows that if this was the best part of the movie imagine what the rest of the movie is like.
