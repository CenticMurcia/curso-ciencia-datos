The skilled cast of this film is given little to work with as most of the plot development of Boyle's wonderful novel is tossed out in favor of enema references. While it is still a good satire of health crazes (which are hardly a new phenomenon), the book simply had too much story to put into one movie.<br /><br />I was also disappointed that some of the facts were changed (Dr. Kellogg, for example, stayed fit and healthy well into his 90's) to please the anti-fitness people. The truth was crazy enough.
