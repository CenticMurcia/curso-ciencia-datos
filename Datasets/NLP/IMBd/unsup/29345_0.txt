This is an interesting movie. I really enjoyed it and was perfect for the kids and also a great film for the young at heart aswell. The plot is gripping with the Lucky Duck lake monster and the fact that his secret love for Patti is almost over in just over 1hr and 30mins which is just perfect for the kids who want to go to bed soon. But over all a fine film and I will watch time and time again. Hopefully there will be Dougs Second Movie, now that would be great
