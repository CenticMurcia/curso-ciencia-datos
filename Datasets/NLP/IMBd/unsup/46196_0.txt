This sitcom is basically a half-hearted attempt to copy Larry Charles in Curb Your Enthusiasm. Kirstie fails miserably. Every episode shows her stuffing her face and not even TRYING to lose weight. Watching it I'm wondering, what am I doing watching this loser of a show? It's not what it claims to be because Kirstie "gets work" even as a fat actress. Fact is, it's a man's world and there is no way around it. Men can be ugly, fat, balding, flat-butt, short, whatever, and we accept it. However, fat women are DISGUSTING on film and the last thing a viewer wants to see is a fat woman EATING compulsively on TV. This show is disgusting, not even funny and should be canceled.<br /><br />That being said, Rachael Harris is awesome. She carries the show. The time she smoked crack from Kirstie's brother was hilarious. And her comments as Kirstie and others are talking are spot on and hilarious. Now, I would LOVE to see HER get her own show.<br /><br />But to Kirstie - if you are going to star in your own show - be original. You are just a "showtime" "subpar" version of Curb Your Enthusiasm. You aren't funny.
