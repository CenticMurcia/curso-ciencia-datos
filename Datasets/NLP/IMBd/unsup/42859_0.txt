This film is terrible. It's a true abomination to the Star Wars universe. I was really excited when I saw a promo pic and a trailer for it but I was utterly disappointed when I finally confronted the real thing. Words fail me in terms trying to find a level of garbage this movie has reached. The special effects are amazing, I will give credit where it's due. However, like so many other fanfilms, this movie is made just so the special effects team behind it could show off and likely that someone wanted to look cool with a lightsaber. I have been watching the Star Wars movies religiously ever since I was a youngling and I know when someone does credit to the Star Wars Universe (Even if Episodes I and II didn't, lol) and this movie does not. I would advise anyone even thinking of watching this movie to stay away and save yourself the time wasted on this mockery of that which we, the fans, hold so dear to our hearts. Please, if you are a die-hard Star Wars fan and truly love the saga, then I would say don't waste your time. The story is cheap and artificial. The acting is atrocious and the dialogue is even worse. Avoid at all costs!!
