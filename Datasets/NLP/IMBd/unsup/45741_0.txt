When I saw the box for Ticker at at the local video store back in 2001,I was genuinely surprised.I had not seen this in theaters?Surely A seasoned actor like Tom Sizemore off great parts like In Saving Private Ryan,Black Hawk Down,and many others get the DTV treatment?<br /><br />Even more eerie is Steven Seagal fresh off his return to box office glory with Exit Wounds hit DTV so soon?It was bound to happen anyway.<br /><br />Throw in acting legend Dennis Hopper slumming it.How could this go DTV? Simple:its a bad movie.A 3rd-rate speed/Blown away Knock off.Sizemore and Seagal are the cop and Bombsquad master on the trail of Maddog Hopper.It seems like a normal B flick.B for boring.It starts slow and stays that way.Never rising to above mute.<br /><br />Is this the same Steven we saw 6 months earlier from Exit Wounds?The Raspy voice.Sudden Weight gain.There is not even a decent fight scene in the whole movie?I did not buy the Zen style he talked up.I suspect it is not all his fault here though.<br /><br />Sizemore looks bored.But can act in his sleep.He gives a little depth to his role.Fault cannot really lay with him either.<br /><br />Dennis Hopper shows up as the "Irish" terrorist.He is kinda hamming it up here.He is amusing to watch.No fault here either.<br /><br />Peter Greene,Ice-T,Jamie Pressly,Nas,and Hill ST blues alum Joe Spano pop up for either bits or extended cameos.The sad fact is they could have been in the movie longer.Or a better movie altogether.I cannot blame them.<br /><br />Albert Pyun.The name ring a bell anyone?Nuff Said.Bad director.But even he can rise to the occasion sometimes.I think its simple: Nu Image-bad movie makers.Its their fault.<br /><br />This could have been something.I suspect there was a decent movie in the script.But the finished results leave a lot to be desired.Maybe this is what drove Tom Sizemore to drugs?Seagal to even worse movies.
