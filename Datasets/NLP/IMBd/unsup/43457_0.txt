Thursday June 1, 6:30pm The Harvard Exit<br /><br />Roberto Rossellini's The Flowers of Saint Francis is resplendent in its simplicity. Seeing the film on a big screen is an unparalleled experience. The short film preceding it, is another matter. My Dad Is 100 Years Old is a love letter written by and starring his daughter Isabella. Within seconds the phony, pretentious technique of this short identifies it as the work of none other than Canadian poseur and wannabe auteur Guy Maddin. Imagine going to the home of a fabulous chef for what will certainly be an incredible meal. The guests are seated and wait with anticipation for the coming feast. Wine is served, candles are lit and the mood reaches an anticipatory climax. At that moment, the chef's child leaps onto the table and with great delight lays a giant smelly turd. It can certainly be removed and forgotten, somewhat, but avoiding the incident altogether would have been preferable.
