"No Way Back" is your typical generic action movie. With it's typical generic plot, it's typical generic clich√©s and it's typical generic run of the book characters. I wasn't really expecting anything great on account on any of these things, but what I wanted to see was some good action and yet it failed even there.<br /><br />There is really only one scene that could actually be worth seeing again and that is the shootout in the beginning. It lasted for about a minute, but it was nicely choreographed, with some relatively good use of slow motion and gun play. Leaving a good first impression. Sadly it does not last long as the movie apparently ran out of budget after that scene was shot and everything went down hill from then on. With some atrocious over the top acting, incredibly annoying female lead and a weak attempt at creating dramatic tension and development between characters. I understand that the filmmakers were running on a tight budget. But they could have at least tried to hide that fact. There are actually several moments when the main character is conversing with his superior in the FBI headquarters, and well it looked like they were shot in some abandoned warehouse. Problems don't stop there though. The movie's what could've been only redeeming factor namely the action scenes besides the one I've spoken of earlier aren't really all that good. It's like two completely different people directed them, with the quality of the latter ones being on the same level as a Dolph Lundgren film.<br /><br />Going in to plot details is unnecessary because chances are you've heard all of this before and seen all of this before done in about half the action movies released in the last 20 years.<br /><br />Besides it's decent beginning there isn't really anything entertaining in "No Way Back". A waste of time .
