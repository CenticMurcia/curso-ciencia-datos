I rented this movie thinking it was going to be a typical National Lampoon's movie (lots of laughs, college humor, the same means of Animal House). Instead, I got a movie that sounded like a sex ed documentary, because it was too melodramatic to be considered a romantic comedy. Adam (Cameron Douglas) didn't seem to be the "sex crazy guy" described in the movie summary in the back of the box. Eve (Emanuelle Chriqui) character was okay because of the message she wanted to bring up to the audience. Adam's buddies weren't present in the movie that much, so we don't get enough feedback of Adam's life BEFORE meeting Eve.<br /><br />I'll give this movie a 1 out of 10, because I cant give it a 0. I'm still upset about the name "National Lampoon" in the box.
