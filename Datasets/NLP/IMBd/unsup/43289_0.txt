The acting is terrible. The plot makes no sense. This movie attempts to explore 2 relevant & infinitely interesting topics...a type of D/s relationship & human slave trafficking. Unfortunately, it doesn't come close to doing either justice. It attempts to intertwine the two in a way that makes no sense. The D/s side comes off as typical fantasy...the woman is offered large sums of money by a rich man to try being his kept-nude & in a cage pet & she likes it. Now, I'm not against a well-done fantasy portrayal, but this isn't it. In the movie's defense, it does attempt to show a D/s relationship as a loving one with mutual consent & benefit (besides the monetary). But that doesn't begin to save the film. We are asked to believe that one day she is perfectly lucid & signing contracts & the next day she has no cognitive abilities except those of a dog. BTW, if you have a RL dog, you know that most of them have a whole lotta cognitive ability LOL. This is only one of it's many, many problems.<br /><br />As for it's attempt to touch on the abhorrent practice of the human slave trade, it touches on it briefly in a way that makes no sense in the context of the movie. I had such high hopes for this film & the trailer made it look so exciting. I wanted to love it. Instead, when I wasn't laughing, I was just stunned by how bad it was. Don't waste your time! And definitely don't waste your money!
