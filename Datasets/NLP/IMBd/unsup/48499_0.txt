Hey Babyy was a huge box office success and further established Akshay Kumar as a dependable actor(Namastey London, Bhagam Bhag, Bhool Bulainya were all massive hits). I only managed to catch this movie on TV a couple of months and it would be suffice to say I was very disappointed. I think most of the blame should fall on Sajid Khan, don't get me wrong I think he is hilarious in five minutes sketches but he can't make people laugh for three hours. The main problem is that Sajid Khan couldn't make up his mind whether he wanted to make Hey Babyy a comedy or a drama, which results in an uneasy mix of both. As a result of that the film fails on both counts, it doesn't make you laugh and it didn't me cry. Now onto the best aspect of Hey Babyy, the songs are tremendous, my favourites being Jaane bhi de and Mast Kalandar(which has a guest appearance by Shah Rukh Khan). Hey Babyy is an unfunny fare from an otherwise hilarious Sajid Khan.
