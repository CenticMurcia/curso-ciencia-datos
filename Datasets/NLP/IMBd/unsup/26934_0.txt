This movie shows us why Jet Li is the bonafide martial arts superstar. With the right people behind the movie's production, maybe I shouldn't be so surprised that I actually found this film to be slick, exhilirating, and VERY STYLISH (much like La Femme Nikita). I walked out from the theatre satisfied and entertained. Thanks to Luc Besson, the movie also gets Thierry Arbogast, who is a GREAT technician when it comes to creating the saturated atmosphere. This movie, essentially Jet Li with a touch of French vanilla flavour, turns out to be a surprising winner in my jaded film logbook.<br /><br />Sure the movie has plot holes and some unintentionally hilarious continuity problems that will leave some of us scratching heads. But in the end I didn't care; this movie is so stylish-looking and well-acted, sometimes I forgot I was watching a martial arts flick. Great fight scenes, especially at the end where Li's character uses cramped office space to his advantage (a very smart move). To my delightful surprise, Bridget Fonda gave a stellar effort, because she didn't put on lazy acting as if it's just another film project that pays her money - big kudos to her. Jet Li proved to everyone that with the right movie material, he can show that he is rarity among martial arts actors since Li can act pretty well, which helps the audience to sympathize with Li's character. Karyo's character is made too obviously evil from the beginning, but never mind that - he is so much fun to watch. It's great to see that Li and Fonda do show strong on-screen chemistry, because after all I never expected so much quality from any martial arts movies. All in all, not since "Fist of Legend" or "Once Upon a Time in China II" did I felt this good about watching Li in action. Very nice effort!!!
