<br /><br />Garbage.The word fits this film to a tee.Jaws was the cinematic masterpiece.Then you look at this film.I watched it often as a teenager.Same goes for all the Jaws movies.I see the trouble with all the sequels in this genre and hollyland.YOU CAN NEVER REPLICATE THE ORGINAL FEARS,SUCCESS,AWARDS.Jaws3 misses the boat for these reasons:No plot,no action,no directions.Jaws3 and Jaws4 are two films they should never have made period.I am of the firm opinion Jaws and Jaws2 are the only Jaws films every made.Hollyworld less is sometimes MORE.<br /><br />-33 out of 10.
