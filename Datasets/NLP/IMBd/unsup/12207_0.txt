This was one of most touching movie I have ever seen. I was so close to cry when I saw it. Sean Penn did an excellent performance - maybe his best performance ever? <br /><br />I got so touched when I watched this movie...A beautiful and a lovely movie. I rate this a 9 and not 10 because there was some little errors that could have been fixed..but it didn't bother me so much.<br /><br />~C
