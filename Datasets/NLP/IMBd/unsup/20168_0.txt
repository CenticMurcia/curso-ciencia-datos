"The Ultimate Gift" stars James Garner, Brian Dennehy, Drew Fuller, Ali Hillis, and Oscar nominee Abigail Breslin, who recently starred as Olive in "Little Miss Sunshine," which also was nominated this year for Best Picture at the Academy Awards.<br /><br />This is the fourth film from Fox Faith, a division of Twentieth Century Fox, created to provide audiences with quality inspirational features, something of a recently opened Hollywood niche, prompted by the overwhelming success of "The Passion of the Christ." An important thing to keep in mind, though, is that these Fox Faith films are thankfully not "preachy." Their content is more balanced, with solid story lines exploring each character's mental and spiritual health and wellbeing.<br /><br />The plots revolved around discoveries in people's lives we can easily relate to, leading us to reflect on what values we hold dear. These films straddle the line tastefully, without overdoing pivotal moments in the story. They do a fine job of avoiding the pitfalls that could make them sappy.<br /><br />This film deals with the universal quest for finding real happiness. In today's world, the pursuit of happiness for many is the chase for wealth, yet many rich people also find happiness alluding.<br /><br />Red Stevens (Garner) is a billionaire who dies suddenly in a crash. Disturbingly, all of his descendants seem to be only concerned with what they might inherit from him, and as the wishes in his will are carried out, the family members barely receive anything.<br /><br />Along comes his grandson Jason (Fuller), a spoiled trust fund baby who hopes to cash in on some inheritance. But Jason's grandfather had other ideas planned for him.<br /><br />Jason is brought into the board room where a lone box rests on the table. Inside the box is a DVD with a special message from his grandfather who has set up a series of 12 gifts for him, leading up to the ultimate gift.<br /><br />The gifts lead to a chain of events that will stretch Jason to his limits. Starting with digging holes for fence posts down on a large ranch in Texas, his journey takes him as far away as Ecuador, teaching him the value of work, real friends, family, true love, laughter, dreams, gratitude, giving, and the importance of using each day to its fullest.<br /><br />These are things that Red Stevens could not teach his grandson in life. But with his passing, he offers him a chance to inherit the wealthiest of treasures, a sense of what really matters most in life.<br /><br />Many surprises wait along the way in this tender story, with solid, heartfelt performances. It is touching to see this self-centered boy start to rearrange his priorities, and connect not only with other people, but himself.<br /><br />This film is a rewarding treat that everyone should see.
