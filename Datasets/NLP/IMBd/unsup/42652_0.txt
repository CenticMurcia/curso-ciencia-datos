Like most television these days, this show thrives on three things: Male bashing, naked women, no plot that takes some thinking to make. What happened to the days when shows like MacGyver and cartoons like Duck Tales were on television? What happened to normal shows like Highway To Heaven and Full House? Movies and TV in the last 10 years has only been able to make junk things. This sickness seems to pervade all facets of TV. Even advertisements have this problem. Desperate Housewives is a show that takes little thinking to make. It takes little thinking to follow. It takes little thinking to watch it. It's time to ditch these garbage shows and get something that we can call 'normal'. Because this show definitely belongs in the dustbin!!
