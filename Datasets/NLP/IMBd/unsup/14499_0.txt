In a history of making terrible, terrible, terrible shows Pop Cultured still stands out as maybe the absolute, #1, Very Worst show that the Comedy Network has ever produced and broadcast over the airwaves to an unsuspecting and soon-to-be-very-angry viewing public. Who's idea was this show and either why weren't they publicly flogged for this or if they were flogged for it why wasn't it more public? That is something they should be airing on the comedy network.<br /><br />Terrible acting, terrible writing, terrible production over all, terrible directing and this is even if they had writers and directors which I wouldn't be surprised if these terrible actors just showed up and made up their terrible jokes on the spot. The host was the worst host I've ever seen and every one of her monologues to start the show were unbelievably painful. Don't get me wrong I watched this show a lot, I hated it with a passion but I watched it a lot because it was like watching a car wreck I couldn't believe this show was being broadcast night after night, and the interviews weren't much better you could practically see in their eyes that every guest was thinking about standing up and walking out and shouting "what the flying hell is wrong with you!!" If it wasn't for other shows that came later like Girls Will Be Girls and Punched Up this show would be a slam dunk for worst Comedy Network show ever. I would say Girls Will Be Girls is the worst of all time, I can't even talk about that show without wanting to destroy something, Pop Cultured is second worst and then who knows, Punched Up, Keys to the VIP, Shakespeare Comedy, there are a lot of bad ones to choose from. Gutter Ball Alley was terrible and so is that new pointless one Hot Box.<br /><br />The Comedy Network needs to fire everyone who is responsible for these shows if they haven't already because the average person could make a better and funnier show in their basement taping it with their cell phone and I am not kidding.
