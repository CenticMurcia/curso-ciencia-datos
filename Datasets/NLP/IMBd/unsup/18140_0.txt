Saw this on WorldLink TV last night - gripping from the first frame. Wonderful journey into Turkish Sufi lives & the character of a simple devout person presented with difficult life choices. The story & character development is excellent. Interplay between the main character & his employer/benefactor and then with the other members of the sect is presented in a great way. I come from an Asian culture and could immediately connect to the protagonists struggle to solve a complex nature of problems and make them fit within his simplistic religious view. <br /><br />Cinematically brilliant, great acting, wonderful cinematagrophy Catch it if you can.
