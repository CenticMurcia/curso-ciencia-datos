Drew (Andrew) witnessed his parents' divorce when he was 11 and how it ruined his father's life. Now, Drew is in college and as a handsome young man has become a serial seducer. He easily meets and sleeps with women only to dump them. Drew doesn't do relationships; he doesn't even do second dates. <br /><br />Joe, Drew's roommate, willingly puts up with being denied access to his room every time there is a `sock on the doorknob' and the two boys are actually good friends even though Joe is the polar opposite of Drew. Not terribly attractive and a bit of a nebbish around women, Joe has been attracted to Shayna, a girl in his Chem. class for weeks but has not worked up the courage to ask her out. <br /><br />When Joe confesses his infatuation to Drew just before Thanksgiving break, Drew advises him to `just go for it' and Joe resolves to follow that advice and ask Shayna out as soon as he returns. Unfortunately while Joe is away, Drew and Shayna meet up in a bar and the inevitable happens. In the morning Drew treats her as he has so many others, only to realize too late, that his feelings for her are different.<br /><br /> I was pleasantly surprised to see that this film had this much depth. What I expected to be another hormone driven teen movie actually turned out to have a well crafted story-line and some insight into how the characters might feel. I'd recommend this film and look forward to seeing more by this film-maker.
