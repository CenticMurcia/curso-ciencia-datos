This movie HAD to have been a remake of the original film. When I saw the remake I was nauseated and upset because the later ending was completely changed.<br /><br />I would like to hear from others who remembered the original ending. Here's where the spoiler comes in........the original ending<br /><br />Kerr's memory gradually starts coming back, all the while Adrieanne and Kerr gradually fall in love. He reveals that he is from the future and that he and his brother had built separate time machines and agreed to meet in the past. However, Kerr's machine developed a problem and he wound up on a beach in Greece in the 1980's. <br /><br />They wanted to get married and sailed to a main Greek island to make plans for the wedding at the Greek Catholic Orthidox Church. After entering the church, Kerr stops at the alter, looks up, drops his jaw in wonderment then says, "That's my Brother".....looking up Jesus on the cross!<br /><br />I WAS SHOCKED......the first thing I thought, "What IF?" Then I also thought, "No way is this gonna fly with the Catholic Church"<br /><br />Please tell me if someone out there remembers this......my wife does!
