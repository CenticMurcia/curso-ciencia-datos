I got this thinking that probably several of those who appreciated this film might be right about it - I was so disappointed!<br /><br />Cinematography - utterly static.<br /><br />Direction - flat. <br /><br />Dialogue - well, it's realistic, but that doesn't make good dialog; in fact, it's dull.<br /><br />Characters - not one we really care about: odd balls but not interesting weirdos, besides they're all depressed! & have every right to be, nothing worse than neurotics without sensesayuma. Would anyone like Woody Allen if he wasn't funny sometimes?<br /><br />Symbolism - clumsy - snow, veils, things "in-between" - hackneyed & boring!<br /><br />Usually I'll watch any movie through if I've made it past 30 mins, but not this one. I tried, but I kept falling asleep. I think I got mental frostbite from the snow. <br /><br />Resnais has made some great films, but if you want to remember him fondly, skip this swan song.
