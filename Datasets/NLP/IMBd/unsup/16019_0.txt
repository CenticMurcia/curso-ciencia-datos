After Hours, originally a Columbia thesis script by Joseph Minion tells the story of Paul Hackett's crazy adventure in Soho.<br /><br />A friend described After Hours as a movie he always saw the cover for at the video store back in the day, and always thought it was a silly 80s comedy. It wasn't till years later he realized it was a Scorsese movie.<br /><br />The movie came in the WB Box Set released with Goodfellas, Mean Streets, and a few other of the filmmakers lesser known, earlier films. I was happy when I finally popped After Hours into the DVD player, it is a darkly funny, well written downtown New York Adventure.<br /><br />Hackett meets Marcy in a caf√©, who passes her number off to him. Clearly a bored word processor seeking adventure, Hackett calls Marcy, who invites him over, he peers at his watch, 11:30pm, and his night has just begun. So begin's his crazy adventure, meeting peculiar character after peculiar character. The theme of the movie is that the whole world is different after midnight, from the people who inhabit it, to the rules which govern it.<br /><br />Hackett has lost his money, and is so far from his home uptown, that he is virtually stuck in Soho. It's a fun movie, and worth seeing, if just for what Scorsese was up to between Raging Bull and The Last Temptation of Christ.
