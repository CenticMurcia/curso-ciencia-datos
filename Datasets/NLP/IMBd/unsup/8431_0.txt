This movie is supposed to be about four military men trying to find life in a country wiped out by a nuclear war.<br /><br />This could have been good, despite the bad science involved. It isn't the worst science, but it is hard to swallow that suddenly the radiation level falls for these certain characters when it needs to.<br /><br />That would be okay if the characters were half way likable. They aren't At least the two leads, who are both sort of super extremist spoiled brat supermen. And you know the two more likable characters won't be around long. After they're gone, you don't really care. This was made in the dorky day of the Steve McQueens, when each hero had to have a vehicle fetish that only the reddest necks can identify with. The other character is more realistic, but still too military. It isn't hard to care about them. It is impossible to care about them. Sort of like "Enemy Mine" made years earlier. And this is the real reason the film fails.
