This movie is SO unbelievably poor! I have lost faith in the Human Race if this film gets a rating of over 5! I wont put any spoilers... but to be honest it would make no difference: We have the token villain who cares about treasure more than anything. His trigger-happy stooge. The Stereotypical hero, who didn't have a clue about whats going on... his love interest who is there for no other reason, and of course who could forget the Law enforcement official who believes nothing told him... a la every other creature Feature... ever.<br /><br />The "Plot" follows the group searching for an ancient Indian burial ground... But it is protected... dun dun dun.<br /><br />Awful Dialogue, Acting, Inept structure and Poor effects... as well as an ending that is so pointless and tacked on that it made the previous 90 minutes seem ever more pointless. Avoid at all costs... in fact burn any copies found... on no accounts waste one and a half hours of your life on this thing!<br /><br />0 out of 10!
