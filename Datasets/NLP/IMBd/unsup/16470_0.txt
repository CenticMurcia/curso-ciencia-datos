Loved it when I first saw it. I recently (about a month or so ago) got it on DVD. Now I just have to get The Monster Squad on DVD. LOL. This movie is one of my favorites from the 80's. Why? Well for one thing the story and plot were really well done. I remember that every time it came on cable I had to watch it. It doesn't matter how many times I've watched it. It brings back what the 80's movies were all about. There isn't many movies of today that can compare to (a lot of) the 80's movies that were made in that time. I wish a lot of 80's movies were available on DVD. Sadly they aren't so I have to watch them on VHS. A few of them are kinda worn out. Explorers will always be a favorite of mine. Kids today should watch this movie. The special effects aren't overplayed and they fit with the movie just enough for the story. I don't care what anybody says this movie sparks the imaginations in kids and let's them believe that anything is possible when it comes to dreams!
