Maybe I was a little impatient with this film. I watched it one sunday afternoon when I was bored out of my skull and there was nothing on television. I am a big Fan of Nicholas Cage and havent really seen a bad Ridley Scott movie but I actually ended up switching this off half way through. Perhaps had I stuck it out Id have got my reward but in the first half this just didnt have anything to excite me, make me think or particularly want to see how it ended up. It just didnt seem to be going anywhere.On the plus side Cage was good if nothing spectacular and his character was brought some humourous moments. The female lead (her name I forgot just now) was refreshing and radiant and definately one to look out for. Though I dont always agree, Robert Mckee claims all films needs something to keep the audience hooked, alas, if this had one I must have missed it or it was too late in coming.
