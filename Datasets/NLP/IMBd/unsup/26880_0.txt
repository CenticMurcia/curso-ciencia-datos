Sadly, I was subjected to this film not too long ago. It was truly a wretched example of film making, and better serves as a cautionary tale to young film-makers everywhere. The acting was very poor, leading one to believe that perhaps the creator's friends were used in production, rather than Ms. Simmon's third grade class, but the difference is negligible.<br /><br />It's very easy to see that this "film" is a poor attempt at creating a cult classic, utterly failing at creating a cohesive storyline, failing again at actually entertaining viewers, and really, cannot be considered to be much more than simple at best; It attempts to weave a lacking storyline, an attempt to look as a "B movie" would look, and a lot of popular music from the punk genre; simple anthems, in an obvious attempt to create a movie that would possibly catch on and elevate this film maker to some sort of status of which nothing but a miserable failure has occurred.<br /><br />In any case, please do yourself a favor, and avoid this blunder. Otherwise, you're in for a treat of nothing more than a couple of poor actors with disproportionate pimples on their heads, as the cover dictates, music from a punk sampler, and poor-quality production values; which seem an attempt at irony; but is exactly what it is- poor values. Skip it, do not think of it a second time, and do not watch unless you have a motion sickness tablet handy.
