i saw this wonderful movie yesterday ,and i highly recommend it.I sat through the entire movie with a smile,what a fantastic member of the human race,Robert Crumb is.The Crumb family gives a whole new meaning to the word Dysfunctional,and it made my family look really sane:)love it. Go on see it and if you don't like it,see a doctor.
