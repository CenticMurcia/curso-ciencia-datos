I was lucky enough to see this film at the Savannah Film Festival on Halloween and hopefully it will be lucky enough to get show in theaters. The film is the result of the TV show Project Green Light, but don't let that thwart you. I went in with the skepticism that I give all the horror movies these days and was pleased that it did not involve an evil child that glitches around the screen. This movie tears down the clich√©s of its predecessors and is provides non stop excitement from beginning to end. A great mix of horror, action, and comedy. The diverse cast is as good as the ways they are off'd. Well, reality TV has finally done something for me, now it can go away.
