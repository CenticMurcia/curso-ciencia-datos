I tried... I really did. But after 20 minutes, I couldn't stand the torture any longer. I would rather pluck out my eyes with a wooden spoon than watch any more of this horrid, waste of time movie. The makers of this film should consider themselves lucky, as I doubt that too many others would last even that long. From the very first scene, less than 10 seconds into the movie, you know that you're in for a wild time of melodrama, overacting, bad script, and really bad set design/location and costume.<br /><br />One of the cabins featured prominently in the start looks like something you might see as the backdrop in a J. Crew catalogue. Beautiful stone tiles and kitchen counter tops. Not exactly what one would expect from a film that supposed to be set in 1874 (or thereabouts). Most of the costumes looks like they just came out of the clear plastic bag from Walmart.<br /><br />At least I know now that Blockbuster isn't playing favorites - they rent good and absolutely horrible movies alike.
