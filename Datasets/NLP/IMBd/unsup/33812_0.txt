Yet another one in the long series of godawful, ridiculous and utterly predictable horror/thrillers made in Spain in the late 90s/early 00s. And this is one of the very worst ones: not only it consistently sucks, but it doesn't have one single original moment. It starts like "Fight Club" (Tristán Ulloa even dresses like Brad Pitt/Tyler Durden!), continues like "I Know What You Did Last Summer" and ends like "Se7en", with halfway stops in "Lost Highway" and "Body Double". Characters are clichés of the worst kind, specially the vomitive mama's boy and the cowardly fat girl. And you see the "big plot twist" coming before the movie reaches its mid-running time.<br /><br />Absolutely nothing worth watching here. It doesn't even have eye candy to save it, as, even if there are two absolutely gorgeous girls (Pilar Punzano and Marián Aguilera), you hardly see anything of them (except for a breast in close-up, which means it could be a body double).<br /><br />I long for the day when Spain stops making half-baked ripoffs of American hits and starts attempting honest genre movies. Things like this bomb really hurt the industry.<br /><br />1/10. Save your time and money.
