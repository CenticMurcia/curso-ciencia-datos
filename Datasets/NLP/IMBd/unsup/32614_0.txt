A spoof on reality shows with the premise that the clips are 'reality shows that were too hot for TV'. The skits suffer from what I like to call SNL-ites (even when they are not funny to start with, they STILL go on way to long). I didn't laugh once. National Lampoon is WAY past it's heyday and should be disbanded. It's time is over and passed. This piece of excrement actually spawned a sequel if you believe it. THAT'S one I can't wait to avoid. I guess it's nice to know that Rip Torn is still managing to get work though. I NEVER thought I'd say this in my life, but if this is your cup of tea, then go watch Underground Comedy Movie instead. Now pardon me while I wash the filth from my body.<br /><br />My Grade: F<br /><br />Eye Candy: a few boobs, some ass, and one or two vertical smiles
