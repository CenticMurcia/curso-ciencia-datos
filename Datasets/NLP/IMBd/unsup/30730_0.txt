Oh, I remember it well. The hemlines had shot up from the ankles to the thighs in a few short years. The girls were sexy but aloof, but in love with their male teachers. The boys hormones were raging more than ever and we were wondering if we would get laid before we died in VietNam, and we were hoping that that oh so sexy teacher would be willing to give us some "extracurricular instruction". Charles Manson had been convicted of the Tate-Bianca murders. The atmosphere was so sexually charged you could cut it with a knife. <br /><br />This movie almost perfectly captured this mood--As good a documentary as you can get in a fiction film and some of the most gorgeous soon to be "B" movie queens were showing us their bodies (including Angie Dickinson--at age 40!)<br /><br />
