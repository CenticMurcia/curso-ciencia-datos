I really liked this version of Show Boat. Some people negatively compare Ava Gardner with Helen Morgan, who played Julie in the 1936 film version as well as on Broadway, but I think Miss Gardner was fantastic. Her scene in the dressing room when she realizes Magnolia is on stage singing "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man" was truly heartbreaking, especially when she starts drinking. Her "Bill" was also really quite moving (although dubbed by Annette Warren,) especially when she acknowledges that her ring finger no longer has a wedding ring on it. The 1936 version of the film is a real gem and should not be missed for Show Boat fans, but this version should not be dismissed either!
