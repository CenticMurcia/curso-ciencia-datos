Bad Sreenplay, yes, which is a reality of this movie. Average Music, shoddy narration, and direction that just about suffices the need for the film to progress. But Madhuri Dixit, the lead actress, is outstanding. She in every sense has given the best performance of the year as Dia. She is not even for a moment out of character and manages to catch and deliver all the crafty nuances of the character with truckloads of grace and beauty. This is true method acting. All the other actors were good too, especially Konkana SenSharma and Ranvir Shorey. But Madhuri carries this film completely. Very few actresses in Indian cinema have this much of screen presence that not even once you miss a lead actor in the movie, that is the old story behind a time-tested formula. Watch this movie entirely for Madhuri Dixit. The choreography was average and comes as a rude shock. Overall the movie does fail Madhuri, and the Chopras can be hanged for it. But the magic is still on. Madhuri Dixit is spectacular in the movie. Believe me for I have seen some top-class acting in the world, Madhuri as Dia deserves the Silver Lotus Award.
