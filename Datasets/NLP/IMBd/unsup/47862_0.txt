Sorry, I didn't go for this one.<br /><br />For starters, it was wa-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-y too slow. The pace was so glacial it was hard to care what was happening.<br /><br />The rats were your basic gang of thugs. They were basically modeled after every 1930's gangster flick you could name. The party at the end looked like it was lifted from a Hollywood ball.<br /><br />The plot was either hackneyed or non-existent. Attempts at cuteness and emotions were so forced it was pathetic. And allowing the mouse and child 'toy' to suddenly function whenever a dramatic moment (hah) occurred just killed it.<br /><br />A kids movie NOT from Disney. The producers had a chance to make an impact. But they blew it.<br /><br />For insomniacs only.
