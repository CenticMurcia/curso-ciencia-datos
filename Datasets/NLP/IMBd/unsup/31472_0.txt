Written and Directed by: Ashutosh Gowariker. Starring: Hrithik Roshan, Aishwarya Rai. Music: AR Rahman. <br /><br />A young boy named Jalaluddin stands on a war front In 1555AD India to be crowned as the new Moghul Emperor after the death of his Father Humayun. The ministry wages the war and defeats the rival King. They bring him in front of the new emperor and ask him to behead the defeated King. Only to find that the young emperor recognizes that disgrace is worse than a death and denies following the orders. This young boy grows up to become Jalaluddin Muhammad (Hrithik Roshan) Akbar (as honored by his country eventually). He marries a Hindu Rajput's daughter Jodhaa Bai (Aishwarya Rai). How? You will find it out. <br /><br />Jodhaa-Akbar is a story of love between a husband and a wife after they get married. Given some exposure to Akbar's learning curve to understand the common man in his country with the help of his wife's thoughts and philosophy this movies tries to connect the dots between a husband and his wife and an Emperor and his people. The first winner of this movie is writer-director Ashutosh Gowariker. Making a comeback after a highly spiritual Swades (2004) Ashtosh may not have as appealing story as Swades but the love in Jodhaa Akbar cannot be denied. He brings in different shades of connections between the two like the first time Hindu vegetarian meal for Akbar, a sword fight or a confession of love in a room lit by setting sun. Gowariker handles these facets very carefully by taking his time to create an atmosphere. He is one of the young directors with his own vision that he follows. <br /><br />The next one on my list is Hrithik Roshan. With a muscular physique and eyes full of emotions his portrayal as an Emperor with roots of humanity is something to look for. An emperor slowly learning about the people around him and eventually following his heart and philosophies is a very good character to be seen. His fight with his ownself to understand Jodhaa is convincing. Not to forget Aishwarya Rai as Jodhaa bai. Personally I haven't been able to appreciate her beauty in a long time since maybe Aur Pyar Ho Gaya (1997). <br /><br />I have saved the best for last and that is Mr AR Rahman. His background score and musicals like 'Jashn-e-bahaar' and 'In lamho ke' are appreciable. But 'Khwaja' is something beyond great or extraordinary. The prayer and appeal by sufi singers to the priest are nothing short of 'magical'. You will be drawn into the prayer just like the emperor when he gets up and shows his excitement to God. Wow!!!<br /><br />Independent movies are said to be daring and courageous. Jodhaa Akbar may not be an Independent creation but it is a period movie with a magnitude that perhaps was last seen in K. Asif's Mughal-E-Azam released in 1960. It took 48 years for Bollywood to make a movie like this so in that sense it is a daring and courageous effort. <br /><br />My Rating: 9/10.
