I would like to say i have seen Many film's , maybe about 2,000 so you could say i am a bit of an expert in my own household ! So if you only take one peice of advice from let it be this...Don't waste 90 minutes of your life and watch this film, it is the worst piece of codswallop i have ever had the misfortune to see , it makes the police academy films look like masterpieces of our time. Just DONT BOTHER,.
