I've seen low-budget horror movies before and they provide that so bad it's funny feel to them and this was no exception. However this was the worst yet! I swear the actors must've been reading off of cue cards because they put absolutely no emotion into it whatsoever, it was like they were all monotones. To get a scary effect in the background a scene would consist of a tree shaking and unfortunately they did this multiple times. I was just so bored with it I wanted to cry. I did laugh at a lot of the death scenes though since they were done so poorly. Oh and the ending is hysterical since there's no reason or justification for it whatsoever. When one kid gets shot at his head just pops, I think they used a balloon as a prop...no kidding! The guns were like Revolutionary War muskets and I got a kick out of that as well. The dialog was retarded and whoever wrote a script this bad should be shunned from the film industry for the rest of their natural born-lives!!! Only watch if you want a good chuckle and for an ending that you won't find anywhere else.<br /><br />Final Cry:<br /><br />Movies: If this made it into theaters I was the first President of the U.S.<br /><br />DVD Purchase: That'd be a no!<br /><br />Rental: Only in extreme situations!
