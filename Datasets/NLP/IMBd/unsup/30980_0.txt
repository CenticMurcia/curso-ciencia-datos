This is a deeply moving film with an excellent lead performance by Damien Lewis as the mentally disturbed and grief stricken Keane who wanders around the city searching for his missing daughter. From the start it is clear that his daughter went missing sometime ago and the film gathers a feeling of a man who was once sane being tortured by the abduction of his young daughter whilst in his care. The film follows his journey over several days to what appears to be the peak of his grief and pain to possibly the point at which his can begin to get his life back...<br /><br />I was lucky enough to see this film at the London Film Festival where Lodge Kerrigan and Damien Lewis where present and did a question and answer session after the film ended. The mental disorder issue and the issue of the truth of William Keane's lost daughter were eluded too. Lewis said he believed that the daughter did exist as it gives purpose and integrity to the character allowing a greater feeling for his situation. As writer and director Kerrigan made some comments about the film and why he wrote it saying that there is a lot of miss-understanding of mental disorders especially in the states and not enough sympathy or as much as there could be.<br /><br />The film feels very real and this is due to the live sets that are used and the whole film being shot with a hand-held camera and all but a couple of scenes using natural lighting. It is real and it touches you, as the credits began to role the cinema remained very quiet as I believe that the vast majority of the audience required sometime to take in what they had just seen. I challenge you to watch this film and feel nothing whether it be for the character of Keane or for the everyman on the street.
