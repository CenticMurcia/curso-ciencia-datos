Oh my God!<br /><br />I've seen a lot of so-so movies with John Goodman in it, but this one is definitely the worse. Thanks god, this wonderful actor later had good opportunities to show us his talent.<br /><br />Such a waste of good actors (Peter O'Toole! John Hurt! Richard Griffiths! Oh no!!) is a shame. The direction is cheap, the script is cheap, the humour is cheap, everything is cheap, this movie is plain cheesy and its "humour" is on par with any Benny Hill show. No, really, heeeewwwww!!! David Ward is a honest writer sometimes, but as a director... NO!<br /><br />If you have a brain, avoid this movie. If Benny Hill makes you burst out laughing, then go rent it. Personally, I do have a brain, so it was quite a disgusting experience.
