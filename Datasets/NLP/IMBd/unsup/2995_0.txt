This has got to be the most terrible film ever committed to celluloid, and I watch Mystery Science Theater 3000. I just couldn't see the point in any of it as it appears to be a series of unconnected scenes badly put together. Girl gets sent to reform school, but she's innocent, there we find the usual prison stereotypes, rough girl, quiet girl etc. She then finds she has a gift for running. So what?? Its a pitiful film in which you can honestly, and I mean honestly, spot what's coming. Leery guidance counselor?? Check. Unnecessary lesbian scene?? Check. Worst Ending EVER?? Check. I won't spoil it but its awful and completely negates the rest of the film. I spent three days telling everyone I saw just how bad it was, I now have no friends thanks to this film. The very worst part comes right at the end when, over the credits, it reads out what happens to the sad reprobates with each one, without fail, going on to something far better. And what the hell was Matt LeBlanc doing in this movie?????
