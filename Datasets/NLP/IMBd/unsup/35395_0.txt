I wasn't really impressed by this movie; it's pretty much your standard teenage film. The plot revolves around a girl from New York City who moves to somewhere in Jersey and then attempts a new school. She is fan of a band who breaks up and they give a final concert with an after party. <br /><br />Now without many spoilers I will summon up the plot for you real quick. Desperate to go to the concert she and her friend try all the teenage clich√©s and so many things we have seen before to get in. She finally meets her idol, the singer of the band and comments him on his alcohol addiction. We can all predict the outcome of the film from a mile away. There is also a subplot with a High School play. Where is trying to get the lead part.<br /><br />The acting isn't impressive but I have seen worse. Lindsey Lohan played better in Freaky Friday and Mean Girls. Which were also better movies by the way.<br /><br />In the end this is just another Disney high school movie, where popularity stands central and predictability is inevitable. Some people might enjoy this, but for the majority of the moviegoers this is a major let down. Grade 4/10
