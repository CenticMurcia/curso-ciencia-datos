Hey, I'm really into Sci-Fi movies. I love any movies that have to do with Science Fiction, and are based in the future with unique settings.<br /><br />Well I'd like to say that I've seen Moon 44 and consider it a great movie. I'd give this movie overall a 8/10. The reason for this is because of the cinematography. You cannot have a Sci-Fi movie without cinematography.<br /><br />I consider the cinematography above average in Moon 44 because the director, even though on a short budget was able to create some neat scenery, of futuristic earth, space ships, fighter planes, the base itself and etc. This really caught my eye and made me feel like I was in the movie, like I was Felix Stone (Michael Pare).<br /><br />Now, I though this may sound crazy, but I have to be able to get into a movie to enjoy it, like I enjoyed Blade Runner because of the cinematography. I felt like I was in the movie, in Neo Angeles 2019 AD and as the main character. Same thing went for Star Wars and so on.......<br /><br />Even though Moon 44 was done in a foreign country and on a tight budget, I consider Moon 44 to be one of my Sci-Fi favorite flicks. The script could have used improvements, but overall it was a great movie. See it for yourself and tell me what you think. I'm sure you'd enjoy it as well.<br /><br />-Romeo
