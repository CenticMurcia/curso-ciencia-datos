What could have been a great film was let down entirely by an appalling script that makes Shortland Street look Oscar worthy.<br /><br />With a damn awful soundtrack (did they run out of money?), melodramatic silent screen era responses to unrealistic dialogue and a cast that looks the part but cant act to save themselves.....i struggled to make it to the end.<br /><br />The saving grace of the film was the stunning NZ scenery and realistic visual atmosphere.<br /><br />Unfortunately it just wasn't enough to save this incredibly disjointed film.
