Just saw this film a couple of hours ago and thought I'd write a review while it was still fresh in my Mind.<br /><br />In summary I really enjoyed this film, wasn't a classic but was a good evening out. (7/10)<br /><br />Plot - Not very original. As other people have commented, this film has a Porridge feel about it. Certainly not as funny though.<br /><br />Acting - On the whole pretty good. Having seen him in a few things now, I would not call James Nesbitt a charactor actor. However his cheeky charms were right for this role, Olivia Williams was average but passable, nice to see her in an British flick after her roles in 'Rushmore' and 'The 6th Sense'. For me Timothy Spall out-classed the rest, my first thought was that I would have liked to have seen more of him but on reflection I actually prefer him as a side kick.<br /><br />Tone - I would not class this film as a straight comedy, it certainly had its tragic moments. I think this film will suffer from being compared to "The Full Monty".<br /><br />7/10
