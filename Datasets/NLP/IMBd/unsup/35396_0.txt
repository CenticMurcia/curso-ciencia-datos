I have seen what hell is like, and it's watching this movie. Lindsay Lohan plays Mary. (She calls herself Lola.) Mary is an extreme drama queen. So she is crushed when her Mom moves her from New York City to a suburb. She spends the entire movie trying to compete with mean girl, Carla. First, Mary tries out for the school play and then she tries to get into the final concert of everyone's favorite band, Sidarthur. In the end, Mary gets everything she wants because she is the so-called "protagonist" of the movie. Lohan plays this part amazingly well, mostly because Lohan is a drama-driven slut in real life. That's just my opinion, but I know that a lot of people agree with me. Mary is just about as horrible a role model for young girls as there is. Just as bad as a lot of mean girl antagonists like Carla or Sharpay from High School Musical, if not worse, a lot worse. This is a very bad movie to show your daughters because it gives them horrible impressions about appropriate behavior for girls and it teaches them completely horrendous values about life and getting what you want. Overall, this is the worst family film I have seen in my life.
