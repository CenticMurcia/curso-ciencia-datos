First off, I recorded this because the title and info given on the cable guide made this movie sound interesting--if not for a few laughs. I've never heard of this movie so I put it on in the background as I did some stationary chores. 20 minutes later, I deleted the stupid thing. This movie is horrible. The main character seemed like a washed out, more annoying Chris Tucker. At least Chris Tucker has some character. I'm Chinese, and I find some jokes about Chinese culture funny. The jokes in this movie were so bad it was offensive. I don't hate much in life, but I hate this movie and am somewhat shamed that I had recorded it.
