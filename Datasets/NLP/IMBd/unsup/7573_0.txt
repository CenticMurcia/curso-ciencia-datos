If you're looking for steamy soft core, this isn't it. It's an actual attempt at comedy, not something Seduction Cinema does well. I've seen several of their movies and this one is the worst so far. As a certified male pig, I was looking for a lot of nudity and as much of that as possible....what I got was a bad comedy and some television-style T&A. Avoid this one, and if you're a big Misty Mundae fan see SpiderBabe or Lust for Dracula instead. I give it a 2 only because Misty Mundae was her ever-amusing self in it.<br /><br />The comedy isn't mind-bogglingly awful, it's just bad. You will even chuckle at a few places, but overall you'll wish you saw something else. Think you're going to see a lot of g-strings? Think again.
