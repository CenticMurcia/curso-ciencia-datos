First of all, Petek Dinçöz is not actress. She is not singer neither. So, why she plays in this movie? Actually the answer is money. If Dinçöz play in this movie and introduce parts of her body to us and for "art",our wise people will not watch the movie. Yes, they are watching Dinçöz, directors and producers are happy, we, poor cine-maniacs, are sad and mostly angry...<br /><br />Anyway, lets look bright side, nope, there is not bright side, actually, there is no side neither only bad side, no bad is not right word this film is sucks...<br /><br />One more think Plese Mr. Erbil, don't act, please
