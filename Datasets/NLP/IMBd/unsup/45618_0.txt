What is "Violent Cop"?<br /><br />A: A boring, ridiculous B-movie (bang-bang, you're dead) masquerading as "art"?<br /><br />B: A pathetic attempt to jolt the viewer out of his lethargy by repeated shots of graphic violence (mostly heads splattered)?<br /><br />C: A test by Kitano to see how long he can keep his camera still on his expressionless face, without giving us any insight into his character (apart from the fact that he's a cop, and he's violent)?<br /><br />D: All of the above?<br /><br />The choice is yours. But one thing is for sure: by the time (SPOILER WARNING) Kitano gets hit by the 15th bullet or something and still doesn't fall down, it was clear that my second experiment with his films (after the equally awful "Brother") will probably be the last.<br /><br />For a couple of good scenes (the foot chase and the confrontation on the roof of a building), I give "Violent Cop" *1/2 out of 4.
