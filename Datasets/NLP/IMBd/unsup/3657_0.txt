"Matando Cabos" is the title of Alejandro Lozano's debut film, that even when it shares some similitude with American Films, such as "Pulp Fiction" and "Taxi Driver", it stands as a great movie, bringing a refreshing breathe to Mexican commercial cinema.<br /><br />The major attractive of the film lies in its screenplay. The story is about two best friends, Jaque and Mudo, that are involved on a critical situation when they accidentally kidnap their boss, the sadistic and rich Oscar Cabos, and they hide him on Jaque's car. Meanwhile, a kidnapper's band, directed by the son of Cabos' ex-best friend, plan to take him to ask for money. But they take the wrong person and that's how a series of funny events, plagued with a black humor-screenplay, are shown by a bunch of hilarity characters that add a special charm in the movie.<br /><br />Of course, this film is far from been compared to "Amores Perros", "Y tu Mamá También" or "El Crimen del Padre Amaro", which were deeper and focused on complex and even controversial issues. On the other hand, in "Matando Cabos" we have a well written and light story from the beginning to the end.<br /><br />Finally, it's very remarkable the use of f/x for the car-chase scene filmed in the Estadio Azteca, supervised by people in charge of effects for "Matrix", that is the most expensive scene ever done in Mexican Cinema's history and by the way, the best Mexican action film. That's the reason why the film was released on summer, because it's able to compete against the mega-budgeted productions.<br /><br />One of the best movies of the Mexican commercial films that vindicates national cinema with its fresh air and leaves the door open for future indie and risky films that are changing the face of Mexican movies. Great film, excellent casting, very funny and catchy. Don't miss it.<br /><br />9 out of 10
