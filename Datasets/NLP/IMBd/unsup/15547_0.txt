Although the story line may have been lame at first. I thought it definitely had potential. Justin the guy playing Aquaman would have been great if would have been allowed to develop his character more. He had the look and was Gorgeous. They should bring it back. We are living in a day when the world is in love with super hero's. And one saving the marine world, activist all around the world couldn't argue the fact that this show could send out a positive message. With a great cast Ving Rahmes and Lou Diamomd Philips the CW should have never turned it down. Regaurdless of cost. Take Smallville for instance, I'm an avid Smallville watcher and in the begging the show had weak story's and bad acting. Now in there going into there 6th season and has done a 360 in great story lines and improved acting. They should have fought harder for Aqua MAn
