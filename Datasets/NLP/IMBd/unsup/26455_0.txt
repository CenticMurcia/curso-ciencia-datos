absolutely amazing film. absolutely the best anti-china movie Americans ever made("anti-china" just means that kind of movie shows china's bad side, doesn't mean anything negative.) the reason make me like this movie, is how deep the film makers know about china, unlike other anti-china movies, this one is extremely really, like the all the uniform designs, and those details make the movie "believelbe". but thats not the best part, the beauty of the film is how much does the writer understand whats the problem of china, those problems in the justice system, the problem of the control the powerful man in military. i cant believe the writer is from another country, because the those problem of china is so complicated that to hard to be understood by the most of western citizens. one thing i have to say about the last commenter, he suggest that go ask those fa lungong people to know how Chinese government trade human rights, come on, thats just as stupid as go ask the terrorists how do they think about USA. anyway, not like I'm saying that human rights in china is cool, just, that unnecessary exaggerate will just make it like a shity film, like "spy game", which by the way has nothing compare to the red corner.
