A lot of people who have seen this film will wonder why 10 out of 10.<br /><br />However, having watched this film almost 12 times I never tire of it. Ridiculous quotes and incredibly bad acting from all involved make it so much fun. And this is what movies are about right? Simple setup - Roger Moore and Michael Caine's ex-partner conman characters are almost identical to two partnered scientists - HOW CONVENIENT! And so they set up a plan to steal the scientists secret diamond stash all the time bumbling through some goofy moments in order to set up the crime.<br /><br />Written by the creative team behind the dire TV sitcom "Birds Of A Feather" I was surprised the film has some quick witty one-liners. It also has some cringe inducing scenes including what I believe is Roger Moore trying it on with his own daughter. Michael Caine is the first to point out some of the terrible films he's made so you can't really have a go but his accents are hideous.<br /><br />All in all I recommend this film to anyone who just wants a laugh even if it is at the expense of two fine actors.<br /><br />"Has anyone ever said you look like Mel Gibson?" Baddie shakes head. "I'm not surprised."
