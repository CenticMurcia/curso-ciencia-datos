A great Episode of South Park once again, Mr/Mrs Garrison decides that she is a lesbian, going from a straight man, to a homosexual man, to a straight woman, Garrison has got to the sexual preference of lesbian.<br /><br />The episode is a spoof of the film 300. cartman gets his friends to get their homework done by some Mexican immigrants which goes wrong.<br /><br />Once Garrison becomes a lesbian she goes to the "girl Bar" with her "friend" she met at the gym. They join with all the other girls to try and save there bar from being bought out<br /><br />Quite disturbing ending.<br /><br />My favourite quote "scissor me timbers".<br /><br />10/10
