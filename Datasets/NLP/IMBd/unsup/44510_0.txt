An odd movie that I am reviewing from my notes from my original screening of the movie long ago. Perhaps I just didn't get it, but my plot summary is as follows (Quoting from old notes): "An extra-terrestrial(ET) force is present in an unsuspecting mother.<br /><br />The force manifests itself in her 8-year old child, giving the child super human powers. This makes the mother is the object of attention of both the ET aliens and some earthlings who know of this strange phenomenon." It doesn't quite sound like the plot summary, given here at the IMDB - which will attest at least to the incoherent nature of the film. The movie is confusing, but reasonably fast paced. I rated the movie a "1 of 10".
