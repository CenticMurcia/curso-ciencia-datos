I had the chance to see the North American Premiere of Alien Evolution and I was quite impressed by it. As a fan of this franchise and thinking that I knew everything about it, I have learned many things while watching it. It's a lovely documentary to see because it talks a lot about what the actors, directors, producers of each films think about all four movies. It's a must-see for every movie-goers especially for the first thirty minutes, I would say, because everyone who was involved in the 1979 classic "Alien" give their point of view (and H.R. Giger as well) on the creature and the sets where the story took place. It is great! Also, there is some actors from the first three movies who appear to say their impression about all kinds of things. Ridley Scott, H.R. Giger and Sigourney Weaver had many good things to tell us about.<br /><br />My only disappointment, I think, would be that Alien Resurrection was a little bit ignored in this 1 hour and a half long documentary. The only persons interviewed who were in this 4th installment were the director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, and of course Sigourney Weaver. It made me a little bit sad because Alien Resurrection is my favorite of them all but Alien Evolution was so well done and what the people had to say was so interesting that I still give it a perfect 10 on 10 because it was excellent!<br /><br />*I wish we could put 11...
