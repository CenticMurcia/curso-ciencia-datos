On the whole it was a very well done production. I can't wait for it to be available on DVD so I can enjoy it without all the commercials.<br /><br />I was familiar with some of the legends but not all of them. It was good to hear them and see them come "to life". I was overjoyed to see so many Native Americans and Native Canadians (isn't Canada part of North America?) portray the cast in an honest and proud way.
