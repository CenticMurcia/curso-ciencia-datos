Here I begin my attempt to once and for all write my IMDb comment for each and every episode of probably my favourite TV show of all-time. I had already submitted some (Seasons 9, 10 and 11 are done) but from now on I will write in order (with the exception of course of the up-coming 7 episodes of Season 13 that thankfully begin airing next Wednesday). So here I am after seeing again after some years the very first South Park episode...<br /><br />Right now we all know the extremely bizarre biography of one of the characters, of one of the residents of the town of South Park, Colorado, of Mr. Garrison. In this first episode, Cartman Gets an Anal Probe (the title itself certainly indicates that something in this animated show is just f****** wrong), Mr. Garrison is introduced and some of his words are the following: "I tell you, there's crazy stuff going on in this town". He is certainly correct and well there's no better place to start bringing on to this comment the crazy stuff that goes on in South Park than with Mr. Garrison himself. His very first scene has him teaching his students, Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny included of course, together with Mr. Hat..."Mr. Hat, may I please be excused from class?" "Well Kyle, no! You go to hell and you die!", so if Garrison is that f****** bizarre what's going on that is for him really crazy? Well, maybe not the fact that one of his students is farting fire but sure the arrival of aliens is pretty damn crazy! <br /><br />And is all certainly related: this show begins with Cartman after having a bad night, nightmares about visitors that abduct people and mutilate cows. The constant is Cartman keep saying that it was all just a nightmare while we all see the visitors abducting Kyle's brother Ike, mutilated cows (we also see cows wanting to ride a train!) and well also Cartman's anal probe (loved: "hey that kind of looks like Tom Selleck"). Not enough for you? Well, we also have romance (Wendy is also introduced, and boy is the kissing because everything went fine scene is simply ruined!), THE Chef (you gotta love "I'm gonna make love to you woman, gonna laid you down by the fire"), one of the most memorable deaths of Kenny... it's just the very first half-hour of the show but I tell you, there's crazy stuff going on in this town of South Park. <br /><br />Something from the fireside chat with Matt and Trey: hilarious stuff, not much to add just that "this was the pilot episode, done before we had a series so Matt and I had to do the whole thing by ourselves. For several months we were locked into a cold, dark, little room, for long periods of time" and that Trey was actually abducted when he was a small child.
