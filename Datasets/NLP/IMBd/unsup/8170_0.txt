When I first saw this movie I regretted spending my money on the ticket. The plot was so predictable, with villains next door getting away with just about every accusation a young boy could throw at him. Shallow characters taken straight from other movies. No new features I have seen in any character of this movie. It was a simple mix of many different other poor productions. And some time later it struck me!!! I have seen this story before! And where else could I see this not other than... The Simpsons. Season 6, Episode 1: Bart of Darkness. Look it up here on IMDb.COM. This episode of The Simpsons features Bart getting his leg broken leg in a cast, getting a telescope from his sister, starting watching people from Springfield using the gift. Sees no other than Ned Flanders - the next door neighbor doing suspicious things... murder is in the air... This episode was inspired by Rear Window by Alfred Hitchcock (1954) later remade by Pei Chan in Hou chuang (1955) and yet another time on TV under the very same title Rear Window (1998) (TV) starring Christopher Reeve. Are there no new ideas in the writers heads? Has everything been already written? Why can't I see Alfred Hitchcocks' name when I type Disturbia in IMDb?? When I first saw Disturbia I regretted spending money on the ticket. Now that I discovered it was a cheap ripoff I think it was just another moneymaker by people who do not care about the art of film making and, what is even worse, they don't care about the viewer... they only think about their pocket.
