Here's my theory. An accountant with connections managed to score directing a film, a dream he's had ever since he was so influenced by seeing Fate of the Dolphin III as a teenager. He then proceeded to stumble his way through the production and managed to put something together that, and I don't say this lightly, was a movie. Well, only just.<br /><br />Honestly. I've seen better production values on films shot with no budget whatsoever. I'm sure it had a low budget but it's no excuse for what they turned out. Absolutely no idea how to tell a story through the medium of film. Go back to filming birthday parties.<br /><br />Anyway, it gave me a good laugh. 0 out of 10.
