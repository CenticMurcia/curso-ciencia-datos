George Lucas's second feature film is definitely an A-plus when it comes to life in the early 1960s. This movie also paved the way for future stars particularly Richard Dreyfuss, Ron Howard, and Harrison Ford. The movie is basically about a eventful but hectic night in 1962 that has friends cruising up and down the main street and also some wild escapades involving mooning, spraying shaving cream on car windows, and tying the wheels on a police car to break apart. It also includes interlocking stories that eventually meet up in the last fifteen minutes of the film. There's some nice drag racing sequences as well, especially the one at the climax of the film that has a 1955 Chevy flip-flopping after losing control. The soundtrack is the best feature in the movie, about 50 or 60 songs were used in the movie alone. It's nice to check this movie out again when you have the chance.
