Great White isn't to bad of a film. I was expecting worse if they had to sue a law-suit.<br /><br />Anyway, i watched it online and loved it! Plot: Writer Peter Benton soon finds out a shark has been terrorizing there beach and wants to put a stop to it. his daughter, Jenny, loses her leg to a shark, a toy helicopter crashes replacing real one, a man's legs is torn of, oh and it made me smarter because in the movie, sharks roar, are made out of rubber, bob up and down, and look real fake.<br /><br />the shark looks real fake, and roars which disappoints me. i did enjoy the film, and am probably going to buy it.<br /><br />I think it was a decent film.<br /><br />10/1o stars.
