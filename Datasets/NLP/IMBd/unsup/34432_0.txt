I remember watching the only episode of this show that ever aired. I do remember Tim Conway using a lot of vulgarity, which I never noticed in any other work that he did. The skits seemed to mimic that of Rowen and Martin's Laugh-In. I know that this show was so controversial at the time that it was canceled 10 minutes after it was aired. The other networks wouldn't even touch it.<br /><br />Because of the time difference, people on the west coast never got to see it. I remember commenting to my mom how out of place the show was. There were some scenes that were drawn, and the characters just "popped in". This show was below the kind of comedy that Tim Conway was capable of doing.
