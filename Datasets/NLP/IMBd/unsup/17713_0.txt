This has to be one of the worst things I've ever had to endure..and that was under pain of death from the other 'arf! We missed the first hour of this 4-foot slog (thankfully)and then giggled through the rest of this abysmal Antipodean crap.<br /><br />The plot was predictable and the acting, wooden. There was more life in that piece of flotsam in the final scene. The 3rd hour was gut-wrenching, at best. The characters? Marie..looked more like a bloke. Gina had a moustache. Jack with his dodgy eye movements.And Mim-htah looked like she was carrying round an entire football team. That annoying French bint with the sword, dancing in a cave with a ghost! Had she been chewing some exotic tree-bark prior to her sojourns?<br /><br />This was definitely one for the teeny=boppers. I do like some Aussie things, though. Lager, Kangaroos and the name Sheila. My girlfriend enjoyed this piffle but that's hardly worthy as she also watches Prisoner Cellblock-H, Neighbours and Sons and Daughters.
