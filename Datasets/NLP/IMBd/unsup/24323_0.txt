You get Anol. Which pretty much says it all. (Thanks to TA for pointing this out to me).<br /><br />Yes, this movie is stupid. But not in the Troll2 funny kind of stupid. It is an hour and a half of pure boredom punctuated by brief episodes of incredulity. Let's get this straight guys. Lawyers in coffee shops do not save the day. <br /><br />They drink coffee and get stoned when they go home.<br /><br />Girls who work for escort services, are expected to service their clients. They don't get lucky shots with some crap in a sock.<br /><br />The average "madam" is not some sweet lady that cares about her workers. She's a user, just like the Johns.<br /><br />Almost forgot, the dialogue is just horrible.
