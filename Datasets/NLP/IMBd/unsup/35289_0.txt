I beg to differ with an earlier poster who thought this movie was a 'wonderful little flick'. Neither myself, my wife nor my two teen daughters thought this movie rated even a '1' on the scale.<br /><br />The acting can only be described as amateur at best. The lines given the actors aren't up to the task either and the situations, which are supposed to be comedic, are not. I noticed just one small smirk each from wifey and one daughter. The other daughter and I just thought the whole movie stunk.<br /><br />What could have been fodder for an uproarious comedy was wasted in this stereotypical teen high school farce having all the requisite players; jocks, goofs, hairballs, goons and mentally-deficient teachers. Just what purpose was served by the "reptile guy" and the "trekkies" I'm not sure. And the relationship between the two main characters seemed to suddenly appear without any basis. Instead, we get treated to scene after scene with the "goon" pulling pranks on underclassmen - oh, how cute! <br /><br />I'm glad they left some production money in the Valley because they sure didn't leave any laughs.
