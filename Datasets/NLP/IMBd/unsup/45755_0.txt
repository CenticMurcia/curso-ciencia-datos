Angry serial killer kidnaps people and subjects them to horrific torture until they die, all broadcasted live through the internet. The catch is that the more people log in to watch, the faster the person goes, which is supposed to show how cruel the common people are - since when you are dying under excruciating pain, you want it to last longer.<br /><br />The FBI special internet crimes division is on the job, but they are not only incapable of shutting down the site or blocking the access, but even of recording the transmission so that they can investigate closer - probably an attack on the Bush tax cuts.<br /><br />Still, not entirely devoid of excitement if you are really into the must-catch-a-serial-killer-fast-before-more-people-die genre. Beats "The Bone Collector".
