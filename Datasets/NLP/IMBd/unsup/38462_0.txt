One wonders why this was even adapted from the stage. Maybe the play was worth seeing but this movie arrived a few years too late to be a decent critique of lad culture.<br /><br />Yaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwn!<br /><br />Lazy adaptation. And as for the ending? We didn't write any decent scenes to wrap the film up so we just wrote these stupid captions instead!<br /><br />Come on guys! How could a screenplay that had such noticeable flaws ever make it to the screen?<br /><br />Don't even bother seeing this.
