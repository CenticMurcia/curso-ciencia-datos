I liked the first movie. It was funny I guess. But the second one, come on, my dad and I, movie lovers, almost lost our dinner watching it. At one point within this movie, Clara Topper who is looking through the creepy mansion for her husband is sitting at a table with her maid eating cake. My dad and I made a Mystery Science Theater out of it. I despised this movie. It was not good at all. And one women is constantly saying things like, "Well that killed all of that" this being a murder, she intended it to be funny which it is definitely not at all. I don't understand why some people who put reviews on this page appreciated this movie. I know that this is just my opinion and that you may not agree, but I hated this movie which others seemed to love.
