it had been a long time since i had a headache watching a movie but i presume we should torture ourselves once in a while with such pathetic movies to appreciate the well-made ones.... the movie is about a simple constable of Punjab,nihaal singh(sunny deol) who is too sweet and innocent to be believed. the villain is played by kamaal khan by the name of romeo who is an international hit-man who kills a priest after doing an act of terrorism(i thought the character was supposed to be smart).romeo comes to apna Punjab on a mission and when nihaal singh tries to arrest him(for not having a revolver license) he fools him and escapes crossing the border effortlessly(wow!!!romeo should be given full points for fooling the security of both sides of the border).nihaal is suspended on account of helping the terrorist.as nihaal singh is the only one who has seen romeo , his services are asked for by none other than the FBI but apna nihaal wants to take romeo back to India and with the help of a female(Indian) FBI agent who is more interested in shedding her clothes than doing her duty, manages to do that. the movie is a drag and the scenes where nihaal's mom keeps on falling down every time nihaal bumps into the female FBI agent is plainly stupid and unexplainable. at the end of the day the movie does'not make sense and the humor is anything but funny.sunny deol should take a break and reconsider how he wants to take his career ahead. kamaal khan is promising in certain scenes. the woman in the movie provide the required glamor and flesh. simply a very avoidable movie.
