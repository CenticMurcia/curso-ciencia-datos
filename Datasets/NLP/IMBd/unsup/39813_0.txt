If Hollywood keeps making bad copies of movies, at least they could see fit to copy a decent movie. Instead these bozos decided to copy the 1991 barely-B-Movie "Toy Soldiers" in this overacted cliche-filled steal wherever we can excuse for a film. It has the school kids held hostage, gadget-freak semi geek with a heart of gold, bad boys doing good and even the cute teens of Toy Soldiers, without the benefit of the dimples of Sean Astin or even the acting prowess of Wil Wheaton or R. Lee Ermey. Skip this one.
