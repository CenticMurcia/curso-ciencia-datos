A young girl (Nami) inherits a house where she lived until she was 3, and she and her ex-boyfriend go check it out. They're part of a team of video game designers, and they transmit their findings to the rest of the team because they want to use the house & some ideas for a new game. Nami knew the house belonged to her father but that's all, she didn't know who her father was. Apparently he was a great artist, but from some of the other things that they found in the house he had other interests too. Not wholesome ones, either. One of my complaints lies in the making of the movie, wherein certain parts are made to look like a video game, so you're never sure if you're seeing a game or the movie. However, considering that I've seen "House of the Dead" which is the worst-ever movie-based-on-a-video-game, this is done quite well and was more intriguing and mysterious. This is not a top-notch film but it's decent entertainment. 7 out of 10.
