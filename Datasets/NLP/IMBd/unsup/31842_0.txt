There are some similarities between the story of "Frühling auf dem Eis" and that of "Das Kind der Donau". But the ice dancing in "Frühling auf dem Eis", especially that of top star Eva Pawlik, is beyond all doubt more interesting that Marika Rökk´s dancing. Besides, Pawlik who was world-famous at that time, is a better actress.
