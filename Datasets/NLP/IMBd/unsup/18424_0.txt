I recently saw this film at the London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival and enjoyed it but the casual viewer should be warned... Watching a film of this type is very different from watching a common film. Here the plot and the characters develop slowly. There is plenty of fodder for introspection. Like life, there are also parts that you may never fully understand.<br /><br />Overall the film is fascinating and I was drawn into it as much out of a sense of wonder, as out of the hope that it would start making sense. By the end parts do make sense and some parts don't but I wouldn't cut any of it.
