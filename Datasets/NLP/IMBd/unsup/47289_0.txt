(Slight Spoilers) Badly disjointed horror movie involving a 1,000 year old African mummy Nigerian nobleman Gatanebo who's time has come for him to came back from the dead. Gatanebo's insane mission is for him to reclaim his love of years past the reincarnated Kenya. Kenya doesn't know it but some 1,000 years ago she was having an illicit affair with Gatanebo behind her husbands, the village high priest, back. Caught and made to pay for their crimes Kenya was lucky in just getting her head cut off. Poor Gatanebo got the worse of it by being locked alive in a sarcophagus, stone coffin, for all eternity.<br /><br />It's now in 1973 when Gatanebo's coffin is being shipped back, from Pôrto Prince Haiti, to the Museum of Natural History in New York that he suddenly comes alive. It just happens that the person in charge of shipping Gatanebo back to the states, Dr. Kessling, assistant and secret lover just happens to be Syliva! Kenya latest reincarnation! Coming alive Gatanebo has Freddy, another of Dr. Kessling's assistant, who guarding his body drugged with his golden snake pinkie ring and made into a mindless Zombie. Freddy now Gatanebo's Zombie slave will now do anything that his master Gatanebo tells him to even murder.<br /><br />The film "Vudu Sangriento", Bloody voodoo in English, goes on endlessly with Gatanebo looking like the guy who played the role of "The Amazing Colossal Man" the 60 foot bald and radioactive mutant Glenn Manning. Not quite being able to adjust to modern society Gatanebo is also unable to keep his emotions and feeling to himself! With him going into wild and murderous rages whenever things don't go his way. Gatanebo spends most of his time running around on the cruise ship with nobody on board,the 340 passengers and crew, being able to kill or even capture the dangerous and out of control maniac.<br /><br />Gatanebo also does in one of the ships crew members by decapitating him who, were later told, was the person back in ancient Nigeria in another lifetime who decapitate his doomed lover Kenya! Gatanebo in a crud effort to go undercover later takes on the identity of Dr. Craig, whom he had the Zombie-like Freddy crush to death with a steamroller. It was the late Dr. Carig whom Dr. Kessling was to meet at Pôrto Prince Harbor in discussing what to do with the stiff, Gatanebo, he's got on board and how to ship him back to the states . <br /><br />In doing that, having Dr. Craig murdered, Gatanebo as Dr. Carig can now be as close as he'll ever get to his old flame Kenya or now Sylvia Dr. Kessling's secretary. Gatanebo has no trouble speaking the English language In that over 300 years of being displayed in museum's all over the world he quietly and secretly learned English. This was by his listening to the people and tourists, from English speaking countries, visiting the museums.<br /><br />Sylvia when finally confronted by her long lost lover Gatanebo was anything but trilled in going back with him, to Nigeria, since he was anything but likable or even interesting to her. In fact when the weather cooled off, or dropped below body temperature, Gatanebo turned into, with his skin dripping off his face and body, what looked like a melting chocolate Easter Bunny! <br /><br />Mad and feeling rejected Gatanebo, like a spoiled brat, together with his Zombie-like slave servant Freddy for some reason go on a rampage attacking among others two of the boats passengers the Chicago meat distributor, he has the best hamburger beef in the world, and his girlfriend an exotic dancer on the ship. This mindless action on Gatanebos part tips off the local police to what a nut-case and dangerous psycho he really is. It also connects him to the brutal murder of the crew member who's severed head was later found in Sylvia's bedroom. <br /><br />Chased into a cave on the island, Haiti, by the local police lead by inspector Diminguez, a Spanish version of Let. Det. Frank Colombo, Gatanebo and his love the kidnapped and unwilling to go along with him Sylvia end up where where he always wanted her to be: With him forever in the land of the dead.
