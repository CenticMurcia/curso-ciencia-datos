After Hours is a classic, highly original and bizarre movie that reveals its greatness only through repeated viewings. It all takes place over one night, and becomes a surreal, unpredictable journey through the Manhattan underworld. If you like cleverly written, unpredictable stories then this film is for you. There are great cameo performances from the likes of Rosanna Arquette, Linda Fiorentino and Teri Garr among others. The film begins like a gentle romantic comedy, but as soon as Paul gets into the taxi to go to Marcy's Manhattan loft apartment, everything begins to go wrong and the film turns more sinister.<br /><br />Scorsese is a master at creating a sense of unease, with scenes cleverly set up to make you fear the worst, and share Paul's growing paranoia. This happens particularly with Marcy's character, with the suggestion that things aren't quite right, and why was she visiting the all-night drug store? "It's under control" says a guarded Kiki. The plot twists are often difficult to predict but the clues are there, and by a bizarre sequence of events, (SPOILER) Paul is unable to return home and ends up being persecuted by a vigilante mob with a Mr Softy truck.<br /><br />These scenes with actor Griffin Dunne running through the streets in the middle of the night are the highlights of the film - he witnesses a shooting while hiding up a fire escape, and says almost to camera: "I'll probably get blamed for that." It's vintage comedy of the darkest kind, and a journey into one man's soul on a search for love and acceptance. The sad thing is that most of the characters he meets are also just looking for a soul mate too, but the yuppy world that Paul comes from makes him too prejudiced and unable to see through their apparent weirdness to the lonely person underneath.
