I watched this movie under the title "Primitif" with Holland subtitles. It was not interesting at all, the plot (if any) was obvious and the gore effects was not very good. Need I say that the acting was ham? The only positive thing is the intro soundtrack which was "We are the robots" by Kraftwerk, accompanied by some "stylish" jungle-footage. Bah!<br /><br />Unless you're a REAL jungle-exploitation/cannibal-movie fan, this is not worth the 90 minutes.
