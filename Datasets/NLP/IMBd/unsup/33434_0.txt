I can't say much more than other reviewers. A group of particularly dumb people hook up at rich man's house, and do dumb things and get themselves killed. The fact of the matter is, they had all the tools at their command to disable that electric fence (or short circuit it). The bad guy hangs out in his room and leaves them alone most of the time. They can come and go, plot, talk, do whatever, but no one comes up with a decent idea to get them out. Then there are a series of ridiculous plot twists that leave us guessing (guessing why we ever watched this in the first place). The girls are all attractive and run around in swim suits, but that is really damning with faint praise. Why is it when people start getting killed, the characters do things like take showers, away from the rest of the group. Or go nosing around "by themselves." There is truly strength in numbers. These people never figured that out.
