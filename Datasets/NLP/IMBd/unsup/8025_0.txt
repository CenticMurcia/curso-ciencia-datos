Rachel Hayward and Christopher Lloyd star in this much-misunderstood comedy of errors, set in Seattle, Washington. If you--like I--call this city your home, you will emit gleeful shouts of recognition time and time again as familiar landmarks appear on the screen. You'll see those trademark new Seattle buses, the green and yellow ones. You'll see white Seattle buses, with orange and red stripes. But wait--those aren't Seattle buses! While such visual jokes will really only make sense to Seattleites, there's certainly something in this film for everyone. People's faces shake. People take off clothes in laundromats. Other people get afflicted with the pesky ole' stigmata. Christopher Lloyd even talks theology with a nun.<br /><br />Sit back with a friend or two, crack open bottles of MGD, and watch out for the scene where the mug hits the ceiling. It's a laugh a minute! I also found that this is a great movie to play with the volume turned down, at a party...your guests will thank you. Trust me!
