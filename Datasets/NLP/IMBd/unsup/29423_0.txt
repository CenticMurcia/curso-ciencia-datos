I have seen this film many times but each time i enjoy watching it, it's the best film I have ever seen, Antonio Banderas did his best , he's a Cuban man loving an American girl but there's a problem : She was such a lier girl and a thief as well .Simultaneously she was in love with another man so after a while she took all Banderas money and ran away, Banderas started to find her in order to kill her .He Employs a detective to do so but guess who the detective is : It's her lover missing her too and is searching for her.What would happen next? See the film.It's the beginning of one of the best films in the History. I recommend you if and only if ( I Like math) there's just ONE day left from your life(I'm sorry for you) GO SEE the film,don't miss it or you'll regret for it afterlife.
