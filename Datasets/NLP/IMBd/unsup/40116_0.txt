Don't even rent it. If you happen to come across it on the side of the road (which is quite possible due to the hatred I had toward this movie once I finished it), maybe then you could give it a watch. I want my 87 cents and time wasted watching back. This movie is just pathetic. I thought there was no way a Hellraiser movie could get this bad, but oh, it can, and it did. First of all, this movie has the entire Hellraiser series "self aware" in the world, and Pinhead is a widely known character to all of these sad pathetic gamers. For example, one of these douchebags is running around in a Pinhead shirt....yeah, lame. Don't expect any great acting either, because there's NO acting. It's horrible. A laugh fest. All I really have to say is this; Before I rented this movie, I came on here and read all these bad reviews, but being a huge Hellraiser fan, I decided against them and went ahead anyway. Now I'm here to back them up, this movie does truly suck.
