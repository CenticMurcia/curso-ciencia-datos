Each frame of the film is thought about very carefully. Its almost as if you watch a living painting a piece of art. The film was designed. They had the courage to show an image with just one small red dot in it. I don't know about the filters used on some parts of the film it looks a bit strange. <br /><br />The only comment I can make is that the short stories never got an end. At a certain moment you see a monk cutting cloth for a new coat. It would be better to have seen the process of making the coat and who it had to wear. I would have liked to see how they lived in that small room, how they slept and how they survived without speaking. What the effect is of little communication on their personality. And how they teach each other? There must have been some form of communication.<br /><br />But a fantastic film thanks for making it.
