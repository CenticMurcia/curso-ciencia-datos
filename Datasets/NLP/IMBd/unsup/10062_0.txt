Well, I didn't expect a great film, and I watched "El Milagro de P.Tinto" and I didn't liked very much, but I love the comic and I had to watch the film. The movie was even worse than I expected, characters only look like comic characters, but their personalities are completely differents, and the director included sexual jokes that you'd never find in the comic. If you loved the comic, DON'T watch the film. If you don't care about the comic and you want to watch 2 hours of easy jokes, this is your film.
