Well, it starts off fast, with death and lots of color, but then it goes blah. The ending can be predicting within a couple scenes. The dialog goes from crispy to that stale "I'm a bitch with attitude *snap snap*" we've all grown sick of. It just gets boring. Because, really, we've all seen this type of movie before, except this time someone dies. Fortunately, to save it from getting a 2/10 as opposed to the 3 I gave it, it remains colorful and purdy throughout, and Marilyn Manson's cameo boosted it as well. Oh and Pam Grier is cool. Speaking of Pam Grier, Jackie Brown is a good movie. If you're going to see Jawbreaker, I recommend seeing Jackie Brown instead.<br /><br />-Al
