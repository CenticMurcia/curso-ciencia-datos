there are bad movies. slipstream happens to be a real bad one. the idea itself is cool. but that's it. really. bad script. bat acting. stupid characters. plot holes.<br /><br />come on, the bank-robbers in the bus start to sing? i just don't believe this is real. i feel i've just lost another 80 minutes precious time.<br /><br />the explanation, which characters can travel back in time, and what will remain the same (clothes, money, but not the bullets) is a joke. probably the best part is, when the time-travel-ipod-like-gadget gets hooked on via USB to a laptop, because it's screen broke. you can probably think, that this movie is a spoof of its own. avoid this one.<br /><br />go and watch "the butterfly effect".
