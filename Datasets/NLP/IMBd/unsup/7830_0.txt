This is a very predictable movie yet at the same time very entertaining. I thought the casting was well done and that Susie Amy was a good choice for Valentine. This is a movie meant for entertainment and not for a deep socially redeeming value. I compare it to Cutthroat Island with Geena Davis. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the movie. When I watch movies of this nature I am looking for fun, some excitement, but mainly relaxation. This has all the qualities I look for in a movie. If I want to watch a more sophisticated movie then I am looking for different qualities, but this is good family entertainment with no explanation needed. My only problem with this movie and others that take place in a European country is that when all else fails, lets give them British accents. Depardieu, being French, had the only realistic accent in the movie.
