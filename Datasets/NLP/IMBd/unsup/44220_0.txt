This was one of those comedy films where I liked all the characters, especially the young girl who befriends the Spaceman, but there just wasn't enough really funny material to make the film fly. There are some good ideas here, but the director doesn't seem to know if he's making a serious movie or a B movie or a spoor or what. If it was trying to be like the later hit "Lost Skeleton of Cadavra", I'd just have to say it failed mostly because it was too modern in some parts. I heard it was produced by the guy who does "The Onion" but I saw no satire whatsoever here. It wasn't a terrible movie and I didn't find it annoying. In fact I was quite intrigued by the story. But it didn't go in either direction, to become a self-serious B movie like "Hideous Sun Demon" or to spoof itself like Roger Corman's "Bucket of Blood". This film got lost somewhere in the middle, and a slew of decent performances from totally unknown actors went with it. Maybe it was just the very serious tone of the film, I don't know.<br /><br />At any rate, this film would only be recommended for those who are seriously bored.
