This movie is very original in context and quite touching. The characters are all important to the film, by that I mean there are no "fluff" characters... except for the one that is "fluff" on purpose but that is obvious. Steve and his crew are surprising fun to watch throughout the adventure. The camera work in this film makes it seem realistic. More like you're watching a play from the front row than looking at a film screen. One particular scene moves from set to set without a cut away, seeming impossible unless the sets were actually built on top of each other like and actual boats rooms. By the time the movie was over I felt a strange connection to Zizzou and his crew.
