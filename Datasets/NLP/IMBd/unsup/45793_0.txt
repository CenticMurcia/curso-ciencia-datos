to be honest ever since highlander 2 the highlander series has been slowly declining in quality. the contradiction between each story lines is ridiculous and as for this movie it completely destroys it. i mean where has this whole source storyline come from, i was under the impression that immortals came from a plant in the distant future. and how many times can someone be the one like think of something new every time someone says oh I'm the last immortal at the end of the film then there's always another load in the next one its just pitiful. the first highlander film was great the second and third were not bad but now its just completely lost its way. and the series and endgame was rubbish too none of it made sense compared to the original.
