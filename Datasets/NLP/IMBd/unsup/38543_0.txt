Totally pointless and exceedingly boring low-budget sequel to the surprisingly popular and yet, disappointing first film that starts off promisingly enough as it shows in black and white a young deformed boy being tortured by a group of teenage thugs that call themselves "The Blood Wings"...or something similar to that. However, after that opening sequence the film takes a drastic nose-dive into the land of really cheap horror flicks as it becomes very hokey (cringe-worthy even) and nonsensical ultimately causing the viewer to heave a huge sigh of relief once the film has ended! Overall, the only true highlights in this sorry excuse for a film are the few short scenes of a rather luscious-looking Solei Moon-Frye (from "Punky Brewster" fame) in a small supporting role as an occult obsessed teen, and an admittedly creepy atmosphere which seems to mysteriously dissipate altogether after the first half-hour passes.
