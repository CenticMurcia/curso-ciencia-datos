I admit that the reason I watched this was because my cousin, Tim was involved heavily in its creation. That being said, it makes one very thankful to know that this was just a stepping off point for him on his long career in film production.<br /><br />I agree with every commentator on here "Yes, it's horrid" and on so many levels. The true horror comes from the fact that you've given up over an hour of your life that you can't get back.<br /><br />Like I mentioned before, I had a relative that contributed a lot to this movie. Since I'd never known anyone in the "business" I was really impressed that someone I knew personally made a film. Well, as my friends and I sat around the VCR with high hopes and anticipation, they were quickly dashed. Time actually seemed to stand still as we watched and we actually started thinking "a rousing game of chess would be fun" it became blatantly clear that not only was this film a total waste of time, but it was pure crap as well. You always want to say something somewhat constructive about your relatives/friends (if you like them), but I was completely dumbfounded. What made this project even worse, was the fact that there was an entire fifteen-minute segment that was repeated in its entirety for no reason whatsoever.<br /><br />Tim has gone on to do some great and creative things since this came out. We all have stumbling blocks along the way, but I still want the hour or so of my life back...
