I only give this movie a 9 because it was a bit slow to get started. A young man gets out of jail and moves into his mothers old apartment. No one is quite sure how she died and the door had to be broken in for her body to be taken out. He makes some discoveries in the apartment that leave him with a lot of questions. One day as he's going to his apartment, he ends up in an elevator with a police officer. He doesn't say anything, but you can sense is discomfort as he feels like the officer is following him. He proceeds to his apartment and the officer enters the apartment next door. He begins to hear arguments in the adjoining apartment and bangs on the wall at one point to let them know he hears them. Occasionally he sees their little girl sitting in the hall playing a tiny play piano. Each day seems to pull him more and more into the events of this family. When we find out why the guy went to jail, we understand why he is reluctant to risk a possible fight with the man. I don't want to give anything away, so I'll end here. This movie should make us reflect on whether or not it is our business to step in when we see someone getting abuse. Like the woman that was raped and killed outside a building while no one did a thing to stop it, or the current gang rape that just happened. Ask yourself if you would put yourself at risk for someone you don't know and whether you would expect someone to step in if you were in some kind of danger at the hands of another person.
