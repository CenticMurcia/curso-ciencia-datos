Wow, I had no idea that was there until I read it on this message board... So, yeah, thanks; it was really funny! I think they could have done without Sarah Michelle Gellar, or at least they could have cast someone else in her place,... maybe a female comedian instead. But Jack Black was hilarious, as usual. They couldn't have found anyone to do his part as well as he did! It's really funny to see how they fit it all into the actual scene from the movie and make it look so real. I just wish I'd seen it on the movie awards... Not sure how I missed that, exactly. Anyways, it's kind of hard to find at first but its worth the extra remote clicking.
