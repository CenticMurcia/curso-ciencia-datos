Although not as wacky and funny as either Bringing Up Baby or Arsenic And Old Lace, this is a very funny and memorable Cary Grant comedy. I don't understand how someone could be disappointed by the movie, as one comment on IMDb stated, but everyone has their own taste (and I sure know of a lot of beloved films I hated).<br /><br />Irene Dunn plays Grant's wife who has been lost at sea for many years. She and a man she is shipwrecked with were finally discovered and she returns home to Grant on the eve of his wedding! Apparently, after so many years he is ready to have her declared legally dead and proceed with his new fianc√©e. Her arrival sure throws a monkey wrench into their plans! However, when Grant finds out she was stranded along with the handsome Randolph Scott (FYI--he really was Cary Grant's best friend in real life), Cary isn't sure whether to get remarried or return to Dunn!<br /><br />FYI--The same year this film debuted, another film with almost the exact same story line also came out called "TOO MANY HUSBANDS". While this other film was amiable enough, MY FAVORITE WIFE is better in every way. If you only see one of these films, be sure it's MY FAVORITE WIFE.
