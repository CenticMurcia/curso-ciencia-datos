"Light Years Away" is a beautiful movie. It has timeless, tender themes and genuine entertainment value! Well-acted with a touch of magic, this film will touch you. Gently mixed with a fun, whimsical playfulness, an old fashioned soulful romance is clothed in modern garments in "Light Years Away".The result is a joy, a rare movie. Chris Knight and Meadow Williams are very believable as star-crossed loves and have great chemistry on screen.Eric Roberts gives a great performance.Tim Peyton has fabulous comic timing, and Adrianne Curry is outstanding as a nerdy scientist.Creative and wonderfully cast, with genuine,believable, and powerful performances by all. A true jewel of a movie!
