A real contender for the worst movie ever made. Neck and neck with "Plan 9 from Outer Space." The big difference being Plan 9 was made for $500. Pretty much everybody associated with this movie could arguably deserve to be shot. Too bad about losing Morgan Freeman! A real contender for the worst movie ever made.

Too bad about losing Morgan Freeman! How do films like this get made? Should the geriatric hamster who checks the scripts be replaced? Possibly with a grade 2 class somewhere in Alaska? Well that's OK. So long as millions got spent. too bad about it being a vomit sandwich.
