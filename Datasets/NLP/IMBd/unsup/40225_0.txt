OK, so I went to see this movie because of Monica Bellucci, however, I am a Spike Lee fan. This movie just went from bad to worse and I didn't even know what hit me. The script was not coherent, it flow wasn't smooth, and I really didn't get anything out of the movie but a scene of bewilderment for having to sit through that. People say there is a meaning in this movie but I just couldn't get passed the bad storyline. However, not to trash Spike to much, this movie defiantly obtained a cult status, so if the plot interests you this movie just MIGHT be for you, cause its definitely wasn't for me ... in fact I can say this movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. So thats it, it gets 3! On a side note, Spike Lee redeemed himself in Inside Man.
