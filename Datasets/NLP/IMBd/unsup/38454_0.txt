I was surprised how bad this one turned out for me, given that Dean Cameron and Patrick Labyorteaux usually make great under-achieving party animal characters, as they prove to do here. Except, even where the movie follows that party animal meets anal villain story line and completely follows the book on ski movies, nothing much happens.<br /><br />At a posh ski school, cabin number 8, lead by David Marshak (Dean Cameron) only has three things on their minds that any slacker guys in an 80s/early 90s comedy romp has on their mind: beer, boobs, and parties. And, usually in that order. The sleazy jerks from cabin one, which could easily be mistaken for Eurofags Lars and Hans, were it not for their American accents, don't want to put up with the antics of cabin number eight. So, Capitan no fun and his gang of merry thugs wage war (somewhere in there) and vow to get them kicked out of the camp, because they're really stealing their thunder. There's not much skiing going on, save a few shots in the beginning, and of course, the dangerous slope competition finale (the pinnacle of any ski movie out of this period). The rest of the time is devoted to cabin eight's goofing off. Seriously, that's about it. A repetition of boobs and parties. They attempted to put a story in there and follow it, although they didn't and the characters had to state the obvious intermittently in the film because they obviously weren't devoting much camera time to it.<br /><br />Granted, I usually love dumb comedies like these, and especially with Dean Cameron and Patrick Labyorteaux in the front seat (see 'Summer School'). I could tolerate the clich√© ski school story line. I could even put up with the numerous boob money shots, but damn, they made almost no effort for a story here. That's a no go for me. Over and out.
