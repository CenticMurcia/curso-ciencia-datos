The Ultimate Gift is simply an amazing movie with a heart rendering message. I was truly moved and truly inspired by this story. A cynic may proclaim it to be predictable and clich√©d but a movie this meaningful should not be viewed through cynical eyes. I guess it depends on the viewer's state of mind but I was in a place in my life where this movie truly touched me. Having lost a loved one recently, this movie spoke to me. The need to be reminded of the purpose of life and the need to find your true role in it was poignantly illustrated. Also, The performances are wonderful and I love the structure and presentation. I can't wait to own this one on DVD and I'll be giving copies as gifts to all my friends and family. Truly, the ULTIMATE gift indeed.
