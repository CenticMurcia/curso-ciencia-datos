I actually suffered through 10 minutes of this thinking that it might get better.... Please do yourself a favor, and don't bother watching this.<br /><br />Unless you enjoy intolerably bad movies, your time is better spent anywhere else. <br /><br />And I do mean ANYWHERE.<br /><br />It is hard to believe that any of these actors who participated in this movie did not get banned from the business permanently. It certainly is a black mark on their careers in my opinion.<br /><br />So, what was wrong with this movie? Poor Acting. Bad Jokes. Bad Plot.<br /><br />What is good about this movie? You don't have to watch it.
