Shoot 'em up is quite possibly the best action movie I have seen so far mix in Broads, Bullets, and a Hardcore selection of rock music like Ace of Spades by Motorhead, If You Want Blood by ACDC and Zen by Strapping Young Lad and you have a movie you can put on even when your not really paying attention, just non stop action all the way through such as your typical "Total Recall" or "Crank" films. If you like rock music, if your sick of the dreary love scenes and dialogue in most films this is the one for you, so lock up your daughters, shoot your sons and check out the best action film of the year. Probably the best watch I have had at the cinema for 2 years 2006-2008
