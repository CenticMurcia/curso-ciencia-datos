Alas, FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION will elicit sleepy "no thanks'" responses from most audiences. An 86 minute in-joke for the film biz but not the audiences who pay, this skid-mark in CG's career is adequately spelled out in other comments on this site. I was very disappointed and ultimately, bored by this slight joke movie lampooning what should be a sure fire winner comedy. Probably the one really funny gag is Catherine O'Hara's plastic surgery. I also have a complete aversion to Parker Posey. Every role I have endured seeing her including this one is tedious. She cannot act. The 'role of a lifetime' in SUPERMAN RETURNS was another lame result. She might stay home along with Casey Affleck and Denise Richards and spare us moviegoers from more wasted time. FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION needed a proper script and tighter direction and a 75 minute running time. I did consider, and my answer is NO.
