"Something to Talk About" is one of those movies I can watch time and time again and never tire of. It appeals particularly because it has so many elements I love in a movie -- dancing, powerful women, horses, sexy men riding said horses, humor, fighting, making up.<br /><br />Not to mention a cast, writer, and director that imbue the film with a sense of high quality. Relationships between a myriad of characters are explored and to satisfaction. Even minor characters turn in great performances; for example, Grace's Aunt Edna, who shares a secret that leads to a hilariously dark moment for Grace and Eddie. Kyra Sedgewick steals every scene she is in and makes me wonder why she isn't a bigger star. She had chops in this film. She was thoroughly enjoyable.<br /><br />Callie Khouri and Lasse Halstrom made a memorable movie with "Something to Talk About." Worth watching and laughing over and over.
