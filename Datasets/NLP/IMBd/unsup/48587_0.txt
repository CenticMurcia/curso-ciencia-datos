This movie is one word CONFUSING. At the end your like what the huh? In the beginning your like what the?.... This "voodoo" woman character who looks like whoopi goldberg having a really bad hair day and the role she plays is unclear. She plays a voodoo priestess who speaks with the dead on a regular basis. She influences John Cusak the main character a journalist from NYC and Kevin Spacey a nouveau riche from Savannah. The story essentially doesn't really need her or her scenes to make sense. The movie revolves around the shooting of a local bad boy/ pretty boy Jude Law in the estate of Kevin Spacey. Kevin Spacey is accused and the story takes off from there. The titled has nothing to do with the essence of the movie, neither does the bizarre ending or that voodoo woman.I love Clint Eastwood but... stick to acting honey! The only thing thats good about this movie is the all star cast, some funny moments and a glimpse at the beauty of the South. 3/10 Ouch!
