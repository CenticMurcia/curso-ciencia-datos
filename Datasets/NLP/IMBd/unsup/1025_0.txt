This movie is misguiding, since this is not your brainless action flick Lorenzo "I have a father and a mother too" Lamas is associated with. The problem is that, instead, we get a boring, slow-moving, predictable "suspense" with a plot straight out of zillions direct-to-video movies, where Lamas' "interpretation" of his "character" sinks it to new depths (who ever asked him to be an actor anyway ?) The only good point for this turkey are the competent diirection and good cinematography - plus the fact that the French video wasn't pan&scanned.
