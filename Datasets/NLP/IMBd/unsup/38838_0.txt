The plot line is so simply you'll swear you've seen it before...<br /><br />People wake up to find that their city has been evacuated and is under siege by alien robot thingees (of which we never actually see more than one on screen at any given time.) While survivors try to keep one step ahead of the monsters, the Army is bravely trying to figure out how to defeat them.<br /><br />Can't say the movie was all that great. It was clearly done on a budget, with characters talking about what was going on rather than showing us things going on. (Something a modern film would never do.) <br /><br />The acting was fairly decent, but the threat just wasn't all that impressive.
