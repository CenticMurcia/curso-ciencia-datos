After a two minute introduction to the Bigfoot mythos that seems like it could have been plucked out of "Legend of Boggy Creek", we first meet the shag carpeted, snaggle-toothed creature himself. Seems that this particular Bigfoot is quite the peeping tom. Spying on them until they get into various stages of undress then whisking them away to his secret cave for later use. In between the cheaply made creature roaming around doing his thing, we're 'treated' to such mindless padding as a woman waking up & showering with a sad lack of nudity, a mindless sub-plot ( or what passes for a semblance of a plot in all honesty) about ex-cons that goes nowhere fast, hippies being hippies (complete with an absolutely horrid song), and a rather strange nightmare that has jack all to do with anything. Strictly for fans/ completinists of the works of Uschi Digard and/or Sharon Kelley. Because even ample nudity can't save this turd.<br /><br />My Grade: D-
