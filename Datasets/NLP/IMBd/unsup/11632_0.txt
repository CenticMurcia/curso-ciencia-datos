Question: what do you get when you take Tony Manero and ad body oil and a script that single handedly reminds us of ALL the reasons the 80s sucked? Answer: A 'perfect' movie. ...in which our hero trades in his Saturday Night Fever for a pair of leg warmers and a synthesized soundtrack. Where to begin? How about with an insipid script in which a Rolling Stone reporter (who happens to look like a movie star, like most reporters do..)seeks out the "truth" behind the health club craze of the Reagan years--not exactly Hunter S Thompson stuff huh? Career killing moments abound in this one, including a post-rhinoplasty Laraine Newman who actually says "it's a lot safer looking for Mr Goodbody than Mr Goodbar..."). No really! She says that! AND Jann Wenner, RS Editor, even gives an unconvincing performance as...HIMSELF! AND a few years later, it took Quentin Tarantino to rescue Travolta's career from forever doing talking baby movies. Redeeming feature: a very, very 'pert' Jamie Lee Curtis! If you like unintentionally bad movies, then this truly IS your Perfect choice.
