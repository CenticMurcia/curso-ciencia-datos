being a fan of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy for as long as i can remember. i have seen all of their films from Lucky Dog up to the dire Atoll K and this is in my top five favourite Laurel and Hardy films of all time.<br /><br />Stan and Ollie play mouse trap salesman who get riped off by a cheese salesman and must pay off their debt by working at a local hotel. there are many funny moments in this film including the fire scene (once you see this film you will know what i mean) but there are a lot of boring songs that spoil the comedy of Stan and Ollie but apart from that a classic piece of vintage comedy.<br /><br />watch this and enjoy!
