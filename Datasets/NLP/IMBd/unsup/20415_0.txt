i think that film was a great film 2 watch. it shows u how u feel about the game and if u want 2 become a professional football wit love involved i just wanna no wen goal 3 is out because that has 2 be better because she is pregnant and who's the father i think we know its munez's baby.! and i reckon this has become a gr8 movie from goal because it means anything is possible so u don't have to have trails for teams you can just be spotted u never know in the years 2 come but i just cant wait until goal 3 comes out because thats just going to be fantastic so thanks for looking at my comment and hope 2 comment again soon about goal 3 this time thanks
