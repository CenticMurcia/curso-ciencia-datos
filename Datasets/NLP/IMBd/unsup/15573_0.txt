I started watching this show in 2006, probably the last season it was in production, and now enjoy the reruns every night. What a thoughtful and funny show. It rivals and possibly exceeds all of Bill Cosby's shows with family humor that never sinks to the low humor used on so many situation comedies. Each show is an original and enjoyable learning experience. The actors are great, especially Bernie and the adorable Jeremy Suarez (I just want to squeeze that child, he is the cutest child ever), and the music is fabulous. All in all, one of my favorites. I love the way its shot and how Bernie addresses America. It's just so good, I wish it was still in production so I could see more of it. Thanks Bernie from a fellow, former, Chicagoan.
