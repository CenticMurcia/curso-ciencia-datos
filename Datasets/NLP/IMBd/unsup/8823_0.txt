Bobby Reynolds (Jesse Bradford) is released on probation from Rikers and moves to the old apartment in East Village, New York, where his lonely mother lived and passed away. He finds a job as mechanic in the Houston Auto Repair owned by the supportive Hector Rodriguez (Carlos Leon) and tries to rebuild his life. However, he is outcast and his former friends and neighbors do not want to talk to him. He meets his former girlfriend Alyssa Foldes (Amelia Warner) that works as waitress and studies in a college of design. Bobby hears weird noises and finds blood in his apartment, and overhears an argument between an abusive police officer and his wife and their daughters. Sooner he discovers that the next door apartment is actually empty and he is haunted by the ghosts of the deceased family that was not helped by the neighbors. <br /><br />"The Echo" is a good ghost story and apparently a remake of a horror movie from Philippines that I have not the chance to see yet. The plot is supported by a stylish cinematography and a creepy apartment building that gives a scary atmosphere. The conclusion does not explain how Bobby could justify the death of Hector in the basement of his building in the same day of his absence to the probation officer and even the bruises in Alyssa and if the curse has ended. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Ecos do Mal" ("Echoes from the Evil")
