When I read the last comment amongst others I realized that most of the people don't know that this movie is just a remake of a French one. I understand that this one is not good at all but try to watch the French one. Even with subtitles you will laugh a lot more. I know you will say I am French and I try to defend the movies of my country. You are right but "Neuf mois" is really worth it. Check out the comments of people from other countries. In the French version Patrick Braoudé is excellent. Hugh Grant is a very good actor and doesn't deserve to play in such a bad movie. They missed all the good energy and jokes that were in the original version. Also Hugh Grant cannot play like Patrick Braoudé. They don't have the same way of behaving. One is more discrete and acts with his eyes and the other one is just crazy. Patrick Braoudé as crazy as he is can make you realize that you would do the same as him in such a situation. So the conclusion is: skip the remake, watch the original one.
