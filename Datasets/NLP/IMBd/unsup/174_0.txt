Tomorrow Is Forever finds Orson Welles and Claudette Colbert as a pair of young marrieds during World War I when Orson announces he's enlisted in the American Expeditionary Force. The young wife sees her gallant young husband off to war, not knowing that she's pregnant. When he's reported missing in action, Claudette's all at sea. Fortunately she's got a most sympathetic boss who has an eye for her in any event. Claudette marries George Brent and they raise the son she has by Welles and they also have a son of their own.<br /><br />Although as the romantic young husband John MacDonald, Welles doesn't quite cut it, as Erik Kessler, the German refugee who in reality is John MacDonald, Welles just shines. With a heavy beard, makeup, a German accent and a shambling gait courtesy of the last war, Welles totally succeeds in recreating himself on the screen. He's so totally different you can't blame Claudette for not recognizing him, I could barely. <br /><br />On the eve of World War II, Brent who is now a big time industrialist meets Welles who is now in his Kessler persona. He brings him home and while there's something eerily familiar to Claudette he becomes an adjunct family member.<br /><br />Watching Tomorrow Is Forever I have no doubt that director Irving Pichel gave Welles total command of his character. Most likely Welles even directed some of the scenes he was involved with.<br /><br />Orson Welles throughout his life appeared in a lot of garbage using his actor's salary to continue financing his own projects. Though he's a bit weak as the young husband, as the old refugee chemist it's a brilliant characterization. Orson gets good support from Claudette Colbert, George Brent and the rest of the cast.<br /><br />Too bad he didn't get to do the whole film, direct as well as act.
