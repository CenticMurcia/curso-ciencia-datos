Besides, the story told is very sensitive and real. It reflects the situation that a man faces when he comes back to his homeland after living abroad many years. All the characters, the photography of this beautiful city, the Real Sporting, and the story, make this movie a real pleasure to watch. I am not surprised that it was awarded the Oscar to the Best Foreign Film in 1982 from the National Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
