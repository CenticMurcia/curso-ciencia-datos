A perfect movie projecting a man 'Desu' who finds opportunity in difficult time, makes decision rationally, lives by his own conditions, has Rules unsurpassed, vision unparalleled and perfection in execution. Ram Gopal Verma has given a new dimension to bollywood film making. Randeep Hooda has delivered very less dialogs but his portrayal of character is perfect. Controvercially its story of Dawood (Underworld don accused in 1993 Bombay blast case)and his Gang "D".Ramu also got some threatening phone calls for that. In the end of the film it summarizes character as: when, where and what he will do - nobody knows. thats why Desu is called D. Nobody could stop him. He made crime a business. Veiled politics and brought underworld into 'upperworld'.Even today 'D company's greatest rule is - "In business, your friend is your foe."
