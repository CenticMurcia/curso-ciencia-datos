An action film at heart. The story of gun smuggling is just a backing just big enough to support the relentless action scenes.<br /><br />Motorcycles exploding in mid-air, cars blowing up, shotguns, pistols, submachine guns, bombs...it's all here.<br /><br />They all make for some of the best action sequences ever filmed. A good mix of the gritty and realistic with the improbable and totally fake. Though I think that the ending is bit too much. But what can you expect from Woo aside from a molotov cocktail of intense explosive action and violence?<br /><br />Action and cult movie fans are advised to watch this film, however others might be turned off by it. 7/10<br /><br />Rated R: intense strong violence
