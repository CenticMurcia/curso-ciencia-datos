Jon치s Cuar칩n seems to find his role as a director in his spectacular debut "A침o U침a" (Nail Year), who tells the story about a girl form USA and a boy from Mexico who fall in love during an awful summer. I was really impressed with the movie because it he told the story with a completely original and fresh concept based in only photographs. Such a challenge!... This will not be the first thing we're gonna watch of him, so lets put all eyes on, he have such a great talent! The voice performances of the actors who lead them were astonishing when the main thing to pay attention to is to your ear (very clever). This movie was premiered during the XXII Guadalajara International Film Festival 2007.
