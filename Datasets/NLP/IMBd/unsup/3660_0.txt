If you have already seen this movie please just ignore this comment. If you are about to watch it for the first time please just forget about it. It is a waste of time.<br /><br />The movie starts with two strangers making love in a motel room without even knowing each other's name. Between the 3-4 rounds of sex they have (when they are "regenerating") they start to chat discovering each other and finally they get friends. That is the story in a nutshell. <br /><br />Although the concept of the movie seems to be quite OK the workout is incredibly dull. Boring meaningless conversations. I could hardly wait till the end of the movie and I felt sorry for the time I had spent in the cinema watching.
