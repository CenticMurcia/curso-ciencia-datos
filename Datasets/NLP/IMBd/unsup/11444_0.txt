To the average spectator this is agonising viewing that requires concentration, open-mindedness and above all, diligence. But give, and you shall receive, as Philip Groning's monumental production demonstrates. For a monk of the Grande Chartreuse Monastery, located in the French Alps, his chosen life is about seclusion, silence, contemplation, routine, repetition and prayer. Not to mention the daily chores and regular haircuts. The rhythms of life are slowed right down for these holy men of the church, and their devotion to their God, combined with Groning's majestical photography, is utterly awe-inspiring. This astounding documentary challenges the viewer's patience, but, in return, purifies their soul.
