Saw this movie at 3am on the 'Bad movies' channel. It certainly deserves it's place there. Badly acted, boring, explotitive and just plain silly. Still, if you're drunk or on any naughty illegal substances you just might enjoy it.<br /><br />Basically a load of boys at military school get involved in the swinging 60s drug culture. They get high on banana skins, meet girls in mini skirts, drink a lot and generally stick it to the man. There's not exactly a lot of plot, or dialogue. Just seems to be a random assortment of odd little scenes.<br /><br />But hey in the end the guy meets a groovy chick and they go to san Francisco and probably live happily ever after in a camper van.
