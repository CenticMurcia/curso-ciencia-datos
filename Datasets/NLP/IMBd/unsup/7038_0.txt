Reader, do you know all those cousins and distant relatives you have that live far off in such different places as Kentucky, Arkansas, West Virginia, Southern Ohio, Mississippi? Perhaps even North Dakota, or Iowa, or way out in Washington. The houses come complete with animal trophies mounted on the walls, bowling trophies displayed on the television, and piles of junk in the hallway and guest rooms and in the basement. They refer to our nations capitol as "Warshington" and in most of these places you can get a free shotgun if you buy a queen size bedroom set.<br /><br />Liam Neeson simply owns this movie, even Patrick Swayze has a hard time matching Neeson's intensity. Neeson's portrayal of your average ass-kicking coal miner from Kentucky is all the more awesome when you figure in the fact that the dude is Irish. Reader, do you think it's entirely impossible that they have rednecks in Ireland too? In the end, the mobsters (including a young Ben Stiller, who comes across remarkably like an arrogant little prick) can't defeat the dirty-fighting Hillbillies because the mobsters are sissies who like to look pretty and the Hillbillies, hell they don't care how dirty they get. They're hillbillies from Kentucky, what did you expect?
