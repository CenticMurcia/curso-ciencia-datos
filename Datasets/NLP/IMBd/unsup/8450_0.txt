Robin Williams is probably the best Peter Pan I've seen. Well, at least, a grownup Peter Pan. It's not a usual role for Robin compared to Mrs. Doubtfire or Good Morning Vietnam. He's a workaholic to get away from his family, along with his drinking. Then, his kids are gone and look who tells him that Captain Hook kidnapped his kids. In comes Maggie Smith. She is a wonderful Wendy!! This movie has it's ups and downs, of course. But, Robin's humor along with Dustin Hoffman's performance as Hook and Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell makes this movie a perfect childhood movie that can be watched with the whole family!
