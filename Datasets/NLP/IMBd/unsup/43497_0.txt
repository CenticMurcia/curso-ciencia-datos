Well, here is another of those quickies that the studio forced upon Bette Davis although this one is not quite as bad as some of her other efforts during this time (Fog Over Frisco, The Big Shakedown).<br /><br />This time she is paired with Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and they are a rather attractive couple.....but as usual Bette does not have much to do here except use a phony Southern accent and sport that platinum hair. The story concerns two flyers (Doug Jr. and Frank McHugh) who go to work for gangster Leo Carillo (before his days as Pancho, sidekick to the Cisco Kid) and get involved with running drugs. The story and dialogue are surprisingly modern as are the living arrangement of the three main characters. But the film still comes across as one of those throw-aways that were on the lower half of the double bill at the local Bijou. Bette deserved better than this. It's worth watching just for the ambiance of the early '30s and the rather honest appraisal of the Depression and its effects.
