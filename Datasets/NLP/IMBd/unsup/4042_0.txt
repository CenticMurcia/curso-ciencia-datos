The start of probably the greatest action triolgy alongside Indiana Jones has to rate highly. A movie that is action packed, laced with great one liners and see's the good guys kicking ass over terrorist before it was popular. Its not for everyone, not one movie is, but if you love action movies, make sure you've seen this one.
