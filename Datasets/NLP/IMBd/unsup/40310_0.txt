No, this isn't THE next big swedish movie. If you are looking for something like Lasse Hallström's "My life as a dog", you better keep looking. The script is poor, the characters are heavily undeveloped and the cinematography is full of clichés. This movie gets a 3/10 only because of Esa Vuorinen's photo (superb) and Nadine Kirschon's debut as the young sister.
