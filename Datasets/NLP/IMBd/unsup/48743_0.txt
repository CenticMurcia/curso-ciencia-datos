Seeing the preview, I had high hopes for the film. It seemed like an idea which came out of a good, but out-of-date, pitch. The script was not there. The pitch would have been "It's 3rd rock from the sun meets My Stepmother is an alien with a twist of Gerry Shandling." However, it did not pull it off. It had some funny moments in it, but they were few, and mainly in the beginning of the movie. <br /><br />Another problem with the movie is that its running gag is tedious, and gets boring. How often can you laugh at a penis that hums when excited. Its funny at first, but by the end it is old. John Goodman also has a hard time making the half-good jokes work. His last comment has off timing, and barely makes me laugh. Plus, the movie was just too long for its humor. It would have worked better if Shandling had just made this into a one-hour HBO special or something to that effect. There were these stretches of emotion that just ran on, and I got bored of them. <br /><br />This potentially funny situation has been done before and better by other shows and movies, like the ones mentioned above. See most of the other movies which are out right now because this one has to be the worst of them all...with the exception of Pitch Black. It has its funny moments at times, but they run dry long before the movie is over.<br /><br />2/10
