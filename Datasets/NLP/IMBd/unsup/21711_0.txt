Excellent movie. I loved it so much I searched until I was able to find a place to pre-order it, & I'm glad I did. I have watched it many times, & everyone I've shown it to has loved it also. It's an incredible story portraying Native American legends, and also shows the struggle that modern day Native American teens go through when trying to find their identity. Anyone with an interest in history or Native American culture should watch this movie!! I do agree with the previous comment that when it aired it was annoying that it was constantly interrupted with commercials. Much better to have the DVD & watch it commercial-free!
