The sequence of accidents at the start is garbage. The guy hitting the metal post would fall right back, not to his right. The girl on skates could easily avoid him and not hit the cart.<br /><br />What are the little flaming things that catch the penguin on fire? If they are road hazard markings, surely a reflective one would be used or a battery powered light, NOT a naked flame. The guide-dog would not run after the other dog, they are specifically trained not to.<br /><br />Why don't the people in front of Clark notice the burning penguin or put it out and why doesn't Clark take his paper of the pile thats very visible.<br /><br />No bank guard would fire in a crowded street and the guy in the car had plenty of time to open a window/door and get free. None of the bystanders try to break any of the windows either, which is easy.<br /><br />The photo-booth would not take pictures so quickly after having money put in and most take money from the inside of the booth anyway. The guy with the bucket on his head could easily have taken it off. The 2 men who fall over are actors but the public walk over the slippery gum-balls easily.<br /><br />The pie man could have stepped over the gum-balls easily also. Why is the Daily Planet in the same street as the Empire State Building? (visible from the front on the street).<br /><br />The "hacking" that Gus does is impossible. He uses his employee number to hack into the company system. He's a data processor, he'd have little to limited system access. His terminal would be limited to the task he was doing and nothing else at that time. And any hack would be traced back to his employee number. <br /><br />Being a data processor certainly wouldn't involve a light-pen in any way. And it's unlikely the Webscoe system would accept commands typed in plain English. There was plenty of space on the road by the chemical plant for the bus to get past if the police car had moved.<br /><br />Inflammable? Doesn't that mean won't catch fire? Why didn't Superman freeze the acid when he was talking to the scientist. Now it's clearly stated that no-one knows where the half cents are going and aren't accounted for so how do they work out they are being defrauded?<br /><br />And how does Gus whose only just learned to be a data processor learn so much about hacking so quickly? (like he was taught it when he was taught DP). And Gus "hacking" a weather computer would NOT effect a bank ATM, or Bloomingdales Billing Department, or traffic control (they are totally independent systems). Traffic lights are very basic circuits built into the light itself.<br /><br />Vulcan can only monitor weather, that's all it's designed for, it would never make weather. This is totally beyond belief, that a novice hacker could reprogram a weather monitor system to actually create weather.<br /><br />And Gus would have smashed right through the window he landed on when he fell down the building. How can a satellite designed to predict and monitor weather analyze chemicals from an asteroid?<br /><br />Ricky only told his friends that Superman was coming (who wouldn't believe him anyway), so how did the whole town find out Superman was coming? And more to the point how did Gus, who isn't even in Smallville find out? Superman knows Kryptonite is green, why didn't he suspect the gift from Gus right away? Why do Lana and Ricky live in such a big house? No wonder her rent costs so much.<br /><br />Superman blowing out the Olympic flame is no big deal, it could easily be re-lit when he left. Oil ship steering isn't computer controlled. They might get instructions by computer but they are steered by humans as the sea is too unpredictable. No ships captain is going to take notice of orders to go to the middle of the sea and stay there. They know the lack of oil would cause chaos. Oh, and why isn't the British Reliance flying either the Union Flag or The White Ensign which she would do if she was British registered.<br /><br />How did Gus design a computer? He was only ever trained in data processing, Not like he learned computer architecture there. And once again we see The Statue Of Liberty (In New York) but heavily featured as near Metropolis.<br /><br />Am I the only one who thought the tanker should explode when Superman is welding the side closed? And how DO the Websters balloons stay inflated when they have no heat source inflating them?<br /><br />The instructions Websters sister gives are useless unless the people she's giving them to designed the computer. And she would have no idea how to operate the computer seeing as she's never seen it before and Gus designed it to his specifications. The screens attacking Superman are from the Atari 2600 Superman game, the sound effects are from Pac-man.<br /><br />Superman in a bubble with no air is no big deal, he can fly in space in a vacuum. Oh, and the string of a yo-yo would not support the weight of a fully grown man. Why didn't Gus just throw the power switch that Lorilei used to activate the computer at the cave entrance?<br /><br />The end for this is weak and the whole film hasn't lasted well under the passing of time.
