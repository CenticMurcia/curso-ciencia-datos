"White Boyz" has a good premise with the concept of white suburbans that are enticed by the ghetto lifestyle. The story and characters are under developed and loses pacing with the music videos and day dream fantasies. The acting of the lead is weak which makes the film fail. In addition to this the genre of it being a comedy is lost as it moves between bland serious drama with sprinkles of comedy. Almost all the scenarios in this film are serious and don't have any funny characters or light score music or songs to create a comedic tone of any kind. There has been better white boys acting black in movies like "Malibu's Most Wanted" or the character that Seth Green plays in "Can't Hardly Wait". Ultimately it was a good idea with very poor execution.
