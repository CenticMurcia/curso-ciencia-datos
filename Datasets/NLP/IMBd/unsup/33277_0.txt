Well, the title says it all; NIck is a sore looser, by some strange and uneventful coincidences, he starts to work in a psychic hospital as clerk/janitor and because of his lack of tact, gets fired after a few minutes. By coincidence, he stumbles upon a patient about to commit suicide and save her life. The nut girl decides to follow him, they hit the road and go on adventures together... to fall in love and of course, to go meet Nick's family who's very rich and where his brother and his step dad are more than scornful, you see the portrait eh?<br /><br />Seriously, this history is as exciting as if I would tell you the day I get my thumb caught in a bottle of Dr Pepper, the ONLY POSSIBLE WAY you could like this movie is if you're an hopeless romantic or have this huge crush for tacky/ultra cheesy movie. I saw it in my German class and got angrier by the mediocrity of the movie than by the fact that I struggled to understand dialogues.<br /><br />I highly suggest you not waste your precious time of your precious and short life in front of this absolutely mediocre scenario without any interests except if you love over romantic and tacky movie.
