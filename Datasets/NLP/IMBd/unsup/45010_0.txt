I am Chinese myself and this film is just embarrassing. A film that relies so heavily on special effects, and yet the effects look like something that was made in the early 90's. One scene that stood out was the scene where the girl is flying as a kite for no apparent reason but to show how beautiful the film is, and sadly they failed at that attempt. It showed how terrible and flawed the effects are. Tell me you didn't laugh when the guy is speed crawling/running through the 10000 bulls. The sets look like sets literally. There's no authenticity and what, when, and where is this story supposed to be taken place? A fairytale land? It looks half cartoon and half live action most of the time. The acting was laughable.<br /><br />Performance done by Nicholas Tse was unintentionally funny. Do we really need an evil villain that speaks like a gay man and yet is pseudo-straight that wants to have sex with a woman? He acted like he was in another movie, and perhaps it might be better if he just go on and make a movie of his own. Cecilia Cheung, all I remember from the film is her infamous line- "Do you want to see what's underneath?" One dimensional character that is supposed to gain our sympathy and yet she failed to engage the audience to sympathize with her. I am not going to go into the other characters, the guys in the black feather cape is terrible as well.<br /><br />This film is basically scenes slapped together hoping to pass as art, but most of the "artistic" scenes turned out to be hilariously funny. A film with no substance trying to trick western viewers, but people are smarter than they think
