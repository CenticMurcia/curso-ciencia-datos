Here's the scenario: Futuristic company limits couples to only one child, and any past that become property of the company. Any violators of this law are sent to a seemingly inescapable prison. One couple dares to violate this law and is sent to prison, and thus conflict ensues. If you're anything like me, you're probably thinking this movie is going to rank right up there with Super Mario Brothers as far as sci-fi movies go, but I actually enjoyed this one. This movie manages to avoid the cheesy unrealistic costumes and weapons that plague far too many sci-fi movies, and it also produces characters that you start to sympathize with. By coupling an interesting plot with somewhat decent acting, Fortress deserves at least a saturday afternoon rental, that is if nothing more exciting is going on.
