First of all I wouldn't bother spelling the title because for 1 thing I don't actually know how to spell it; "Surburben Girl?" and for another I haven't got the faintest idea of what is actually means!? So anyway I got the chance to watch this film last night and after seeing the trailer I basically presumed that it was going to be another one of those rom-coms. On the mix of plus/down sides it wasn't, it wasn't even funny either, to be honest this film has no genre at all which is quite weird. On the down side I'm seeing absolutely nothing come out of tin. Nothing. The performances, the energy, the figure of this movie, nothing. And not to mention there was no doubt that is film is abysmally boring and dull. Even the plot was quite confusing let me say the pace at the start of this movie is very fast. After 2-5 minutes onwards the film the girl already met the guy and became close friends and after 10 minutes or so they kissed and slept with each other?! Talk about fast! And throughout the movie I was bored, yawning and just wanted stop watching this bore! But I figured I take a chance on this film but that still didn't work. So yeah that isn't a good sign. But overall this film has it moments but that does not change everything like I said there was NO DOUBT that this film is boring dull confusing and delivers no energy. A disappointment.<br /><br />****/********** <br /><br />(4/10 stars) <br /><br />~Kalendra
