I will not write a lot about the story since so much is already said in the preceding comments. However I will tell how I came to watch it. <br /><br />It was very late one weekday night and the rest of the family had gone to bed. I was dead tired and just about to turn off the TV - and there was this film, All Or Nothing, about to begin in one of the two non-commercial public service channels (which might be one explanation why it transfixed me - no interruptions with inane requests to buy anti-wrinkle cream). And I was just completely enthralled! I was dreadfully tired, my eyes were red and swollen from exhaustion but I just couldn't stop watching. When the movie was finished at around two o'clock my eyes were also red and swollen from crying - and yet I was completely sober and so unprepared for this absolutely gripping film experience with the most wonderful actors. One of the best ever!
