By far one of the most boring horror movies in history. Two parapsychologists move into a haunted house. They cant have sex because the guy keeps getting attacked by a ghost. Dwell on this for 90 minutes. Throw in one of the most predictable plot twists in history and show the key moment in the film on the back of the box. Stir with bad acting and you have Knocking on Death's Door! I can honestly say there is absolutely nothing original in this movie. The fact that this movie is rated 3.9 absolutely astounds me. A boring waste of time. I paid 2 bucks for this movie at a going out of business sale. I can imagine the store's clerk broke into riotous laughter after he unloaded this bomb.
