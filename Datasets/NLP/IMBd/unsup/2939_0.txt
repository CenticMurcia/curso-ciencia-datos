Major props to Rob Rugan and Mike Benson for making this movie happen. I hope that viewers out here can appreciate "Hide and Creep" for what it is. For starters, don't prepare yourself for a spine tingling horror epic. "Hide and Creep" is unexpectedly hilarious. With their local approach (great, authentic southern accents), dry humor, and skillful editing--Rugan and Benson have the makings of a cult classic.<br /><br />I think its great that the SciFi channel premiered this movie, and I cant wait for the sequel. <br /><br />In the future, I'd like to see more with the actor who plays the bullet biting zombie in the police station--great scene.
