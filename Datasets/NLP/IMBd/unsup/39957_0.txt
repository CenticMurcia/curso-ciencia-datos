I just watched Impact Earth and was really surprised to see that Dublin, the capital city of my fair country, has moved! Yes, you heard me Dublin has relocated to the North of Ireland and is now roughly where Belfast is. (Maybe Miss South Carolina was the geography consultant on this movie?) As if that isn't bad enough the Irish 'science' people in this movie are from Queens College Dublin. Note to the writer/director/producer - many Irish people are a bit tetchy about the subject of the British monarchy and would really not appreciate our main educational institution named after their queen. Folks maybe before your next movie you might check out the geographic and socio-political facts, eh?
