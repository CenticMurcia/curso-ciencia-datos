All I have to say is that "Life Is Worth Losing", if you had to sit through George Carlin's new stand up. I am a huge fan of his past HBO stand up's but this one made me go to sleep. He has just lost his touch, it's a shame what rehab will do to you. The comedy was really just not there, the delivery was not sharp, stuttering over lines, reading of cues, just not Carlin humor. Yes the show had it's up's, but very few, and none of them where worth repeating the next day. I hope this new clean cut Carlin takes a drink and a couple pills, because this is not the guy that gave us such great stand up's as, "You are all Diseased", "Complaints and Grievances", "Jammin' In New York", "Doing It Again". George, please give us the old pi**ed off, grumpy Carlin that everybody loves.
