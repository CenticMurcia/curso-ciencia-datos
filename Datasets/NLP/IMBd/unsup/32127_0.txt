I think most of the reviews previously entered on IMDb were placed by he cast crew or Anna Biller herself. This was the longest 120 minute film I have ever seen. Anna Biller seems to have some talent as a production designer but as an actor, director, writer or editor she is severely lacking. She seems to suffer from the often seen LA role as the spoiled daughter of a rich family who makes bad film and no one wants to tell her she is without talent.<br /><br />This film was entered into dozens of film festivals and didn't win any awards, OK maybe one. I hope Anna will recognize her limitations and go back to painting.
