What a waste of talent and cinematography. I saw the DVD version and the photography and setting was great; very crisp and rich. The casting was fine and the script was a proven one. Must have been really bad direction?? Car chases were fine, but I especially enjoyed the one in the Christmas tree lot! I thought it also kind of totally fell apart in the last 1/3
