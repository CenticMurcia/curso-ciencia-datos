The Wraith is a fairly typical mid-1980s teen movie, with the twist of a revenge-seeking ghost. It's kinda neat seeing the bad guys get their due, and it has a nice happy ending.<br /><br />But who really cares about any of this...? The movie has Sherilyn Fenn in it - - 'nuff said. She's great (as usual), and Charlie Sheen is alright as well. Highly recommended, but mostly just for Fenn fans.<br /><br />Score: 7
