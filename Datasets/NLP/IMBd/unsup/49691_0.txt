I admire the acting skills of Drew Barrymore and Jessica Lange, but I was disappointed by the uninteresting story, which I'd sum up as "Pampered socialite mother and daughter see themselves as victims of the Depression and are too passive to take care of themselves. Lacking servants, they are forced to become self-pitying, smelly cat ladies with an appetite for publicity." I wonder if this film would ever have been made if they had not been related to Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy.<br /><br />The Edie's are boring characters with no gumption or insight or curiosity. Even great actors cannot make them interesting, only pitiable. It might have been a dramatic story if they had made an effort to clean up their own squalor or, (horror of horrors!) get jobs like ordinary people and create a new life, instead of waiting to be rescued.<br /><br />The music, costumes and sets were great.
