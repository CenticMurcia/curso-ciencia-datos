This was just weird Maybe something got wrong when they transformed it from play to manuscript for this didn't work at all. Everybody just<br /><br />acts weird, and I am not sure if it was the characters <br /><br />that were stoned or the script writer/director...<br /><br />crap 2/10<br /><br />watched it once, giving away the DVD...<br /><br />and Guy Pearce: What is he trying to do? A nerve damaged weirdo or a drug addict?<br /><br />want 10 lines 10 lines of text I am singing in the rain just singing in the rain what do you want to use these crappy rules for ?<br /><br />Short comments should be OK too, especially for crappy movies
