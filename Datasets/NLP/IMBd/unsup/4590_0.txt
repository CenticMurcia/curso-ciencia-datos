As it is with most brilliant, potent, abstract pieces of work - the "meaning" is in the eyes of the beholder.<br /><br />So what did I see? Well - I read what other people had to say, and I think what I saw was a lot scarier than most.<br /><br />This is a movie about time, I think - and how slippery it is. We are forced, as viewers, to dissect what time is, and how it relates to film (cameras). The camera zooms in and out, isolating the narrator - making him look alien and organic at the same time. Every time he said the word death, my heart skipped a beat. After all, just as the Aged Actor who forms the center-piece of the film explains to us, film is time, and time is death.<br /><br />This is a movie about birth and death. The old Actor (Narrator) personifies the camera - almost making it out to be a tinkering toy and a monstrous beast at the same time. I think this is a movie about isolation as well - you feel isolated watching it - you start to look at yourself and your "time". There is also the isolation of old and yough, and the gap of understanding.<br /><br />And the end is the ultimate punch - where I think, if you look close enough you can actually catch the darkness between the frames (As they flick by at mindnumbing speeds) where death waits...<br /><br />So that's my take on it.<br /><br />I don't want to give too much away - you just have to watch it. It's very short, only like 6 and a half minutes long, but it hits you in the stomach like a truck and stays with you.<br /><br />In case your having trouble finding this movie, let me tell you that I couldn't find it anywhere for purchase, but I did find a low-res version of it on google video.<br /><br />Later I found out that it's an extra on the Criterion Collection version of Videodrome - so now I have to buy that.<br /><br />Later folks! -jay
