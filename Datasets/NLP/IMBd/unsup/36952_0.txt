I couldn't sit through this. The dialogue between Prinze and Forlani was brutal. I didn't make it to the end so I will give this a 3. I'm sure if I kept watching it could have become a rare 1. No adult could possibly enjoy this. I guess if you're a teen you may find this cute. I was physically attracted to Forlani before this role. Her lines were so annoying that I have seriously lost all of my attraction. That takes a lot my friends. PAINFUL!!!
