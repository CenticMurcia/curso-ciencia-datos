What I wanna know is - Errol Flynn was too busy to make this movie, right? This seemed like an ideal vehicle for him to shine in. He definitely woulda brought Francois Villon a lot of life. Okay, well, he wasn't in it, Ronald Colman was. And he did a fine job. An even finer job was done by Basil Rathbone as the cackling, humorous king. Eccentric indeed. Before watching this I had no idea Preston Sturges was the writer. It was great to see his name. I knew immediately that I was in for potentially something special. Oh, how this could have been just a mediocre movie or even a flop but it was enjoyable all the way through. One thing that did irk me was the accents of the characters. Was even one French? Uh, I don't think so. British and American. American! I know this is a small thing but I noticed it constantly and I didn't like it one bit. I guess back then no one invented the occupation of voice coach? What a shame. That and knowing what Errol Flynn could have given this movie brought it down for me a little bit. Still, I'd watch again and might buy the DVD one of these days... speaking of which, I know companies are slow in releasing older movies onto DVD but if you're reading this, which I highly doubt you are, do not leave this title out! My grade for this very fine movie: A-
