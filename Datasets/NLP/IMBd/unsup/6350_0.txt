This is not a review of the film.This is a spoiler.Haha.To begin with...well,let me just say that Dracula can't beat Frankenstein's Monster.The original monster has the combined strength of a 100 men and,as we all know,he's INDESTRUCTIBLE!But Al didn't know that and obviously he was a Dracula fan.So,the monster became an "artificially created man" which was torn apart in the end by Dracula.If Boris Karloff was in that forest,in which the "final battle" takes place,he would have pounded them BOTH into oblivion.But fear not Frankenstein fans!There are other films(not to mention comic books)in which the monster defeats the "lord of the manner of Corpathia".If you are a Dracula fan,then enjoy this.You will never see Dracula defeating the "monster" again.But If you are a Frankenstein fan,then please avoid it.
