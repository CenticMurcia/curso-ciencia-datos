Taxidermia will shock, upset, disturb and make nauseous all but the most sturdy and unflappable cinema viewer. However, it will also make you laugh, smirk, and smile. It does the whole spectrum of emotions as you are taken from through three generations of a family with varying degrees of humanity and all with a similar obsessions over flesh (be it sexual, personal, that of others, etc).<br /><br />I cannot vouch that it will be a revelation to all, and some will see it as very base cinema, but I think you need to look beyond the excess, and take it with a pinch of salt.<br /><br />It is superb production, it is at the very height of tastefulness and tastelessness, but pulled together so effortlessly and seamlessly.<br /><br />More please!!!
