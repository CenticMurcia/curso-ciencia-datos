Many times I have viewed this film over the years mainly because I am a big fan of Sandy Dennis, (Gwen Kelleman) who plays the role of a wife from Ohio and her husband, George Kelleman, (Jack Lemmon) who wants to go to New York City for a job position that George would like to have and they encounter many problems that they never expected. This couple find themselves having to sleep in Central Park and are robbed of everything they have and there is plenty more situations that they are faced with. In the beginning of this film Sandy Dennis and Jack Lemmon were flying in from Ohio and landing in a real airport on Long Island MacArthur Airport in Ronkonkoma, New York where I actually worked at the Army Aviation Support Facility #1. It was great seeing this entire scene of great movie stars being filmed at this New York Airport. It is a great shame that Sandy Dennis had a very short life which cancer overpowered her, she gave a great performance.
