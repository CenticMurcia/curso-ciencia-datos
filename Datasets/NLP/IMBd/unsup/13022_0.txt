Being a Charlton Heston fan (as a result of the first two PLANET OF THE APES films), I found myself first in line the Wednesday THE OMEGA MAN opened. The newspaper ads had looked spooky: Chuck, armed with a machine gun, was firing into surrounding darkness. "The last man on Earth," the copy read, "...Is not alone!" So, there I was, snatching up a couple of the freebies laid on the concession counter- mock-up newspapers featuring NEWS FROM THE END OF THE WORLD! There were black and white shots from the movie. I was hooked. The movie itself was a mixed bag, even then. The last man on Earth wasn't exactly alone, after all... Nor did he have to do his own stunts... Still, the movie was great, if for no other reason than Charlton Heston's performance. That was 1971... <br /><br />Three decades later, while it's definitely dated, it's still an entertaining movie to watch. Vastly inferior to the novel upon which it is loosely based (Richard Matheson's brilliant I AM LEGEND, adapted by the Corringtons, the husband and wife team who also gave us the abyssmal BATTLE FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES), it nonetheless holds up as a good SF shocker STILL notable for Heston's performance. (One can only imagine what could've been wrought had they opted to do the novel the justice it deserves.) This was the second time around for I AM LEGEND; perhaps the third time will be the charm...
