I haven't played the sequel "Baldur's Gate II - Shadows of Amn" yet, which is said to be even better, but Baldur's Gate is definitely one of the best RPGs of recent times. The storyline is great and there are so many subplots and quests that you can't count them. Of all the games I've played Baldur's Gate is the one that comes closest to the quality of Ultima VII which I consider to be the best RPG of all time.
