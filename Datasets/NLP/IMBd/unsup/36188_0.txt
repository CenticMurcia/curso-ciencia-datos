A fan of the first film and the novel that preceded this, I did not expect much from this film as neither the author of the book or director of the film was on board for this "sequel", let alone cast. On a lark, I taped it off HBO so it did not cost any $$ and tried to be understanding and treat it as a "B" movie, hoping for laughs. No such luck. The film is a poorly written attempt at black comedy, like someone wanted ot combine "Election" with "American Psycho" but came up<br /><br />with what would be an insult to the "Devil in the Flesh" movies it more closely resembles. I apologize for being mean, but it's a bad idea to have a voice-over narrative when your actress has a terrible lisp. (and can't act). Anyone who was involved in this film should take year off to carefully evaluate what they are doing with their careers and why they wanted to be in the entertainment<br /><br />business.
