I thought Robin Williams was careful on how he picked a film role, but sometimes even the best can make mistakes. This movie was a huge mistake, although Robin Williams managed to slip by with a few chuckles, but I realized his humor only works if he plays off other interesting characters around him. License to Wed does not have any. The story starts with Sadie(Mandy Moore) and Ben(John Krasinski), a couple who are so much in love, and really want to get married, but Reverned Frank(Robin Williams) wants to put them through series of crazy tests, in order to prove there love for another. The big problem for me is, it was not funny one bit, with the exception of Robin Williams, the rest of the film was kind of depressing. Mainly because of the Sadie and Ben character, there a little bit funny in the beginning, but there humor just quickly vanishes. The poor Ben character just comes across a likable schmo, who takes it, but when he dishes it, everybody looks at him like he shouldn't have done that. And the Sadie character is annoying cause spends the most of the movie belittling Ben, and she doesn't even realize she's doing it. Wasn't American Dreamz(2006) enough of a humiliation for Mandy Moore. Only Robin Williams makes this movie memorable.
