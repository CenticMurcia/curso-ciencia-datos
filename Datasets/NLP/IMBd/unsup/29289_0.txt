Let me start out by saying that I enjoy a good urban movie, even those stereotype ones with lousy humor and stuff. This piece of, well you name it, is so horrific, it should be banned from all places. Or it should be used in colleges to show how NOT to make a movie or act in it.<br /><br />The acting is horrendous, the only good and funny things are the two drunks and the short fellow with the odd face (Black Zeus' sidekick), they are hilarious. <br /><br />The rest of the crew, well, they act like they've never acted before (and after this flick, probably never will again), the chairs and tables in this movie act better than the actors! If I wanted to see people reading cue cards or acting like they were wooden puppets, I'd play The Sims. That would be a less waste of time than this.<br /><br />I like Trina and her phat tracks, but girl, stick to rapping and leave the acting to people more qualified than yourself.
