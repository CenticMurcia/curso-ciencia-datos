John Krasinski alone, cannot save this movie from being one of the worst of the year. It also reassures me that Mandy Moore can't act and Robin Williams can't seem to stop being an annoying asshole in every role he plays. <br /><br />In Linsence To Wed, Ben and Sadie (Krasinski and Moore) plan to get married at her childhood church. Before they can get married there, they have to complete a series of tests. This movie is just another predictable, stupid, and a hardly funny comedy. <br /><br />Also, the only humour in this movie is either slapstick or plain stupid jokes. Basically, this movie is a bust, don't see it, you'll be very disappointed, its just another horrible excuse for a romantic comedy. I did not enjoy this movie at all.
