Bob Hoskins is a tough as nails gangster in The Long Good Friday, a British gangster movie set in 1970's London. Its funny reading that the studio tried to dub over Hoskins dialogue because they feared American audiences wouldn't understand it. I had a problem understanding that strong Cockney accent. He talked very fast and had a really strong accent - but that added to his persona as the tough gangster.<br /><br />Hoskins is Harold Shand, top gangster of London who is trying to secure a big deal with the mafia. Unfortunately, on the day they visit, his top lieutenants are killed and his casino bombed. It looks like the mafia may back out of the deal, so he goes on the warpath to find out who is targeting his organization.<br /><br />The movie has a gritty feel to it and the genuine Brit gangster look is helped by copious amounts of violence and Hoskins build, voice and manner. The dialogue is quite funny (especially the last scene with the mafia guys). Helen Mirren is quite sexy in her supporting role and their is a young assassin in this movie who would go on to much greater success as James Bond.
