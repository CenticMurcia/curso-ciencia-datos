When I saw the trailer of the movie I wanted to watch it. The idea, the setting sounded interesting. But when I watched it, it felt that there was not much more in it than I had already seen in the trailer. Probably a person who is more shocked by the idea that someone is working in the sex business can appreciate it more fully. The film has its moments, but it has much more lengths. To me the reaction of her son to what she had done to save the live of his own son was a bit over the top. The other characters are developed rather nicely. But there was not enough density for a full length feature movie. In the sex club where she is working they seem to have only one song playing over and over again. And that is systematic for the movie. There is not enough change in it to get me hooked.
