Are these comments real? Seriously? Now I know why there are so many crappy movies and TV shows out there. Most of these posters must have been high on something.<br /><br />I watched this pilot with two other friends and we all agreed that it was horrible. Everything bad that could be put into a pilot was here. Every cliché was in full force.<br /><br />The writing was horrible. The directing was horrible. The entire story was horrible.<br /><br />It's not even hard to back up my position. I know nothing about Aquaman, really, so I went into it with an open mind. It didn't matter if anything was changed because I didn't care. Here are some points:<br /><br />-- The narration in the beginning was silly. Just get into he story already. Let the audience THINK instead of being hand fed everything. <br /><br />-- Ving Raymes' character was ridiculous. His nickname should have been Exposition. What happened to unearthing backstory through action and bits of dialogue here and there? I guess that isn't needed when a menacing Ving Raymes can say choice bits like "A storm is coming" or whatever the heck he said. All of his dialogue was so on the nose, it isn't funny. <br /><br />-- A.C. tells his "gal pal" that he can talk to fish. Let me repeat this ... he tells her that HE ... CAN ... TALK ... TO ... FISH. Her reaction? It barely fazed her. She just went along with her day. And then later, he tells her about Atlantis or the sirens, something incredible, and she has the same reaction. Where were these kinds of girls when I was in college? They'll believe anything.<br /><br />-- A.C. scoffs at the idea of Atlantis and pretty much everything else. This guy can breathe underwater and swim at the speed of a jet and he thinks Atlantis is too fantastic? Compare this to Clark being told that he's an alien ... an ALIEN ... and compare how they each reacted.<br /><br />-- I don't want to pick on the FX, because I'm sure they weren't finished. But the flapping his body thing looked stupid. Yeah, I get it, he's swimming like a fish, but it looked dumb at that speed. Does Clark flap his arms like a bird when he flies?<br /><br />-- The one cool thing was when they killed the girl. But, oh not, wait ... she survived. So not only is our show terrible, we have no guts to do something out of the ordinary. Like I said, cliché.<br /><br />That's just a few things off the top of my head. There was nothing redeeming about this pilot, and it would have been an embarrassment to CW. I give them a lot of credit for having the guts not to put it on the air despite being created by the creators of Smallville. <br /><br />I am amazed by how bad this was. Don't writers know anything about quality anymore? This is stuff that I learned to avoid in my first creative writing class. I can't believe that someone high up in the production didn't say "You know, this is real crap." They should be embarrassed to be a part of it, I'm sad to say.<br /><br />And don't come back and say "Yeah, but it was a pilot." If anything, a pilot should stand out. Check out the pilots for Angel, Firefly, Lost, and Rescue Me, just to name a few. Those all set up stories that would be fleshed out later, and they were all good. I can understand being easy on a pilot, but not when it is this bad.<br /><br />But please don't avoid downloading the pilot. Get some friends together, order pizza, have some drinks, and try to count how many times they repeat plot points that have already been stated. Or how many times A.C.'s hair comes out perfectly mussed up after being in the water.
