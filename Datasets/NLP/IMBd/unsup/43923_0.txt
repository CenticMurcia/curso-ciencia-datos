Boy oh boy this movie disappointed me a lot. Let me go over the cons which are a lot. The movie and the story is way to slow with barely any action involved and this is under the action section? The acting IMO wasn't that good at all and i like Colin Farrell. Pretty much the main stuff that makes this a bad movie is that it's too slow and the story is as well and doesn't make sense at all. It's it jumped from another area to the area with no detail explanation on the drugs other than the ending which is probably my favorite part but still that is not enough. So if i were you i would avoid this movie at all costs, even on free rental day. The only pro is the ending but that's it.
