It's a bit unusual seeing Dean Martin play the part of a villain, especially having been a regular viewer of his variety show back in the 1960's. I couldn't help thinking that any minute he would enter the Ace Deuce, hop up on a piano and start belting out 'That's Amore'. There was at least one similarity to Martin's weekly show with the presence of a gorgeous blonde babe hanging around. No, not Jean Simmons, but that saloon girl Claire (Carol Andreson), who if I had to bet, would probably have shown up on one of his shows as well.<br /><br />Actually, Martin handled the role of a heavy pretty well, but I kept wondering if the movie might have been better served with Dino and George Peppard switching roles. The casting of Slim Pickens as Alex Flood's (Martin) top henchman also seemed to go against the grain. I mean, can you picture Andy Devine as a bad guy, or Smiley Burnette, or Chill Wills, or ..., well you get the idea. But at least Pickens took the role and ran with it, nasty bull whip and all.<br /><br />As for Peppard, he becomes the reluctant hero after Flood pushes all the right buttons, and especially when he makes the move on Molly Lang's (Simmons) stagecoach business. Martin's character makes it a point to own fifty one percent of every enterprise in Jericho, but you know, I kept wondering why he allowed the 4 Aces Saloon to operate in town; it didn't seem like Jericho was all that big.<br /><br />Hey, can you beat those medical fees back in the 1800's? For fixing up a gunshot wound in old Ben Hickman (John McIntire) the Doc charges just a dollar! Kind of makes you wonder how much it cost to go to med school. Too bad Hickman didn't make it to the end of the picture, I kind of liked his deliberate, methodical style.<br /><br />Of course the ending is never in question, the fun is in watching how the good guy plan separates Flood's gang of outlaws so they can narrow the odds. The one thing I would have allowed for earlier in the story would be showing Peppard's character and his prowess with a knife. As it is, the way Dolan took out Flood made me sit up and ask, 'where did that come from'?
