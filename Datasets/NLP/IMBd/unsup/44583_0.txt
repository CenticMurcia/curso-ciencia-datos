Young girls between 14 and 17 are falling into a coma and dying. When they wake up they are flesh eating zombies called Stacys. Weird gore horror comedy social commentary that never quite comes together. Its too gross (blood goes everywhere), too knowing (the zombie fighters are called Romeros, a chainsaw is a Campbell) and too odd ball to ever really have a shot at any audience. Give the film points for trying, but the low brow humor mixed with not very pointed social commentary doesn't seem to go anywhere. I won't even mention how the blood and guts quickly become too much to take. I had read a couple pieces that invested the film with some great purpose and meaning, I never saw it in the sea of severed limbs and chainsawed faces. If you like blood and guts try it, but I'd steer clear.
