*SPOILERS!!!!!!* (but then, who'd care with this!)<br /><br />I bought this title for a relative as a joke present, keeping the 50p price tag on it. Little did I realize how bad it was, and they insisted, in the most sarcastic fashion, that i should view it too. Oh dear...<br /><br />The best bit of this film is the opening sequence, loosely tying it in as a sequel to another film which appears to have nothing to do with this one! It offers a couple of inept chuckles, but the fun stops there.<br /><br />I cannot find a single redeeming feature in this film. There are no campy moments, there aren't even any moments of unintentional laughter, it really is that bad!<br /><br />There is no excitement, the script is cringingly embarrassing (there are some truly poor attempts too add some mysticism by reading 'The Jabberwocky') And the monsters look awful. The plot is non-existent, and there are huge swathes of the film that involve nothing but people walking across bits of scrub land, with some terrible keyboard music.<br /><br />This is a terrible film, don't see it. It's not funny, scary, camp, pornographic, exciting, or entertaining in any way, shape or form.
