I never thought while watching this film, and the alternate version by Soderbergh, that the daughter never existed. Keane shows enough humanity and normality from time to time to make me think he doesn't have schizophrenia and has just been temporarily unhinged by the loss of his little girl, which, considering his own responsibility, would drive many off the edge.<br /><br />It seems to me that by re-enacting the tragedy, with the neighbor's little girl and at the scene, Keane makes the first step toward recovery. Seeing that Kira is okay will replace the image in Keane's mind, or at least partially replace the image, of his own daughter disappearing, and allow the healing process to begin. What happens next is another matter, and I don't want to get too rosy about it. Perhaps Keane doesn't have the necessary strength of character, which may be what got him in trouble in the first place. But this is what turns this film into literature, that the protagonist undergoes a great change during a crucible experience. He's not quite the same guy at the end that he was at the beginning.<br /><br />This is a wonderful movie, crafted carefully enough to maintain interest and suspense even without heavy action and violence, and absolutely filled with humanity.<br /><br />Incidentally, I thought the submitted version was better than Soderbergh's variation, and I hope readers of these comments will forgive me for this heresy.
