if you need a laugh, there are better ways to get it. Paris Hilton (while stupid) is no dummy when it comes to money.<br /><br />She laughs all the way to the bank while audiences in America continue to watch this. Nicole Ritchie at least added some edge, now she is gone from the show.<br /><br />Send a message to Paris, don't buy her products or tune in. Trash like this is worse than "The Apprentice" because it has six year old kids, tuning in and thinking its "cool". Yeah, it's cool to make fun of people 24/7. That will help them a lot when they get out in the real world, and think that having a pink cell phone and Vuitton handbag will equip them for reality. One star for Nicole.
