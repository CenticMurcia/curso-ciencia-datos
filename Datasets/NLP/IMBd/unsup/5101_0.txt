Amitabh Bachchan is a fantastic actor. Him and Sharukh Khan are known as the Bollywood kings. Nearly every film that Amitabh Bachchan comes in I give it either 9 out of 10, or 10 out of 10 like Naseeb, Coolie, Amar, Akbar, Anthony, Mard and a lot of other films. Amar, Akbar, Anthony is about 3 brothers who are left by their Mum with their Dad and they all get separated while they are children. Amar is found by a Indian and is grown to be an Indian.<br /><br />Akbar is found by a Muslim and is grown to be a Muslim.<br /><br />Anthony is found by a Christian and is grown to be a Christian and at the end the family including the mother all find each other.<br /><br />I loved the storyline and the fighting too.
