The previous poster had a real disdain for this movie because it was superficial and insulting and not considered 'art'. He then goes on to insult the director and the writer and that's when I stopped reading. The intent of movies like Eating Out and this superior sequel is to entertain and tittilate. It's not even considered a 'no-brainer' because there is actually a lot of wit packed into the screenplay. Why on earth would someone expect anything less from a film title 'Eating Out' in the first place? Give me a break! This movie is sexy, funny, offensive and silly. Exactly what what we should expect. What we SHOULDN'T expect is the wonderful comedic performances from the cast especially from Rebekah Kochan as sex pot Tiffani and American Idol castoff Jim Verraros (who is way too cute to be playing the 'average' guy). The only thing that saved this film from getting a perfect score from me was the running time was much too short, perhaps when they release the DVD they could give us a director's cut of more Tiffani and more gratuitous nudity by the terrific looking Marco Dapper and Brett Chuckerman!
