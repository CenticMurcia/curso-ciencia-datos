I could only watch the first 1 hour. Jennifer Fox has made junior high school girls look smarter than her. Come on, 42 years old, living in New York and behaving like it's your first crush. In these films she is clueless, and comes off very immature and childish. However, there are a few of her friends, who I say bravo too, through illness and divorce they show great courage, however somehow the films doesn't portray bravery and courage, it documents how little women have grown. Jennifer narrates the film and it is totally about her failure at love, it is easy to understand why she is not successful. All this giggling and laughing... Come on, grow up. It is a disappointment to see a women who is obviously talented still obsessed about having a man. Her lover lives in Africa and is married... I think that is all you need to know. She spends the entire movie agonizing over this. She visits all her friends and most of them are just as clueless. I was astonished , in disbelief she actually produced this film and thought that it told a relevant story.
