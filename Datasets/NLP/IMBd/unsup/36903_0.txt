Simuland misses the point me thinks. 'K tries to add to the Bible' but fails! In an interview with Kieslowski, he tells a young student of film, that he wasn't trying to moralise but to ethicise, as moralism is too monolithic and closes down dialogue. He felt that to move to an ethical stance, it opened up a dialogue with the viewers. This I don't think is an attempt to add to the Bible, but in truth registers the fact that the trace of history - to allude to Ricoeur - is such that we have to realise that this is a different age. And Biblically of course a different dispensation, having moved from Law to Grace. Not that I'm a theologian, so hey shoot me before it happens! Nor do I think it peters out. It stands as a 'tour de force' in film-making, which rejects the temptation to moralise and tub-thump and is wonderfully aesthetic, allusive and after all gets us talking.<br /><br />What more can you ask for, in a film or 10?
