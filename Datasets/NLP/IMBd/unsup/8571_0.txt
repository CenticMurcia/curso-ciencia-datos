I have a question for those negative reviewers out there. WHAT WERE YOU EXPECTING? JKX is a great show and Jamie's "Brad Gluckman" character is the best. The Movie gives us some background to Brad and supplies us with some good laughs. I am sure by now you know the plot summary so I won't go there. Taye Diggs and Anthony Anderson are hilarious and steal the show. Taye's character, with his Juliard training and trying to act ghetto black gave the audience I was in some big belly laughs. The only down fall was the Brad was too sweet. When he's on the WB, he is brash and at times harsh (Jamie, where was the "Gin and Juice"). Maybe it was the PG13 rating so the whole family can see it, I don't know. All in all though he and the rest of the cast made me laugh.
