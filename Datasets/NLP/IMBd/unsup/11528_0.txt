I think it is churlish to bring up such things as slanted propaganda for a film like this, it is what it is, a firmly enjoyable romp from the comic gold of Abbott & Costello. Perhaps back in the day it was appropriate to analyze the film for it's portrayal of the soldier at war, or the fact that they didn't mention so many bad things that were happening at that time, erm hello, wake up and smell the comedy and focus on that please.<br /><br />Bud & Lou mistakenly join the army when trying to avoid arrest on the street, this sets us up for them to flip the army upside down with a series of sequences that are refreshing in what was obviously troubling times out in the big bold world. From new skits to delightful musical numbers this film stands up as one of the better entries the boys would do in there considerable output.<br /><br />Footnote:Jane Frazee has one of the most delicious smiles you could wish to see, and if you ain't tapping your feet as the splendid Andrews Sisters belt out Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy of Company B, well you are beyond help, move along please.<br /><br />8/10
