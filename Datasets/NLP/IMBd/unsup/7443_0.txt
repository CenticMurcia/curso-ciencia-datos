Smilin Through before Sleeping Through, i was really disappointed in this film it lacked character and interest. Jeanette's singing is the only thing that saved me from complete boredom. Gene Raymond didn't fit the character or the movie, Jeanette didn't have any chemistry with her husband on screen might as well have put Nelson Eddy in the film it wouldn't have been so bad to watch. All in all the songs are nice including "Drink to me only with thine eyes" it looked like she was singing that to herself instead of her loving husband if you ask me. Even Louie B Mayor said it himself " sing to him like you love him" <br /><br />she was supposed to be singing to her husband with love that shouldn't have been hard, if only she wasn't already inlove with Nelson. Jeanette always looks stunning in color and black and white films if you like Jeanette Macdonald then watch this film other then that nothing special really.
