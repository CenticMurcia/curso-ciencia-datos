Jo bole so nihaal is a movie full of Punjabi (Indian) culture! Though I must admit, Punjabi's aren't as dumbed down as shown in this movie (I myself am one :-)<br /><br />A cop looking out for a bad-guy who's framed him, Sunny Deol (Nihaal Singh) goes all guns to get 'Romeo' the villain. In fact, he goes across the globe to the US, and does things 'his way' there!<br /><br />The plot contains too many loopholes to worry about it, and the humour - though funny at times - is not well executed.<br /><br />To be fair, if you like irrational action, then this movie is for you. There's loads of beating people up, god-like heroism, and a little excess of patriotism & religious fervor.<br /><br />I'd suggest going out for a nice dinner date, rather than spending on this flick -- unless you know you have the appetite for it!
