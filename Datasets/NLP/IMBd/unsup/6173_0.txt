Thundercats was the so-called arch rival to He-man: Masters of the Universe. And yet I loved this more than He-man. The cartoon was a mixture of fantasy, sci-fi, action-adventure with a bit of humour thrown in as well. The Thundercats were made up of leader, the young but fearless Lion-O, who wielded the Sword of Omens and his compatriots, Tigra, Cheetara, Panthro and Wily Kit and Wily Kat, not to mention the lovable Snarf. Together they battled against the evil Mum-ra, of whom was the more convincing baddie, in stark contrast to Skeletor from He-man.<br /><br />Thundercats deserves full marks for being original and for having the most inventive-yet interesting characters. The animation may have been a little dodgy at times, but design-wise, they were well drawn and created. The dialogue was at times a little corny to say the least but the show also had episodes where basic morals, values and ethics were highlighted and addressed within the series.<br /><br />This was a great TV show to watch with an equally memorable theme tune to boot! Thundercats, ho!!
