"Terms of Endearment" is engrained in my brain. I know the entire movie by heart, text and all. I don't know how many times I have seen it but suffice to say its plenty. <br /><br />So when the opportunity to see the sequel arose, I must admit I was curious and hopeful. However, after ten minutes watching this became an ordeal. MacLaine brings none of Aurora's charm to this outing and all the actors around her are just as flat. A scene on an airplane between Aurora and Patsy (Miranda Richardson, inexplicably) is a total embarrassment and I can't believe MacLaine allowed it. Marion Ross as the housekeeper seems to be channeling Agnes Moorehead in "Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte", and not very well, at that. There is a moment between Nicholson and MacLaine that suggests the magic of "Terms", but that's only one moment.<br /><br />The movie has value as Ben Johnson's last appearance, but little else.
