Sinatra was OK, but Sterling Hayden was just _SO_ shallow and seemed to be rushing thru some of his scenes like he had something more important to get to. My wife and I both burst out laughing at some of the scenes. For instance, in the opening scene when the the guy asks the deputy what the name of this town is and the deputy says "Suddenly." "Suddenly what?" the guy responds, and the deputy says "No, that's the name of the town: Suddenly." I guess this was an attempt at humor, but the humorous part was when the camera pans back showing that the guy and the deputy are right underneath this huge roadside sign that says "Welcome to Suddenly."<br /><br />Maybe that scene subliminally set the tone for the rest of the movie in my mind.<br /><br />I had not checked the IMDB rating before we watched it so I was surprised that it had a 7.0 avg. rating so I'm definitely in the minority but it just didn't generate any suspense (IMHO).
