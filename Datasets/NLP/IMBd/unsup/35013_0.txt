Unbelievable tosh concerning an over-sized baby being possessed by a malicious dwarf. Yes, that really is the plot. I'd love to see this remade by the League of Gentlemen but I doubt they could make it funnier or more bizarre. This infant pushes people to their deaths, lynches his 'father' (played by Ralph Bates with a strange Italian/Scottish hybrid accent) decapitates Donald Pleasance with a shovel and has enough strength to drag his victims out of sight. Laughable dialogue and some strange accents, including one English actress being dubbed by another one, plus some comical 'special' effects make this entertaining for all the wrong reasons. Oddest of all is how so many top notch actors got involved with this drivel which could hardly have looked good even in script form. The scene where Joan Collins is touched up by a dwarf has got to be one of the most ludicrous scenes ever committed to celluloid. Hard to rate but 0/10 as horror and probably 6/10 for entertainment. As it happens I saw this just after Death Wish 3, so obviously there was a 'so bad its good' theme that evening.
