I only saw part of this movie, but I loved it. I have many ties with Jonathan Taylor Thomas (Toby) in that movie -- It, I felt was well acted, and NO I don't like the movie because it has him in it :) But I only wish I could've seen the whole thing and I don't have cable. You will like this movie if you are open minded, or dealing with sexuality in itself - for me this movie provided a sense of homage, to know that I'm not alone, even though I know I"m not but this is a step for diverse sexualities and its acceptance. Thank god it has finally made its way to film, I only wish Hollywood started it sooner.
