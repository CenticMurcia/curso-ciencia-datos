Sandra Dee gets to play the first "Gidget" (combining "Girl and Midget"). She's seems too made-up and beautiful for the role, but she acts the perkiness well. James Darren has a good role with "Moondoggie". Cliff Robertson is the "The Big Kahuna" of the beach. At different times, Ms. Dee's Gidget seems to want to: have fun, have sex, grow up, grow out, stay young, and/or learn to surf (which is not at all unusual). Most of all, Gidget wants a boyfriend.<br /><br />This film seems much more significant in hindsight; since, the Gidget character proved to be so enduring, and filmmakers discovered an audience for teenagers in swimsuits was ready for action. As a film, "Gidget" only fair, and its story is standard. I thought the most interesting part was Mr. Robertson's character - do you want him to "grow up" and leave the beach, or should he become an old beach bum? You do get an answer, at the end of the movie. Also interesting is how Robertson relates to the younger characters. The music is slight. Mr. Darren does the title song nicely (later on); and, the soundtrack often sounds like the melody to "Tammy" is about to begin. <br /><br />**** Gidget (4/10/59) Paul Wendkos ~ Sandra Dee, James Darren, Cliff Robertson, Arthur O'Connell
