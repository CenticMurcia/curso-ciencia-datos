I had the pleasure of seeing Julie Harris perform this one-woman show back in 1975 in San Diego. Then, when this video came out (as part of Great Performances on PBS)I was thrilled to see how close it was in conveying the actual stage performance. This is a must for all teachers of American literature who want their students to get a sense of Dickinson.
