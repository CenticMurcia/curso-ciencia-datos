OK, Quentin is a great director and writer. He usually has good judgment why would he want to Producer this stuff. He should have taken his time and reviewed the script. He would of known that it was smutt. He should have written a version of it get George Clooney and Julia back and get rid of Danny Trejo's character since he died in the first one and then he would of had a sequel worth seeing in the theater and not video or DVD. I would love to see another sequel to From Dusk till done just to ignore this whatever this is. You could do it Quentin. George has said he would love to play Seth again if you asked him. The original was truly a great film. The Prequel wasn't bad, but this one sucked.
