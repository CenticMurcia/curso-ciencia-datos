This is one of the worst Japanese big budget films I've run across. The plot has something to do with a project concerning Jupiter going horribly wrong and... you really don't want to know. Trust me as bad as you think some of the Godzilla movies and films like The Green Slime are, this is worse, but not in a good way.<br /><br />This is just stupid, the hippies being the last straw on a short list of reasons to watch, none of which are good. I have no idea why anyone would like this on anything but a technical level since the plot, which I've finally been able to erase from my mind only thanks to years of very expensive therapy. All I remember is that the film seemed to want to be a flower power film but was made by people who didn't know what that was and were 15 years too late.(these people couldn't plot a film even if they were handed it)<br /><br />This film was suggested to me by a friend who loves it, "saying you'll either love it or you won't, but I think you will". He was wrong.<br /><br />Trust me, there are better ways to spend two and a half hours, many much more pleasant
