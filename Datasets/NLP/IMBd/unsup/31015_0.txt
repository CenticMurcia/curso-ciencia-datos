I don't want to tire you all with a long review, there isn't a need for one with this movie. From start to finish it is embarrassing to watch, almost excruciating. Jokes fall flat, send ups of other movies have no comic moments and I seriously could see a 6th grade drama class do a better job of something like this. How this ever got released is beyond me. Why Alyson Hannigan decided to star in this movie is beyond me. Sophie Monk was the only decent actor and put on the American accent well in her first movie role (despite being cast as eye candy for the male audience). The remainder of the cast whilst possibly talented had so little to work with they would fire their agents if they ever see this trash. I saw this movie because it was free (like the rest of the cinema goers at this particular session). No one was laughing and I am sure I could hear tumbleweeds rolling through the cinema at various times. In all I counted about 4 scenes which made me laugh, I won't spoil them for you so that if you do happen to get dragged to this flick you will have some comic relief. My advice is to stay clear, well clear. Scary Movie 2 was better than this.
