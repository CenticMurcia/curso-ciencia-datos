unfortunately shows like these along the lines of American history X and romper stomper help fan the flames of hate for skinheads. in reality most skinheads are not neo-Nazis or neo-fascists. there are very few of these kinds of skinheads around and mostly referred to as boneheads. most skinheads are SHARPS (skin heads against racial prejudice) or really don't care. the funny thing about skinheads is that the subculture is from the Jamaican rude boy culture mostly a black subculture. so please just ignore this show and hopefully shows like these will go away and someone out there will finally make a non bias non ignorant show about skinheads. until then see the movie skin head attitude it's the closest you'll get to the truth through the media.
