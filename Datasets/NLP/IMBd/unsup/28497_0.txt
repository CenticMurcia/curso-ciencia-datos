Much inequity in this world that takes away any chance of survival for millions of worthy brethren, much selfishness that brings only misery and loneliness!, Appearance and how much desire to feel superior to others when it will show us we are all equal! <br /><br />At this very moment, thousands of human beings roam the streets in search of a few coins incessant to bring home food minimum. Hundreds of people walk long miles to get the scarce water that allows them to survive. Millions of workers are unemployed, from one side to another, with the gray hope that someone offered a decent job.<br /><br />When I remember the old movies, my memory goes back Umberto D, vainly trying to stop the eviction. I remember Ali and his sister Zahra, in permanent anxiety about the tennis shoes worn they share.And behold, with its immense sensitivity to the common people and humanistic lyricism that flowed constantly, also the master Akira Kurosawa was busy making a film where, for a rookie detective, your weapon becomes endowment constant goal, when it was stolen on a bus. <br /><br />Have a long way to go then, but life will put his hand to a noble and brilliant detective Satori. Not for nothing, Satori means light, flash lighting. The detective becomes for the rookie a lesson from professional full and dignified, that he may change his life forever. And for us, is an eloquent reflection of the integrity is preserved even in the toughest conditions.<br /><br />It postwar period. Japan abounds in poverty and the poorest often go into prostitution, arms smuggling and anything else that allows them to survive. It is in this environment, where the two officers began searching for the man who has just committed a crime and, perhaps, the colt has withdrawn from Murakami. <br /><br />Kurosawa gets each character has its own life, the delight in their weaknesses and their abundance, their strengths and weaknesses, as Terque and his wisdom ... thus creating a human picture that might produce this flash to be erased suddenly, but may never get that and more we are the same. <br /><br />How significant would be the big film studios, this movie promote dignified man. And every school should enable young people to access these messages. It's just a matter of method... and love for humanity. And these two are doing now needed more than ever.
