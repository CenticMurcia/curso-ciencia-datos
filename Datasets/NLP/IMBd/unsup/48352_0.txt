Okay--so this movie wasnt good--but it was better than i expected. There was a certain art to its badness--Price and Carradine seemed to enjoy themselves with whatever little they had to work with(and they should--knowing that their fees probably resulted in the producers resorting to godawful masks for the club scenes).<br /><br />The stories told were not very good---the first was lame, the second goofy, and the third..interesting--but a little weak in the ending(it was the best of the three I think). Still--the film had its moments. There was a neat use of illustrations to tell parts of one story(drawn by comic artist John Bolton I believe) and the speech by Price at the end was somewhat satirical.<br /><br />And the songs were amusingly bad--especially the performance by the singer of the second one.<br /><br />
