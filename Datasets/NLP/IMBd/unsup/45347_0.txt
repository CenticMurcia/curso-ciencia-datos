There were quotes on the cover saying stuff like "...the best zombie movie ever made!". There is no way in hell anyone (drugged, insane, undead etc), could state such at thing after seeing this "movie". Talk about false advertisement. <br /><br />I love a good horror flick and a friend of mine had rented 3 of them but we only had time to watch one. I got to choose which one. Well... That wont happen again I tell you.<br /><br />3 reasons to avoid this film at all costs:<br /><br />- Horrible horrible story/script. It has the same plot as every other zombie/living dead movie ever made, only devoid of all the interesting parts.<br /><br />- The horrible horrible 1st person photography. Reminded me of a 10-min zombie movie me and my friend did when we were 14.<br /><br />- This is not a horror movie. Its a horrible horrible movie in every possible way. <br /><br />3 questions you most certainly will ask yourself after this movie:<br /><br />- Why oh why?! - How the hell did this movie end up on a shelf in my video store? - Can I please have that 1 hour and 15 mins of my life back? <br /><br />(note: Why does IMDb "name" a 1 rating as only "awful"? Giving this movie a 1 is therefor almost an insult to all the awful movies out there.)
