I was swept away by the vision and the overall mood of the film. Stephen Angus' slightly sinister, slightly angelic performance literally sent chills up my spine! Timothy Burke was very believable as the man who had nothing to lose. The acting of the Dog, played by Bibo, was stunning, especially when you know that she has received NO formal training whatsoever (and she did indeed act, not react!). It is a shame that this film is not feature length, and therefore not available to a wider audience. I have heard that this is actually one segment of a trilogy that would be made into a feature-length film, and am eager to see what is to become of this. All in all, I'd say that everyone involved with this piece should be proud of what they have accomplished with it.
