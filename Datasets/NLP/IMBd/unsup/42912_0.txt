I just finished watching this movie on TBS and I feel sick. I have never seen a movie with such blatant proselytizing as "Starship Troopers 3: Marauder". One could argue that the Federation Network television deliberately parodies current television propaganda hypocrisy and contradiction of glorifying both extreme militarism and religion. However, the "real" parts of this movie - the parts that are NOT meant to be parodies of television propaganda - are what are most sickening of all. Specifically, the religious nut girl at the end repeating some prayer over and over, and forcing her agnostic commanding female soldier to repeat this fantasy nonsense. I have never cared less about a character as the characters in this movie - including the non-religious ones. But, that female religious soldier I actually was HOPING would become bug soup.<br /><br />In greater detail, this movie makes a horribly lame attempt to draw some kind of phony distinction between a "true" religion versus a religion based upon mind-control by bugs. But, there IS no distinction. ALL religion, ALL belief in "god" is mind control!<br /><br />The CGI effects were laughable. They were as bad as "Shark Attack 3: Megalodon". But, at least THAT movie must have cost much less to make than "ST3:M".<br /><br />The hypocrisy is never addressed of a people or species or government that glorifies fighting and killing for what you believe in such as freedom and justice (and lower taxation) but then murders a peace activist, and calls them a "terrorist", for fighting for what HE believes, such as not having a wasteful intrusive repressive government that hates freedom of speech. The murder by execution of the brave female officer who informed the black male officer of the soldiers stranded on the planet is never resolved.<br /><br />The acting, the falling down whenever a bug comes up from underground and shakes the earth a little, is pathetic.<br /><br />I kept hoping for some redeeming qualities to this movie, but they never came. So, 1 out of 10, even though it deserves a 0.
