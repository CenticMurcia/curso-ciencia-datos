Glass Trap is set in Los Angeles where Curtis (C. Thomas Howell) works as a cleaner in the posh upmarket Waldman Building where various offices are housed, it's a Saturday & the building is almost empty except for a few workers & security guards. A delivery of plants is made but it turns out that the plants are hiding an unexpected secret, they were exposed to plutonium & the Ants that were on the plants have grown to a huge size & their appetite for flesh has also increased. The Ants breed quickly & soon decide to turn the Waldman Building into their very own Ant hill, it's up to Curtis the Janitor to save the day...<br /><br />Directed by Fred Olen Ray under the pseudonym Ed Raymond this is the sort of rubbish that turns up on the Sci-Fi Channel regularly that features some sort of giant insect or animal, a few Hollywood has-beens & lots of bad CGI computer work. The plot is full of holes & character's you don't care about who make the most stupid decisions that they deserve to die. There's this odd sub-plot about some guy who has to copy a disk for some reason but we never find out why even though he knocks the cleaner out so he isn't seen & it seems to be quite important to him, the disk or it's contents are never followed up or even mentioned again. It's never explained how giant radioactive Ants manage to stay hidden in what are basically houseplants or how they breed so quickly. The whole film is full of ridiculous moments like survivors sliding across from one building to another on a telephone wire (one guy shoots a gun at an Ant while on the wire & guess what? He shoots the wire & falls to his death, that's how stupid this film is). At 90 odd minutes it goes on for ages & even a couple of embarrassing cameos can't save it.<br /><br />This being a PG rated film there's virtually no gore, there's a couple of bloody skeletons but nothing else. The whole thing has a pedestrian pace & it fails to generate any excitement or tension or scares. The Ants themselves look poor, the CGI work is terrible while the actual on-set models are so stiff & lifeless the poor actors have to jump around & roll around on the floor while holding a plastic Ant to try & create the illusion that it's attacking them, they don't & it doesn't.<br /><br />With a supposed budget of about $475,000 this was low budget & it shows with pretty bad production values. C. Thomas Howell & Martin Kove are better then this while Stella Stevens seems to be having fun & puts in a reasonable performance.<br /><br />Glass Trap is a really bad creature feature like the ones that turn up on the Sci-Fi Channel all the time but without any gore & an even lamer plot & killer giant creature than usual. There are much better creature features out there, you have been warned.
