This Is No Joke They're Bringing Back The Series THIS YEAR. I Love The Show I Have Seen Every Episode & Every Movie This TV Series Is The Best Animated Show On Fox (I Have Not Seen 'Cleveland'(Don't Want To) Or 'American Dad' (Again Don't Want To)) I Firmly Hope That They Don't Do What They Did With Family Guy (Better Known To Me As 'Family Crap'). Fry Is An Idiotic Nobody Who Gets Frozen In The Year 1999(New Years Eve) For 1000 Years. He Wakes Up In The Year 2999 (New Years Eve) & Joins The Crew Of Planet Express With Leela A Cyclops, Captain, Active At Any Time, Wants To See Her Parents(& Soes In Season 4). Bender An Alcaholic Abusive Smoking Lazy Robot. Hermes A Boring Finance Manager(Or Whatever It Is). Professor A Senil Old Man Who Runs The Company. Dr Zoidberg A Lobster Doctor Which Doesn't Know Anything About Human Anatomy & Finally Amy Wong A Dumb Chinese Woman. Youj Put The Characters Together You Get A Funny Animated Show WTF Was Fox Thinking When They Cancelled It It Was A Great Show Better Than Some Of The Crap That Fox Keeps When They Transfered HIMYM I Stopped Watching Fox & I Hope They Keep The Original Funny Series That Got Cancelled. All In All A Very Funny Series That Is Worth Watching.
