What do you get when the first 5 minutes of a film has a guy kill somebody with a carrot, and proceed to deliver a baby in the middle of a shoot out while constantly dishing out one liners that are nothing short of snappy-as-hell? You get 'Shoot "Em Up", a movie with a plot that doesn't make much sense and characters who couldn't carry out a conversation to save their life but can somehow always come up with Tarantinoesque one liners at any given moment. As I said, the plot doesn't make much sense, but it basically follows Clive Owen trying to save the baby he rescues after its mother dies giving birth in the middle of a shoot out, while protecting it from the evil Paul Giamatti and his henchmen. What "Shoot 'Em Up" does is take every clich√© from every action movie of the past thirty years and make it something totally original, off the wall and impossible to dislike (unless, of course, the violence is too much for you). And it is incredible violent, but on a completely comic book level, and it is actually quite well crafted. The director does seem to know what he's doing, as he takes scenes that have been used in many action movies in the past, and brings them to the next level. Take one scene for example, when Clive Owen's Mr. Smith is having sex with the beautiful Monica Belluci, and right in the middle of it, the bad guys come in. A normal action scene would have him proceed to throw her down, pull out his gun, kill all the bad guys, and get dressed. Here, he pulls out his gun and kills all the bad guys, while still having sex with Belluci. So you see, things are done differently here, and we even have a few questions answered. At another point, One of the main bad guys is talking to Mr. Smith and says, "You know, we weren't really trying to kill you, we just wanted to scare you into surrendering." And Mr. Smith responds, "That explains why your aim is so bad." Now it all makes sense.
