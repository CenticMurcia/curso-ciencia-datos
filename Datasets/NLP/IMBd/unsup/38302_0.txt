After seeing From Dusk Till Dawn, I was looking forward to seeing the second film, I knew it had a crummy rating, but I figured to give it a shot. Who knows? I thought since it had Robert Patrick and Bruce Cambell, that it might have potential. But I just watched it and I'm hoping for that hour and a half back because this was a pretty sad movie. First off, it wasn't anywhere near as good as the first From Dusk Till Dawn film and it had a bunch of shots that the director was trying to impress people with but it ended up making the film look cheesy. The plot was just ridicules, it could have had something, but instead it was pretty stupid. I mean, who knew that vampires needed money so badly? That they too can rob banks? How did some of the characters who supposedly died in the last film come back to life? How did the strip club come back? I don't know, but this was just a bad idea.<br /><br />Buck, his brother, and his friends are in Mexico to rob a bank for millions of dollars. But when a friend of their's, Luther is running late for their meeting. His car breaks down on the road and he heads for the same club as the first film and of course is turned into a vampire and then comes back for his friends. Buck is unaware of what is to happen when his friends take him to the bank and he finds out that maybe he'd rather just go to jail then be with these blood suckers.<br /><br />From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money has extremely pointless moments, like the beginning sequence with Bruce Cambell and Tiffani Amber Thieson, it never had anything to do with the story. The acting was bad and the action wasn't really that exciting. They also kept cutting to an edit of the boys watching a porno movie, so it was like they were trying to have some sex in there the cheap way I guess. I don't know, I just really feel like my time was wasted with From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money. I'd rather just stick with the original and I suggest you do the same.<br /><br />1/10
