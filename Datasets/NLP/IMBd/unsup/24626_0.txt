First off, Jeff Goldblum is just awesome. Everything I've seen him in has been good, up to and including "The Race for the Double Helix." That being said, "War Stories" is just plain good. Good may in fact be an understatement. Sure, it isn't big on fleshing out, but it's a two hour telefilm, and like most movies, there isn't the time. We get a bit of backstory on the major characters, but the focus is more on the events that take place and how they affect the characters than understanding what makes the characters tick.<br /><br />Goldblum was the only member of the cast I recognized, but that isn't to say the others were bad. The actress who played opposite Goldblum, Lake Bell as Nora, I believe, was quite good, as were the other reporters. It was dramatic in parts, there was action, and I actually was totally uncertain of the outcome.<br /><br />Overall, "War Stories" kicked ass. It actually manages to weave a web of confusion together into a coherant, interesting story. It's one of the best made-for-tv movies I've seen in the past few years. It doesn't try to knock you over the head with a message, and it doesn't overplay any sort of 9/11 in an attempt to get pity viewership or something like that. It's just plain good.
