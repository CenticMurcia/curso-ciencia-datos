OK, some of the acting is bad and the plot is totally unbelievable...but I consider it one of Almodovar's best films. Somehow he makes the characters and situations realistic...every time I see it I totally forget how silly the basic plot is and get caught up in the story. It's to Almodovar's credit that he gets this to work. The only weak point is the acting by the leading man--he plays Victor. He is handsome, has a good body and does a nice full frontal nude shot--but he's a lousy actor. Still, it doesn't hurt the film too much. <br /><br />Beautiful direction, some really good performances and a plot full of twists and turns and absurdity. It all leads up to a happy ending. Never a dull moment! Well worth seeing. IMO, Almodovar's best movie.
