I'll stop short of calling this the worst film I've ever seen, as others have done here, but it is dreadful and, at times, insulting. I rated it two out of ten because the actor Ryan Carnes has a lot of charisma, though he isn't well-directed here. I feel sorry for the actor and the other one who's name escapes me for they are subjected to a completely gratuitous nude scene, the kind that young bimbo actresses are subjected to time and again. The plot is completely old hat, nothing new --stop me if you've heard this one before -- a straight guy pretends to be gay to impress a girl. Yes, in 2005 we're still trying to gett mileage out of that one and the perpetuation of gay stereotypes. Actually all the actors are poorly directed and as so often happens most of them overplay their scenes, hoping to milk this slight material for laughs where there aren't any real ones. Production values are non-existent, which is understandable with an indie film, but the amateurish writing and directing is inexcusable.
