The self-absorption of today's independent film industry continues with Japanese Story. So many comment-givers cited this film's departure from convention as a reason for loving it so much. Well, in my opinion, it follows convention with great fealty -- the independent film twist on love stories. You begin two people who at first don't like each other, but then grow close, but never quite fall in love. Generally, the feel is that of a romantic comedy. Then, two-thirds way into the movie, everything suddenly takes a bizarre twist. In Lost In Translation, it is Bill Murray's affair with the otherwise anonymous band singer despite refusing overtures from Scarlett Johanssen. In The Shape Of Things and Kissing Jessica Stein, one of the partners had another agenda from the start. In Chasing Amy, it's that Ben Affleck is an obsessive jerk.<br /><br />In Japanese story, a playful Toni Colette yells out "Last One In Is a rotten egg, then jumps in the water", her Japanese friend pursues her, jumps into the water, and promptly has a fatal accident. The last 35 minutes are about the mechanics she endures and the guilt and grief she feels about making arrangements for the friend's wife that she had just had an affair with to pick up the body and bring it back to Japan. That's 35 of the most dragged-out minutes in film history detailing every trivial aspect involved in getting a dead body back to Queensland, then her interaction with fellow co-workers, family, and necessary outsiders.<br /><br />This is also typical of the pretentiousness of today's independent films. Showing the mundane and seemingly inconsequential becomes the focus and is seen as genius because any hack director can have a plot written, then tell a story. After all, it takes a great independent Director to have complete disdain for storytelling in favor of glorifying either something bizarre or something mundane.
