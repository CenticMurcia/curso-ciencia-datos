I really hate this film, which is something I have never said about any other movie. I was ready to walk out on this film within the first 5 minutes. The only reason I didn't was because I had already handed over my hard earned money to see it. The story was complete rubbish, a mix of tired and unfunny spoofs of other films. Poor acting and casting decisions as well as some really bad jokes. If any film was going to kill off the spoof genre, this was going to be it. It is a great shame, because Leslie Nielsen has made some great films, none better that Flying High(Airplane) and The Naked Gun. There are no redeeming features in this movie at all so if you see it on a shelf in a video store, do yourself a favour and keep walking.
