I saw this movie on TV a LOOONG time ago, and the other day I just kept thinking of this Chuck Norris flick where there was a fight scene where it was nothing but silhouettes in a neon light background on a staircase. After flipping through my uncle's VHS collection, I find this! You gotta love the old Chuck Norris flicks; he was what Steven Segal and Van Damme were in the 90s in the 70s and 80s. We see a 'Godfather-type' theme here, it gives for a decent plot for a bare bones martial arts action movie...and Chuck Norris delivers. It's a shame what he's become, because he was just RAW! An all around enjoyable old school action film. Anyone looking for anything else that what's being presented here is just misguided. <br /><br />*** out of **** stars.
