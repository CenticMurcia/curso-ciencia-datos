First of all, the Tokyo Babylon manga is one of the most amazing things I have ever read. The characters were deep, sympathetic, and non-clichéd, and the story lines were very original. Congratulations to the ladies in CLAMP for creating such a beautiful story.<br /><br />That said, what on earth was this? Both of the Tokyo Babylon movies were more like bonus features - "Okay, you read the manga, here's some other cool adventures they got up to!" Which is a nice thought, but it really has no purpose. You cannot condense a series like this into a couple of movies - they tried it with X and it didn't work, they tried it with TB and it worked even less. There was none of the depth, none of the message, none of the character development - it turned into just another comic book, a collector's item.<br /><br />It was also rather irritating (TOUCHY SUBJECT ALERT) that half of the plot was ignored. Let's face it, folks, Tokyo Babylon is, in large part, a homosexual love story, learn to live with it. In the first TB movie, it seemed that Sakurazuka Seishiro's romantic advances were targeted more towards Sumeragi Hokuto than Sumeragi Subaru, and in this one, they were almost completely absent. Without this major part of the story, Seishiro is worthless - he becomes another clichéd villain.<br /><br />The animation was very pretty (as it always is in shojo) and the voicing couldn't have been better. Like I said before, it was a nice thought, but it simply isn't worth the trouble. 3/10.
