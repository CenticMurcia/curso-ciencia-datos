Edward G. Robinson in a slapstick comedy??!!! Yep, and a damn funny one. E.G. parodies his bad guy image perfectly in this flick as he wants to pull of one last heist before going straight, so he buys a luggage store next to a bank to break in, but he soon learns that he can make more money in a legit business... but that's only the beginning! I can't figure out why nobody knows about this film, it's very entertaining. It is perfectly cast, with Broderick Crawford, as Robinson's flunkie is hilarious, Jackie Gleason has a cameo doing a variant of his 'born loser' routine. Even Anthony Quinn is funny! If you can find it in the video store on on TV watch it, it's worth your while.
