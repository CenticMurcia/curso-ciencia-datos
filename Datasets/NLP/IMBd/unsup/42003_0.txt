For a movie made on a low budget, the cinematography is pretty good and has some very good looking scenery. Unfortunately, this one good thing is not enough to overcome the atrocious acting and bad storytelling. The story itself might have been better if told chronologically, rather than using a flashback of a flashback. It seemed like an unnecessary device to use. The lack of any emotion from the actors, especially the lead, led to the story falling flat and pointless. The lead actor just read his lines in a monotone voice like he was reading off of a cue card. It's virtually impossible to have a good drama without either an excellent script or excellent acting. This had neither. I have no doubt that the main problem with the movie is that it was produced, directed, acted, and written by the family. With the same amount of money, someone else could have made a better movie because they were emotionally detached from the content and could have seen the obvious shortcomings.
