Our Transatlantic puritanical fundaMentalist Judaeo-Christian cousins (at least once removed) strike again, with yet another fear-mongering propagandist defecation.<br /><br />This time, they are feebly attempting to turn our hearts and minds against the psychedelic mushroom, and all those who indulge in such practises of course, by suggesting that anyone (even an cloying, incessantly altruistic, All American teenage virgin cheerleader-stereotype) can become a psychotic sadistic murderer overnight after ingesting a single "Death cap" mushroom (not even a psychedelic strain: merely a poisonous lookalike).<br /><br />This moronic "update" of Reefer Madness, shamelessly and inappropriately steals several visual scenes from the infinitely more intelligent classic, Jacob's Ladder, which remains the only genuinely frightening film of this ilk, in my opinion.<br /><br />Ah, why am I even bothering. I had better things to do than watch this stool, never mind describe it to you, who is obviously even now contemplating wasting the best part of two hours on this drivel. OK, if you want to see trippy visuals, this is not the film for you: watch Fear and Loathing again, or google "optical illusion". This is nothing more than anti-drug propaganda, badly-made on a shoestring, directed and acted by people who have never even seen someone on (or apparently met anyone who has ever taken) psychedelics.
