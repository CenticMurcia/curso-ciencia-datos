"Explorers" tells the story of young science-fiction buff Ben (Ethan Hawke) who has a vision in his dream that he imparts to his whiz-kid friend Wolfgang (River Phoenix). Wolfgang uses his own technical wizardry to bring this vision to life and together with a third friend Darren (Jason Presson) they design a craft that takes them into outer space where they have a close encounter.<br /><br />Lightweight, certainly likable science-fiction fantasy that is good for the young crowd - in fact, it is okay for family viewing - but for me it was too slowly paced. It wastes a little too much time.<br /><br />And now after seeing it again (it's been YEARS since I last saw it) I can understand why Leonard Maltin and his cronies would say it "takes a wrong turn in space". That's because there is no substance or importance to the close encounter - the outer-space portion of the film rambles on pointlessly (just like the aliens) and in the end it was hard not to be as disappointed as the three young heroes. At least it has its heart in the right place. The special effects are practically overwhelming.<br /><br />Robert Picardo, a veteran of director Joe Dante's movies, displays his versatility by playing three roles: 'Starkiller', 'Wak' and 'Wak & Neek's Father'. Also features veteran cult actor Dick Miller in one of his many roles in Dante movies.<br /><br />Rob Bottin, the man behind the alien design (and who created those memorable werewolf effects for Dante's "The Howling"), was probably given free reign in coming up with ideas and he came with some pretty funny, fanciful-looking aliens.<br /><br />It's not really BAD, but it's not that good either.<br /><br />Phoenix's and Hawke's film debuts.<br /><br />4/10
