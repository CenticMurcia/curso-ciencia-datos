After boring 90 minutes, I felt my times was completely wasted. If you like Kieslowsy, look somewhere else. To some people, it is artistic to portrait poor lives. It is sometimes true (Monster, Rossetta) and most time false. Edi is perfect example of how silly "art house" movies can be. A basic requirement for a basic movie is internal logic. It was obvious that the princess was protecting someone and having Edi as the easy cover up and the brothers did not suspect that. It was so ridiculous to have someone cut his balls off without fighting back even this is the kind of character the movie makers are trying to give to Edi. Don't even mention the Christmas crap, what a cheap clich√©. I agree with Godard, a bad Hollywood action movie is much tolerable than a bad European art movie.
