Who writes these reviews. Thanks to them I wasted 1.5 hrs of my time. I do like a good horror and its a shame as this is not one. There are some so called gory bits but on the whole you have to like crap horror, poor scripts and annoying characters to enjoy this. I even forwarded to the end. The start was quite promising with some suspense, ooh, whats going to happen and to who? But very quickly it became obvious that I was watching a real bad horror and not bad in the good sense. My original thoughts on what will happen really didn't matter anymore as I quickly lost the will to live but persisted for almost 80 minutes, by this point I'd had enough and flicked to the end. And its open for a sequel so all you fans, careful what you wish for...
