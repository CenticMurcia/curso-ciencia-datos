Cantor Rabinowitz (Warner Oland) wants his son Jackie to sing traditional Jewish religious songs at the temple. Jackie likes only signing jazz and, after his father beats him, he runs away from home. Twenty years later he's changed his name to Jack Robin (Al Jolson) and is a jazz signer...albeit not successful. He then meets beautiful Mary Dale (May McAvoy) who helps him become a big star. But his father is dying and wants him to sing for him before he dies and (wouldn't you know it?) this happens on the opening night of his big break.<br /><br />Yawn. What a cornball story! This was old even in 1927 when this was made. It's more funny now than dramatic. The clich√©s come flying left and right--some of them were so overdone I couldn't believe it! I was rolling my eyes and smirking almost nonstop. If this wasn't one of the first talking pictures and didn't have Jolson in it, it would have disappeared long ago. Also this (technically)isn't an all talking picture. It has sequences of dialogue and signing from Jolson but it's mostly a silent with title cards and everything.<br /><br />Cornball story aside the acting didn't impress me. I'm no fan of Jolson. I do admit his acting wasn't too bad but I hated his songs and didn't think he was much of a singer. When the sound came on when he was signing I kept hoping it could switch back to silent! Also he does two numbers in black face. I realize that was considered OK back in 1927 but it comes across as appalling and racist today. The rest of the actors overact to a startling degree--but that was how silent film stars DID act so I can't fault them.<br /><br />A real bad film but I give it a 2 because it is historically important. Anyone who interested in cinema should see it at least once.
