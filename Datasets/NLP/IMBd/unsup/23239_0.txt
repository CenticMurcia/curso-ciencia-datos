Synopsis: Robert Duvall is hired to kill someone in Buenos Aires. As he waits for the guy to show up he learns how to tango.<br /><br />The movie is pretty bad actually. As far as tango ambiance is concerned I would rather watch again movies at the National Geographic site (http://magma.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0312/feature2/index.html). However complete tango danced as a background to credits is worth rental price. <br /><br />Learned an interesting factoid: apparently in Argentina young attractive women are smitten with old goons. Food for thoughtÂ…<br /><br />4/10
