It starts off just as it is expected to with all the clich√©s about India. Yes, there are cows on street but it is hard to believe one in a call-centre campus. In fact, it's hard to believe a call-centre office in a rural hinterland with callers having heavy first-language influence. I believe only GOOD speakers of English are recruited by these firms and they don't change their outsourcing plans overnight. Travellers who make an impression of India based on this film may be pleasantly surprised if they actually visit the cities of India.<br /><br />Anyway, what got this movie really working is an interesting storyline, interspersed with comments and questions about cultures on both side of the 'divide'. I'm not sure but it seems like the director / writer was pointing at issues here with outsourcing as a backdrop: 1. That there are PEOPLE (humans) working in companies - this is often overlooked by bosses remotely controlling company operations. This is not limited to call-centres and may not be limited to India. Just as in the movie, several jobs may be put to risk at any time by a "20 heads for the price of 1" logic. Right now, we in India are facing the same issue with the rise of "cheap" workers in the Philippines, who may be doing a good job a few years down the line.<br /><br />2. Several other interactions and incidents in the movie seemed to say - there are humans involved. Sensitivity is required in handling human issues, for example, the spiritual undertone of the characters or the surprise at "calf-branding".<br /><br />3. Within a span of a few hours drive, the director has been able to show that there are different kinds of people in any populace - with respect to wealth, hygiene, behaviour, etc. This is commendable.<br /><br />4. Several questions raised about each other's culture can also start healthy debates. This makes this movie even better than it started out to be.<br /><br />Lastly, in case you decide to visit India after watching this movie, plan your travel well and just like any other part of the world, stay alert. Not all Indians are friendly. Most in the tourist destinations are out to fleece tourists, either legally (high rates) or illegally (robbing, thievery). And don't blindly accept invitations of a luncheon from people you don't know. In fact, avoid taking or even giving any food or drink (even water) to fellow passengers.
