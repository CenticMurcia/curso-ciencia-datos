I've loved this movie since its first airing back in 1980. Actually I only caught the ending that night because of being out late trick or treating..lol. Great cast, especially Jeff Goldblum and Dick Butkus. For a lot of the movie you get so wrapped up in the characters that you almost forget about the real headless horseman. There's just something very nostalgic about this film. The clothing, the log cabins, the small community, the nice manners, the ghost tales, the hospitality, the music, the location..so much to enjoy! The story is a little modified from the original but that's okay, it still works very well. I don't think much of it was filmed in a studio which gave it that more realistic feel. Just a wonderful film from beginning to exciting end. <br /><br />Yes a DVD release would be very nice.
