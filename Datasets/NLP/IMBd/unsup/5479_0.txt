A Catholic priest and theologian, Father Cura, believes that he has discovered through numerical values in the bible, the exact date of the birth of the anti Christ. Believing the only way to stop this happening, is to become evil himself by doing evil deeds, he sets off on a pilgrimage around Madrid looking for a sign that will direct him in the right direction. He teams up with a Death Metal shop assistant and a TV host of a phoney paranormal show to make his meeting with Satan come about. Day of the Beast is a hotch potch of ideas that in all truth shouldn't work at all, but de la Iglesia's excellent script and dark sense of humour guides this hybrid film into the realms of a real classic. It delivers in spades in every department, the three main performances are exceptional and they spark of each other to perfection. The opening sequence is pure slapstick you might expect from someone like Benny Hill, but it sets the tone perfectly for what follows, a comedy masterpiece, that also delivers on suspense and horror
