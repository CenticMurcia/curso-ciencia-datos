I am a truly HUGE Brent Huff fan, and have been since seeing Perils of Gwendoline.<br /><br />Mr. Huff looks great in this movie and though his part is short, he is seen enduring a bone-scraping torture through his bare chest that looks like evil acupuncture.<br /><br />Brent was one of the most handsome and sexy actors in these actioners and he could act when given half a chance. I don't know why he did not have a larger career, but I am thankful for the one he had.<br /><br />In some ways, he was the Mark Damon of the Eighties (though Mark got more notice for a little while during his heyday.) Mr. Damon has gone on to do very well as a producer. I hope the best for Brent as well.<br /><br />The VHS version has nice picture quality. I have not seen the DVD version.<br /><br />An 9/10 for shirtless torture sequence.<br /><br />The rest of the movie is okay. The actor who plays Huff's interrogator is a good one who shows up in many similar roles.
