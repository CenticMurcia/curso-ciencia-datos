This is late Rene Clair but none the worse for that. The first thing you notice is the color; pastel to a fault so that even the bright red trousers of the dragoons seem somehow muted. There's an unreal quality about the whole thing so that the overall effect is like watching a marionette show under water. The next thing you notice is the toytown quality of the sets, reminiscent of the castle in Les Visiteurs du Soir, the whole town, interior and exterior looks as though it never needs sweeping or cleaning. The plot needn't detain us - the one about the babe magnet who either wagers himself or else his colleagues wager on his behalf that he can seduce (in the early 40s and The Fleet's In, the GI only had to KISS the girl to win the bet) a girl selected at random by a given date has been around since they were writing with papyrus - because it's Style not Content we've come to see and we don't go away frustrated. What we have here is one of the great beauties of French cinema - two if you want to stretch a point and include Gerard Philippe, who was about one generation ahead of Alain Delon in the Pretty Boys Who Can Also Act school - wearing exquisite clothes, smiling her exquisite smile (eat your heart out, Julia Roberts) and suffering as exquisitely as only Michele Morgan could. Against all the odds, plot one step up from total clich√©, mannered acting, predictable outcome, etc, we keep on watching and more than that, watch it again and again. Let's face it, on a Clair day you can see forever.
