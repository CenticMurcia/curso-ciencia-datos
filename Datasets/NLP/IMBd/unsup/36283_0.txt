Yes, the movie is scary. Supposedly there is still one special effect left undone. But new? I am a movie buff (in production/writing) who has screened horror since it began. Young males who are horny find beautiful females and then are punished in a horrible way. This is as old as the oldest horror movie. Watch any Simpsons episode where a character goes to a scary movie. The director has said he made the movie to make us think about where society is going in terms of pornography. Bullshit. He made it for the money. The vast majority of characters killed in movies are male. And in most of these, the victim can somehow be blamed, allowing us in the audience to say, "Well, I would never go that far, so it couldn't happen to me." The reality is, young children are often the victims of forced prostitution, torture, and murder. In the movie, wealthy people pay to torture and kill. What of those who see the movie and are not wealthy? Would any of us be comfortable watching small children be tortured and killed? What if they reminded us of our own children or young siblings? Would that be a lot of fun? Yet we all know that evil people start out with vulnerable people and move up to young males, if they ever do move up. Their favorite victims are children, then young women, then men, because this is the easiest order to get control over. Movies like this only propagate the idea that those who suffer are guilty. Innocent people in the world suffer just as much as, and often more than, guilty people.
