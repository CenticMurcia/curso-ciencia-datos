Awful is a good word to start with. are you others stuck in the 80's or just pretentious film students? i have seen better "stuff" in my toilet. i am a James spader fan, but after seeing this movie early one morning suffering from insomnia i question his ability as a person. for Christ's sake he is a fellow mick and Bostonian and could not pull off the accent! not only that the movie sucked more than a hooker on a good day! all you lovers of starcrossed, it is time to put away the d&d game and move out of mom's house and get a job. if i ever see this movie on my t.v. again i will vomit and then drop my t.v. off a thirteen story building! James spader should be ashamed, better yet humiliated for ever even thinking this movie was a good career move! and you lovers of it GET A LIFE!
