In reading some of the non-spoiler reviews prior to watching this film, I was prepared for a deliberately-paced drama with elements of horror sprinkled in. What I got instead was a movie that was boring beyond comprehension.<br /><br />By "boring" I do not simply mean slow-paced. Most assuredly, there are many slow-paced films that are very interesting - "A Tale of Two Sisters", "Pulse", "Cure", and "Audition" come to mind. However, there are also many slow-paced films that are simply boring. "Sorum" is one of the latter.<br /><br />At no point during the first 85 minutes did I feel even remotely interested in what was happening. There was far too much "small talk" that contributed virtually nothing to the story. To be honest, the first 85 minutes could have been easily condensed to less than 30 without much loss to either plot or character development.<br /><br />When the final sequence of events took place, I could not help but feel cheated at the rather superficial treatment of the primary issues that the filmmakers were attempting to address - especially considering all of the screen time that was literally wasted during the first 75% of the film.<br /><br />I do agree with the positive reviewers here that ADD-ridden simpletons who need car explosions or lots of deaths will have difficulty sitting through this one. Unfortunately, the attention deficits of teenagers will never change the fact that "Sorum" is a poorly made film. Attempts to justify trash film-making in this manner is reprehensible. A bad film is simply a bad film.
