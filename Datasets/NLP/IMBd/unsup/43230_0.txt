Nosy body Emily Pollifax wants to work for the CIA after she is widowed. A typical New Jersey widow, she is given some case.<br /><br />She is supposed to get a book in Mexico that has important microfilm but the plan naturally goes awry and she is held in Albania with Darren McGavin as a fellow spy.<br /><br />The film goes downhill rapidly once the two are captive in the land of dictator Enver Hoxha. They plot to escape and manage to do so despite the Albanian terrain.<br /><br />As the film progressed, Russell really started to look elderly. She wears hats that could have easily qualified for Easter.<br /><br />Any hint of romantic ways between Russell and McGavin is ridiculous.<br /><br />The great Rosalind Russell should have been able to end her fabulous career on a much better production than this.
