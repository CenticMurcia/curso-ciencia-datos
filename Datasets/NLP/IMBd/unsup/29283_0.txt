This episode has EVERYTHING! From Milton, the retiree who quotes Longfellow, to a romantic comment between Grissom and Sarah. Who dunnit? Everyone! Cause of death? Everything! A great guest cast, headed by James Whitmore, does an outstanding job in a super setting. A whorehouse in the desert, populated with old coots, beautiful ladies, an inept local constable, and strung out Happy hisself- one of those characters "who needed killing." If Emmy awards aren't given to the writers, cast, special effects artists- it will really be a CRIME.<br /><br />I really, really need some comic relief, and this episode just made me grin from ear to ear. Thank you, CSI producers- this was the best of the best.
