I was kinda looking forward to seeing how they ended the Candyman trilogy and the story actually looked entertaining. I remember when I was younger getting a peek at the movie on HBO, but I think I remember falling asleep, so it was at least something I could put to rest of what the rest of the movie was about. Candyman 3: Day of the Dead turned out to be an ordinary sequel with nothing to remember and it wasn't up to par with the original Candyman.<br /><br />Caroline, the great great grand daughter of Candyman, is still haunted by the dreams of what her family and Candyman had to go through. No one believes her of course that he is still real, Candyman is back though and he is murdering her friends one by one while she gets the blame. She tries to uncover the legend and figure out what he wants from her, but she might end up loosing the only true friend of her's.<br /><br />This film was sadly typical and even for a horror movie it was plain pathetic, I do like a little cheesiness every once in a while, but for a great story like Candyman, this was really sad. Well, I can see why they didn't make a fourth installment to the Candyman series, big surprise there. Well, at least I'm done... or am I? *Insert cynical laughter here* <br /><br />2/10
