I admit that I'm biased here. Paul Valentine is a friend I've known since grade school and this video was the first I'd seen of him since 1974. Wow! Paul used to say in school he didn't need math because he was going to be like Elvis - an entertainer. He dreamed of being a rock star and movie star and what do you know? Here he was headlining a Paramount Pictures video! I admit that as a Christian I was taken aback at first but the little boy I first met in second grade was there for all too see. I rapidly came to understand what Paul was presenting. He no more worshipped the devil than I do but he knew a potentially successful schtick when he saw it; a schtick he readily admits to having parlayed into 24 years of personal appearances, a mammoth "satanic" church, and hundreds of YouTube videos and BlogTalkRadio shows. Good job, Paul!<br /><br />But I don't believe for a second you're a satanist.
