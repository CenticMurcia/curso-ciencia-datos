Wow, "Panic" is yet another turd from the so-called "Chilling Classics" box set, a London-filmed epidemic tale sporting an Italian cast and crew, with international celebrities David Warbeck ("The Beyond") and Janet Agren ("Eaten Alive") lending some brand-name recognition the lousy ride. There's not really much to be said for this grade-Z stinker--the plot is the typical pulp of a scientist whose experiment backfires, transforming him into a hideous mutant who spends the film shuffling through the London sewer system in between random lackluster attacks on various characters. There are endless dialog scenes involving scientists, policemen, and government figures talking the issue to death instead of actually DOING something. The performances and dubbing are uniformly atrocious, with Agren seemingly inserted at random to pad the film out. And while Warbeck does his usual tough-guy shtick, the real amusement of "Panic" is the pair of tight-binding white jeans he wears during the last act...never has a bulge been so shamelessly exploited since David Bowie donned tights in "Labyrinth"...but aside from that dubious curiosity, there's really nothing here worth seeing.
