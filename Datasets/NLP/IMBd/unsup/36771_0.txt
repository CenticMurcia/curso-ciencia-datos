SOUTH OF HEAVEN, WEST OF HELL (2 outta 5 stars) Considering the tremendous cast involved in this movie (Billy Bob Thornton, Vince Vaughn, Bridget Fonda, Bud Cort, Peter Fonda, Bo Hopkins, Luke Askew, Matt Clark, Scott Wilson etc.) I was expecting one hell of a movie. Sadly, the meandering nature of the script doesn't really give the movie much forward motion. There are a few individual scenes that are noteworthy but a lot of other scenes that seem to serve no purpose but to give a few quotable lines to a familiar film veteran. Director/writer/star Dwight Yoakam is the star of the film but unfortunately he doesn't quite have what it takes to hold the movie together. Vince Vaughn's bad-guy role steals his thunder in every scene they share. Many other scenes are marred by being a little *too* over-the-top (as when a prisoner slobbers all over the naked bosom of a prostitute pressed up against the window to his cell). Considering that the movie is basically a vanity project for Dwight Yoakam it's not as terrible as it might be... he's very generous in giving screen time to his co-stars... and he does come up with some nice dialogue. Yoakam also provides the memorably haunting musical theme runs throughout the movie. Not a total waste of time... but very bumpy going at times.
