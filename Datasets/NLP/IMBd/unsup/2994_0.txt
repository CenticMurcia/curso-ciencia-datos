A great romantic thriller with wonderful characters. Mark Harmon shines as a private detective more at ease in a library than carrying a gun. Mimi Rogers is brilliant as the mysterious grieving widow and the film is extremely well made with a catchy Jazz music score and beautiful photography. A must-see.
