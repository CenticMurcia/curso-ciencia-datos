Recap: Guru Pitka is frustrated that ever being in the shadow of Deepak Chopra. But when the owner of the Toronto Maple Leafs seeks his advice Pitka sees his chance. If Guru Pitka can reunite their biggest star with his estranged wife, and break the Leafs' curse and win the Stanley Cup, none less than Oprah herself has offered him a spot on her show.<br /><br />Comments: Supposedly a cut character from the Austin Powers' movies, and it shows. The humor and set up are identical to the Austin movies. Unfortunately that means that most of the jokes are extremely low and juvenile. At best they are just about sex and mildly distasteful. At worst they are almost disgraceful and embarrassing for any above the age of five. It's a shame because Myers can be a good comedian at times, as is evident because a few jokes and puns are actually very good.<br /><br />Mostly it is a movie that should be forgotten as soon as possible. It should only be watched as a last resort and only if you're really tired and easily entertained. Because when you think about it, it is quite bad.<br /><br />3/10
