This is an excellent representation of a Whitesnake concert. The one and only time I have seen Whitesnake live was New Year's Eve 1981 but this really brings back great memories.<br /><br />Only David Coverdale remains in the band from those heady days of my youth but, nonetheless, these guys still put on a show. If you ever get the chance to see Whitesnake live, I suggest you take - you will not regret it.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the powers that be decided to erase the sparse amounts of foul language and replace it with ... nothing! C'mon guys - I can't see too many 13 year olds rushing out to buy this. We're all (probably) adults! Leave it in there as part of the actual concert! DAVE
