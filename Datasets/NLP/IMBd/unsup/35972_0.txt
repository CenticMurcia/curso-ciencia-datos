Probably the worst movie I have ever watched. Actually I didn't expect anything delightful from the beginning, and forced myself to watch it solely because of Christopher Plummer whom I adore. And Christopher Plummer is fine as usual - though he is definitely not performing Shakespeare, but a rather aphasic, gum chewing and cheaply dressed police inspector. But the rest of the movie... oh my God! You won't be spared anything: turbid atmosphere and terrible film score, whorehouses, heroin addicted prostitutes taking drugs, plenty of blood, stabbed cats hanging on the wall, and above all a long black mess scene with plenty of details and a doped prostitute playing the sacrificial victim. Everybody is aphasic, and very few words are uttered in the whole movie. Maybe is it because on the set everybody was embarrassed and ashamed of what he/she was doing there? I usually am extremely understanding towards Christopher Plummer's professional choices in the movie sector: though I think he has wasted his unique acting talent starring in too many mediocre movies, I understand that everyone has to earn a living. But this time it's too much even for the most devoted of his fans! This time he should have had his hands soundly slapped for wasting himself so much! He can be forgiven only if he is able to prove that at that time he was starving. :)
