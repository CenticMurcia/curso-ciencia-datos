I was lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time to see this movie at the Phoenix Film Festival and I absolutely loved it. The actors all did a great job, and the chemistry among the whole group was wonderful. I would love to have them for my new best friends. Jensen Ackles (Priestly) was really amazing--charming, charismatic and fantastically funny--an opinion clearly shared by the entire audience. Elizabeth Harnois, Daneel Harris and, especially, Clea DuVall put depth and heart into their characters and Jon Doe and Alice Krige were a joy to behold. The movie made me laugh out loud and tear up as well. Even my picky, analytical cynic of a husband was delighted and moved. The best word I can think of to describe this movie is "joyous." It is destined to supplant Pretty Woman as my new favorite movie to watch when I need a lift. I truly hope the movie acquires a solid distribution deal, because I think it would be a shame to deprive a wide audience of such a delight. I can hardly wait for another chance at it myself.
