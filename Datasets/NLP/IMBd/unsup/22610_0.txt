Charlotte SOmetimes really hit the mark in terms of defining the relationship dynamics of this generation with honesty and realism. I was very impressed with the maturity and depth the cast and director brought into this film. It seems to me that with the sparse dialogue and emphasis on body langauge and position and cast and director really had to give a personal performance drawing from experience and so on. I loved the simple sets and uncomplicated camera work because it reminded me a lot of the recent Taiwanese movies I liked. There have been comparisons to In The Mood For Love, but I think the most apt comparison is to the New Wave Taiwanese auteurs and especially Tsai Ming-Liang. Just that and a personal resonance made me love this film. I don'tknow if being Asian has to do with anything, but I definately will recommend this to my crew.
