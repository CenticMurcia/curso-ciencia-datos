This was a surprisingly great movie about a young Hasidic man's journey from an insular religious Brooklyn community to the modern, secular world of Manhattan. The film was both hilarious and profound, philosophical and emotional. Mendy's story will ring true for anyone brought up in a traditional community who tried to find their place in the chaos of modern society. As an Orthodox Jew, I found the story to be extremely realistic. In particular, Orthodox Jews will be able to understand the psychological enormity of the taboos that Mendy breaks - starting with cutting his peyos (sidelocks), then tasting his first cheeseburger, and having sex with a non-Jew. But ultimately it seems that Mendy finds some kind of peace with his new non-Orthodox lifestyle, despite having been brought up with almost no skills with which to function in American society. The final image of the movie is striking, a reaffirmation of Mendy's religious roots despite his abandonment of the Hasidic way of life. Great work by the writer/director Adam Vardy, and wonderful acting. Hopefully this movie will get the wider release it most definitely deserves.
