Wow, what a waste of cast! Dustin Hoffmann is trying his best but he can't save the mess that is "Moonlight Mile". This is an all around unrealistic drama/romance with some slapstick moments thrown in. Sounds stupid? It is! The dialog is horrible and within the first five minutes it becomes obvious that this movie blows. Do yourself a favor and avoid it.
