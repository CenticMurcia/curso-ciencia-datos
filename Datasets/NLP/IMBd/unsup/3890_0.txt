Feds is great! So much humour and wit mixed with butt-kicking.<br /><br />The movie really is empowering for any woman who works in a male-dominated field. They really do show many of the guys how to do the job right.<br /><br />There is also a great showing of support for each other that really helps make the difference.<br /><br />I wish they would release it to DVD. VHS is really a sad medium for film now. I want to add Feds to my DVD collection.<br /><br />If you haven't seen Feds, do yourself a favour and rent it if you still own a VCR.
