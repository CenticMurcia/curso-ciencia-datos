I thought the idea behind this film and story line were absolutely fantastic, I love the idea of a huge prison existing where the prisoners are on their own to survive and must live amongst themselves. Great idea!<br /><br />The only real complaints I have about this film is the cheesy lines throughout the film, Kurt Russell's stupid whisper voice, and the music. For most of the film Kurt Russell did an excellent job, but there were a few scenes where I couldn't stand the way he talked. As for the music, I'm unsure whether the blame lies with the fact that this film was made in the early 1980's or if it resides with John Carpenter's choice of music (I don't like the music in just about any of his films).<br /><br />All of that aside, I thought the film was very good and definitely one of John Carpenter's best. John needs to stick to movies like this, I think it's safe to say that it's movies like this that fans appreciate. Anyhow, if you are a fan of John Carpenter, then you MUST see this film. If you're a fan of futuristic action/adventure films, then you also MUST check this out. I hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading,<br /><br />-Chris
