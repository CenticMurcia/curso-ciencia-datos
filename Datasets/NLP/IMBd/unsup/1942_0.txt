I give this one 2 points for its narrative attempt at trying to make it "real," and one point for the filmmakers' truly laudable 'Efforts.'<br /><br />Four generations of special-effects technology have already passed since J3 was made (maybe more... it was first released in theaters almost twenty-years ago), and the viewer simply can't get over its bad chroma-key mini-sub, cheesy 3-D props, et al.<br /><br />However, like most badly executed thrillers with substandard "eye-candy," J3 has a worthy message for all of us: Try to bottle Nature in an attractive Theme Park package, and nature will get back at you in a deadly, often gruesome way.<br /><br />Most interesting here are the two-dimensional, stock characters. They surprise us in how they eventually evolve as the story comes to its inevitable conclusions...<br /><br />What we may initially perceive as the secondary Villain (the manager of this aquatic theme park, "Calvin"), turns out to be just an ordinary person at a loss for words, and tries his best to save the endangered tourists trapped underwater. Unlike the previous two films (in which we're subjected to the pig-headed-ness of one dollar-hungry Mayor), Calvin made me laugh when I realized his character was just all attitude and 'talk.' He is speechless when everybody realizes they have a serious situation on their hands: 35 feet of man-eating death!<br /><br />The heroes (God save what's left of their present acting careers!) also prove brave and honorable.<br /><br />My favorite character, however, was the calm and rational female tour guide that succeeded in 'tranquilizing' the trapped visitors until rescue divers could successfully bail them out. Here you have this short lady telling the much taller adults and children to conserve their energy and air, so that escape seems all the more possible.<br /><br />Brief Review: J2 was pretty much along the same lines as its original... except here we have a regatta of mostly teens and twenty-somethings trying to stay afloat, and the shark in question keeps getting bigger by the time we reach J4.<br /><br />J4 stinks and sinks! Pray that someday we'll all be allowed to go back to our beaches without the likes of Michael Caine and Lorraine Gary polluting our oceans. These landlubbers belong either on the Broadway stage or beside their mogul husbands, sitting quietly counting their box-office money.<br /><br />See Jaws 3. If anything, it's great watching this truly unique aquatic show, where 'red popcorn' goes flying off into the audience.<br /><br />
