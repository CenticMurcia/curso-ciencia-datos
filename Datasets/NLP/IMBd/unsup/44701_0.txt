I was in pain after watching the seemingly never ending mess that is Pariah. In pain from laughing so hard at the nonsense I witnessed, that is. I am not shocked to see from his IMDb page that Director, Randolph Kret was never allowed to waste investors money again. It makes me wonder how much money was spent making this film. The story was silly, stupid and boring. Plain and simple it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen and I've seen some junk in my time. The portrayal of the skinheads was WAY over the top. Again, I can't stress enough how bad this story was. It was all over the place. My advice to anyone who sees this movie at the video store is to save the 99 cents it would cost to rent this movie. I don't think it's worth a nickel.
