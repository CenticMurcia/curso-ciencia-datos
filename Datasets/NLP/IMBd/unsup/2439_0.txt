1st watched 4/20/2002 - 2 out of 10(Dir-Jay Andrews): Bizarre, idiotic story-line is the first problem with this movie. I hate it when the box description on a video is totally wrong. It states that a chemical is being carried on a plane that crashes into a mountain and causes havoc, the Blockbuster description says it's carrying the world's deadliest explosives. Guess what, both are wrong. What is being carried on the plane is a scientific devise invented back in the early 1900's that basically takes a person's thoughts to create atomic-like destruction. Now beginning with that, can you really make a good movie?? Treat Williams tries to add humor to an otherwise way too serious treatment of a silly story. We get to see some old time TV stars make a little money, but other than that what a waste of my time & money(if you paid to rent this film - mine happened to be a freebie, but what a waste of a freebie). Oh well, the next one has got to be better than this loser.
