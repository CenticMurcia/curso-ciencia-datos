This movie was ridiculous. The plot is completely unbelievable. A woman bets her boss that she can 'lose a guy in ten days.' A man bets that he can make a woman fall in love with him in ten days. What can go wrong? Too much. The movie was not funny. It showed women as catty and men as stupid. There is no reason why he would 'want to keep her' and there is no reason that she 'would fall in love with him.' Granted, they are doing stupid and idiotic things on purpose, but after finding out that they were lying to each other, all is forgiven! And of course the climax is played out in public. Typical Hollywood. In reality, they would be so upset that they lied to each other that they would never see each other again. And any talking would be out of the line of curious ears. But of course, movies are not based on reality.<br /><br />Kate Hudson is very pretty and Matthew McConaughey is quite handsome. The costumes, especially the yellow dress that Hudson wears at the end, are gorgeous. I do think that Hudson as Andie Anderson and McConaughey as Benjamin Barry did well with their talents, but the movie itself stinks. No matter how talented you are, you cannot save a sinking ship.<br /><br />I'm sure several people will like this movie and that is fine, everyone has different tastes. I am a romantic, but I pride myself on being a sensible romantic. Movies of this kind are not romantic to me, just wastes of time. If you want a quality love story, go with something else. If you don't mind killing time and wasting your hard-earned money, then this may be the movie for you.
