Similar theme and plot. But not a snappy action show. A thriller dwelling more on the sensual and personal aspects leading to downfalls rather than, as in Buffy, merely showing the heroine entering and leaving the bedroom then skipping to the resulting disaster and fight scenes.<br /><br />Shouldn't be a spoiler to say the heroine is more like Willow than Buffy if you are drawing general comparisons.<br /><br />If all you want is fight scenes, special effects, and stunts -- then this not the show for you. If you like sex with a background of creeping horror ready to jump out -- then try this.
