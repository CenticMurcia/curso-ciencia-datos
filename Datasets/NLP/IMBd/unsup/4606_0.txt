Absolutely amazing.. What else can i say? I'm a 22 Year old male, and i do have a daughter of my own, this movie was great, from the start i was glued to the screen and i was still there at the end, and i didn't even move to grab a drink, or go the loo.<br /><br />I found this movie very emotional, and near the end i was almost in tears, and had a lump in my throat.. i'm not ashamed to admit that.<br /><br />What Jacey did was amazing and was a very tough decision for her, and i feel i can relate to how she felt, as i have been in this situation myself. I will certainly buy the DVD for this once its out. <br /><br />10/10. Well done.
