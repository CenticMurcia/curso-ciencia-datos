I love action-packed games, and I love James Bond movies. "Agent Under Fire" is the first (to my knowledge) James Bond game that isn't based on one of the movies. It's entirely original. The character of James Bond also isn't based on Pierce Brosnan or any other Bond. He's entirely his own character in this. This is great!<br /><br />One thing I love about this game is the sound. It's amazing. I turn the volume up whenever I play high-intensity levels, and it's like I'm watching DVD. I can't get enough of it.<br /><br />I guess the only thing that disappoints me in this game is that it's a bit too short. Only twelve levels. But on the upside, some of the levels are divided into three or even four sections, so a level can feel like it's more than one.<br /><br />Because of this game, I'm now really looking forward to "Nightfire", the new, completely original James Bond game coming out this fall. If it's any better than "Agent Under Fire", then I'm sold.
