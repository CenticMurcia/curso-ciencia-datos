This movie depicts the Buffalo Soldiers, one of the most decorated units that ever fought for the United States as criminals. They were not criminals. They had the lowest desertion rate during the Indian Wars in the 1800's. They were called upon to be with Theodore Roosevelt when he followed them up San Juan Hill in Cuba with the Rough Riders. They were called upon again to chase the thieving murderous Pauncho Villa into Mexico and execute him for his crimes. They were the first guardians of our National Parks like Yosemite and the Presideo at San Francisco, where many are burried, in honor. Though BLACK for the most part, segregated, spit upon by other soldiers, looked down upon they held their heads high and fought bravely during every conflict the USA had to deal with since their inception in 1868. No, this film should be named something else. I cannot believe other STARS in Hollywood and elsewhere allowed this attrocity! I don't care how funny, how good, where it shows - I'll not cast my eyes upon it and allow my money to foul the memory or our heroes.
