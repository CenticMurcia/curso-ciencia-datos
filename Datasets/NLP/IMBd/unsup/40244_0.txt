My gods, I want those 28 minutes of my life back! This so-called movie is a therapist's dream client. The guy who wrote this has issues, massive, major issues.<br /><br />It was worse than any Woody Allen movie I've ever seen.<br /><br />So his dad's a jerk. Well, grow up. You aren't your dad. Get over it.<br /><br />How the hell did this thing win an Oscar? It was pure, utter crap.<br /><br />I saw this tonight at a screening of the five short animated films nominated for the Oscar, and I cannot possibly fathom how any of the other four lost to THIS.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs.<br /><br />The writer of this film should issue a written apology to the world for unleashing this massive Shite Monster on us. I've seen the Shite Monster, in the movie Dogma. This was its poppa.<br /><br />Did the people who voted for it actually SEE the movie? Or were they just impressed by its length?
