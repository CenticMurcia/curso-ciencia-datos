A rich woman wants to adopt a sweet, young street performer, but things are complicated by the latter's thieving grandfather. Shirley gets to dance and act cute. She also gets to display her dramatic side in an enactment of "Uncle Tom's Cabin" that brings tears to one's eyes, not because it is moving, but because it is painful to watch. Morgan made some fine films, but this is not one of them. He does the best he can as Shirley's greedy grandfather, who considers selling Shirley for $5000. There is an uninteresting romantic subplot involving the rich woman's nephew. The best thing to be said about this film is that it is only 79 minutes long, limiting the audience's pain and suffering.
