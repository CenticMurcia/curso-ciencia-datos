Make no mistake, if you rent/buy this and are in a haste, only watch the second segment! Horror-maestros Romero and Argento's teaming is not what could have been expected. First we have a spooky retelling of Poe's "Mr Valdemar", directed (or should it, in this case, be non-directed?) by Romero, and it's so very, very looooong. The plot never get's to boil here, just simmer slightly. All there is to enjoy is the over-acting of Ms Barbeau in one of her (many) bitch-parts, otherwise nothing interesting happens until the last five minutes where there is some suspense and horror. The second story is by italian horrordirector Argento and it's at least twice as good, but still not good enough. Interesting directorial touches, mixed with some nice gore, manages to hold the interest even if the material is stretched well beyond it's limit. There are numerable references to other Poe stories to find and an impressive dream-sequence with a very nasty impaling. Harvey Keitel is nicely creepy in his part as killer and cat-hater. It's his show from beginning to end. But the ending is too abrupt and, as I said earlier, there is not enough story fill the space with. So, to make a final verdict, a pretty pointless affair with the following ratings: segment 1: 3/10 segment 2: 5/10
