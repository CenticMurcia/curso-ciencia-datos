I've waded through lots of zombie movies trying to find some good ones.And since Romero has only made 5 there aren't very many good ones among the loads of stinkers out there.This one was one of the worst pieces of homemade garbage I've seen yet in my quest to find good zombie movies.<br /><br />A group of what look to be mostly 20 year olds set off in a van on what I think was a going to a trip to a debating contest.Along the way they get hijacked by a dope dealer who is trying to find his partner who has disappeared out in the Arizona landscape somewhere.Anyway the group tracks the dope dealer to a ghost town in the middle of nowhere.Shortly after arriving the kids are attacked by the missing dope dealer who is all bloody and talks kinda funny.<br /><br />So immediately one of the debaters starts rattling off about the legend of Bloody Bill,a confederate solider ,who ended up out west after the war was over.Legend has it that Bill swore revenge on the town-folk who had killed him for bad stuff he did in the war.How they linked the wounded dope dealer up to Bloody Bill so quick was sort of glossed over and the kid who knew all the details was obviously and painfully reading his lines as we watched flashbacks of how Bill came to be.<br /><br />Anyway the town soon becomes alive with Bill's zombies who run from one old building to another ,as do the kids,in what sometimes looks like a Benny Hill chase scene without being anywhere near as entertaining.All we needed was "Yakety Sax" as background music.<br /><br />Speaking of music this film had one,what I took to be,death metal song with idiotic lyrics that was played over and over and over.But really so much was wrong with this film it isn't hardly worth mentioning it all.The zombies were those kind that were just sort of halfway done, no well done zombie make up here. In the flesh eating scenes,which there are very few, we see the cheapo looking rubber stuff instead of the real looking latex standing in for human flesh.In one scene a grenade goes off downstairs but in the shot outside we see the blast and smoke coming out an upstairs window.<br /><br />One guy runs around and around trying to escape the zombies but all the while keeps one hand on his Kenny Chesney looking cowboy hat to keep from losing it.No one in this film could act their way out of a wet paper bag.The plot and script were terrible and the special effects were as crappy as any I've seen.<br /><br />In short,this whole mess looks exactly like what it is.....a bunch of lame asses making a zombie movie without one single shred of talent whatsoever.It turns out looking like the homemade junk that it is.<br /><br />Hey I only paid a buck for this thing at Wal-Mart and I wish I had my dollar back.Yeah it was that bad.
