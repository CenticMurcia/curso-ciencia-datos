Contrary to how it appears on IMDb I saw the film in its correct order and enjoyed this, the first half, more than the second half because it was not as gritty nor as fundamentally sad. I enjoyed watching the Cuban Revolution unfold and I enjoyed seeing a movie about events I remember only from television. It is very hard now to see Castro in New York City addressing the UN. I can remember him being received as almost a movie star on that visit and to see Sonderbergh treat that event, as well as the entire revolution, so even handed was excellent film making to me. I can easily understand why the conservative commenter's get so worked up about Hollywood and the supposed leftist leanings of the entire city. They conveniently forget the pabulum regularly dished out by Disney because by omitting that studio it makes it much easier to blanket the entire movie industry. I found this first part of Che most interesting and I saw glimpses of the national divide that would play, in my opinion, such a major role in part two. I had always thought that because South American countries, with the exception of Brazil, speak Spanish then it seemed that national boundaries would play only a minor role; but as becomes clear in part two that is most certainly not the case. I think Soderbergh steered an extremely tight course through the rapids of politics in this film. It could easily have become politicised because of the inflammatory nature of the subject matter but I believe he delivered an extremely even-handed film about a most difficult topic.
