Hard to watch! This movie is a DOG, and I don't mean that in a nice way! I was annoyed at how infantile and brain-dead ALL the adults are in this movie. As a scientist, I was especially insulted by the scientist-father character; it might make the child laugh, but who would want to grow up to be THAT? The humor is infantile and the jokes are contrived and forced. Expect all dog-cat stereotypes in this woofer.<br /><br /> I suppose that this movie was aimed at the very young. I fully expected to find dippers and teething rings on the movie house floor. This movie might be a little young and childish for the dipper set!<br /><br /> I give it 4 out of 10 because the special effects are well done- the animals do seem to talk and even act.. whew!<br /><br />NO Cats & Dogs 2! If i have to take my daughter to that one TOO, it is<br /><br />I that might have an accident on the carpet!
