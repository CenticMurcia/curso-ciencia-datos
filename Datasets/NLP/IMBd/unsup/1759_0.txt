I had first played this game in the year 2000 and i thought then, what a great game, now, almost 7 years on i still think it is one of the best RPG games. Of the three Final Fantasy's (i think) that came out on PS1 i think VII and IX were n o match with 8. The storyline of this game is, i think one of the greatest from the Final Fantasy series and the graphics for a 1999 PS1 video game, well it is just amazing. As I said the PlayStation 1 format is great, but the PC format isn't as good. The graphics on the PS1 format are precise, but the PC version is blurred, the sound during the CGI clips is distorted and the world tour on disc 2 has glitches and if you go to some places, freezes. If i were to choose to remake any game of the FF series, this would be it. My favourite. Final Fantasy VIII.<br /><br />Other games which i would recommend would be FFX or FFXI.
