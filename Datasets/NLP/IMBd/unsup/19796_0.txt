I saw this movie in Denver for free and I still to this day feel like someone owes me money for seeing this. Horrible all the way around. I had to leave the theatre after about an hour and 10 min. How anyone can enjoy this just astounds me. I rate it as the worst movie I've seen.(Never had the privilege of seeing Ishtar)
