The Lost World sets you in the eyes of 5 different characters. 1: Compy 2: Dieter Stark ( Human Hunter ) 3: Raptor 4: T-Rex 5: Sarah Harding ( Human Prey ) They all have different attributes and must use it to survive Isla Sorna. The game play is a bit hard to master but it is pretty decent, the graphics are somewhat OK but the humans' faces are hard to describe and tell. But still this is a pretty good game and I suggest you try it out. The only favorite character I like to play as is Dieter Stark, because you get a gun and shooting dinosaurs is fun! The Lost World: Jurassic Park, I give you a 7 out of 10, you just needed to be fixed up a little.
