Excellent B-movie crime caper story with an A-movie complex twist pulled by the caper's Mr. Big, Preston Foster as Mr. "Foster"(how creative!). All the stereotypical movie bad/tough guys you love to hate are here...Jack Elam, Lee Van Cleef, and Neville Brand in typically bad guy roles, and all were tough and great and threatening. Hey, that must be what got them their reps! <br /><br />Suffice to say, Foster as Mr. Big had it all figured to take everything in the end with all the others involved in the caper losing out, that's all of the story I'll tell, but it played out quite tense in spots. John Payne was the good bad guy with exotic Collen Gray as "the love interest", stuck in the story more or less to make sure that romance-loving gals bought tickets too. Payne wore 3" lifts to get him up to John Wayne/Bob Mitchum height so he would look the hero part better and he puffed up to his full lift's height more than once when confronting the 3 Bad Men. He played his B-film Bob Mitchum role here pretty well, but Foster and the 3 Bad Men were the best things in the story with Foster the best of the bunch in his forceful and convincing role. Gray had only a small supporting role but really sparkled when she was flirting with "her man" of the future.<br /><br />One of the best B-noirs and right up there with most A's, but not up to the level of The Asphalt Jungle, The Killers, or Out of The Past. Those are the very best noirs, but this one is well worth seeing.
