A seven-year-old boy, Omi is sent from India to live with an Uncle in Ottawa. Nobody is told that his mother is dying. The teenage daughter of the family, Safia is given the task of watching over Omi. On one of their outings, Amy meets a black man, Roland, who is a tour guide in his thirties, and they become romantically involved. Omi is convinced that Roland is a superhero, who will save his mother and bring her to Ottawa, so he assists with their clandestine meetings.<br /><br />The acting is in the low-key, naturalistic, Canadian style, which keeps a very light mood to the drama. The characters are interesting and endearing but are not fully developed. The film is quite enjoyable but not memorable.
