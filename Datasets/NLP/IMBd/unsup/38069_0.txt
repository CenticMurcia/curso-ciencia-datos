This is the worst sequel to Urban Legends. It makes no sense. For reasons unknown, some chick has visions that make her care about an unsolved murder from 30+ years ago, and uselessly tries to figure it out, with the help of her twin brother, who in the end, died, I guess? They never really tied that up. But that's the least of the problems with this movie, though. The director doesn't know a good story, because this film does NOT have one. I can't even explain it, it's so bad... Okay, in the past, some girl, "Bloody Mary" was left to die in a chest in the attic(?) of the school (And understandably, the police would never search the school where she was last seen, and of course the school wouldn't start to smell when Mary's body rotted inside that chest, so it remains unsolved for 30 years). Anyway, this Mary chick comes back as a ghost to avenge her death by killing the children of the people involved in her murder. It's gay. The vision-chick has a hard-on for figuring out why her enemies at school (who drugged her and left her out in the country) are dying, and meets some old hippie chick who was involved in the old murder. The hippie-chick (wearing the same wig she wore 30 years ago), for more unknown reasons, leaves her house, giving up her 30 year agoraphobia, to help this vision-chick find "Bloody Mary"'s body and try to bury it. I can't write any more... The movie dialogue is boring and retarded. Too many holes in this plot to count (They don't bury people in the winter, the ground is frozen idiots). Ughhh... what a waste of time, like this e-mail.
