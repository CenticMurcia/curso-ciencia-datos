Need I say more? I think I have watched this movie consecutively more times than any other movie I have ever seen. It is a piece of cheesy 80's art at its finest. The embedded flashbacks make it a bit hard to follow the first 10 times you watch it, but make it pleasantly Warhol-esque especially once you know the majority of the lines. Watch it over and over again, then watch it some more. Make sure you watch it with a drink in your hand, but remember Schwab Insurance doesn't insure drinkers.<br /><br />"You could have more fun than you've ever had in your entire life"<br /><br />"Are you sure?
