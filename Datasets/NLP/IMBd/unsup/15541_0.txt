I've just watched the Pilot of Aquaman from Itunes and must say that if WB doesn't pick up on this the guys who in charge cant possibly haven't had the time to watch the PILOT... The cast and the storyline along with the crew of small ville really knows what makes things interesting for the viewers... Usually aqua man is quite lame but they have already managed to make lots of fans who would love to follow the show..I really hope that they'll air the show in September... Nowadays it's possible to make great shows in this category due to experience and technology. They've got something here which would make quite a success SO they shouldn't hesitate.... Hope to see the show aired
