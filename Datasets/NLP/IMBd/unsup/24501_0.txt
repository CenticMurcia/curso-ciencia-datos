Wow, i know that this show is praised and considered to be one of the best shows of the 80's, but i certainly did not expect such a good first episode, in fact it's a double episode that's almost 100 minutes long. I didn't have chance to see this show earlier so i'm watching it now 25 years later and it still doesn't seem old at all, it's even greater now as you look back at the mid 80's.<br /><br />Great introduction of the two main characters of this show, Det. James 'Sonny' Crockett (Don Johnson) and Det. Ricardo 'Rico' Tubbs (Philip Michael Thomas) in this first episode. Ricardo Tubbs come to Miami by representing himself as his brother which died three weeks ago in undercover operation gone wrong and he was killed by a same man and his gang that Ricardo wants to catch and kill in Miami, that's the reason of his coming down south in the first place. On the other hand Sonny Crockett is a Miami detective who just watched his partner die in car explosion, Crockett is also known as the detective who doesn't always work "by the book". When these two meet they of course argue a lot at first and don't get along, but fate has different plans for them as they start working on their first case of catching drug dealer Calderon (the same one who killed Tubbs's brother)...<br /><br />I have to say that this first episode passed by so quickly that i thought it was a regular episode (which means 50 minutes long because that's the length of 'Miami Vice' episodes unlike some shows which have 40 minutes episode's length) and not a double one, it was exciting and entertaining in almost every scene, acting was very good, far better from what i have expected, since i heard that 80's detective shows aren't well known for their flawless actors, but Johnson and Thomas are dead on most of the time, specially in dramatic scenes and dialogs. Soundtrack is naturally amazing for this 80's TV series, i heard music themes from 'Miami Vice' long before today and the first episode of it that i watched, official 'Miami Vice' theme is very good and likable as well as the music from 80's that was used for this show, for example in this episode we hear well known hits such as 'Girls Just Wanna Have Fun' and 'In The Air Tonight'.<br /><br />10/10 - a perfect start of the show
