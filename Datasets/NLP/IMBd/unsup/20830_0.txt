Definitely worth seeing. There is a lot of rubbish out there generally. A big budget and big hype certainly do not make a good movie but they make the general public and, even I am ashamed to say, me, more likely to see them. Which is unfortunate not least because movies like Gamerz can easily be overlooked.<br /><br />The story does not involve complex characters, what it does have is believable and honest characters that are easy to relate to. Its a feel good story which doesn't try or pretend to be more. It's easy to watch with some genuinely funny moments. While obviously not produced with a big budget, It's well crafted.
