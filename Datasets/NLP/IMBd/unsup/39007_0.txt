I was totally disappointed by this film. It started out with a George Bernard Shaw quote which gave me really high expectations since Shaw is just brilliant. I'm a huge fan of dry humor, which predisposed me to loving this film, but it was just disturbing. It was also boring and rather sickening. With regard to the latter, I think it did succeed since that was probably one of the writers' goals. In spite of its offensiveness, the film succeeds in its ultimate educational goal. The main failure IMHO is its taking advantage of every possible stereotype. After 15 minutes it feels stupid. The last two minutes before the closing credits were the parts of the film I enjoyed the most.
