A good source writer and an intelligent director were hamstrung by a lack of funds and some awful editing and a non-performance by Anita Ekberg in the lead. This girl was not a bad actress, she was a non actress, as evidenced when asked to do her hilariously awful 'sexy' nightclub routine. The body moves but the eyes are blank, and, one suspects, the head is empty. It is a film that warrants quite a few viewings but only if you are really anxious to find out if your initial confusion was down to you or them. Them.
