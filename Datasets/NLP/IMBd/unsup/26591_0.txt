Okay, this is definitely the dumbest movie I've ever seen since Satan's School for girls. No good violence, no vampire gorieness, no nothing. The graphics absolutely SUCKED. I hated it, on a scale of one to ten i'd rate it a two for originality. Okay, the gorieness part was untrue, there was a whole lot of ketchup (for the blood) you could tell it was ketchup, all they had to do was put some chunky stuff in there. lol. And it ended with the people walking away, and the girl of the whole thing was all happy and stuff that she got away from the vamps, then she showed the guy an "upper" part of her leg and she ended up being bitten and she didn't know it and she bit the guy while kissing him and then it ended. BOOOOOOOOOOO! I hated it...
