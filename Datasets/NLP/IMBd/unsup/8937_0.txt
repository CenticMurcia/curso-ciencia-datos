Taking place mostly at a small apartment building in downtown Manhattan whose inhabitants must deal with murderous rats, as well as the zombie rat-people that those they bite devolve into. This low-budget really surprised me (it being a part of the After Dark '8 films to die for' didn't really provoke confidence as most of those films I've seen previous to this one were awful) However this film kept my interests throughout & a testament that supremely low-budget films can be good if the film maker has an eye on the ball, plans it all out ahead of time and has a real passion for cinema. Well acted, but characterization is a tad sparse, however that's all right as the film is tense and tightly made so it's not a huge problem. Nick Damici does a great job both behind and in front of the camera.<br /><br />My Grade: B
