I strongly advise anyone who enjoys a nice romantic movie every once in awhile to check this movie out! It was such a cute movie and i don't know why anyone who's into this type of film wouldn't like it. The casting was perfect- and that doesn't always happen with made for TV movies. And as for Brian Green..wow..he was amazing! Any fans of the former Beverly Hills 90210 star is sure to enjoy this flick! It will probably be playing on and off a lot in the next few weeks on ABC Family, so don't miss it. You will definitely not be disappointed!
