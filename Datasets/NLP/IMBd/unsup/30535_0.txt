Alfred Hitchcock made this highly enjoyable and under-rated divertissment in 1950 after a run of glum movies in the second half of the forties but before embarking on his richest period in the fifties. It also brought him back to Britain for a very old-fashioned comedy-thriller that wouldn't have looked out of place among his thirties' thrillers. It's also the one with the twist that turns out to be Hitchcock 'cheating' or, shall we say, breaking the rules and detractors of the movie haven't forgiven for it. There is also no flab in the movie whatsoever; it kicks off with a murder and subsequently develops into a good old chase yarn.<br /><br />The principal parts are taken by Jane Wyman, cast against type and underplaying nicely, and Marlene Dietrich in one of her theatrical grande-dame roles, (in this one she sings 'The laziest gal in town'). The men are slightly frenetic Richard Todd and a bland Michael Wilding but it is the supporting cast of marvelous British character players who are the best value and give the film its bounce. We have Alastair Sim and Sybil Thorndike, Kay Walsh and Joyce Grenfell and a wonderfully sleazy turn from an unlikely Miles Malleson. Set-pieces are few, (the doll at the Garden Fete is one of them), but as I've said, this was a divertissment and very good fun it is, too.
