An adult would find this extremely boring, predictable and immature.<br /><br />If you are 15-17, you would probably enjoy this movie.<br /><br />I would not let anyone under 14 see this movie, because of sexual themes and some shock-value spooks. There is basically no gore, just a bleeding finger.<br /><br />Revenge from the grave is trite and unrealistic and it was done very poorly in this movie. The shove-it-all-down-your-throat ending was expected and not appreciated.<br /><br />I can't say I cared if any of the characters lived or died, they were all irritating and unintelligent.<br /><br />A generous 4 stars is all I can muster.
