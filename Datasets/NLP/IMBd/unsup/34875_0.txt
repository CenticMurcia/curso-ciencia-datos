Since this movie wanders randomly all over the place, I thought I'd follow suit and offer some random thoughts: <br /><br />Ever notice how all movie-length cartoons are starting to look the same? All the characters have a handful of human-like expressions that are supposed to make the viewer identify with them, and these expressions are recycled over and over and over from one movie to the next. Watch the eyes, for example; they don't hold in one place, the character will say something and the eyes will go down a little bit, then to the side a little bit. The mouth will open to indicate realization. The eyebrows will raise to indicate hope. The brow will furrow to indicate contemplation. And there's always a smartass female character who won't take no guff from the men in the movie. This is why this movie failed, because it's exactly like every other cartoon movie made over the last fifteen years.<br /><br />Why on earth should there be male and female robots? Don't think about this too hard.<br /><br />Robin Williams is becoming increasingly irritating as he ages. In twenty years, his voice can be used to sandblast ships in dry dock. Mork needs to go back to Ork already. PLEASE.<br /><br />Why all the pop culture references? Because the writers were too lazy/uncreative/unmotivated to write a better script, that's why. Instead of a clever parody of technology, we get references to Britney Spears and 2001 a space odyssey. BFD.<br /><br />Why doesn't Madame Gasket have access to the most sophisticated robotics in the entire world of robotdom? She should have been able to wipe out Rodney and his friends with a snap of her fingers. Instead, five robots take out hundreds. Doesn't make any sense.<br /><br />I don't care about the robot's mission, their plight, their suffering. When something breaks, you fix it. So? What's the problem? Ratchet wants to sell upgrades instead of parts. Well doesn't Ratchet need parts too? Hard to understand. Don't think about it too hard.<br /><br />Why in the world does Rodney "grow" from an "infant" to an "adult"? Don't think about this too hard.<br /><br />Is there any point to this movie? What did the robots accomplish in the end, the right to have spare parts instead of upgrades? Wouldn't you really rather have an upgrade than the same old parts? Given a choice between the stock part and a superior aftermarket upgrade, anyone would want an upgrade.
