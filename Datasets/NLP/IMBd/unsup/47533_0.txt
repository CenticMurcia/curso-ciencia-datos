This movie is a heavy-handed collision of Gorillas in the Mist and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. Seriously.<br /><br />Somewhere in the muddle is some kind of message about man's eco-place in the natural environment. Or something like that.<br /><br />We get Anthony Hopkins living among Gorillas (but he doesn't run into Sigourney Weaver, go figure) until he gets arrested and flown back to the US to face charges. An eager young med student named Cuba Gooding Jr is volunteered by Donald Sutherland to conduct a psych evaluation on Hopkins.<br /><br />Well, it takes one minute for Cuba to break through the primitive wall of silence Hopkins has constructed. And before you can say Jack Nicholson, Hopkins has the assorted criminal loons on his side. Which is supposed to be all uplifting.<br /><br />Skip this. Watch Cuckoo's Nest, Gorillas in the Mist and Silence of the Lambs instead.
