This film is awful in the sense that it is loosely based on 'While You Were Sleeping'. I was expecting more from this film, but was disappointed. In 'While You Were Sleeping', the relationship develop slowly and we fall in love with the characters, but here..it is a total waste up. Particularly, because Salman tried hard to acts funny, but he wasn't able to make quite an impression.There are just too many co-incidental events which makes the film illogical. Trust me, you shouldn't waste your money on this movie
