I've been dragged to this movie by my friends and i must say that i hated every minute of this movie! it was like PLEEEASE MAKE IT STOP! Just the idea of making a movie out of a story like that puts me off. The english cinema has great movies, but this one is not one of them 4 sure! Highly overrated! And i wish the european cinema in general would get rid of this "realism"...
