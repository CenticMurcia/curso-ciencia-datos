I'm really sick of these movies talking about the Israelo-American conspiracy against Egyptians, trust me they don't even bother to think about us! Egyptians are respected everywhere except in Egypt! Movies like these only convince Egyptians that they are inferior than other peoples and have only a negative impact.. it only accentuate their internal sufferings and make them more hostile towards the western world.. Please stop it!<br /><br />And I'm really shocked that Youssef Chahine is that famous.. I can't understand why?!<br /><br />This movie has nothing special, nothing impressive, wired story, wired philosophy, very dramatical, theatrical performance from all the actors, very basic cinematography!! what's going on?<br /><br />This old fashioned way, that Egyptian filmmakers are never getting over it, of making the same actor do the father and son and grandfather and grandson... Mercyyy!! <br /><br />He tries to give the film a hollywoodian look by putting as many sex scenes as possible even if some of them are unnecessary!
