This film really just comes across as a very belated and totally redundant sequel and has very little point to it at all.<br /><br />The story of the film being that that the neighbouring town takes in the killer children of the original film just seems a stretch, why would they take in children who appear to have killed every single adult - more to the point did they not notice that the town next door was missing it's entire adult population.<br /><br />That's pretty much the side story though as the main story follows a news reporter and his son visiting the town with the father trying to get the story of the original film - he also gets an extremely unpleasant to watch love scene with the woman he's renting from. The son also falls for a hot girl from the town but alas she stays fully clothed. Also living in the house is the new leader of the cult who at least looks slightly closer to childhood than Isaac in the first film.<br /><br />There is a Native American subplot relating to the Corn Cult which is unnecessary and just confuses the story.<br /><br />The film is not quite without merit but when the credits roll there is a strong feeling of what was the point, and "He who walks behind the rows" is mentioned so many times I wanted to throw the DVD case at the screen.
