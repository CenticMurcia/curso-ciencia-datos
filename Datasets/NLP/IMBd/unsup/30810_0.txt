The Fans of "Star Wars - Clone Wars" may tar and feather me for my opinion, but after seeing this on TV a few months ago (aired directly after the original "Star Wars - Attack of the Clones"-Picture) i was extremely disappointed. As a "Star Wars"-Fan since 1977 i expected something, that surely will not par up to George Lucas original movies, but a least pay homage to the original movies, but after 15 Minutes i turned the TV off. The cheap animation (boldly called in another comment "state-of-the-art"...) was on the roughest level, The movings, explosions and laser-shots was always the same animation-cels reused and reused, the depicting of the actors in his animated forms was ridiculous, the dialogue was extremely stupid... i can't help, i simply did not like this film! It was an insult to George Lucas original movies for me! The next shock for me was to search here on the IMDb for it... Rating 8.1!! Come on: Ed Wood (in drunken condition) would it done better! Everyone has it's own opinion, but i did not like this film, and no power (even not "the force" :-) will force me to see the whole thing!
