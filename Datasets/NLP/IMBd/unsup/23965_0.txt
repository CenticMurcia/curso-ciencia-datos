This is the only American made film in the whole list. Why? because unlike every single other martial arts American movie this film actually seems like it was made in Hong Kong. It is that good. Directed by Chinese-American Steve Wang this film was the first film to use film and fighting techniques later used by such films as The Matrix. The fight choreography is absolutely amazing just like a Hong Kong movie. Credit must go to the brilliant Japanese martial arts choreographer Koichi Sakamoto and his Alpha Stunt team for their ingenuity, Mark Dacascos is amazing in this film and proves that he could cut it in Hong Kong movies if he wanted too. Kadeem Hardison is brilliant as the wise cracking sidekick unwillingly brought into the thick of things by Mark Dacascos. Brittany Murphy is also a revelation here as a (very!) sexually hormone charged teenager. In fact the scenes with her, Kadeem Hardison and Mark Dacascos are probably the funniest in the film, although it is a shame she wasn't in the film for longer.<br /><br />Also this film is also very very funny at times. And Mark Dacascos even makes Jet Li look a bit slow with his brilliant acrobatic ability. In fact this film is so good that it sweeped countless film awards across the world and even beating Jackie Chan's Drunken Master II to a film award. For a film released in 1994 it is very hard to find. But trust me your patience will pay off when you watch this film. This film deserves to be re-released in the cinemas. It was only a flop because the studio didn't promote it at all! Although it is now regaining cult status for martial arts fans as a fantastic piece of film. This is how modern martial arts movies should be. At the end of this film it will have you crying out "more please!". It is that good. This is a classic no doubt about it.
