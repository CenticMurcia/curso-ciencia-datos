Man this movie is a pearl... of trash! Already the sub-title says it all: "The Terminator meets the last Mohican"... YEAH!!! Awful dialogues, awful settings, awful actors. This movie picks up all the bad sides from "Terminator" and from Carpenter's "1997", and the hero's Last-Mohican face fits like a punch in your stomach. I liked especially the cyborg looking like a man in his fifties, with mustaches and "evil" look in his eyes... this movie is a MUST for all trash lovers!
