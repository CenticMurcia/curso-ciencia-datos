I can NOT believe it!!! I just "discovered" Freaks and Geeks and I gotta admit that at first it took me some time to get into it because I was kind of expecting a more broad, punchline based comedy but the more episodes I watched, the more I started to really dig this show AND to love the characters and I really mean LOVE! Except for Undeclared, there is not ONE TV show which develops such really and truly lovable characters. You start to feel for them in every step they take throughout the episodes. Freaks and geeks made me cry. It made me freak out. It made me jump around in my room.<br /><br />That it got canceled just proves once more that no one realizes anymore what a good show is supposed to achieve. To create characters whose progression in their lives is worth watching. Just as Undeclared, which also got canceled after one season, this show is a stroke of genius which every fan of a good TV-show and yet every fan of something good at all, should watch.<br /><br />And now I'm sitting here, disappointed that I will NEVER get to know how Freaks and Geeks could have continued. It's just good to know that the makers of this are still out there doing the best comedies around.
