"Too Many Husbands" impressed me as the best of the three main versions of this plot (the others being "My Favorite Wife" and "Move Over Darling"). Only in "Too Many Husbands" did I get a distinct sense of the terrible dilemma faced by the spouse who has to make a choice. This is because in this version alone are the two competing spouses portrayed as equally worthy, charming, and attractive by actors who were close to one another in those qualities, as well as in their respective levels of stardom at the time the film was made. In both "My Favorite Wife" and "Move Over Darling", it is quite clear, from the portrayal of one of the competing spouses and from the casting of a lesser star in the role, whom we are supposed to be rooting for. Not so in "Too Many Husbands". Douglas and MacMurray are very near equals in star power and in the way their characters are written and portrayed. Unlike the other two films, this results in as real a conflict for the viewer as it does for Jean Arthur's character. Unfortunately, it also results in the movie's weakest point--the ending (or lack of one). The dilemma was apparently so strong that the film makers themselves were unable to decide. After having Arthur's character seemingly make her choice, they tacked on a rather strange ambiguous ending suggesting that the "losing" husband might still have a chance. The effect is a non-ending that suggests the film makers couldn't make up their minds, so they just turned off the camera.
