I was only a kid when this movie came out and it made a real impression on me. I already thought that Burt Reynolds was just about the coolest dude around (I wanted his black Trans Am so badly!) so the chances were pretty high that I would like it regardless of whether it was a good film or not. I ended up recording a copy off TV and pretty much burned out the tape watching the flick over and over again (Cannonball Run II as well). As I recently prepared to watch the film for the first time as an adult, I was a bit concerned that it wouldn't stand up to the high acclaim I had awarded it as a kid...particularly after noting the poor rating it has here on IMDb. Nevertheless, as I kicked back and turned it on I was immediately giddy with the initial scene of the Lamborghini chicks really putting the machine through the gears. While the humour is admittedly silly, that is what the movie is about - it's a silly but extremely entertaining movie with hot 80s chicks and fast cars. If you want to catch a fun movie with major nostalgia - take the Cannonball Run for a test drive! Don't let the ratings here turn you off, this movie is a blast.
