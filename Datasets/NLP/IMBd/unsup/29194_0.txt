There are some works which smack of being surreal just for the sake of being surreal, where you get the feeling the artist just got tired and threw anything together mindlessly in the hopes that someone will come across it and yell "Eureka! How surrealistic!!" Fantôme de la liberté IS NOT one of those films.<br /><br />It is a taut piece of work where every set up, every punch-line, every reveal is precise and calculated. Every storyline weaves into each other seamlessly, and though each of these characters could take up a full film themselves, their individual story lines feel resolved and complete. Luis Buñuel has precisely constructed a work that preys on our society's monotony, while at the same time pointing out the insanity that lies within all of us.<br /><br />What moved me the most was how, after basically watching movies since I was born, I realized just how programmed I was to the standard structure of film narrative that each transition by Buñuel struck even more drastically than the last.<br /><br />Some would say that you should watch the movie being open for anything; I disagree. I say, watch the movie with every notion and every expectation that you bring to any movie you see; it only makes the movie that much more meaningful.
