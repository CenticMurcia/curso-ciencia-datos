We picked up this movie at the video rental store thinking that this would give us a good laugh, and that's exactly what happened, although the laughter was really just mocking what a lame movie Uncle Sam is. There were so many things TO laugh at: the plot was completely lame, the dialogue unrealistic, the acting terrible, yet I still think that for as bad as it was, it should have been funnier. There have been many "horror movies" that have been as low budget and bad as this one, like Jack Frost for instance, but something about this one was just not as funny. Maybe it was almost TOO bad to be funny. This movie is completely pathetic, but oh well- it was a cheap low budget film, what else can be expected?
