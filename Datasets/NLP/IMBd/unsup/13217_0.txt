This picture was released on July 6 1976 starring David Carradine as Coy Cannonball Buckman, Bill McKinney as Cade Redman and Veronica Hamel as Linda Maxwell. A former employee rips off his own Death Race 2000 in this mindless car-crash saga, containing more twisted metal than a bombed-out steel mill. The nominal storyline concerns an illegal auto race from Los Angeles to New York that promises the winner 100,000 dollars. Coy "Cannonball" Buckman, is the race leader who drags his girlfriend, Linda along for the ride. Linda is not very happy to be the passenger in this race because she has has a job and a boss to answer too. Cade Redman tools around in a loud red Trans Am, while Cannonball's nemesis barrels along in a big, black Plymouth, trying to outsmart Cannonball at every turn and exit ramp. Things start to go wrong as cars start breaking down and you need money to fix them. The only way to fix them is with your sponsor's money but there's no which means no money. I bought this movie because of Veronica Hamel and she was a big disappointment. Even though this movie had a leading actress her performance was not good so I give this movie 4 weasel stars.
