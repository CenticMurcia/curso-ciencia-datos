I won't spoil the ending, but I will talk about the (paper thin) plot, that's why I put the spoiler alert/tag. If you haven't seen the movie, but have plans to do so (although I wouldn't recommend that as you can see by my voting), I'd tell you not to read this beforehand.<br /><br />This movie is in the vain of similar torture movies (or "gorno" as they are called). While the American business man is supposed to be a everyday man we (or let's say a "western" audience) can relate to, but still stay ambiguous enough, that never fully gets "exploited". Instead it's more exploitation and in a bad way. Robbing a man of his "senses" and making it as painful as possible. But watching this is even more painful, especially because it is as predictable as it can get. While Saw (at least the first one) had an intelligent twist to the whole thing, this movie tries to disguise the whole torture thing with a social commentary, that just doesn't work ...<br /><br />What I didn't know, but read here on IMDb, is the fact, that this was based on a novel. As a read this might have been more interesting, but after watching the movie, I don't feel the need for more ... "torture"
