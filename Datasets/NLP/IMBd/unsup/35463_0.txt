Oh my god - I've lost my faith in Steven Seagal. He's horrible.<br /><br />This movie is absolute junk. The story was lame - there's absolutely zero excitement to the movie. And Seagal doesn't even fight in this movie, I mean c'mon.. what is that? They just show somebody's hand and after that they show Seagals face. It looks stupid and not real at all.<br /><br />Besides the story is so goddamn crappy and unbelievable anyways. The story is based on the "fact" that these guys are going to steal plutonium from a nuclear disposal center or something. The thing just is that you can't make a nuke from plutonium like that - the plutonium has to be enriched first in some weapons facility. Regular plutonium is something like 5% strong - the plutonium used in nukes is 80% stuff. You just don't steal stuff like that - especially NOT IN A LUNCH CUP as they did in the movie.<br /><br />Don't buy this movie. I spent my money on nothing.
