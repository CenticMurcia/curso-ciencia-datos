This story is about a rich, arrogant, spoiled nephew who is a potential beneficiary of his billionaire uncle's estate. Jason Stevens hasn't worked a day in his life and just expects to have life fed to him a a silver platter.<br /><br />But, he finds that in order to to collect his inheritance he will need to successfully complete 12 monthly 'assignments' leading to what his uncle calls the "Ultimate Gift." The journey that Jason takes will surely make this one of the most heart warming and memorable films you will ever see. My 13 year old son was almost in tears while watching this. It's a movie for young and old alike.<br /><br />Touching performances by Abigail Breslin (Little Miss Sunshine) and other seasoned actors such as Drew Fuller, James Garner, Brian Dennehy, and Lee Merriwether will hopefully take this movie to the Oscars!
