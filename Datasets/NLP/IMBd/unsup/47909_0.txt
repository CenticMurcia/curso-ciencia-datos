I'm a huge Beatles fan...But I still have to be honest. I'm not sure why some people gave this such a good review. The only way to view it is as a home movie. The music is good, but to be entirely honest, the movie is pretty bad. I've watched 4 or 5 times and it doesn't really improve much. Claims that it is 'underrated' and 'ahead of its time' are absurd. Yes, there are some good moments. "The Fool on the Hill" and "I Am the Walrus" are good, and there are a few laughs in the mix, but I think it's really for fans only. I don't even lend my copy to anyone, because I know that my friends will all hate it.<br /><br />The truly shocking thing is that this was produced in the same year that they Beatles recorded "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band". They went from their greatest triumph to their greatest failure in the same year.
