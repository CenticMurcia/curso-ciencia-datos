Hey! I got an idea, let's make a movie with no plot, mediocore fight scenes, horrible acting and crappy special effects! Oh wait... someone already did it. It's called Mortal Kombat Annihilation. A bunch of random fight scenes strung together with an invisible plot, or was it even there at all? Special FX weren't THAT bad for most of the movie but the end fight scene graphics were the worst I've seen in a while. Fight scenes were crappy. The only good one was when Raiden was fighting all the Reptiles, that was actually pretty cool. Thanks to the Martial Arts genius of Ray Park. He is a god. This movie was crap. Don't even waste your time watching it on network television. I made the mistake of seeing this movie in a theater. *Shudder*
