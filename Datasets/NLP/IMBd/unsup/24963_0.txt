"Tee for Two", despite being so simple and predictable, is different at the same time because it is one of those Tom & Jerry's cartoons all about sports (in this case, golf). There aren't many of these cartoons that deal with sports.<br /><br />Good or not? For me, yes, although not one of their best. Anyway, it's entertaining and great fun. The story is a little uninspiring, but the cartoon is alright. As for the artwork, it is simplistic yet acceptable. The golf course, however, is reasonably drawn and looks quite a pleasant and relaxing place to play golf, enjoy silence (no major noises in there), pure air, pure nature and a blue and sunny sky.<br /><br />Among the funniest gags, already in the beginning there is a good one: whenever Tom tries to make the ball go into the hole, it bounces out. This happens some 3 or 4 times until we realize that Jerry lives in that hole and is the responsible for the bounced out ball. This is followed by another funny gag, when the last ball comes out lodging into Tom's eye and Jerry draws an eyeball on it. Another one of the funniest parts is when Tom is trying to locate the ball far off into the distance and Jerry whistles to him after a while only to reveal he had the ball the whole time. Tom responds by washing Jerry in the ball cleaner. Jerry then responds by spitting water in Tom's face.<br /><br />The gag of Tom with the fur like a French Poodle is silly, but the only gag I hate is when Tom gets an explosive reception by the bees under the water. It is almost brutal to see.<br /><br />Nevertheless, with Tom and Jerry it's always like this: on one hand, they can't stand each other - but on the other hand, they can't live without each other.
