this movie has a lot of old ideas all mixed into one, yet it doesn't look messy, several teen agers try and open a night club, on "holy ground" without noticing, one of the teenagers finds a girl but her mother is the local "crazy person" they ignore her about this but it was a bad move, when the club is up and running the fun begins, from maggots to wall of dead, its a fun thrill ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat. This movie wasn't one that was supposed to be taken serious, it has snoop dogg so if you came for a serious movie then you are pretty much crazy... It Is a lot of fun to watch, it has a a lot of funny moments, a few sad moments a few scary moments and even some dramatic moments but the main point of the film is to entertain, people are really hard on this film because they expected a masterpiece but if you just want to have a fun time enjoying a movie then this one should do!
