Who the hell are Herman's Hermits? Quite clearly I'm not familiar enough with all those 60s rip-off bands of The Beatles. MBYGALD shows that even bands who've got personalities as colourful and diverse as a bunch of accountants and librarians going on a fishing trip can be offered to make a movie in which this absolutely amazing collective charisma is supposed to set the screen on fire. I half-enjoyed the first 10-15 minutes solely due the nice photography and colourful 60s England, but this quickly wore off, leaving me to yawn like a walrus at the rest. The songs are mostly vomit-inducing, safe, uninspired drivel, and the dialogues even worse: whether a mouth opens to sing or talk, it only ejects vomitus. The daft humour is strictly for very young children and the Zurueckgebliebenen. I finally gave up on the film about halfway into it, preferring instead to devise ways of torture to be implemented on its demented, sadistic producers. On the other hand, the financial failure this little movie must have been during its release was probably enough punishment for them as it is...
