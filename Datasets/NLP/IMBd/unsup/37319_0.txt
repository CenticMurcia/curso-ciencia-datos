Like many religious movies and TV shorts that the industry makes, the industry seems to be confused in regards to God and His Will. Such was the case with "The Soul Collector". I was enjoying watching the movie till it was implied that the soul collector or angel had sex relations outside of marriage. I don't know of any religion that condones sex outside of marriage, but they would probably say that it was that sin that greatly contributes to the population in hell. This movie was sacrilegious and greatly disrespectful to the Angels of God, by implying that any messengers of God would perform any act that is strictly against God's law. I am surprised that the movie was recently shown on "Lifetime (Original)" on Cox cable,if I am correct? If the movie or TV industry cannot make a religious movie without showing the messengers of God having teenage puberty sex outside of marriage, then they should not make any religious movie, because they do not know how to make a religious movie. Sincerely, Craig.
