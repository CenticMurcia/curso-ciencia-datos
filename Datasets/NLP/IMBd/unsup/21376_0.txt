Enjoyed viewing this great film classic and the great acting of Kay Francis (Georgiana Summers),"Play Girl",'41 who loved to fool around with George Brent("Bob" McNear),"The Great Lie",'41 who was a married man. It seemed that everyone else in the picture played husband and wife with lots of infidelity and everyone telling little white lies about who is married to who and why we have to have different rooms to sleep in and why we have twin beds in our rooms. It seems that being divorced was a very evil thing and talking about their "EX" husbands was the in THING!. Genevieve Tobin (Betty Summers),"The Petrified Forest",'36 and John Eldridge (Lawrence Thurston),"Superman",'73 enjoyed stealing automobiles(coupe type) and even going into being a jewel thief. It was great viewing this film and seeing just what people were watching during the YEAR 1935. This film was probably considered X rated. The old gas stations, furniture and women's fashions, plus the modern auto's in the 1930's made this a great film classic with all these young actors starting out in their film careers.<br /><br />
