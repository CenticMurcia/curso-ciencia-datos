This is a perfect Sunday afternoon film, when you're stuffed with roast and vegging on the sofa.<br /><br />The plot is nowhere to be seen, but the film ambles along in a series of sketches and setpieces usually involving Dundee being amazed by the crazy Americans and coming up with some Australian saying to sum up the situation.<br /><br />'Gay, well I am kinda happy' Yay Mick, you show those Americans who's boss.<br /><br />In summary, a ludicrous film, but I really enjoyed it. And I agree with crocodile dundee about coffee enemas. 'Don't order a coffee here, you might not like how they serve it'
