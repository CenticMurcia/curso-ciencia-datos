Oh, no! Here comes another dubbed "Godzilla" export! There's so much about this movie that's easy to complain about. If Japan's supposed to be wizards in the video game/electronic industries, why are the special effects so bad? Second of all, the acting is terrible, the plot is pointless, and the ending line is just plain embarrassing..."there's a Godzilla in every one of us." I laughed at most of this movie when I should be biting my nails. A monster movie fan may enjoy this, but I didn't.
