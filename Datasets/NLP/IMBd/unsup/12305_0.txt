This second installment stands on its own as a good movie but is not qualified as a sequel to the Nightmare series, in that many of the rules set by Craven in the 1st part have been broken in this one. For example, hmmm... I thought Freddy only has power in the dream world, but since when he's able to possess human body in the real world? Come on, this is not an Exorcist movie!!!<br /><br />The fright & gore are good. The helplessness as well as loneliness of the lead character (Jesse) really help augment the horror atmosphere of the film in that, to me, the less main characters there are in this type of movie, the more horrifying the film will be (just like part 1)!<br /><br />
