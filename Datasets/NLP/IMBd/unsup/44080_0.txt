Sure Ice-T is cool and Michael Madsen is cool in strange way and Eric Roberts has a cool sister. Unfortunately she wasn't in "The Alternate". I've seen thousands of films and this has got to be the baddest yet, not bad in the good sense, just plain bad. The "action" scenes were among the poorest I've EVER seen, or Eric is just plain good at dodging the several million rounds fired at him. His Glock should be investigated as it held in the neighborhood of 100+ rounds between reloads, perhaps that's why he couldn't hit anything-the thing was too heavy from all the bullets. The director, who's name I choose to forget and I hope Hollywood does likewise, should be given one more chance, to direct a kindergarten play in Spudville, Idaho. I will admit that Eric's use of the action verb "GAACK" several times was one of the thrilling moments of the film, perhaps the apex.
