i think i prefer the original "hackers" to this, at least it had some humor value. "takedown", when you take into perspective the articles/books john markoff has written about his dealings with kevin mitnick [and the subsequent bling-bling-cash-money], is just a lot of lipservice for him and shimomura.<br /><br />but if you ignore the flawed story, "takedown" is still mediocre. the editor should have laid off the speed, we could have done without the mutiple "rotating shimomura" shots. imo, rotating phonebooths are much more 1337, if that's the effect the producers were hoping for.<br /><br />logue and ulrich did a decent job however. wong came off too mellow for what i took to be a rather intense corporate hacker.<br /><br />if you want a decent hacker movie, go find "freedom downtime," or "wargames" which is infinitely more fun.
