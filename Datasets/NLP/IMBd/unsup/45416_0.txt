I hate to see Terry Farrell's talents go to waste. Terry Farrell played Major Agatha Doyle in this movie, but only to put her talents to waste.<br /><br />The movie was so boring that if I didn't have Terry Farrell, it would flop. Same storyline as Agatha Christie's Ten Little Niggers, and honestly, I was bored to death by this book.<br /><br />I give the 4/10 just because of Terry Farrell.
