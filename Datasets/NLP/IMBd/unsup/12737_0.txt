The magic of this movie sneaks up on you. Our heroine, Fiona, is a quiet child, who tends to isolate herself. At first, we think this is a gentle tale of a lonely little girl. Woven through the mystery, and then the magic of the tale is the common child's lament, "no one ever listens to me, no one ever believes me". And Fiona uncovers a mystery that is fairly unbelieveable!<br /><br />The old sorrow of her family is in the tale of her lost baby brother, who's cradle washed away out to sea one day. Local legends tell of silkies, wonderful creatures who are seals in the water, and beautiful women on land. It is said that Finona's baby brother is now being brought up by the silkies, and there is some reason to think she may be correct!
