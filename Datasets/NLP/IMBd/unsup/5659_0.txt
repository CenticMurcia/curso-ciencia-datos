The Bad Old Days indeed! As a New Yorker, I found this film to be a grim reminder of how much more lawless and dilapidated New York was during this time period.<br /><br />I won't rehash the generally accurate comments of the other reviewers other than to say that this is one of the best cinematic deglamorizations of crime (and law enforcement) ever.<br /><br />Anthony Franciosa is just great as a Mafia enforcer. He's still the same nice, personable guy people my age remember from 60s and 70s television. You really want to be his friend. A great smile and a comforting manner. A demeanor he maintains without a crease while he maims, tortures and kills! One of the most skilled---and frightening---performances of all time. Anthony Quinn is also excellent as a corrupt police captain who has deluded himself into believing that he still has some ethics.<br /><br />The graphic violence, sex, profanity, and ethnic slurs take it light years out of the family viewing category and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with a weak stomach. I don't think the "blaxploitation" label many apply to this film is accurate. The best I can think of is "noir verite". Don't miss this one!
