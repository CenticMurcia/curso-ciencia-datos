is those episodes real or false.They seem to be so,well balanced.That i feel that.There has to be some truth to at least most of those great episodes.If there is truth to any of those,great shows.Is there any body a live to confirm this.Very curious to know. Is there any one out there,who has information on this.Is the host of the show still alive.Where do i find more episodes of this wonderful show.Is there a DVD collection out there.Is there ever going to be,another series like this one.Since that show was on i have never gotten a feeling of just wanting more,and more out of a show.So i hope.That there will be a show like that in the near future.That could give the same feelings that this show did.
