Har Dil Jo Pyaar Karega has all the ingredients needed to make this movie a hit. A great cast as well as songs.<br /><br />The movie starts out with Raj (Salman Khan) going to Mumbai from Goa hoping to make it big in the music industry. But he finds out that things aren't as easy as they seem to be and he ends up staying at his friend's place. One night, he witnesses an accident and ends up saving the life of Pooja (Rani Mukherjee). Her family thinks that Raj is Pooja's husband as she left home to marry the guy she loves. Raj is not given a chance to explain but then he realizes that this is the opportunity he's been waiting for because her family was very rich. Pooja ends up in a coma but she can hear and see whatever is going on. Pooja's best friend, Jhanvi (Preity Zinta) comes in from the US after hearing about her accident and she meets Raj. She falls for him but doesn't do anything because she thinks that Raj is Pooja's husband. After she finds out that it is not true, she starts to fall in love with him. In the meantime, Pooja has also started falling in love with Raj and when she wakes up from her coma, she identifies Raj as her husband although that is not true.<br /><br />The rest of the story deals with how the situation is resolved and who finally gets Raj. It is a pretty good movie, but the first half was too long. There is only one song in there which I really like, and that is 'Piya Piya'. The acting done by both the actresses was excellent! As for Salman, he overdoes it in some scenes and he really should think about getting another dress designer for himself! But, other than that, it is a watchable movie. Fans of Rani and Preity should definitely watch this movie!
