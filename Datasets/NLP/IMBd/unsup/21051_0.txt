Morgan Freeman's performance is the only reason to see this movie. Any life the movie has is supplied by him, and quite frankly, its really boring when he's not on the screen. <br /><br />Chris Reeve has a story published about a pimp who is a little too close in description to Freeman, so the D.A. wants all his notes about the interviews. Trouble is, Reeve made up the whole thing. He has no access to the man. But he gets close to him anyway, thanks to Kathy Baker's hooker with social skills. <br /><br />So the D.A. and the courts do not leave Reeve alone, and he soon regrets his own imagination. Freeman commits crimes that put Reeve in jail, because now he has obstructed justice. <br /><br />Mimi Rogers is seen briefly as Reeve's white bread counterpart. There is a stupid scene between her and the late Rick Aviles in a bar that does not seem to serve any purpose. <br /><br />Very little happens of significance. I appreciate this movie if it gave Morgan a chance to be in other movies, and of course his Oscar nomination didn't hurt, I am sure. <br /><br />Movie is beneath him now, though. And me, too. 4/10.
