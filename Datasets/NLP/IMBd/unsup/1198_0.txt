I've watched Danny Fendley in probably 10 or more films and he can do a really good job IF he is interested in the part. He obviously wasn't to thrilled with this one. You can watch his work and tell if he likes the script. He can be a very high caliber, talented actor but he basically just went through the motions on this one. There was a nice chemistry between Fendley and Brigette Neilson, it's to bad that they didn't have more time to work together on the film. The story plot of this film lacked and the directing and editing were also sub par. Speaking of Directing, I've also seen improvement in Donald Farmers work as a director. As for the rest of the actors Dana Plato did a good job and was well suited for her role. She has a perky attitude that is demanding of attention.
