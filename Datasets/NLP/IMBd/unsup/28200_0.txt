This was a very enjoyable film, but is very difficult to get access to.<br /><br />I saw it on broadcast television while in Portland.<br /><br />The film has wicked British wit, and has heavy surrealistic aspects to its production. Don't try to watch the movie from a causality standpoint (if A and B then C), just sit back and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />If you can't stand surrealism, or if your movies MUST have a plot, steer clear of this title.<br /><br />This is not really a spoiler, but don't read further if you just want the full impact of this wacky title.<br /><br />The main character is dreadfully afraid that he is going to turn into an English Bed Sitting Room (a room in a house: Wikipedia "bed sitting room") All of this occurs against the backdrop of the world after it has been nuked to a trash pile. If this doesn't tell you how odd this film is, nothing will.<br /><br />I laughed so hard while watching this movie, I thought I was going to wet myself.
