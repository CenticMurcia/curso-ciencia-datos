OK, so I will admit that I did a thing with this movie that I absolutely hate to do...I turned it off halfway through.<br /><br />The storyline definitely seemed appealing, especially to me as a woman as there have been a great deal of movies about older women with younger guys, but finally here was a film where the opposite was true. But, the greatest problem with the film was the lack of chemistry between the two main characters. When they acted like they were together it wasn't believable, Baldwin particularly seeming the most uncomfortable out of the two.<br /><br />Another thing that seemed to confuse me about the film was...well to be blunt..how confusing it was!! One minute she was angry at him, a pure anger that would leave any female audience member chanting her on in a supportive manner. But then suddenly...the anger was gone and 'Archie' was able to act in the same (slightly patronising in my opinion) manner as before.<br /><br />OK, so final thought on this film is if you really like the actors and storyline give a go, certainly as this comment is only based on half of the film. For me personally, it lacked the potential that the storyline possessed and I hope that somebody else takes a shot at it.
