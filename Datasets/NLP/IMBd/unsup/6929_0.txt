There are some days which you feel yourself very tired and need to be happy. She's So Lovely is very entertaining film which makes you to feel great. First of all, it was great to see two amazing actor Sean Penn and John Travolta together (pre- The Thin Red Line). Sean Penn gave Oscar-worthy performance, Robin Wright Penn was just great, Travolta was very charismatic and great as always. Film also memorable for performances of actors like James Gandolfini, Debi Mazar and Harry Dean Stanton. It is very absurd, original and funny look to "what can love to do to people? Especially these people are bad!?". I really enjoyed while watching this movie. For my idea film's most funny moments were final scene, dance scene and all scenes of Sean Penn but I want to say that if you're fan of John Travolta like me, don't miss that!
