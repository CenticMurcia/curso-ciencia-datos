Produced and directed by Roger Corman. Very low budget. A monster that to look at is laughable, not fearsome. A story line very much like so many to follow. An entity from outer space comes to our world and needs to enter human bodies in order to conquer it. A once respected scientist(Lee Van Cleef)has the ability to communicate with the invader and wants to be part of the super intellectual take over. His best friend (Peter Graves)is a rocket scientist that unknowingly provided the invader from Venus a way to arrive on earth.<br /><br />The movie of course poses a frightening event in an innocent time. Mr. Graves plays his role very calm with little emotion to speak of. The rest of the cast seems way over the top. The cast includes Beverly Garland, Russ Bender, Sally Fraser and Dick Miller.<br /><br />If the appearance of the monster was left to our imagination, it might have been more thrilling. But we get so disappointed without a creature of some sort to fuel our fears. It came and it conquered...well, conquered for almost an hour.
