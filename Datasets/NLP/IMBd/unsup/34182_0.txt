Mad Dog and Glory" don't let the catchy title and blockbuster cast of Robert Deniro, Uma Thurman, and Bill Murray fool you, this is a bad movie from 1993. Yes despite this talent of stars, the movie is a big let down for fans of Deniro's and Thurmans. However Bill Murray gives perhaps one of his comedic/dramatic performances ever. In fact not surprising<br /><br />As far Deniro goes though, his performance is bloody awful. Some people say an actor acts "effortlessly:" when he gives a good performance, however in Deniro's case that seems to be opposite as their is hardly any acting all. However, this stems from the fact that most of the characters in Mad Dog and Glory are utterly weak and pathetic, with the exception of Murray.<br /><br />In fact I still found the movie hard to watch despite Murray's performance. The plot of the movie is that bumbling cop (Deniro) name Mad Dog Doobie stumbles onto a robbery in progress. He sees a man holding up a liquor store with a tall man (Murray) as the hostage. Murray's character is a riot, telling Mad Dog to blow away the sucker like Dirty Harry.<br /><br />Mad Dog doesn't catch the person and the assailant escapes, though I believe he is captured later on though that isn't relevant here.\ Murray's character as we learn is a top and tough Mafia Boss named Frank Milo. Milo is quite a character almost larger than life, he demands respect and if you cross him your dead. Milo though loves Mad Dog as he has just saved his life in this holdup. Milo knowing that Mad Dog is a cop (although not a good one) offers his services as a Mafia boss to Mad Dog.<br /><br />Dobie refuses using one of the few morals he has, however Milo comes up with another proposition, he wants to be Dobie's "friend". LOL In fact he wont take no for an answer. Dobie accepts for the mean time, not seeing any harm in that. Milo eventually introduces the lame brain cop to his new girl "Glory" (Uma Thurman) an attractive woman who we learn is Milo's main squeeze, however better put, she is a prostitute, she is one of many objects that Milo "owns".<br /><br />When Dobie sees Glory and Milo offers "Glory's" services (i.e sex). Dobie refuses. It seems this cop ctually lives up to his mom of being clean unlike other corrupt cops or is he? (Some possible spoilers)<br /><br />Well not exactly, despite Dobie's claim that he is a good cop and he is sworn to upload the law, he breaks his own rules and laws and decides to "borrow" Glory. When he is through with the companionship, he agrees to give her up. Trouble is he doesn't. When Milo comes looking for Glory an altercation erupts that basically sets up the conflict and what happens in the rest of the movie. Milo wants Glory back at any price. He is willing do anything including messing up Dobie's life to do it.<br /><br />I actually made that sound more interesting that it really is. "Mad Dog and Glory" is essentially a part black comedy and part dramatic film. Problem is it wasn't that funny really in the areas I should of probably because of the set of repugnant characters on screen no matter how dysfunctional and stupid they are.<br /><br />A cop who despite his own morals decides to break them when it suits em, doesnt obviously appeal to me or audience. Glorys character despite being the "victim" of sorts doesn't always come out. In a couple of scenarios her reactions dont have the reactions that a victim would have.<br /><br />However as far as performances go I definitely think Uma Thurman did a much better job and any good critic could see that as her character is much more complex that Deniro's.<br /><br />Still not a great film that I would recommend, the 6.0 average on here is obviously done to amp this subpar film.
