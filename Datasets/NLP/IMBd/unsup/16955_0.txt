Because of the star power and emotional power of its contemporaries -- Coming Home,The Deer Hunter, and Apocalypse Now -- Go Tell the Spartans gets little recognition. But it is truly a hidden gem. Set early in the period of American involvement in Vietnam, it gives us a more realistic portrayal of the complexities and contradictions of that war. Burt Lancaster is superb as the dedicated, yet tortured, soldier who must try to deal with a situation that he increasingly recognizes as being, at best, untenable. This film is worthy of the kind of special treatment and commentary that accompanies the "special edition" releases of quality films on DVD. No serious examination of the portrayal of Vietnam War issues in American films can overlook Go Tell the Spartans.<br /><br />
