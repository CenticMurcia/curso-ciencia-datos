Well that is interesting that this was supposed to be a sequel to that movie, though it most definitely does not play out like the famous cartoon at all. Looks like they had to have rewritten the script because this movie quite frankly seems to be a little dark to be a follow up to that movie. That and the fact it goes in a total different direction. What we get is a rather bad Jean Claude Van Dame movie with the same old stuff you would expect with his movies, and a few differing things. Such as the future setting, the bolt guns, and the plot which has some originality in it. Still though, in the end it boils down to a fight between Van Dame and the bad guy, in the rain. You can expect lots of kick boxing action, and the cyborg you ask? Almost a needless part of the plot as she is a rather weak cyborg with no fighting skills or anything that would even indicate she is any different than a human. The only special about her is that she has a cure to some disease. So you may want to check this little movie out as I do believe it was a theatrically released movie, just don't expect much. Another funny part about this movie is that they give the main villain a handicap...you are not supposed to give the villain a handicap that would make the good guy look like a wimp when he wins.
