Kisses And Caroms is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a while. I'm big on independent films and when you have a good story, threesomes, billiards how could you not want to see this. Besides all of the T&A I have to say that the cinematography really pulls the story together. The best part of this movie is that even though they had all the eye candy that every independent film should have, they had a good moral to the story. As a movie director and producer creating a movie can be either really easy or really hard, but these guys definitely make it look easy. I have to say if you like American Pie or any other perverted comedy this is a must see. If only pool halls carried some of those hotties...Maybe someday.<br /><br />Mike
