actually the film had some interesting story lines. casting was wrong, Farrah playing a young babe was mutton dressed like lamb, she clearly does have some thing , but playing a young middle aged sex goddess probably expired by 1990. I feel they should have changed the storyline and made her a has been successful movie star trying to make a comeback, utilise some of her character acting abilities and explore the insecurities of a women who had it all and now faces a ageist community like Hollywood which remembers stars for their more famous roles, like Charlie's angels "closer to half a century ago". The rhythm of the feel was indecisive, and did not do the book justice. I wish someone would give me half the money to make a film like this - with the story lines , budget , actors the final delivery is SO disappointing.
