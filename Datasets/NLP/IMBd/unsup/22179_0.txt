This is the greatest action film ever made. I have been reading other people comments, and most agree, although some people don't seem to understand. They say it is bad because the dubbing is bad (that is the crappy American company that sold you the movies fault, not the movie) or the transfer was bad. Some say it is too violent. Some say the acting is bad. Some said there is not plot. Maybe you watched the wrong movie. No plot? An arms dealer housing his arsenal in a hospital. That is a plot. Maybe you should go back to school.<br /><br />This isn't the greatest action movie ever simply because every action seen tops the other and they are so superbly choreographed. It is cinematically beautiful, Philip Kwok of Five Deadly Venoms fames choreography and role is superb. The Production Design is great, it blends so seemlessly with the lighting. And it features the greatest shot in action cinema history, hands down. The 3 minute shot to Chow and Tony traversing the halls, going up the elevator and killing numerous bad guys along the way is incredible. There has never been anything like it.<br /><br />To all those non believers out there, if you like action movies, you will love this. IF you don't like it, they you are fooling yourself into thinking you are an action movie fan. Now, if only John Woo could make another movie like this instead of the godawful Windtalkers.
