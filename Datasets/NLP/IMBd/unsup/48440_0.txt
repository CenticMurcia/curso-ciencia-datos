I am typing these comments while consuming a can of beer. Well suitable for a film which had 'Beer is life' for a motto :-) Thinking back to that memorable evening at the International Filmfestival Rotterdam, where Chris Doyle himself treated everyone who was left in the audience after the screening of 'Away with words', to a beer. I must admit the after screening Q&A made up for the fact that I found the film totally unintelligible. Brilliant cinematography at times (of course). Weird, but intriguing dialogues. Loveable characters. Extremely funny scenes THIS MIGHT QUALIFY AS A SPOILER? (the rapping granny was a gem!). But all thrown together, a story which for me had no beginning and no ending without the director's comment. From him I understood we should view the film as a collection of words and images, like many music videos. But unfortunately this is not what I look for in a feature film.
