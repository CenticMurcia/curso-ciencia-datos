i was just flicking through channels when i saw an ad for reaper....directed by Kevin smith....now this came as a surprise to me as I'm usually up to date with his works....a regular on the IMDb page as well as the message boards...so decided to give it a go....mostly anything Kevin smith does (despite saying that after jay and silent bob strike back he was quiting the industry...) is good in my book :) and i was pleased to see that this was no exception....the plot is great...and not (as another user posted) like Shaun of the dead...similarities in certain things perhaps...but clearly not based on Shaun of the dead... i would however recommend this series to any fan of Kevin smith or even any fan of comedy...its a warm light hearted comedy about a kid whose just really not had the best start to being 21...:)
