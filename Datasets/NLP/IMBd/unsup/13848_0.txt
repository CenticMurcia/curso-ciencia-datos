I saw L'il Abner for the first time in over 30 years and to me it's an outstanding movie musical based on the Broadway show and Al Capp's comic strip. There were memorable performances from Peter Palmer in the title role, Leslie Parrish as Daisy Mae, Billie Hayes (who later went on to play Witcheepoo on H.R. Pufnstuf) as Mammy Yokum and Stubby Kaye, whose rendition of the song about Dogpatch's founder "Jubliation T. Cornpone" was a highlight. Also, watch for early sightings of Stella Stevens and Valerie Harper. Other songs that stood out were "Namely You," "Put 'Em Back" and "The Matrimonial Stomp."<br /><br />Unfornately, the political humor in the movie seems dated, especially in the song "The Country's in the Very Best of Hands." There are also a couple of songs that were in the Broadway version that got cut from the movie. General Bullmoose's song "Progress is the Root of All Evil" and the song the doctors sung at the testing site "Oh Happy Day." Otherwise, L'il Abner is a hilarious throwback to the days of the late 50s.
