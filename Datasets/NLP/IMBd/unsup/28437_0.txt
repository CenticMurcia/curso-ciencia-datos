yes, this another one of those treasury sting stories...but the story is solid...the dialogue crisp and intelligent... that's true of most noir films from the late 40's...what makes this special are lloyd bridges and barbara payton...his mild manner of speech only augments the gangster character he plays ..and barbara payton has never looked so beautiful and sure of herself as his girl...the lighting is a darker shade of gray and black, shadows and reflections...people aren't who they seem to be and this common theme explodes at the ending...be sure and add this to your collection of top film noir.
