This movie is all wrapped up in about the first hour and half. A dog that talks karate chops a gang that has killed his master. After that, he goes around and makes terrible jokes then sniffs other dogs butts. Oh, he also chases cats. No surprises and even my dog wouldn't watch this stupid movie.<br /><br />I understand that Chevy Chase could waste time in another stupid movie, but Jon Voight? I had a lot of respect for his acting career until I saw this chop suey pile of trash. In this movie he plays some southern Asian guy with a really bad dress on. I am not not sure what is going on and his hair is funny too.<br /><br />It is more painful to watch than a dog bite.
