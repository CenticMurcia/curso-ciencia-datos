I didn't think I'd like this movie at all. The over the top advertising and awful trailers didn't help. I rented it because it was all that was left (that I hadn't seen) at the Video Shop. Lucky for me!<br /><br />This is an excellent (an underrated) horror film. More subtle than most; the power of suggestion is very apparent, and used with intelligence. The performances are all excellent, including memorable performances by Lucas Haas and Joe Absolom. The movie is paced brilliantly, and thus creates moments of genuine tension. I can only admire this film, and considering it's comparativly low budget and it being Marcus Adam's first; they've done an excellent job. The photography and lighting are also used with expertise which greatly add to the experience.<br /><br />I'm surprised that the story works so well too, considering that there are seven writing credits, combined with the fact that it's about the biggest cliche: The Ouija Board.<br /><br />8/10 : The best British horror film since the brilliant 'An American Werewolf In London'<br /><br />Now comes the wait for 'Dog Soldiers'!
