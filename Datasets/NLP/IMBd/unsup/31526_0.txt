the review by Julane stated "who knew?",everybody who knows about music history,thats who.Gloomy Sunday ,the song, has been the subject of so many movies,TV shows,plays,books,etc..Several of the "odd tales" type of TV shows,i.e.twilight zone,amazing stories,tales from crypt,etc..have all had some story about a diabolical tune that drives someone mad.Even a crow stairway to heaven episode had this plot line with Eric Daven hearing the "devils song" The real story is extremely sad,and full of dark subject matter. The writer,Rezso did in fact commit suicide. His widow,was found dead outside her apartment,She jumped out the window.When authorities arrived on scene,her record player was still spinning,Gloomy Sunday.
