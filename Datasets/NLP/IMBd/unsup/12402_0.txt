I can tell you right now that was a very funny film. It was funny and for anyone thats in the industry, you know how accurate it was. Just the casting sessions and the way they conduct them was so real. Exaggerated a little but real. When he went for that baywatch job as the by-stander and met everyone I just felt for the guy so much. When he was in the make-up chair and he met Carmen Electra I just couldn't watch and that fu*#in smile he had the whole way through the film just killed me. The look on his face every time he was around someone important to him was gold! "Two thumbs up!"
