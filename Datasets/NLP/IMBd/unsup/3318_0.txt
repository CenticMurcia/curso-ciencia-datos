A gentle and moving production, this film takes itself much less seriously than Topsy-Turvy. Blending both well-timed comedy and the "human drama" which Sullivan himself so longed for in the libretti of his partner, the film takes us through the majority of the duo's career. Only the most pedantic G&S historian will not forgive the mild omissions and distortions which are used to move the plot along, and the film manages to work in references to all but Patience, Ida, Utopia, and Grand Duke, often in quite clever and entertaining ways. The soaring music of Yeomen, used so poignantly near the end, never fails to bring a tear to my eye. All in all, I would call this one of my favorite films, for its subtle humor, charm, and artistry.
