I always laugh out loud at the comments that portray this film as good. It is awful and always has been. True, there are some good performances from Quayle and Finch but the loose plot, bath tub ships and mostly one sided British view makes it one to forget. The dire bath tub battle sequences have come straight from the comics. Best to read a good book on the subject and stay away from such overpowering rot! Only when the film moves to land sequences does it have any credibility and there are still plenty of cardboard backdrops to help the film become even more foolish. The dialog reeks of upper class English nonsense also. Utterly sicking all round.
