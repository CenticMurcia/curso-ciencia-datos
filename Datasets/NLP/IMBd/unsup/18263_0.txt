Why does everybody cut this movie down just for the nudity that is in it? It does not have all that much nudity and it doesn't show Brooke Shields that much nude. This movie might have a disturbing plot but I think it was a job well done for what it was. It's actually a pretty good movie, just could've had a better ending.
