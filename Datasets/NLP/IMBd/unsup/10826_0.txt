He's hairy crude and he's a big bad wolf, and he'll be your monster for the duration of this movie. <br /><br />Plots barely worth going over for this its your typical 'group of friends go to a cabin to spend a wild weekend blah blah...'<br /><br />It's been done so many times but if you go into this film with the sole aim of being entertained, you'll easily get your moneys worth. Even though it's not got an original bone in its hairy body you'll laugh so much you'll forgive it that.<br /><br />Its got a wicked sense of humour with lots of tits'n'ass and blood'n'gore a plenty, and a very retro 80s feel.<br /><br />"Lets go to the cabin, and get in a little beastiality" a furtastic 7/10 from me. Would be awesome if the people involved came back quick with more comic/horror gold.
