I don't completely understand why HGTV continues to air episodes of this show. Hosts Matt Fox and Shari Hiller certainly have a friendly, down-to-earth manner in sharing their ideas and techniques, and the show is especially useful for learning about simple building and sewing projects. However, the show still fails to inspire, as most people who watch HGTV and follow design magazines will likely find their room makeovers nothing short of tacky. Their selections of paint, fabric, and accessories are rather outdated and kitschy, and they faux finish to the point of excess, dangerously giving viewers the impression that drawing design inspiration from the dining room of a Mimi's Cafe or Olive Garden is a good thing.
