'This movie will take you more than six hours, but it's worth every second it costs you to watch. The director originally made if for Italian television, that's the main reason 'La meglio gioventu' has this length. But the story is breathtaking, you will understand very well why the Italian history after World War 2 is so fascinating, with aspect of the actions of the Red Brigade (Brigate Rosse), the fight for human justice (in asylums and hospitals for the mentally diseased). The performance of the actors, all Italians of course, show you how high the level on this front is. And of course, i'm a big fan of Italian cinema, but 'La meglio gioventu' is better than anything I saw before. It reminded me a lot of 'Heimat' (by Edgar Reitz) and 'Berlin Alexanderplatz'(Fassbinder). Thank You Italy. And one thing more: If you've seen it once, by the DVD, you'll look again and find new things worth remembering.
