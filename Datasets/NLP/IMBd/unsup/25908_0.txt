Well, let's see. It felt like a rip off of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia. Only, its on tbs, so its less vulgar. I heard ads for the premiere all day today on the radio, so I figured I'd give it a chance. All the ads said "its so offensive, it has to be a late night show" or something like that. Maybe the future episodes will be different but the first one was TVPG. If it was a good rip off of It's Always Sunny, then I would have been cracking up the entire time, but alas, it was just a cheap knock off. The meat guy was pretty funny though. I could see this show catching on if it weren't on tbs, but either way, it's not my style.
