I enjoyed this movie a lot at its screening at the Venice Film Festival! It is a fun thing to remember, that the little girl main actress in this film was really crying in the lap of her real mother after the movie was over and while there was a standing ovation. It must have been the first time she'd have seen the finished film.<br /><br />* spoilers maybe ahead *<br /><br />Absolutely extraordinary guiding through some Historical places by the mediteranean sea. It's in portuguese.<br /><br />They speak several languages on a boat. John Malkovich is the awesome captain on that boat. And there you see him talk for hours with Catherine Deneuve and some other actresses. They talk about civilisation, history, languages, society... lots of interesting stuff!<br /><br />As some I heard the opinion from they though this film was badly boring in its talking and in its trying to teach us a lesson in all from the history of Europe, good manners, communication and so forth.<br /><br />But I enjoy a lot when a movie obviously tries to teach me a lesson in such things. Be it supposed to be common knowledge, seeing that orthodox priest talk at the Parthenon, see the two main characters talk and learn through the historical places is very interesting.<br /><br />Most importantly I find the cinematography in this movie very beautiful, specially when they talk on the boat and do stuff on the boat.<br /><br />I rate this movie 8/10, at least..
