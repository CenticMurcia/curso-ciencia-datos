This movie was unrealistic and a little boring. For the quality of acting it was alright but you could really tell that it was a movie. I didn't feel like i was a part of the movie. The movie was real muddled some parts made since but others didn't. I really believed that this is a deadly virus. The science behind it was really true i thought. The ending you could tell the way it would end but it still had some holes. Overall this movie was a really dull and not that hard to figure out. It was a bad movie. The actors could have done a better job on the reality of the movie. They didn't act as if the really liked the movies background. They also seemed as if they wanted more of the money instead of really liking the movie.
