Apart from very bad acting, writing, and direction this movie could not decide what it was supposed to be. Some of the characters were given dialog that sounded like it was copied straight from a community service announcement, then there was the plot which was so thin it was generally hard to find, and when the director seemed to be totally lost, he would throw in a sex scene. Sometimes the two people involved had nothing else to do with the movie. Some of them had no lines. It seems they just had to be willing to take off their clothes, get groped while showing everything. It is really difficult to put two relatively cute guys in bed, have a sex scene which shows everything but penetration and make it absolutely boring. But they did it. There are a few scenes (including one sex scene) that had absolutely no bearing on anything else in the movie. <br /><br />I caught one of the viewers in our showing checking out his emails on his blackberry during a sex scene. It was just that boring. Then there was the over the top music that at best did nothing to add to the scene, but generally set an entirely wrong tone for most scenes. <br /><br />The actors would be hard pressed to get jobs in community theater. They would mumble their lines or deliver them like they were stand alone lines that had nothing what-so-ever to do with the other person talking at the same time.<br /><br />That all being said, it was so bad we found ourselves laughing out loud at how bad it really was. So if you want to watch a movie that has some pretty cute guys (not all mind you) having pretty graphic sex while delivering bad dialog, then this ones for you.
