I had heard of Robert Lepage's work and was not disappointed in the adaptation of his play. The basic premise of the work is the life of dreamy Andre, the elder of two brothers of a gorgeous mother. There is some intense symbolism at work here, the figure of the mother portrayed against the fascination of Andre for the moon itself. The brothers, identical in appearance, so different in personality both brilliantly played by Robert. One knows he is destined to be forever the dreamer, with some small triumphs ( a booking by a Russian for a lecture in Moscow, missed by Andre's absentmindedness, a winning of a video contest put on by SETI ). Meanwhile, Andre's real life is outlined in stunning detail, his deadend job in a call centre, his life surrounded by his dead mother's belongings, his ex-girlfriend, now living in a wealthy suburb. His interior life sustains him and the ending is uplifting and sad at the same time. 8 out of 10. Unusual and riveting.
