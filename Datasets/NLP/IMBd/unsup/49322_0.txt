I noticed the IMDB give the title of this movie as EDIE & PEN where as in Britain it`s called DESERT GAMBLE which is a far more exciting title . What does a movie named DESERT GAMBLE conjure up to you ? A war film set in the North African campaign of 1942 ? A heist movie of likable geezers going to Vegas to rip off the mob ? Or perhaps even a disaster movie about a plane crashing into the Sahara . Nothing as exciting as that happens in this film so I guess EDIE & PEN is a more accurate title since it doesn`t really conjure up anything <br /><br />And nothing really happens in the movie either , it`s basically a low concept dialogue driven chick flick about two women who meet in a red neck bar , one of whom has a sort of relationship with a red neck and the two women swap life stories . I guess girls who are not expecting too much might enjoy it and it is very inoffensive but that`s hardly massive praise
