have you ever been embarrassed for the actors while watching a movie because the movie was SO BAD? this is how i felt during down to you. i couldn't believe how badly put together this movie was, it was like i could see them writing the script. and then there was just this incomplete story feel to it. and it all makes sense because the same person wrote and directed it. i really wanted to like this movie because freddie and julia are cute people but my god... no way in hell. bottom line: avoid this movie!
