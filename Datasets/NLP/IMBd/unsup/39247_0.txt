It`s impossible to believe today in 2003 that a few years ago Jean Claude was a fairly famous film star , but his career soon hit the rocks as audiences became aware that his films were unnecessarily violent and very very dumb . Van Damme movies also lacked a sense of humour thereby ensuring his status at the box office was short lived . In other words a film containg the caption " Starring Jean Claude Van Damme " is not a good thing and I can`t help thinking DOUBLE TEAM is Jean Claude`s worst film<br /><br />!!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!!<br /><br />The major problem with DOUBLE TEAM is that the plot is so slippery it`s impossible to explain . It involves the hero Jack Quinn hunting arch-terrorist Stavros and because Quinn fails in his mission which leaves several people dead he`s given the choice of instant death or being exiled to an island similar to the one in THE PRISONER . He chooses exile but decides to break out to gain revenge on Stavros who`s planning to kill Quinn`s wife and new born child <br /><br />If the last paragraph makes much sense then I`ve probably explained it all wrong because the plot is totally underdeveloped with a massive amount of scenes that lead nowhere . For example Quinn runs into an old rival on the island and gets involved in a fight . Who the rival is remains vague and we never see him again . It`s as though the screenwriter got bored with the subplot and discarded it while he was writing it and the film is littered with these subplots that are unexplained and go nowhere . I was also going to mention the climax with the tiger and the sports staduim that`s been mined but you`d never believe it
