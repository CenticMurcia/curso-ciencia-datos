What a fantastic coming of age film. David Otterhouse created a short masterpiece of the beautiful relationship between a young boy and his older teenage cousin. Chris Nee did a wonderful performance creating a genuine sense of caring and love for his younger cousin. David Otterhouse captured a time and innocence of being 17-18 years old as seen through the eyes of a 12 year old. The era was captured well, the Boston accent added much. A beautiful representation of real true love with no sexual innuendo. Magnificent.<br /><br />I would recommend the short movie for anyone to see. I was touched. Thanks David Otterhouse.
