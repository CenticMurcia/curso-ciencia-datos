To start off with, Jay and Silent Bob rock as always, T.S. is a little anal but that adds to his overall character and pans out to his advantage at the end of the film, Willam is underrated, Brandi and father are a great example of a modern day middle class father/daughter relationship, (and she FINE to!!!), even the lovely Shannen Doherty deserves usually unwarranted praise if just for the lift scene, but the star of the whole movie has got to be Brodie. If not for the preoccupation with superhero sex organs, supermans potential birth control or possible future realistic child bearing partners, then just simply for the answer to what noises do you make when you're having whoopee. According to commentary said noise was supplied by the unappreciated in our time Jay mewesey mewes but delivered with such conviction that i use it as my answerphone message on my cell. Kevin Smith, View Askew, boys, you all did yourselves proud. Even your commentaries are better than most of the other films floating around the cinemas for the past decade. Thank you for making a sad man and best friend very happy.
