How dare they call this IM2! Horrible movie. What was Ping thinking? As far as the confusing plot goes.. whatever!<br /><br />Only thing good about this move is that it has Donnie Yen (who was fantastic in OUATIC 2, Wing Chun and Iron Monkey [in fact all three of these I consider some of the best of the best], shows off some impressive Wing Chun skills).<br /><br />So, if you want to see some good Wing Chun and don't care about the horrible setting. Go for it.
