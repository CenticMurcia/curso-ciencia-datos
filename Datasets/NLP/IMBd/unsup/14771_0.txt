the movie is quite a bore. cannot believe that ed harris wasted himself in this brainless plot. a cheap attempt to recreate some of the magic of pretty woman, but without the class, conviction or the charisma of the former.<br /><br />watch the movie only if you're desperate to see melanie griffith in yet another role as a skimpily clad sexpot. she's quite good in the role though.<br /><br />a stupid 4!!
