I bought a VHS copy of Rider on the Rain in the early 90s when a video store was going out of business. And i had seen it on a NY TV station a few times in the 70s. I hope and pray to the DVD gods that this gets a nice release before too long. The dreamy feel to the entire proceedings is wonderful. Somehow this film is creepy, suspenseful and sweet all at the same time. Bronson and Jobert have such chemistry that i wish they would have done more. This is one of Bronson's 3 or 4 best performances and perhaps no other film tapped into his unique screen presence more than this one. It seems the European's always did understand his appeal more than we Americans. A classic suspense film which, in the end, is more about people, love and maturity than it is about suspense. "Did the bus stop?" "Yes, and a man got off." "The hell he did. Nobody ever rides here on the bus." "Then he must...have ridden in... on the rain."
