SPOILER - Now knowing the ending I find it so clever that the whole movie takes place in a motel and each character has a different room. Even sane people have many different aspects to their personality, but they don't let them become dominant -- they are controlled. Malcolm's various personalities and needs were personified in each character. The prostitute mother (Amanda Peet), the part of him who hated her for being a prostitute (Larry), the loving mother he wish he had, the loving father he wish he had, the selfish part of himself (actress), the violent part of his personality (Ray Liotta and Busey), the irrational emotions he feels and his need to be loved (Ginnie) and his attempts to control those feelings (Lou), the hurt little boy who sees far too many traumatic things in his life, and of course, John Cusack who seems to represent Malcolm himself trying to analyze and understand all the craziness in his mind, tries to follow the rules (accepting responsibility for the car accident), help others (giving Amanda Peet a ride, and stitching up the mother). Very cleverly done!
