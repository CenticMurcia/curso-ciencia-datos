Amazing that money is still being spent on making such rubbish. Full of clich√©s and one-liners, it is one of the cheapest WW2 movies i've seen. Build a farmhouse out of a heap of timber, use the leftovers to glue a tower together with a propeller on it so that it vaguely resembles a windmill and... presto, we are in Holland! Take a Russian Antonov biplane, delete the top wing, glue a pair of (bicyclechain driven?) engines on the wings and put it on pontoons... a nazi seaplane! Life can be so simple. Let some men in a mixture of uniforms run trough a deserted forest making a lot of noise. And whatever happens, whoever shoots who, make sure the black ss uniforms stay in pristine condition... who's funding this?
