Saw the episode tonight on TV, and really enjoyed it. Its just a great series isn't it, and it was really bugging me what the music/song was and wasted an hour or so on the net looking for the name of the music and ended up here! So thanks for the information on the song at the end of the episode. I knew I had heard the tune before, (but not the lyrics) but just couldn't place it! Somehow it seems more appropriate how its used here with Seymour waiting for Fry to come back for the rest of his life<br /><br />"If it takes forever, I will wait for you, for a thousand summers, I will wait for you" <br /><br />compared with the closing scene at the service station in 'The Umbrellas Of Cherbourg' where both of them meet again by accident and each find out that the other is married and has children. Maybe that's why there are no lyrics to the song in this scene as they only sort of 1/2 waited. Still, its a memorable scene as I haven't seen this film in almost 15 years and but I remember it and the tune.
