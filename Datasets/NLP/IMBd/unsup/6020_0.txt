The plot device of having a person show up after an absence on a Pacific Island and after being declared dead, only to find their spouse married to another person served comically for Irene Dunne in MY FAVOURITE WIFE and Fred MacMurray in this trifle, adapted from a Somerset Maugham play. (The serious side was recently explored in Tom Hanks' CAST AWAY). This is merely a photographed stage play for basically four principals - Melvyn Douglas and Fred MacMurray acting like teen-agers vying for common wife, Jean Arthur, with Harry Davenport in support as her father. It is a one joke film that tires way before its 84 minutes are up. Totally unremarkable - even the stars seem as if they are pushing it beyond its reasonable bounds to try to evoke some fun or magic, but they fail. For some reason the sound recording was Oscar nommed - undeserved. However, the inventive and comical score (fun use of bassoon and oboe) was neglected though it deserved the only nod. Strictly for fans of the stars and for insomniacs.
