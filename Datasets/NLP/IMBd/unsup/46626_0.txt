The novel could not be more faithful to the novel than it is. It's overlong, boring (as was the very short book) : junk orientalism could define it best. No interest whatsoever. I wonder why someone would think of making a full length movie of something was would not have been worth a half hour t.v. show (even in that format it would have seemed too long). It's a pity, Keira Knightley is a good actress, I wonder what she is doing in this doomed enterprise of a movie that has all the shortcomings of this sort of movie, including void aestheticism. The director wants the spectators to leave the cinema thinking "The pictures were really beautiful" hoping they'll forget how empty and boring the whole movie is.
