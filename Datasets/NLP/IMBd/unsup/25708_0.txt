This was the final chapter of Walking Tall the life of Sheriff Buford Pusser. Bo Svensen returns to play the role of Sheriff Buford Pusser, Lurene Tuttle plays the role of Grandma Pusser, and Forrest Tucker plays the role of Grandpa Pusser. When the picture ended the last time Pusser had just finished of the last man that was involved in killing his wife. Pusser term as Sheriff is coming to an end and now he has a new challenger. Pusser looses the election and now is unemployed. He turns to buying junk cars and fixes them up to be sold. In the mean time Pusser tries to get on with the highway patrol but is ****** ****. When things get bad a movie director comes calling and wants to make a Hollywood production out of his life. Pusser agrees but he's got more problems then he realizes. I give this movie 8 weasel stars because of the suspense that keeps watching the picture and the action.
