This movie is a horrible movie. The setting is totally wrong and ridiculous. The characters wore the clothes from wrong years and spoke weird language that will make any Chinese native speaker laugh. I kind of think the director may never visit china and just shoot the movie from some wrongful reading or whoever gave the money. Anyone who believe this movie is real or good should visit china personally and see it with their own eyes. Although it is 10 years ago, you can still have a better feeling and know how some lies can be so contagious and outrageous. I don't object movies with a strong political opinion. This movie is just too out of line and relay wrong impression on innocent people all over the world. It is not only unfair to Chinese people but to other people who is not familiar with China.
