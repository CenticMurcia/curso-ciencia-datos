This film may look a little dated today, but the fear factor is still strong. As "Fail Safe" was to the sixties, so this film was to the seventies. A super computer complex designed to be attack proof has control of the American Nuclear Arsenal. When it is brought on line it discovers that the soviets have also completed a similar computer. Between the two computers they achieve self awareness, and using their combined weapons to force the human race to comply with their wishes, as a big brother type system has taken power. Not the best cast choices but they do a good job with the script and direction. Worth a look!I rate this one a nine because of the dated look of it.
