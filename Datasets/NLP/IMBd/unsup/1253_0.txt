During the course of the movie, you are acquainted with this girl who is every bit alike the modern teenager's views on things. She's selfish to everyone whom she comes in contact with everyday. She transitions into the Nazi Camps as her aunt's best friend. As she endures the camps, she realizes that the person she has become sacrifices her life for her aunt. And thus, she does.<br /><br />An excellent movie. I commend the whole theme and main story line. I am a sucker for the "sacrifice" theme, and I enjoyed this plot very well. Excellent characters, the whole variety of camera angles and dramatic emphasis upon the two main characters is naturally sophisticated. Even in the end, love triumphs.
