This movie has its stereotype, but its small and many different injections of its own. The many scenes with its little life lessons and quotable lines and direction should make one think a little harder. Take in these little lessons and minuscule comments to heart because real life can be quoted, but in these quotes are left to bear more than consumed by a normal viewer. There are more than normal movie viewers out there that can read what I mean...if you don't maybe I just didn't make it clear that this movie has more meaning and to get you to watch it was to use a clich√© love story....look and feel closely, this movie will surprise you...
