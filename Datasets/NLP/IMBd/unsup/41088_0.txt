I was very disappointed with this film. I cannot understand why anyone would complain about the complexity of the plot. Compared to an average episode of the TV show, the story was simple, meaning that one action follows the other, and nothing really unexpected happens. In other words: it is very constructed, and you can sense it. For example, the way in the terminal room is MUCH too easy, I think in a TV episode the writer would have invented much more "tricks". The thing that might make the film hard to understand may be the way how the simple story is told... In addition to that, some scenes are so illogical that they are already silly, for example the helicopter in the tunnel, not to mention the often criticized fact of making an arch villain out of Jim or the stereotypic dialogues. I will not spend a cent for watching part 2...
