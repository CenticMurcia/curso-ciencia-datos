So, went to see "Take the Lead" with Antonio Banderas, and it, how do you say? Ah, yes. Sucked.<br /><br />Here's a few reasons: * Every single character was a Stereotype. From the black, thug kids, to the hard ass Principal, the skinny Blonde Rich Bitch, Antonio the teacher who wants to make a difference, the geeky white girl- Not one character was multi dimensional.<br /><br />* It was obviously written by a 40 year old white guy, which is why all the black kids say stuff like "You're a punk a**" and "Let's bring it".<br /><br />*Clichés Clichés! The entire plot is one cliché after another. At one point, towards the end, the black thug kid shows up for the ball room dancing competition still in his thug clothes, and he decided he must dance with the girl who's brother shot his brother, but they have since resolved their differences through dance, so Antonio takes off his jacket and gives it to him.<br /><br />*No scenes have a conclusion. Screen writing 101: Every great scene must have a beginning, middle and an end. None of the scenes have and end. Even the movie didn't have an end. You expect if there's a build up to a big competition, you would find out who wins at the end. Right? Not in this movie.<br /><br />* It was based on a true story. This makes the fact that this movie had a half ass script even worse, because it's offensive to the people who actually lived through it. I would hate to be any of the people being portrayed watching this and think "Am I really that big of a stereotype? What the...?" In Conclusion: I'm glad I got to see this for free, cause I'd be mad if I paid $9.50 for this hooey.<br /><br />Overall Grade: D-
