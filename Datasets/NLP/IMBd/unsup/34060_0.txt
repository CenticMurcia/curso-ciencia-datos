I had a good friend tell me I would find this hilarious, which has historically always been a bad sign. After sitting through 2 and half episodes and trying to force the occasional smile, I could stand it no longer. It's not that it's spectacularly bad, it's just that it is, at best, average in every respect. The humour is predictable. Gormsby's dialogue wears thin after the first couple of lines. The acting is dire for all but a couple of the main characters (Gormsby and that fat PE teacher) and the few dramatic elements are plastic, hollow and laboured.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. It's great that a low-budget show from NZ of all places has done well outside its country of origin. And thank god there's no laugh track, but Christ, I have to voice a counter opinion to all this wanton praise since I've sat through repeated viewings of it now (with the aforementioned friend and his flatmate) and I honestly hate it. Now this might be asking for it, but am I the only one?
