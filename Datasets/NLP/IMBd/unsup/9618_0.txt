The sole directorial effort from Robert Riskin (the talented screenwriter behind many of Frank Carpa's best films), WHEN YOU'RE IN LOVE is one of many films that attempted to re-create the success of 1934's surprise hit ONE NIGHT OF LOVE. This film boasts the advantage of featuring opera singer Grace Moore, the star of the previous film, in the lead role, yet it never really seems to amount to much and was not well-received by audiences upon it's original release. The film's basic premise (famous Australian opera singer "hires" an American man to pose as her husband in order to enter the country) is a workable enough set-up, but the picture fails to generate much momentum or interest. Riskin does a respectable job for a first time director, but displays a poor sense of pace and allows the picture to become plodding.<br /><br />Moore is acceptable as the film's Diva (she never really commands the screen, but she has a odd sort of like-ability) and Cary Grant is in fine form as her "rented" mate, but they are playing stock characters who only seem to behave in the manner that is necessitated by the script. Their relationship suffers numerous ups and downs throughout the course of the film, but I never really cared whether they ended up together and that is a serious determent for this type of picture. The film is also marred by far too many piecing musical numbers that seem to exist only to pad out the film's runtime and serve as a defacto showcase for Moore's shrill voice (even "Minnie the Moocher," which is often referred to as the film's highpoint, is virtually unlistenable). The film's true saving grace is Aline MacMahon in a fresh and intelligent performance as Moore's assistant - MacMahon's good-natured portrayal is a minor comic gem surrounded by a sea of mediocrity.
