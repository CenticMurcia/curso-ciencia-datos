...with bad dreams of this pathetic remake of the classic original by Robert Wise. I kept watching, stabbing at the mute so I could avoid watching the same inane, and frequent commercials. It got worse the closer we got to the climax. It's not that the acting was so bad, it's just that the new plot twists were ridiculous and the special effects budget must have been a couple of hundred bucks. When the thumb throw sequence happened, that was it, just way too silly. Or maybe it was the rat bite on the pooping butt? Or was it the cheesy orange wave of Andromeda over the landscapes and in the rivers? Or the red magic marker lines on the faces on the infected? You get the idea.
