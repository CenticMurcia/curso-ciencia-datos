Enjoyed viewing this way out film about a small town and a nice English Pub/Hotel where quite a few people met up with each other and become very very warm companions in a troubling situation. Jane Merrow,(Angela Roberts), "A Time For Love",'74, arrives at the Pub in order to start work as a secretary for a writer who is owner of the Pub/Hotel. Angela was very attractive and had a very hot body which all the men seemed to go crazy over with hot desires. Christopher Lee,(Godfrey Hanson),"The Oblong Box",'69, seemed to enjoy working in his hotel room experimenting with unknown secrets and played an entirely different role than his horror films. Peter Cushing,(Dr. Vernon Stone),"Monster Island,'81, was a very helpful doctor who loved to help everyone in need and was particularly helpful to Angela and her over heating spells, even her car over heated !
