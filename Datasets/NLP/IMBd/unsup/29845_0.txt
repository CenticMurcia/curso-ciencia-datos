This Quebecois film is a charmer that redeems much else of dubious merit coming out of that bit of Canada which persists in its French-ness. I'm sure the director/producer/acting talent behind this film benefited much from the experience won producing the stage version. One can only wish him well in future endeavors, as this offering speaks well of his talents in each afore-mentioned area. As you've no doubt gathered from surrounding reviews the story line centers around a coming-of-age confrontation with family realities in a family none too conventional. Sex is central, as in seemingly all Quebec films, but is here more subtly handled. Approach this cinematic experience as you might any "art" film -- and then be prepared to be pleasantly surprised by its substance.
