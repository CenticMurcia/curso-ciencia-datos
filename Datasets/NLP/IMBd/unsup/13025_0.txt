POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT! We all have to have our cheese,so why not make it good actor cheese? I'm talking Charleton Heston and Anthony Zerbe.Neville and Matthias duking it out;and L.A.is the prize!Anthony Zerbe ALWAYS does the best villains!Ironic, that a former t.v.newscaster becomes such a technophobe.It's also weird that both hero and antagonist both have a connection with the same woman.[Rosalind Cash as Lisa.]This movie may be cheese,but it does give you some things to think about.[Effects of loneliness,human inpact on the environment.]I can think of worst things to be doing on a rainy Saturday!A good,fun way to kill some spare time.
