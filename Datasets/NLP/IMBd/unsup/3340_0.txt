People thought he could never do.. but he did and this is the best film he has made so far.<br /><br />Uwe Boll the German director who has be come known for the creation of some of the worst films in history. And most of them were video game adaptations.<br /><br />But maybe Postal was the beginning of a transformation. it wasn't a very good film but at least it had some very good bits. Far cry was better but still not great.<br /><br />Tunnel Rats is good. though its not that great and still some visible cracks but at least its the cracks are not so wide. the dialogue is still full of problems but the plot is rather good. the action is intense and meaningful.<br /><br />the film was even very moving at times. I wanted to find problems with the movie but found more good points rather than bad points. which is rare in a Uwe Boll film. many of the characters were still 2 Dimensional but the music,action,plot made up for many of the mistakes.<br /><br />Some war films about Vietnam show the power of the American army, but this film at least shows the Americans being kicked about which I have only seen in Platoon.<br /><br />Uwe Boll has made a film and it is not a bad film.
