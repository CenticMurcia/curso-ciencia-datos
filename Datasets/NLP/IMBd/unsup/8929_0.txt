Nicely done low budget horror movie. Shot in Manhattan and definitely creates a genuine NYC feel through long shots, local sites and color. Acting is surprisingly good and not cringe producing at all. Gives good introduction to all the characters and actually produces some empathy. Interesting subplot of daughter returning from Iraq and leads subtle romance with neighbor. The old men upstairs are a hoot.<br /><br />Gore-and-horror-wise I found it satisfying and gripping to watch. A nice 28-Days-Later vibe done on a much smaller scale. The creatures were cool. Plenty of flesh-eating and blood and guts.<br /><br />Low expectations can produce a very pleasant viewing experience. This movie did. Congrats to all involved and I look forward to future projects by these folks.
