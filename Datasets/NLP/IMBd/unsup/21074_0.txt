Whether you're crazy about Jesus or not, this is an eye-opening film. It is so different to see an extremely warm, passionate, human, divine, and SMILING Jesus! The movie, which uses no other words than those found the Bible (New International Version), tells the story of the humble Jewish carpenter who changed the world forever. The director doesn't try dazzle the audience with "eye-popping" angles or camera tricks, but rather shows the life of Jesus in a simple way.<br /><br />The are several little highlights that decorate the picture. One, for instance, is when Jesus and his buddies play under a waterfall like a bunch of kids. Another is when they all decide to have a little wrestling brawl just to be goofy. Throughout the picture, it shows Jesus teaching his disciples (the buddies) in a way that a father teaches his child the things of life. With all its color and fun,however, the film can get serious real fast. Constant death threats are made against this new Rabbi. Jesus bashes the Jewish religious leaders and publicly announces them as hypocrites. The line is drawn, and the road to Golgotha begins. The film shows the brutal reality of the crucifixion, and the incredible hope that came through the resurrection. The movie ends almost with a question from Jesus himself. "Ok," says Jesus. "You've seen the movie about me, but who do YOU think I am?"<br /><br />Like I said, whether you're crazy about Jesus or not, it's an interesting movie to look at (if you don't mind the length!). It shows Jesus as he was from a Biblical perspective. Funny, kind, patient, a friend of the friendless. Check it out! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
