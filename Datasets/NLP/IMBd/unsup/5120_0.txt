This ninety-minute TV movie, which served as the pilot for what would turn out to be a vastly inferior series, is first-rate Rod Serling: a little preachy, very unsettling, and preoccupied with the themes of human desperation and ugliness. The first segment, 'The Cemetery', is terrific; Roddy McDowall and Ossie Davis play off one another wonderfully, and it's a pleasure to see Roddy's nasty little character get his comeuppance. 'Eyes' is not as good; Steven Spielberg's direction is a little conspicuous and the entire thing basically consists of Joan Crawford just ranting for half an hour. Serling returns to form, though, with 'Escape Route', the story of a Nazi war criminal (Richard Kiley) running from his brutal past. This one would have worked beautifully on "The Twilight Zone" :) Serling turned out the occasional gem on the series (Emmy-nominated 'They're Tearing Down Tim Riley's Bar'; 'The Waiting Room'; and 'Cool Air', based on a story by H.P. Lovecraft), but the "Night Gallery" pilot film was really his last hurrah on network television. The paintings by Jaroslav Gebr are great, too, as is the theme music (this theme was done by William Goldenberg, and is much creepier than the one used for the series). Recommended.
