in that the ending makes no sense whatsoever.<br /><br />This film is parsecs away better than, say, Highlander 2 or UFO: Target Earth, but it doesn't have the naive charm of Rebane's Monster A Go-Go. It was just a mediocre SF film until the ending ... very seventies in characterization ... but with no real hints as to the real motivations of the "invaders", the ending makes no sense. If an invading force is killing everyone, why create (and I assume the invaders created them) a new Adam & Eve from the last two survivors from the lodge? I liked the claustrophobic feel of the lodge, and the presentation of the story came close to having the same feel of something like Night of the Living Dead or Invisible Invaders. But on the theme and story as a whole, it really wasn't pulled off right ... we the audience just didn't get the information we needed to figure things out either before or with the characters.
