I witnessed this atrocity sometime in the late 1980's and It Remains to this day to be the worst film I ever seen, Running a Close Second is the film Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow, Both Stinkers..<br /><br />And this surprises me that Richard Lowenstein Directed, he If I am not mistaken did some fine videos for the band, Guess Michael owed him a favor and hence, Dogs..... <br /><br />But... Michael K Hutchence remains to this day one of the most prolific and sincere front-men of our time.<br /><br />Love The Man, Hated The Film..<br /><br />See Ya
