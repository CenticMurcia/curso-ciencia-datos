This is one of those movies that against my better judgement began to watch at the urging of a friend of my wife's. Well to sum it up I have never until this now walked out of a movie. After rationalizing (since I had nothing better to think about during the movie) I figured that the only way I could recoup the cost of the movie was to cut my losses and leave. The some 1 1/2 hours that I would have spent watching the remainder of the movie would have been better spent licking a toilet at a buss station. ** SPOILER FOLLOWS ** IT SUCKED, IT REALLY REALLY SUCKED !!!!!!!
