976-EVIL (1989) was a bad movie that came out during the 80's horror movie explosion. This was also Robert Englund's attempt at making a movie. He took a topical theme and try to add a horror spin to it. But all you got was a badly directed and acted film with a creepy villain trying to be a second rate Freddy Krueger (i.e. spouting off very bad one liners).<br /><br />A no good rascal (Spike) who lives with a strange woman and her nerdy kid is extremely bored. Besides spending his time riding around like a rebel without a clue an keeping the kid (Hoax) from being eaten alive at school,. Spike has nothing to look forward to in life. One day he comes across and ad for a 976 number. The phone number promises it could "help" him with his problems and what not. He tries it but is spooked by the voice at the other end. But someone close to him has a use for the number. Who can that be?<br /><br />Overall a very bad movie. Maybe if they had a better scriptwriter and director, if might have succeeded. Sadly it fails as a horror film and as a black comedy. Although the first film was bad, the sequel was actually entertaining. My advice to you is to avoid part one and skip ahead to the sequel.<br /><br />Strongly avoid, unless you really dig bad movies and film-making.<br /><br />Bad stuff indeed.
