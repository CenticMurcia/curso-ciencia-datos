You'll need a program to tell you what is going on, because like most modern actors, these bores cannot enunciate. Without closed caption, forget it.<br /><br />Which is just as well, because it is garbage by any standards.<br /><br />It's set in the early 1800s, with British and French soldiers in the middle East. There's a lot of killing and action, but it doesn't work, because you have no idea why it is going on, or how it is going on. It is a muddled mess.<br /><br />The poor speaking skills of the actors are across the board, which means the director and casting crew are to blame more than anyone. And no one cares.<br /><br />The action doesn't work, because it is just another neo Nazi idealist director and writers contriving every instance to save blonde women and butcher brown eyed brunettes. The director is so heavy handed at this, that the audience just doesn't care, and is thoroughly bored by the same old routine. Obviously made for the neo Nazi and female market, since anyone else will be completely turned off by this.<br /><br />Not much else to say about this garbled garbage.
