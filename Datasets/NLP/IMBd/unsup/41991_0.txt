Stephen King's three short stories based loosely around the adventures of a brave alley cat would certainly have made better reading than viewing.<br /><br />Lewis Teague starts proceedings on a reasonably good note with a story about a "Quit" smoking program which achieves results in rather unorthodox and unpleasant ways. James Woods and Alan King head up the cast in an unnerving and tense segment. Robert Hays follows as a retired tennis player who finds himself gambling for his life with the husband of his young girlfriend.<br /><br />The third yarn sadly spoils things somewhat with the "children's fairytale" type story of a young girl who is visited at night by an evil troll intent on stealing her breath. Only "General" the cat can save her. Drew Barrymore gets plenty of chances to look cute, but this weak spooker has little else going for it.<br /><br />Overall "Cat's Eye" is not highly entertaining and can be readily classified as yet another poor representation of Stephen King's literary compositions on film. Alan Silvestri's music is a bad copy of his superior "Back to the Future" score.<br /><br />Sunday, May 1, 1994 - T.V.
