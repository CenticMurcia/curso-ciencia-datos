I heard this movie sucked. It did not. It is not great film, but it is good film. The homage to the 1970s was there, the little "film buff" touches that remind one of urban horror's roots as far back as nosferatu.<br /><br />this movie could easily have been a sell out, with Bones as "Snoop da CROW"<br /><br />with the vengeance thing, but it did not.<br /><br />the only "bad horror" gimmick was the last 4 seconds of the film.<br /><br />I expected a crappy horror movie. This beats urban legend or scream 3.<br /><br />
