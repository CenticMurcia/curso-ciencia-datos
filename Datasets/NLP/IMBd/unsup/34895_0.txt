Do not see this movie. Frances O'Connor, has the worst performance ever. During the whole movie i thought i was watching a middle school play. It is boring and just not fun to watch. I just got frustrated the more i watched it. I do not suggest this movie to anybody except middle school girls who are in love with Paul Walker. Their is one bright spot with the movie, for the most part it is actually historically accurate. The only real thing that wasn't accurate was the type of French that they used. But who really pays any attention to that. The only way you should ever see this is if you are payed at least ten bucks, then maybe you could consider.
