Eddie Macon (John Schneider, in his first film starring role since coming to prominence on 'The Dukes of Hazzard') is an honest-to-God good man who ends up in jail after losing his cool with his sleazy employer. Before the film starts, he's already escaped once, and as the film opens, he escapes again (you'd think they would have been watching him more closely). Knowing full well that he'll be sent back to prison for life if he is caught, he embarks on a desperate race for Mexico and freedom, to be reunited with his beloved wife and child. He is pursued the whole time by a relentless cop, Carl Marzack (Kirk Douglas) who stops at nothing to catch him.<br /><br />I was expecting a little more action myself. This prison escape film plays more like a straight drama, with a rather perfunctory car chase saved for the last dozen minutes. It gets pretty sentimental, a little too sentimental, as the soundtrack songs (sung by Schneider) will attest. Schneider is sincere and believable, and the supporting cast is full of an incredible lineup of familiar faces, including Tom Noonan, Jay O. Sanders, J.C. Quinn, Dann Florek, J.T. Walsh, John Goodman (Walsh and Goodman make their film debuts), Mark Margolis, and others. However, the standouts are undeniably Douglas, who is animated and energetic and engaging in a multi-dimensional role, and Lee Purcell, very sexy and appealing as a high society type who comes to Eddies' aid mainly because she wants a little excitement in her life.<br /><br />Some decent sequences - a showdown with a snake, the confrontations with the Potts brothers - help to make it enjoyable. You might not remember it afterward, but you might very well have a smile on your face while watching it. It's decent entertainment of its kind.<br /><br />7/10
