When I first started seeing the comercials for the "lost season" of the Real World. I was excited. That is until I saw the show. Could it be any obvious that it was a fake "lost season". I mean c'mon explosions and kidnapping? I watched the 90 or so minutes of this made for tv tripe and just chalked it up to my love for the Real World. I also knew it was a phony lost season due to the fact that each of the characters played into what some see as the typical cast mold. You have your diva b****, the shy guy, the homosexual, the skater dude, the frat guy, the militant black woman, and the naive small town girl. What made the movie a little more tolerable is the fact that it brought together some Real World Alumni including Amaya (Hawaii), Anissa (Chicago), Mellissa (New Orleans), David (Los Angeles)(remember they kicked him off), and Mike (Back to New York). I guess overall if you're looking for a crazy spin on the Real World then by all means watch this. But if you are really hoping for a lost season that is authentic, then you better keep waiting. ** 1/2 out of ****
