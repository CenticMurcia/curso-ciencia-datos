(r#57)<br /><br />This game is just amazing. I can play it over and over again and never get bored with it. That, I think, is the sign of a truly classic video game: the unlimited re-playability. You could play Heroes III 100 times in a row and not get tired of it. It's just that great.<br /><br />Let's start with the game-play. You move your "hero" across a 2D map of a fantasy landscape. Occasionally you will run into an enemy "hero" or an army of fantasy beasts. This launches you into battle mode and the entire screen changes into a battlefield, where you get to see your army up close. The armies can be moved left and right, up and down, kind of like in chess, and the goal is of course to strike down upon the enemy with great vengeance and furious anger. It's that simple. Some gamers might think this game-play is too simple and boring. I think it's brilliant. It's so simple it's easy to play any time of the day (or night...). If you purchase a spell book for your "hero", you'll also be able to curse the enemy armies with spells or increase your own soldiers' capacity with your magic in combat.<br /><br />The landscapes are beautiful and incredibly detailed and the music is atmospheric and relaxing. Add to that the enormous set of fantasy creatures you can use for battles (including centaurs, cyclops, unicorns, archers, Elves, at least seven types of dragons, basilisks, goblins, ghosts, skeletons, wizards, trolls, vampires and griffins, and I haven't even scratched the surface), a complex story, and complicated campaign scenarios, and you have the total winner that is Heroes III.<br /><br />Another thing that elevates this game into greatness is the fact that you can, through the use of a very user-friendly map editor, create your own maps, which makes the game creative as well as entertaining. I also recommend adding the expansion packs Armageddon's Blade and The Shadow of Death, which feature additional creatures, castles and characters, as well as the option to create your very own campaign adventure. Expanded or not, Heroes III is a great game which you have to play if you haven't already. If there was a top 250 for games, this should be #1.
