Harry Callahan quickly establishes his action-not-words by driving his car through a liquor store window to free the owners, who are being held as hostages Demoted to the personnel department, he scorns bureaucracy in general and in particular the Mayor's policy of attracting women into the force, but he is saddled with one, Kate Moore (Tyne Daly) as his by now obligatory 'minority' partner <br /><br />Insp. Callahan finds black militants are not his enemies but his allies: when 'Big' Ed Mustapha (Albert Popwell), the black leader, is arrested to boost the Mayor's prestige, Harry actually resigns this time and continues his pursuit of the revolutionaries as a loner His female aide risks her own job to he1p him and eventually they chase a prime suspect through the seamy 'massage parlor' underworld of the city and kill a leading gang member, who has disguised, herself as a nun And discovering that the Mayor is being held captive on Alcatraz Island, they make for an abandoned fortress for the final shootout <br /><br />The film is a step backwards in style and content from the previous two Harry seems to have reverted to his first incarnation: 'What kind of a department are we running when we're more concerned with the rights of the criminals than of the people we're supposed to be protecting?' and displays unusual brutality in roughing up a man who feigns heart attacks instead of paying his restaurant bills<br /><br />Advertised as the 'dirtiest Harry of them all,' it is also the weakest Without the experience of Siegel or Milius to help him, Eastwood took a gamble on James Fargo, his assistant director on some of his previous films and the result was competent action but a noticeable lack of depth and subtlety
