I watched Witness for the Prosecution on the "This" movie channel hoping it would be just as good as the original, but unfortunately not.<br /><br />It plays like a TV episode instead of a movie, and the acting is very stilted. Even the way they move feels like watching robots in motion rather than a natural performance. I don't know who to blame - the directors or the actors - but in either case the actors look like actors, not real people experiencing real events.<br /><br />I recommend you get the original movie which DOES feel natural. Charles Laughton does a brilliant job as the lawyer.<br /><br />Even if you have to rent it, the original movie is better than this "free" TV version and worth the expenditure. PBS sometimes runs the original on weekends, so maybe you can catch it then.
