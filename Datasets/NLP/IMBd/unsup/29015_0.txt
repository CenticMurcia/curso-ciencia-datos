Bugs Bunny thinks he's gonna win the 'best actor' oscar but is snubbed in favor of James Cagney. He tries to convince the audience of his point while doing some impressions and showing a clip from Haiwatha's Rabbit Hunt.<br /><br />Self-indulgent to the extend and not a funny moment in this 8 minute short. It may try to make some points on Hollywood and the Oscars, as a previous reviewer stated, but what it really tries to say is unclear.<br /><br />The movie is banned from tv nowadays because of some racist-related links and impressions, but nothing to get too excited about.<br /><br />Dull. 3/10.
