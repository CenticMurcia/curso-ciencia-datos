Look, I don't know what people have against Eddie Murphy films (they always seem to get a low rating on IMDb) but if you watch them for what they are they are FUNNY.<br /><br />@jogliore from United States What's wrong with you? My wife and kids watched this movie and loved it. I loved it. It's funny. It makes you laugh. The acting is good enough for the type of movie. It's a family comedy - not godfather! <br /><br />Anyway, we really enjoyed this movie just like we enjoy most of Eddie Murphy's movies. <br /><br />Have a sense of humour guys. Come on - this deserves much better! <br /><br />7/10 Mark A.
