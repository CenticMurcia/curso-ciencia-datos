If you are truly looking for a cheesy, horribly made film, then there is no better then The Evil Dead. First of all, you will laugh at the horrible film making. There are goofs and mistakes galore. Crew members visible in the bushes, disappearing blood, costume changes, etc., it is all here. Ed Woods Plan 9 from Outer Space does a better job at covering up its mistakes. The plot, one of the only good points in this film, besides the laughable bad acting, is very interesting and it is good for the sequel (one of my favorite movies) Army of Darkness. The only other good thing about this film is that it spawned the career of cult actor Bruce Cambell. But the very best seen is a rape sequence in which a girl is raped by... trees. Yes, trees. it still reminds me of the trees in the Wizard of Oz. "These ain't your apples!". So if you have had a rough day and just want to simply turn your brain off, pick up Evil Dead. if you are looking for a great old horror classic, pick up army of darkness. because evil dead is merely a five year old's rendition of army of darkness.
