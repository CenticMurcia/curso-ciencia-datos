I have seen a lot of movies in my life and I have never walked out of the movie theater and rarely ever stopped watching a movie. If I paid to see this, I would have walked out. We had to fast forward at 2x at that was the speed the movie could have been done at. Many long scenes with no talking at all and just driving. The characters were empty with no essence, no emotion, no depth to them what so ever. The man was pathetic and his submissive girlfriend had a blank expression on her face through the whole thing. This movie could have been saved if the hint of romantic relationship with the girlfriend and her female friend would have been woven into the story. Bottom line is that what this movie lacked is what lacks in a lot of relationships where people ask later "what went wrong?": lack of communication, thats what. Moodiness, and sad puppy dog looks don't do it, we need to know what is going on through the characters' heads, what makes them tick not just what makes them obsessed. One moment of anguish sobs at his grandmas arms is not enough to wake us up from the silent, expressionless coma this movie put us in. This movie should have never been made. No one should ever see this. It would truly be a waste of your time.
