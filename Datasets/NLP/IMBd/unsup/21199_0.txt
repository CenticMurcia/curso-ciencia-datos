I first saw this anime at the "Bad Anime Festival" at Ohayocon '06 in Columbus, OH. The show was not misplaced. The plot is all action and nudity, which is an asset for many viewers. The animation and sound were at best mediocre. The English dub features Bob Buchholz in an early role I imagine he'd sooner forget. The plot is disjointed and odd, with underdeveloped characters and incest. So if, like the previous reviewer, you are not looking for another Akira or Ghost in the Shell, this could very well be on your "to rent" list. However, if like me you appreciate Japanese art and good movies in general, I highly suggest that you give this one a miss. Happy viewing, everyone.
