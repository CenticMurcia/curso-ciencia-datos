Honestly, I am not really satisfied with my rating of 10/10 for the movie So-Close. For me, it deserved for a rating of 100/10 because it is the best movie i ever saw in my entire life.. I've already watched it for almost more than 30 times from now. I've watched in movie theater and even watch it in dvd.. I love the plot, the story, the effects, the music, the characters and the actors, especially hsu chi and zhao wei.<br /><br />For me.. It is simply the best!!!
