The Pang Brothers should have developed a decent script before churning out yet another disappointing sequel. The Eye 2 wasn't THAT bad but unfortunately Shu Qi's horrible acting had ruined the otherwise good effort. The Eye 10 is simply horrible. Besides casting new actors and actresses who couldn't act at all, the storyline was just downright terrible. I guess the producers were just trying to ride on their success of the first film and trying to produce as many films as possible so as to cash in on them before the steam runs off. Well, the steam definitely had run off with the ending of the first film. Pang Brothers, stop making another THE EYE 100 or The EYE 1000. Come up with something more substantial, please!
