This movie is a great mix of history and humour, which Robin Williams delivers brilliantly. Set in late 1944, it tells the story of a Jew living in his hometown that the Germans have taken control of. When he is sent to a German officer's office for being out after curfew he hears a report that the Russians are heading in his towns direction and thinks they may free him and his town from the Germans. The next day he tells his friend what he heard, in confidence, but doesn&#8217;t believe Jakob heard it on a German radio and believes Jakob has his own radio (Jew's were forbidden to own or listen to radio's, and rarely return from German office's,). Once the rumour spreads that the Russian's are coming and that Jakob has a radio, the town keeps asking for more Information. Jakob has to make up information since no one believes he doesn&#8217;t have a radio and the information brings the Jew's hope. Meanwhile Jakob has taken in a little Jewish girl who has escaped form a train heading to the gas "showers" and must also keep hidden from the Germans. Just a great story of Jewish life in the war without to much war violence.
