Elvis stars as a race car driver. His co-star is someone who was popular at the time. His character has money trouble. These are the overall qualities of Viva Las Vegas, and guess what? They are also present in Speedway. What makes Speedway different is the great supporting cast, Bill Bixby, William Schallert, Gale Gordon, and leading lady Nancy Sinatra. The other thing is the chemistry between Elvis and Bixby and Elvis and Nancy. Elvis and Bixby have a real "buddy" vibe between them and Elvis and Nancy have a believable chemistry. Nancy is an OK actress, but Elvis isn't exceptional either. He was a good actor, but he was never going to win any awards. It seems like towards the end of his movie career he seemed to get a little bored with the same plot, but he turns in a bored-free performance here. Funny moments include the musical number in the IRS office and any scene with Gale Gordon. Gale Gordon is one of those comedy legends that probably could have brightened up a tanker of a movie like Xanadu. Speedway's racing sequences are somewhat dizzying. All of the cars seemed to look the same after a while. But all in all, it was a fun little time filler with goofy moments. The best musical number was the adorable "Your Time Hasn't Come Yet Baby" and Nancy's solo number "Your Groovy Self" was also a highlight.
