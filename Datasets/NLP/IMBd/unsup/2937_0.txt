This is a zombie movie comedy, it's not a horror film by any stretch of the imagination. Of course, neither are most zombie films. People can't really be "scared" by all this silliness, can they? Anyhow, round up the usual bunch of rednecks and let some zombies loose in their town. Hilarity ensues. The local TV station is reporting on the zombies - a redneck calls up and complains that they preempted the basketball game. One guy says "It's the end of the world". Another guy says "Well, it isn't the end of that whiskey bottle. Mind if I have a swig?" You get the idea. People are comparing this to Shawn of the Dead - this is ten times better. I laughed on quite a few occasions during this movie. I changed the channel 1/2 hour into Shawn. That movie was garbage.<br /><br />This film even shows a surprising amount of intelligence. One guy is lamenting the loss of his '64 1/2 Mustang which he had just finished restoring. You'll never, EVER hear mention of such a thing in a Hollywood movie because they assume that the audience is way too stupid to know what a 64 1/2 Mustang is, and they would become confused and disoriented.<br /><br />The acting is really low-key, everyone just takes the zombies in stride, dealing with them much like they would a herd of cattle that got loose and began roaming around town. One guy, who's house is surrounded by zombies, goes outside to get something from his truck. Upon returning, his wife excitedly asks: "What have you decided to do!". "Oh, I wasn't deciding anything" he says, "I just went out to my truck to get my beer".<br /><br />Overall, this is a delightful little film with a lot of originality and - gasp! - it's actually funny. When was the last time Hollywood poured $20 million into a film and actually produced a laugh? These guys did it for probably around $20 thousand.
