This film had a couple things going for it; it is obvious that some very talented people had a hand in creating this film, and the concept for the story had potential, but these were vastly overshadowed by the fact that it was uninteresting, lacked any kind of storyline, and was too real to simply be a girl's imagination. It lacks the imaginative quality of Alice In Wonderland, and substitutes it for random implausible scenarios. The story gives no background for the girl, no idea of who was fighting the war, or why, or if the people she met were real, and mutated by her imagination, or if she manufactured them completely. If she WAS trapped in this place, why did she never try to escape? The basic instinct in a human is to flee from or fear the unknown, of which she did neither. This movie did not even reach a conclusion, leaving you to wonder why you just wasted an hour and a half of your life. And what was with the naked little kids running around? Seriously!
