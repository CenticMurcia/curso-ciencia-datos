I could barely get through this racist piece of crap. Let's see. Here's a poorly made film that abruptly stops to splash "facts" on the screen that are either half-truths or just outright falsehoods. What's so ironic is that the entire thrust of this film is designed to illustrate the importance of Latinos in California. Instead, it simply perpetuates the hideous stereotype that whites are privileged racists and that all Latinos are saints.<br /><br />Above and beyond all that, it's boring as hell. If you want propaganda go watch something like "Triumph of the Will". At least Leni Riefenstahl could operate a camera. As for this, don't waste your time.<br /><br />Oh, and for the record, I've seen white people work in fields, wash dishes and operate vacuum cleaners. They've been doing it in the south for eons.
