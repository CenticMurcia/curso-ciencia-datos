This movie is a Big Chill wannabe. But, it fails to achieve that noble status through insipid dialogue and contrived plot. I kept thinking...who cares!! Do these people work?...are they productive?, or do they just wallow, wallow, wallow in self-centered pitiful auto-examination? I was amazed that the script was written by a man, because the male leading actors talk like women. What guy follows another guy into a public restroom and talk about masturbation?! And so much attention to detail of sets, yet these wimps slug Heineken from the bottle and I could see it was plain water...probably Poland Springs. And Andy McDowell chopping garlic... the professional cookbook writer chopping the garlic skins with the garlic?! Good actors after a bad script and worthless story. Sorry, not even worth a rental.
