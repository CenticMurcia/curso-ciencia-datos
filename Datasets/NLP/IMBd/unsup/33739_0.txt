Ughhhh. Boring boring boring. Looks like a cute little kiddy movie but it's just not. The movie had a very slow beginning but got a little better as it went along. It was sooo long though, I was basically counting the minutes haha. The acting was not good at all in my opinion, especially Hutcherson's. I'm sorry, it's just that his delivery of a lot of his lines were rather cringe worthy. I haven't seen any of his other movies so I can't just come right out and say that he's a bad actor but judging from this, he's definitely not good. The script sucked terribly too. The dog steals the show (or lack thereof lol)... he was pretty tight haha. But he couldn't save this mess...<br /><br />2/10
