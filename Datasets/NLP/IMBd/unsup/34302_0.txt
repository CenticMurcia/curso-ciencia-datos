When i was watching this i presumed it would be the sequel to the 2005 Boogeyman.. a horror film.. but instead all we got is another Scream type clone.<br /><br />The actors and directing is OK i suppose but whats the point of watching a sequel to a horror when its basically a completely different film and genre. In my eyes it should've just been named something completely different or Called Boogeyman, without the 2 on the end.<br /><br />If you want a thriller, 'who's doing it' type of film then sure this might be for you, if you want a horror though i would wait and see if Boogeyman 3 has anything decent to offer.. who knows it might actually have the Boogeyman in it this time.<br /><br />Fair play for not taking the usual "hey lets throw in a heap load of CGI", but it was just wrong to call this a sequel.
