A little too ridiculous for me, rival hit men discover they are long lost friends and team up to do a big score which they plan to donate to African children in order to make up for bad karma. It's just overwrought with non developed ideas and clich√©'s which the direction no matter how novel, as Takashi Miike always is, could not redeem. The stock home video footage of the lead characters as children was an overused device, eliciting feelings of boredom as opposed to the sentiment it is intended to evoke. There's not enough action or character analysis here to make this film anything but an exercise from Miike, which while I'm sure was a good workout for him, leaves the viewer with little else to say, except it was kinda neat when the character's sprouted wings, a non too subtle metaphor for their rebirth as "heroes". I've sat patiently through many of Miike's ingenious works, and this is so far my least favorite.
