I'm sorry this movie sucked. Terrible acting, really really confused story that never really explained anything. If at least a small attempt had been made do actually explain the story or show a plot or something it might have gotten i bit higher grading from me. All the foolishness about a formula was almost making sound like a commercial for toothpaste.<br /><br />My vote of 2 is for decent music in the movie and for at least a twist of an ending.<br /><br />Unless you really don't have anything else do do like operating on yourself with a worn out spoon, then do not see this BORING movie.<br /><br />/D
