This was Akki's first film with DD who is known for his mad films, Akki had done a comic role before in SUHAAG(94) but here he plays a full comedian<br /><br />The movie is a full crap and surprisingly DD released it with another film of his DEEWANA MASTANA which had better actors like Anil and Govinda(at least that time) and that film worked<br /><br />This film is a complete crap film and makes no sense and it doesn't even keep you entertained, A must for comedies<br /><br />The comedy scenes are trite while the main plot is itself senseless and the attempts to comedy are foolhardy though the message is a nice one<br /><br />Direction by DD is bad Music is okay<br /><br />Akshay seems uncomfortable in the comedy set up as it was his first attempt and he was a bad actor those days He shouts too loud and comes across as a poor man's Govinda Juhi is amazing in her comic role and steals the show Kader repeats his act, Paresh is awful Satish Kaushik annoys Gulshan Grover has an indefinite role
