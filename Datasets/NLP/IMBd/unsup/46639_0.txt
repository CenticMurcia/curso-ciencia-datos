I read a lot of great things about this series, so I checked it out. Honestly, there is a lot of potential here, but it just falls flat on it's face.<br /><br />One big weakness was the acting. The worst of them was the main one (Rocco). He was on screen probably 75% of the time, and he was hands down the most un-funny person on the whole cast. I actually van't think of an more un-funny person in the history of film. I'm not just saying that to be mean or as hyperbole, but seriously... Even Rob Schnider manages to be funny now and again in his movies. He reminded me of those nerdy high school drama students who thinks of themselves too highly. His facial expressions and voice inflection was way too overexaggerated which was distracting. I just wanted to punch him every time he said something. He only had one moment that I thought was funny, and that was the Metal Gear mission briefing. That was the only time it didn't seem like he was reading a cue card.<br /><br />The other main character (the one who played Horatio and the other beta-tester) was only slightly funnier. He suffered from the same over-acting as Rocco did. I felt like they were trying to go for a unscripted/spontaneous type feel for the film, but most of the sketches and gags were OBVIOUSLY scripted to the point where they were clearly reading lines.<br /><br />For instance that part in the beginning where one of them was just standing there eating pudding in front of the camera for 2 minutes. You could clearly tell he was acting, it didn't seem at all like it was natural or unscripted. The unscripted schpeel works for most small budget stuff like Jackass when it's actually unscripted, not fake like this.<br /><br />I did like the skinny white guy though. I thought he was the only character who portrayed any personality. His gags seems genuinely funny throughout. The absolute best part was the puppet. That damn puppet had me in stitches just about every scene he was in. If they do a sequel, they need to feature more of this guy and the puppet.<br /><br />The sketches were in my opinion the weakest part of the whole thing. Why the hell would I want to watch a bunch of high-schoolers throw dodgeballs at each other? Or a fat teenager run around asking people "Do you know who killed my father?" over and over again? Most of the sketches came off as poorly done Tom Green ripoffs. At least Tom Green played off bystanders' reactions to make it actually funny. Acting like a dumb ass in public does not automatically make it funny.<br /><br />Also, I must say the editing, music, costume, and sets were all well done, especially for a small budget film like this one. The three guys who wrote this should be proud of themselves. Its just too bad the actors had to ruin it.
