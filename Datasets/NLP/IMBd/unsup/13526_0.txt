It seems like the writers of Twin Falls had a few ideas that they thought would be "cool" to put into a film and nothing else. The premise of the film is typical cookie cutter Hollywood formula, the hapless love story, the hooker with a heart of gold, the dysfunctional hero, etc. Unfortunately that was not the problem with Twin Falls. The problem was the unbelievably poor and heavy handed symbolism. I knew I was in trouble when the movie started with the hooker receiving a 2 dollar bill as change for her cab ride. She stares at it like it is the strangest thing she has ever seen yet somehow she knows it should mean something. Not five minutes later, she walks past a TV with A Tale of Two Cities on. It only got worse from here. The story was an uninspired, trite mess. All of the subplots involving the hooker were underdeveloped, especially why the hooker cared about these guys at all. There was mention of a child she may have given up for adoption at some time, but it was touched upon once and never mentioned again. The interesting elements, like the preacher who lived next to the twins, were completely wasted in this film. Twin Falls Idaho is an art house film that insults the intelligence of its viewers while boring them all at the same time.
