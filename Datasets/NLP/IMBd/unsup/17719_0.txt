Grisly, gruesome stuff. I used to watch this kind of crap all the time back in the day with my buds--and my friends also. Faces of Death and Traces of Death were sort of a rite of passage. Now that I'm older, it's still interesting to indulge my morbid curiosity but I can say that there is some stuff in this type of film that will leave an impact. Atrocities, executions, war, accidents, murders, dead kids, and suicides leave their imprint in your mind after you watch it.<br /><br />This particular volume had a lot of race footage and stunt wrecks as well as war and bombing footage. Several highlights include the suicide by gunshot to the head of the owner of a company that went under, bullfights, a shark bite victim, sex change operation footage (male and female), plastic surgery, burn victims, you name it. I would say that if this type of gruesome reality doco is what you're into, this title will pay off. 8/10.<br /><br />NOTE: My version had Chinese language only but the narration is still just as retarded.
