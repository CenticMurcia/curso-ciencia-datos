It is hilarious to see a detective trying to work while fighting extreme obsessive/compulsive behavior, as well as germaphobia strong enough to merit using anti-bacterial wipes after every handshake. While these tendencies sometimes take center stage, the writing is well-balanced and touching so that it becomes a very enjoyable comedy/drama and not a ridiculous farce. Entertaining and engaging for just about anyone!
