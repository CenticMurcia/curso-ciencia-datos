I saw this for the first time as a kid in the 70s. It has always been one of my favorite movies in this genre. In re-watching it again last night, I once again marvel at the genius that was Jack Lemmon. Other recaps about the story's premise have already been given here, so I'll forgo that. This movie is hysterical...all the way down to the score. Jack Lemmon's tension and neurotic persona are brilliantly played out. Sandy Dennis was the perfect compliment to his "fast-paced" character. Her ability to stand by her man and be the obliging wife echoes both the time period of this movie, as well as her direct dichotomy to her husband's personality. They are simply perfect together. I know others have commented on her annoying voice, but to me, that made her part hilarious. There are so many funny scenes, and I find myself smiling throughout the entire movie. From the "circling and stacking", the buckling ankles, the Cuban ambassador fiasco, all the way to the end of the movie hijackers, this film is a true gem.
