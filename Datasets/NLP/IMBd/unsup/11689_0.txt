Its Happening Now, Oil is about to PEAK, Gas $ are up, Stocks are falling Be Prepared.....<br /><br />If this is the first time you are hearing about Peak Oil, you are among the majority of the population. Peak Oil doesn't mean 'running out of oil', but rather 'running out of cheap and plentiful oil'. Inexpensive oil supports our very way of life, as we know it. It is crucial for our transportation, food production, economy and basically everything that we use on a daily basis.<br /><br />In his 2006 State Of The Union address, President Bush publicly acknowledged for the first time that we are addicted to oil. Unfortunately, that's only part of the story. Addictions of any kind can result in catastrophe when the supply falls short or the costs rise beyond reach before curing the addiction. You owe it to yourself and future generations to learn more today.<br /><br />It is time for all Americans to take individual responsibility for our future. Our industrial society, built on cheap and readily available oil, must be completely redesigned and overhauled Â… immediately. The changes ahead are going to be very difficult; and will be hardest for the ones who didn't, or wouldn't, see it coming, and didn't prepare adequately for it.
