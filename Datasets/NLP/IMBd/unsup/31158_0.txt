A bunch of people in a bar are slightly distressed when a blood-covered, shotgun-wielding "hero" bursts in and warns them all about ravenous, speedy creatures travelling not far behind him. The patrons are rather disbelieving until one creature gets inside and proceeds to try and eat as many people as it can.<br /><br />This film starts off quickly and doesn't really let up for it's duration. It's a lot of fun and I loved the mix of humour and nasty gore moments (the brief bios of each person were particularly enjoyable). The editing was a little bit choppy at times but everything else was well done. And kudos to a real mixed-bag cast (including Balthazar Getty, Henry Rollins and Jason Mewes playing . . . Jason Mewes) who embrace the material with gusto and totally go along with the humour of the project. It's a bit of a no-brainer with no comment on our society of today or underlying, deeper story strands. Sometimes, that is just what you need from your horrors. I'd happily recommend this to any horror fan and was glad to see it at last.<br /><br />See this if you like: Tremors, Tales From The Crypt: Demon Knight, Slither.<br /><br />NB, this review was adapted from the original written under my old RockySchlockyRobot ID that I have long forgotten how to access.
