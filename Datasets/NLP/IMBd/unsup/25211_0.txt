Although there were a handful of Technicolor films before this one (as early as 1922), this is the one that EVERYONE saw and so truly introduced the process to the nation. The reds and blues are quite lovely and photograph far better outside under natural lighting than inside the studio where I had mistakenly assumed the controlled lighting would have made these shots superior to the exterior ones. It's a non-stop swashbuckler and a lot of fun to watch. One almost feels wicked seeing a silent film in color - as if we're being allowed to see something we ought not to be. Fairbanks is in top form and Sam de Grasse is a suave pirate villain. Quite worth adding to your video library.
