I can't say for certain but I suspect that mister Burt I. Gordon is a bigot. That's right, even in this movie released in 1977 there was no characters or actors of any kind of minority. All pure white Americans. Joan Collins even speaks with an American accent or at least she tries. Plus the kind of effects used in this movie didn't work in the 1950s', so what made Burt think it would work in the 1970s'. When I was a kid there was a whole week of giant monster movies and my Grandmother said I could watch only one and unlucky me I picked EMPIRE OF THE ANTS. Burt I. Gordon will be forever in the list of history's worst directors, along with Ed Wood Jr., Jeff Leroy, Don Dohler and Nick Zedd You can tell the ants were in a glass case, the way they walked straight up. Plus, in one scene, the ant was walking on the sky. Card board post cards are not a special effect. This movie would offend ants if they could understand what they were watching and I give it the THANKSGIVING TURKEY.
