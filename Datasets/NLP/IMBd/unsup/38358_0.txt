That was Then,This is Now. An awesome book,but TERRIBLE movie. I mean you take a novel like That was Then,This is Now which is so good and made it a terrible. Hollywood truly did not understand the point of the book. Why? Because they changed the freakin ending! The sad ending of That was Then,This is Now is why the book is so popular and yet they replace it with a happy ending. And dear god, Craig Sheffer is plain horrible as Bryon. He doesn't even try to do good. He just plays the Character and acts all bored and stuff. Frank Howard as M&M,okay he has the look,but also doesn't even try. Jill Shoelen hardly makes Angela Shepard look like the bad girl. Honestly, the only good acting is Emilio Estevez as Mark Jennings, Kim Delaney as Cathy Carlson and Barbra Barbock as Mrs.Carlson. Morgan Freeman has a good act for Charlie Woods,but in the scene when Charlie comes out with his shotgun, honestly your suppose to be in the scared moment,but the way he walks in with the shotgun makes you laugh.<br /><br />Now for the ending: <br /><br />Book ending:M&M takes LSD and his head gets messed up. Bryon finds out Mark had been selling drugs and thinks he gave M&M the LSD. When Mark comes home,Bryon tells him he called the cops. Mark just stands there and says,"Why are you doing this to me buddy?" The police take Mark away. Bryon hurts Cathy which causes their break up. The doctors say M&M will never be the same. When Bryon visits Mark in jail, Mark tells him the only reason he wanted to see him is to make sure he hated him and that when he gets out of jail he will never go home.<br /><br />The terrible happy ending:M&M takes drugs but it is unknown what he took and his condition is unknown. Bryon and Cathy break up because Bryon calls M&M a F**king retard. Instead of Bryon calling the cops on Mark, he tells him to leave and never come home. Mark takes the car and gets arrest for a speed chase. Bryon and Cathy get back together. When Bryon visits Mark, instead of Mark saying I hate you, he says,"I'll be fine. Everything well be alright." After Bryon leaves,he hot wires a car,drives it around and tells the owner,"Chill dude" just like Mark.<br /><br />The more problems with this film is how Ponyboy Curtis and Mike Chambers{yes Mike} are cut from the film. Mike should have never been cut from the film. Mike told a story that proves revenge is pointless and it was cut. Ponyboy may have not been important,but at least his role would have made the movie better! In conclusion,That was Then,This is Now is a terrible film adaption. We demand a remake!
