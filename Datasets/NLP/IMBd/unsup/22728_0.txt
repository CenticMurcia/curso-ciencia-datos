Saawariya isn't a perfect film... actually nowhere near being perfect.... BUT hey......this movie isn't a TRASH either.... i was really stunned by the Cinematography and the art direction of the movie.... it was beautiful.... many people say they were confused of what time period the story took place in???? Well this is a land of imagination...a far far away land........ time period wasn't the crucial thing in the movie... YEs the story is FLAWED......... i hated the ending............ anyways.... Sakkena- SOnam Kapoor wasn't really impressive........... she tried..........but she convinced me that she was crazy... and thats the only reason why i liked the movie.... Ranbir kappor is GOOD, not great but surely he will get BETTER...soon.... as for RANI she is never BAD.... Sanjay leela Bhansali made a beautiful looking movie... not necessarily a great movie.... but if u watch it with it with Open minds then maybe u will LOVE it.... or lets say Be able too see something more meaningful in the rather Simple Ending???? the ending is a bit IFFY and OPEN ended i guess.... well thats the reason why i liked the movie....though i bet Sanjay leela Bhansali dint intend the movie to imply so.... Anyways I don't Think of Sanjay Leela Bhansali as a terrific Director though KHAMOSHI made me cry like hell....and moreover he was the one who hired ASH and Salman in his SUPERB film Hum dil De....WHo are both the WORST actors India has ever seen... anyways i hope Sanjay leela Bhasnsali gets a Original script and SOME Better actors to work on his next movie.... getting back to Saawariya... One thing that cant be denied is that this is a very important movie in the History of India... many Firsts in this movie.... I hope people instead of criticizing, learn some things from this movie...and make more imaginative and beautiful films...which Indian cinema Absolutely LAcks....
