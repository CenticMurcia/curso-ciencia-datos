Over the years there have been many movies and TV films about the oldest profession, CALL GIRLS and MADAMS!!! Jamie-Lynn DiScala(Heidi Fleiss),"Death of a Dynasty",'03, showed her great acting skills in letting everyone see the two sides of being a CALL GIRL with lots of MONEY and more men than you can HANDLE!! However, it also showed the down side with drugs and the horrible price one has to pay for living this type of life. Robert Davi(Ivan Nagy),"One Last Ride",'03, gave a great supporting role as a two timing PIMP, who only used Heidi Fleiss for his own pleasure and $$$$!! There never will be a happy ending to this type of film in the movies or in real LIFE!!! There is always a Price to be PAID.
