This comedy was touching, scathing and educational. The film addresses the stereotyping of Latinos, and the tremendous economic power the Latin population has in the state of California. Few films are brave enough to take on this sort of subject matter. We see the decimation of the police force, agriculture, and the entertainment biz. But the message is not given in a preachy or cynical style. It's a really great movie for younger audiences because the satire has tremendous heart. It's good for adults too because it's biting and intelligent. Tremendously entertaining and informative. I loved the "surprise ending" and the basic message that family is not defined by blood alone.
