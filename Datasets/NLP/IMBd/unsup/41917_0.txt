Okay, it had its moments. The plot, or rather the idea behind the plot was pretty good. The science talk seemed slightly more scientific than usual (Well, not being a rocket scientist, for all I know they could have been exchanging formulas for melted butter - but it sounded right in the first part of the movie). Some of the acting even appeared okay. But then it all ends. Introducing a computer wiz never actually doing any wizzing other than shouting commands at his homebuilt and amazingly awkward computer system. Hacking into what was clearly analog CCTV!? Not to mention camera angles requiring surveillance cameras literally all over the place. Why did Mr. Fulton send Luke through a hole but Teri over the fence instead? How do you get nuclear material into a tokamak without shutting it down? And then at last; a climax as exciting as a flat tire. No, this is definitely a colossal waste of even the dullest evening.
