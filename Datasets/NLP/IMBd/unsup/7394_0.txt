We all had seen side stories of Dragonball before and all of 'em deserved appreciate. I still cannot believe I wasted my time because of this movie. This movie is so pointless. This movie provided me to think this question only: How many generation will this Dragonball continue? How many idiotic new generation characters we have to watch? I only watched the first 4 episodes of Dragonball Gt and when I saw the atmosphere, characters (especially Pan), and synopsis, I rejected to watch DBGT. We had enough pain by watching Pan anyway, and now is it her grandson?? Who cares this. To me, even Gohan was unnecessary. After Goku died, they tried to upload the whole story onto him. But that character couldn't give enough to carry this big project. I even always hated the young Gohan. He must never have been born. After this fiasco, Pan was born. Painful!! And now her coward grandson with her stupid characteristic.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of original Dragonball and the art of it. I have still bearing the questions about the place of Dragonball Z that was it really necessary - That Gohan character, or Goku's being grown up, etc... But I cannot even stand GT.<br /><br />This movie is just nothing but a waste. Scenario is awful. You wait so much things and it gives nothing. We just watched the pathetic Goku. The best solution would be that they must stop this producing new generation and its new characters. STOP THE TIME AND BRING THE ORIGINAL CAHARCTEEERS!!! Young Goku and Yamcha will be enough!!
