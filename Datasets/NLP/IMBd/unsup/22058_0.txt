This film is a sleeper. <br /><br />I had never heard of it an hour and ten minutes ago, and just caught it on television. William Powell's performance is outstanding. <br /><br />My own delightful surprise find was Aline MacMahon, who was sublime as the Countess; what a beauty she was. <br /><br />The sound and visual effects as shown on TCM are crisp and clear. It's a solid film that belongs on DVD.<br /><br />I suspect we will never get the chance to own it for home viewing because of its age-1932, and the unfortunate trend of too many to dislike or ignore films older than six months
