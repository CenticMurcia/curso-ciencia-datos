Agent Dick Steele (Leslie Nielsen) must partner up with Agent Veronique Ukrinsky (Nicollette Sheridan) to stop General Rancor (Andy Griffith) from destroying the world with a nuclear missile hidden in his secret base. <br /><br />So, apart from that, I thought this movie was going to be a funny one. It wasn't, except for Weird Al Yankovic singing the opening theme song, which was quite entertaining. The rest of the film just tries way too hard to be funny which makes the film look really silly, like Police Academy for example (except that had more funny moments but there weren't many). Anyway, to sum this review up, all I can say is just don't bother watching this movie.
