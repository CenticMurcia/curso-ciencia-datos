This movie is about as perfect as a movie can be. Perfectly cast, perfectly acted, beautiful scenery, costumes, settings... Every woman who has seen this movie immediately falls in love with Colin Firth's Darcy. The adaptation is very true to the book, with some small changes that do not diminish the story whatsoever, so rare for a movie based on a classic. I loved the comic characters as well. Alison Steadman deserves an award (did she get one?) for her portrayal of Mrs. Bennet, and David Bamber was so marvelously smarmy and repulsive. I have seen this movie countless times and each time I enjoy it as much as the time before. Congratulations to all the people who worked so hard to put this marvelous production together. I even had to buy the book "The Making of Pride and Prejudice," on a recent trip to England, and the book is a wonderful companion to the movie and a great gift for any fan. I recommend this movie for women and men alike. I have yet to meet anyone of either sex who hasn't become a fan of the movie after watching it, and even my cousin Guy, who's a bit of a modern-day Neanderthal, throws out a Lady Catherine quote now and again.<br /><br />This movie is still by far the best adaptation of this book. (The Keira Knightley version has its own charms here and there, but overall was a big disappointment to purists and was not historically accurate at all, though Donald Sutherland did add a surprising sweetness to Mr. Bennet - a nice if not faithful interpretation.)<br /><br />There is one little editing goof in this version that does make me smile. How many times do they tell us that Lambton is but five miles from Pemberley?
