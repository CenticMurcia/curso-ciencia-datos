Take Kevin Smith's cult flick Clerks, change the convenience store to a billiard shop, and make the leading ladies really hot, and you'll end up with Kisses and Caroms. Oh yeah, make it in color too! Zack's problem comes almost right out of Chasing Amy. He doesn't feel experienced enough sexually to be in a committed relationship with his very hot ex-girlfriend, who for some reason adores him. Unlike Chasing Amy however she's willing to let him get 'experienced' with her a la menage a trois. Most of us can only wish to have his 'problem'. It's actually my only real beef with the movie, as I wanted to smack him around for being such a moron for breaking up with her in the first place! The movie is complete with its funny moments with annoying customers and such. My personal favorite is a 'small' joke when a midget comes in.<br /><br />Basically, if you love Clerks, you gotta check out this homage to it. If you don't, go rent a movie about pizza or something.
