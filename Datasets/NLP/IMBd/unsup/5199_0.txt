This is one of the best Dragon Ball movies. It has Goku, Trunks, Gohan, Vegeta, Piccolo, Krilin, Mutenroshi... the story is interesting, Broly is a fantastic villain and the action is spectacular. In my opinion, it has only one problem: what we see in the movie isn't actually a fight. It looks more like Broly's training or something like that, because Goku and co. can't even hit him because he's too strong. All the action we can see in the movie is Broly hitting and the Z team receiving, it can become a bit boring. I would have preferred a weaker Broly (I'm not saying a pathetic one, of course), so we could see an authentic EXCHANGE of punches, and not this. Anyway, the movie is fantastic. It has very memorable scenes (I love the beginning, with a suited Goku) and the Z team does his best. A must see for all Dragon Ball fans.
