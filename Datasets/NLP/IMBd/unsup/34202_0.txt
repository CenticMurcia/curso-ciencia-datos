This movie has the feel of a first year college want to be director. The cover art on the box makes it out to be a horror film and if you go to rent it, it will be found in the horror section. Let me tell you, it is NOT a horror film! I'm not really sure how to rate this one because it is so bad. This movie wouldn't even make a good COMIC BOOK and I've seen some really bad ones of those as well. Not that I will give anything away by saying this, but the story has so many holes you could drive a truck through them. The acting is so dry that I found my self falling asleep in my chair when I should have been jumping out of it. Unless you want to waste almost two hours of your life I would stay as far away from this movie as you can.
