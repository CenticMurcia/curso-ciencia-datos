Not much to say about this film. Why do they make these? And for whom? Typical "horror" film with a non-existent plot and awful acting. And the beginning, although the best part of the film with loads of good looking babes, is exceptionally pointless. A group of teenagers go to a party outside city and are later on chased by satan worshippers. Makes you shake your head in disbelief. Not much of a tension anywhere in the film. And the chemistry between the leading roles doesn't work. I don't even want to tell anything about the rest of the film, because someone might be surprised about the turnaround in the plot. I personally could not watch the whole movie because I started feeling nausea. But this movie can be used as a test. If someone can watch it, he/she could have a future in...Hollywood?
