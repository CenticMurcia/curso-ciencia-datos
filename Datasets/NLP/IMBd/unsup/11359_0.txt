This spectacularly silly'n'slapdash soft-core Sasquatch smut really needs to be seen in order to be believed. Gaynor MacLaren's patchy script offers more of a snazzy idea than an actual story: A lonely peeping tom Bigfoot abducts sexy'n'shapely sensuous young hippie honeys from a nearby commune and takes them back to his cave to keep him company. Fortunately, director Roy Naneau inexhaustibly milks the skimpy premise for every last sensationally shameless, leering, voyeuristic girl-watching cheap sleazy thrill he can derive from the laughably ludicrous story, with the picture hitting its jaw-dropping surreal apex during a wacky nightmare sequence showing two luscious stark naked gals having an Old West-style gunslinger showdown! And frankly who needs an it-would-only-get-in-the-way hokey plot when you got busty'n'lusty Irish redhead hottie supreme Sharon Kelly, the impossibly voluptuous Uschi Digard and the deliciously lissome Sandra Carey peeling off their cloths and happily displaying their delectable unclad bodies with pleasing regularity? I sure don't. The uproariously inappropriate hip, mellow, finger-snapping cocktail lounge score takes the viewer straight to aural groovesville while the ratty, scratchy photography further spices up the film's fantastically lurid'n'loopy sense of blithely unapologetic degeneracy and the maladroitly jumping back and forth fragmented narrative eschews continuity in favor of a peculiarly becoming "what the hell's going on here?"-type disjointedness. And the Bigfoot itself is a splendidly sickly, shabby, shambling gasser to behold: With its fat, putty-nosed face, mangy black coat, large white teeth, and gigantic, muscular behemoth build, the hirsute Polish Mongoloid lecher resembles a last place loser participant from a tenth-rate kindergarten Halloween costume party contest. A so-terrible-it's-quite-tasty cinecheese hoot.
