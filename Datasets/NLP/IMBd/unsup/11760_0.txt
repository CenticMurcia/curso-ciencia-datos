It's got Charles Grodin and Bonnie Hunt! How could that possibly be bad?? They are always a pleasure to watch. Beethoven's 2nd is worth watching just for them. Beyond that, it's not high art and child actors and not entirely engaging, but it's cute and fun and and quite watchable -- and who could like something with five adorable St. Bernard puppies? Sure, it occasionally drags, but you can't expect Grodin and Hunt to be in every scene. And as a bonus we get Debi Mazur doing a great turn as a comic villain!<br /><br />Lighten up and enjoy a cute film with a pair of exceptional comic actors.
