I had not read the book that this was based on. There was even a sense that this would be a waste of time. <br /><br />I realized I was very wrong. As others have mentioned in their comments: this is no Hollywood canon fodder intended for the spoon-fed masses.<br /><br />Some interest in mathematics or science is not essential but more than likely contributes to ones viewing of the film.<br /><br />I found the story very thoughtful and entertaining at the same time. The film is well executed and easy to watch. <br /><br />(Two dimensional characters do not have facial Tiks - just my thoughts)
