I sometimes watch movies on Lifetime and this is one of the best. It's about Amy who starts high school and has goals and dreams. She thinks that the football coach, Peter Nash, is in love with her but she's only thirteen years old. They have an affair and it's just so wrong and disturbing to watch. Amy thinks that it's all about love but Peter Nash is controlling her. He calls her and calls her and then says that he cannot live without her. Amy is a young woman and for this creep to come along and do this to his students is sick. It made my stomach turn when Coach Nash was in jail for raping her and he asks someone to give her a love letter. The acting was well played out because Amy looked so innocent and Coach Nash was just a loser who was only controlling her. I'd probably watch it again if it was on.
