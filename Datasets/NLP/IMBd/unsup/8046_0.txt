To date, the only other films I've seen by Luigi Batzella are "Devil's Wedding Night" (abysmal) and "Beast In Heat" (SUPER abysmal). However, "Nude For Satan" is a much better film in many ways, but it will definitely not be for all tastes.<br /><br />A doctor, racing to an emergency call, sees what he thinks is a woman in the road and slams on his brakes. His little Volkswagen has been screaming along the back roads like it was a Maserati, from the sound of it. But, before he can get out of his car, there's a crash & there's a woman who has wrecked her car and is hanging out the door, so he puts her into his car, which will then not start. He sees a nearby house so he goes for help, but encounters a very strange man who then disappears. The lights in the house go out when he calls for help, but the front door is open so he wanders in to find the house seemingly abandoned & full of debris. In exploring, looking for someone, anyone, he opens various doors to find nasty surprises inside. And then, he seems to find the woman that he rescued from the accident, surprised to find that she has made it to the house.<br /><br />As the film goes on it seems that the doctor and the woman are in some kind of alternate reality, in which they have doubles. And there's a mysterious man who seems to preside over all that is weird there, presumably, Satan. In encountering the Satan character for the first time, the woman appears nude, while we get a close-up of Satan's eye...talk about undressing someone with your eyes! For the most part, this is very dream-like (or nightmare-like, to be more accurate), and while it's somewhat nonsensical it's still quite interesting and a far better offering than the other trash I've seen by this director. If you like weird Italian horror films, this is definitely worth checking out. 7 out of 10.
