Highly under-rated British comedy with many memorable characterisations, not a bad script, and a wonderful feel-good factor.<br /><br />John Alderton is pretty much faultless as Hedges - this is fine comic acting.<br /><br />Especially enjoyable if you grew up in the 1970s. Standout sequence for me is when Hedges (and we) think 5c have gone to bed for the night and he heads off to the pub with Price... only to bump into his pupils there. Nicely done.<br /><br />Other amusing sequences also, and I can sum up the film using an expression of Dennis's (one of the characters)... "Yeah! Double NEAT!!"
