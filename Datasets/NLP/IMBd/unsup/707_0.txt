When you combine Robert DeNiro--our greatest actor--and Billy Crystal--one of our greatest comedians--how can you go wrong? It was a joy to see the two greats on screen together. They were absolutely magnificent and had incredible chemistry. The way their personalities conflicted with one another was a riot. Another noteworthy member in the cast is Joe Viterelli, who's also a riot as DeNiro's henchman Jelly. Lisa Kudrow has some funny moments and Chazz Palminteri is...CHAZZ!!! He's such a cool actor that his mere appearance can make a film worthwhile. He only has a supporting role, but he's great as always.<br /><br />The film has some priceless gags. Some of the best lines I've ever heard were from this movie. One that really sticks out is when DeNiro consults Crystal in the middle of the night because he couldn't...get it up. Yes, it's what you're thinking. When Crystal advises him to take some sort of drugs to help his "problem," DeNiro replies "Drugs--I don't take drugs. A hard-on should be gotten legitimately or not be gotten at all." Crystal replies in a dry sarcastic tone, "I think Mark Twain said that." I also have to note the hilarious scene where the two guys come face to face for the first time, in Crystal's office. DeNiro asks the shrink:<br /><br />"Do you know me?" "Yes," he replies. "No you don't." "No, I don't." "Did you see my picture in the paper?" "Yes." "No you didn't!" "No, I didn't."<br /><br />And there's a great interaction in which Crystal explains a theory by Sigmund Freud about a child in Greece who killed his father because he wanted to marry his mother. DeNiro quickly replies:<br /><br />"Are you saying I wanna f**k my mother? Have you seen my mother?" "Well, Freud said--" "Well, Freud's a sick f**k!"<br /><br />There's so many memorable moments, but I don't want to give them all away to those who haven't seen the movie. Because these are some of the funniest gags in film history. One moment--and this will be the last one I'll mention--that also made me roll with laughter was the funeral sequence in which a family member got a little over-affectionate with Crystal. DeNiro replies, "Him I don't know."<br /><br />When I saw "AT" in theaters, the place was filled up and people would laugh out loud in unison--like a fifties sitcom audience--at every funny scene. That's a rare occurrence, and I feel great joy whenever it actually happens. <br /><br />The comedy is not done in blatant, screwball fashion. The actors let the laughs come to them, and play it straight. Crystal has a magic way of delivering sarcastic dialogue that only people like Albert Brooks and Woody Allen can surpass. DeNiro spoofs his gangster persona without being superficial about it. He lets the audience search for the inside jokes on their own. People say DeNiro is not suited for comedy. Sure, he's not the Jim Carrey-type of comic actor, but I think that's what makes it work. In films like this and "Meet the Parents" DeNiro doesn't try too hard and is never over-the-top. He expresses the comic dialogue with good timing and good delivery, without making it look like he's trying to be funny. And Joe Viterelli, who's been in other movies but I first discovered him on this one, is great at playing the bumbling henchman and I hope to see him more often. He has great talent. <br /><br />"Analyze This" is a hilarious, wildly original comedy that should have you rolling in the aisles. This is one comedy that won't make you leave with guilt. You're watching two great performers and the humor, though sometimes racy, is all in good taste. <br /><br />My score: 8 (out of 10)
