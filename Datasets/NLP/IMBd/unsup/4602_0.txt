This movie is completely amazing! I'll start with the storyline. The storyline in itself is awesome, never mind the actors. Jacey is a 16 year old girl who has had a beautiful baby boy, in secret. Her mother thought that it would be best that they kept it a secret and not to tell the father, so they did. Jacey was supposed to put the baby up for adoption but when push came to shove she just couldn't give her Son away, so her mum decides that she will raise the baby and Jacey will just go back to High School and lead a normal life, like it never happened. They move away but nothing changes, Jacey still wants her baby, she wants to be a mother. Throughout the movie it shows you the lives of two of her teachers, coach bob and Mrs cooper her councillor who are married. They have been trying for a baby for a year and cannot conceive, they were going to adopt a baby but the birth mother changed her mind at the last minute. Jacey becomes close to this family, although at the start she doesn't seem to want to know them. At the end of the movie, Jacey realises what is best for her son and lets the Coopers adopt him but she is a strong part of his life.<br /><br />Danielle Parabaker plays Jacey so well, you can definitely connect with the character. Now, I next to never cry but at the end when Jacey decides to let the Coopers adopt her son,Charley, is so sad but yet happy. It made me cry because I felt like I could relate to her, like I was giving away my son, thats where Danielle really shows her true talent. I totally lost it at the very end when they were making the home video of Charley's first day at Kindergarden, I was in tears the whole scene!! Defiently recommend this movie!
