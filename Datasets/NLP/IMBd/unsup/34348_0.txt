I liked the first movie. This sequel was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The first one actually occasionally made the viewer frightened and feel some suspense. This one was basically just watching the characters be frightened and people being gored to death. I never once felt scared. There is also an amazing lack of humor in it. Whomever wrote it should never write another movie ever again. The actors were sleepwalking through it. Same with the director. The producers should be gauged with a hook. None of these problems were the fault of Jennifer Love Hewitt's breasts though, which is why I rated the film a 2 and not a 1.
