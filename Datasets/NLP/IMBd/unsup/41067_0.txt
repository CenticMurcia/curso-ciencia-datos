When a movie tries to get most of its power from a plot twist you've figured out well before halfway , there's a serious problem. You think it can't be that simple and hope for something better to come up, only to find out that yes, it is that simple. This whole production just screams nobody cared, screen writing brings images of monkeys with a typewriter to mind. Continuity is for pussies. This Tammy person talks about how she got to know Pandora's Box when she went there with Lance, then seconds later announces there's a rule that you should come alone the first time. They even tried to make this into an erotic thriller (you know, a skin flick), but the main actress is really not fun to look at. Or listen to. Or just experience in general. She gets the words out, that's all I can say. The sex scenes all just feel awkward and sleazy. And low on creativity. I mean, a bubble bath? Seriously? Is she going to order a pizza next? This is a failure on so many levels, it could have worked with a better screenplay, better director, better actors, better cinematography, and even then just barely. It's a pretty nasty movie that's not even entertaining or anything.
