'Honeymoon in Vegas' is, as the title suggests, a romantic comedy film. Fans of Elvis are sure the love this film with all of the Elvis references and a whole team of skydiving Elvis impersonators near the end of the film. This film is just the typical American romantic comedy of the 1990s. It's not a particularly memorable film, but there are some funny scenes. My low rating for this film is due to the story and the characters; it just was not engaging enough to make a really good story, and now that I have seen it once, there is nothing in it that would make me go back and watch it again - unless, maybe I was an Elvis fan. It's not a great film because it has little to offer, and it blends in with all the others.
