There's nobody to root for, or even care about, in Ed Holzman's would-be erotic thriller. Dominick (Bobby Johnston) runs a "private social club" that's really a front for an international prostitution and blackmail operation. Suzanne (Maria Ford) owns a clientless ad agency; a "friend," Nick (Scott Carson) suggests Dominick as a potential client. Dominick and Suzanne proceed to do their best to outwit each other in a series of sexual games.<br /><br />With both of the principals more or less equally amoral, the only possible fun in this movie is watching them go at each other. But Holzman's leisurely pacing throughout, and characters that never go beyond skin deep, spoil the fun. Dawson is wasted as Dominick's personal assistant, Mona. The one character who has a shred of decency is Suzanne's assistant, Tracy (Stephanee LaFleur), but she's clueless and powerless--not much more than a spectator.<br /><br />Holzman has done better work than this. The sex scenes even start to get tedious halfway through the film.
