I haven't seen something like this since the Holy Grail. Sure it is obvious. Sure they are all jokes your dad thinks are funny and everyone else groans at. This is like pantomime. You KNOW everything is ridiculous and exaggerated. The delivery and execution of classic lines are very good, and even though you know exactly what to expect, they still make you smile when they are delivered. This is a film that can only be appreciated when you have developed a very fine sense of irony whilst retaining the ability to laugh at simple things and yourself. There are multiple pop culture references that may elude someone not familiar with German culture, but for me, it was a fine illustration that not all comedy must be sophisticated on the surface. Don't watch this if you think American Pie is Champagne comedy. Your sense of irony won't be refined enough to appreciate it. The delivery of gags in this is also faster than for a typical Hollywood style movie. The buildup for each dull joke doesn't take half the movie and leave you squirming, KNOWING that X is going to happen, you just have to wait for it. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
