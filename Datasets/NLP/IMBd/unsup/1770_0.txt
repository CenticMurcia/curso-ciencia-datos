Squall Leonhart, a courageous young man, who gets his training skills at the Balamb Garden. Because of his lack of trust in anyone, Squall isolates himself from everyone in the Garden. His excellent fighting skills soon makes him a SeeD, an organization who goes against the sorceress, who soon comes into the picture and tries to destory and take over the world. Now it's up to Squall and his new friends to try to stop the sorceress from destroying the world. Yet that's not all - soon Squall learns the meaning of true friendship and surprisingly - LOVE. And who is Laguna Loire and Ellone?<br /><br />Joining Squall in his great adventure are:<br /><br /> - Quistis Trepe - the SeeD instructor who, like Squall, suffers from loneliness, and becomes an older-sister figure to Squall and the other SeeDs<br /><br /> - Zell Dincht - a fun-loving SeeD who loves wild and risky adventures, and is one of the best fighters in the Balamb Garden.<br /><br /> - Selphie Tilmitt - a SeeD with a cheerful, spunky, and bouyant attitude who also has great fighting skills like Squall and Zell.<br /><br /> - Irvine Kinneas - a ladies man originally from Galabia Garden (Balamb Garden's rival Garden), and sharpshooter who soon has a thing for Selphie, yet secretly has a sensitive and caring nature.<br /><br /> - Rinoa Heartilly - the princess of the Timber Owls, an anti-government orginazation who calls for the Seeds for help, who at first had a brief fling with Balamb Garden bully, Seifer Almasy, but soon falls helplessly in love with Seifer's arch rival, Squall.<br /><br />All I can say about this game is "WOW!"<br /><br />Can you believe the life-like graphics and animation on this game? Some say that "Final Fantasy VIII" is the weakest of the sagas (because of it's storyline), but I loved the storyline! The storyline is mostly, I think, based on life...explaining how a gifted lonewolf like Squall could learn to open up to his friends and the girl of his dreams especially. This story a long life lesson for all loners who feel isolated, and Squall's personality is an important part in the story and how his attitude changes, is even more important. <br /><br />As you read the dialogue, you can easily see what each of the characters are feeling...whether it's love (i.e. Squall and Rinoa), fear, courage, hopefulness (i.e. Zell and Quistis), sorrow, or happiness (i.e. Irvine and Selphie).<br /><br />Not to mention, the dialogue can also be pretty hilarious. Seifer's comment on Zell and Squall for example:<br /><br />"This is great! I have a chicken-wuss and a guy who just reached puberty in my squad!"<br /><br />"Final Fantasy VIII" is the first FF game I ever played, but on the other hand, it's very easy to. A LOT easier than "Final Fantasy VII". I even beat the Omega Weapon, which is the toughest monster on the game. Plus, the plot and storyline isn't as difficult as the 7th.<br /><br />Final Fantasy VIII has the best animation and kind of crosses over into new technology for video games and even Japanese Animation! :)<br /><br />TIPS: **Squall and Zell are the strongest fighters in the game** and **Squall, Zell, and Rinoa have the best limit breaks** And DON'T FORGET to get **AURA** magic, and DO NOT spend it all in one battle - or you'll be SORRY!!!!
