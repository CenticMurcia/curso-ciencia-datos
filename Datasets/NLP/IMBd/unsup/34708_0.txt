I got this movie just a day ago, and i must say that i regret that i bought it already. Maybe if i rented it, i would be able to laugh about it, but for the money that i paid, it just wasn't worth it. I feel robbed! The story isn't all that bad, in the right hands, and maybe a few minor changes, it could have been way better than this, i think. It's just that the dialoges and the acting in all seems so fake. The end was quite predictable, the boyfriends saves his girlfriend, blah blah blah. Too predictable.<br /><br />The bottom line: This movie was a horrible attempt to make a horror movie/Thriller. Most of the time you just shake your head over the poor acting, and the fact that "Death" makes you laugh every time he appears. If you're (like myself) like scary movies, horror, or thrillers, please don't see this!
