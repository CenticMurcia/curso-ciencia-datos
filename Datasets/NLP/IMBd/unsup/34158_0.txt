Terrible casting (or wasteful casting), bad acting, and historical inaccuracies (yes, so called history teacher from the U.S., it DOES matter!) Dumbed down, sexed up entertainment for those who would be just as amused watching a gerbil spinning around in his exercise wheel. Lots of action but very little real satisfaction at the end of the day. Hey, producers, here's a thought for you. Instead of trying to appeal to those who know little to nothing about history, why not spin a story for those who could REALLY appreciate it? I really pity the good actors who are attached to this series. Their talents are obviously being wasted. Poor Sam Neil, Peter O'Toole, and others. Too bad they have to be grouped with the likes of Joss Stone and other lightweights.
