It is almost criminal that a director, given the fan base, premise, and interesting character backgrounds/moves in advance to filming can produce such a steaming pile. This man had four aces and traded them away because he didn't understand the basic rules to five card stud.<br /><br />What the hell was with the story? M. Bison with children? Who the hell wants to see that? Chun li's three minutes of training was almost as much of a joke as casting the dude from American Pie as an interpol agent..<br /><br />What happened to the tournament.. you know.. the idea behind the game? Even the two mortal kombat movies got that much right. (I know at least the casting director saw those movies because Lou from MK is Gen) Worse, what the hell was with the fighting scenes.. Where is M. Bison's moves from the game, he does slides in the game, not standard martial arts, and where the hell was his Special MOVE? Worse, when do you see M. Bison with a bamboo stick in the game.. NEVER! Why is Vega such a push over.. why are the effects on chun-li's fireball so corny! It didn't look anything like the game, which is a fast-paced single motion fireball of chi and which could've been done aptly with today's cgi.<br /><br />The only thing worthwhile in this movie is a) the soundtrack (which was fitting), b) the cinematography (which was mostly fitting, good high key lighting, good color combination, fitting aura.. even though the Mise en Scene lacked originality or thought.. docks and guns.. really?) The casting is stupid (nobody looks like they should, or ACTS like they should.) The writing is corny, pretentious, and lacks ANY of the INTERESTING characters from the Street Fighter Game. The directing/editing was brilliantly as talentless as all these other elements. Too many dissolves. Too many pointless scenes. The inciting incident was stupid, as well as the plot.<br /><br />I could go on forever. To a person who paid 85 dollars to get the Street Fighter Championship and Hyper Edition on Sega Genesis when it first dropped, this movie is not just a disappointment, but a mind-boggling failure.
