It's nighttime at the Hunka Cheese Factory and Hubie and Berite have eaten all they can eat. Their stomachs are dragging on the ground, and they're almost gagging. Hubie points out, "The avenge mouse eats 12 pounds of cheese in a lifetime. I figured tonight, we've lived 2,000 years."<br /><br />In their twisted way of thinking, they figured since they've eaten all the cheese they could eat, there is nothing left to live for, so they write a suicide note stating "Goodbye cruel world. (signed) Hubie, Bertie, P.S. we've lived a full life."<br /><br />The funny stuff comes when the two crawl into the big (and stupid) Claude the cat's mouth....but cat wakes up and thinks all of this is too good to be true, or a dream, and spits them out. It goes on from there and the mice keep trying to be eaten and the cat keeps being suspicious and spitting them out.<br /><br />The cat even runs into the house's library and looks up "Mental Diseases - Their Causes and Cures" thinking either he or these little mice are nuts. The ironic twist is that the cat winds up thinking he, too, should end it all. We also get a dog involved.<br /><br />A bizarre but clever cartoon that doesn't evoke a lot of laughs but has a unique story.
