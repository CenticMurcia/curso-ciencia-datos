Just as some kids can be so mean; some movies can just suck like this one does. Don't judge the whole franchise by this installment. Its time for summer camp again and Ronnie(Paul DeAngelo)returns as the junior partner of camp owner Frank(Vincent Pastore). Ronnie wants to keep everyone in line and it isn't easy. Alan(Michael Gibney)is a chubby pain in the ass and a major disturbance at Camp Manabe. He always leaves confrontations with nasty threats, but is he to be feared? When campers and staff members mysteriously become victims of frying, burning and skinning Ronnie can't help but think of the grisly murders two decades earlier at Camp Arawak.<br /><br />At times pretty gross, but not as bad as the horrible acting. No sympathy to be had for Gibney, his character Alan possesses nothing to care about. This part could have been given to Rosie O'Donnell...and that really isn't much of an improvement. Music icon Issac Hayes plays Charlie the Chef, his last full role in a movie. Others in the cast: Jackie Thon, Jonathan Tiersten, Brye Cooper and the buxom Erin Broderick. There are as many tormented and unhappy campers as there are reasons this went straight to video.
