With the help of three low-life's, an ex-cop robs a bank but the gang must contend with the vengeful man who is initially accused of the crime. A terrific B-movie with Payne quite effective as the man intent on clearing his name and settling the score with the bad guys. The actor never rose above B pictures, but had a commanding screen presence. Gray is pretty as the love interest. The bad guys are well played by Foster and a trio of actors who made careers out of playing heavies: Brand, Van Cleef, and an unbelievably thin Elam. Karlson, who made two other films with Payne and specialized in these kinds of low-budget action films, keeps things moving at a nice pace.
