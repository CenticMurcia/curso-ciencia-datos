Just the name of Dr. Bones in the title gave me a shutter, but not in the direction of being scared but of the movie being a complete waste of time. Believe me, if you watch this sad example of a movie, it is a total waste of time. Some of the worst makeup on actors/actresses and I use that term jokingly. The worst effect of someone being electrocuted that I have ever seen. A plot of dead zombies and living zombies which are controlled because of music? I guess the movie was about the dead, and there is no doubt that even the living in the movie were just as dead as this movie is. Skip it and watch another bad movie, "Plan Nine from Outer Space." At least in Plan Nine it is funny!
