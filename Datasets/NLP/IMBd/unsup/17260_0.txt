One of the best movies I have seen in my life time! An absolute masterpiece from M Night Shyamalan. This film tells about a 10 year old boy Joshua A Beal's (Joseph Cross) quest for God after his grandfather's death.<br /><br />The performance of the kids in this film were stunning especially Joshua's. I simply fell in love with this boy's innocent face and meaningful questions he asks. One of the best things in this film is the dialogues that were highly thoughtful and brilliant.<br /><br />The running race scene in the school which involves Joshua's grandfather was a touching one where I couldn't control tears in my eyes. Other brilliant performers are Joshua's friend Dave, Robert (grandfather) and Sister Terry done by Rosie O'Donnell. This boy Joshua steals my heart, how could M Night Shyamalan brings out such a talent from his little heroes? Hats off Shyamalan, you were so unlucky this film didn't brought you laurels, in my view your best one.<br /><br />The feeling you get when you watch the movie is warmth, heartening which will last for some time. The best part is the climax where I couldn't control crying
