A photographer strangles homely models after he photographs them he then meets a ugly girl who strangles bums. Really not much more of a plot and aside from some narration added in post production. This is a stupid stupid film and if I hadn't already watched "Schizophreniac: The Whore Mangler", I would have thought it the worst serial killer film I had ever seen. But I DID see the aforementioned film so this one while still horrid, doesn't seem bad in comparison. The ONLY way to watch this travesty would be with the Joe Bob Briggs commentary on or not at all.<br /><br />My Grade: D <br /><br />DVD Extras: Movie Intro & Commentary by Joe Bob Briggs; Second commentary by Ray Steckler; Interviews with Steckler & Caroline Brandt; Production stills & poster art; and trailers for "Blood Shack", "Adventure of Rat Pfink and boo boo", "Slaughter Hotel", and "Nightmare come at Night" <br /><br />Eye Candy: Joanne Hiatt, Lori Morrir, Snowy Sinclair, Bonnie Smith, and Jean Robert all get topless
