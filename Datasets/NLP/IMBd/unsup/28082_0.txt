This is basically The Stand but with bad acting and a poorly thought out plot. A terrorist group has developed a deadly virus and it is unleashed on the world. I will give some things away here so stop reading if you don't want to know.<br /><br />A number of pretty stupid plot points happen: 1. The President and key personnel are quarantined on an island off of Washington. Of course, they announce to the world where this island is. (that would probably be kept secret) 2. A flamboyant financier tries to land on this island with 12 kids (and low fuel) and is almost shotdown, but spared at the last second. They allow it land and park on the runway but indicate anyone who gets off will be shot. Um, wouldn't there be extra airplane fuel around. Gas it up and send it back out! 3. The lab where they are trying to find a cure for the disease is not quarantined until it spills. 4. They realize they made need medical help for the kids on the plane, but there are no doctors on the island except some former country club doctor. Um, wouldn't there be some doctors as part of the President's essential personnel? 5. A flight attendant (I guess) just happens to be part of the Bleeding Sword terrorist group that created the virus. He eventually takes the plane hostage and forces a face-to-face meeting with the President to tell his story (his village was hit by so-called 'smart bombs'). There is a gunfight and the President dives to catch the virus he has brought to infect him. Oh, this guy who was smart bombed had absolutely no accent.<br /><br />It was just bad. The acting was horrible and melodramatic. It was a laugh riot!
