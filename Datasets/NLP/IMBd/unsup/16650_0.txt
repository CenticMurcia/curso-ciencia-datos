This movie is one of the best comedies ever made...It's hilarious how Martin's character can just pull nonsense out of no where and make the small-towners believe every word he says. They are the most absurd reasons for stealing and breaking the law ever. For example, the phony minister, the jump-starting cars in the army, 25 copies of one book just in case he wants to read it more than once, he put a stolen fish in his trunk while the weather was cold because there wasn't enough room in his freezer on account of another guy he knew gave him a side of beef, etc. Its brilliantly funny and the people who denounced it obviously didn't watch the movie close enough.
