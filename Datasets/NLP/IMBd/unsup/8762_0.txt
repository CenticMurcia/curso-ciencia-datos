"Woodstock is not only a documentary, it's a real piece of history that teels us what happened during that three days of pure heaven on earth (as a matter of fact Jimi Hendrix's performance was deferred two days later, so the days are practically 4). In fact, "Woodstock" won the Oscar as "best documentary". I hope that this film won't be forgiven by anyone!
