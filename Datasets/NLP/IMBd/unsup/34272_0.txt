It's unfortunate that this film was released only shortly before L.A. Confidential, which is a wonderful film that deserved its honors. Twilight, with its intriguing characters and twisty script, simply fell out of the limelight, and hasn't gotten the attention it deserves.<br /><br />There are faults in the script, to be sure, and even with this all-star cast, things are a little uneven. However, this film is a gritty, interesting thriller, focused on the playing out of lifelong grudges and desires. Much as Deep Impact was nominally a sci-fi film, but truly focused on the different ways in which people confront the end of the world, Twilight is only nominally a crime thriller, but truly focuses on the lengths to which people will go to preserve the legacy they desire. A satisfying, if not brilliant, film.
