This one is a long time favorite of mine. Don Knotts and Tim Conway are utterly hilarious in this comedy whodunit. Knotts and Conway are two investigators called in from Scotland Yard to investigate the death of Lord and Lady Morely, two wealthy British aristocrats. The supporting cast (who one by one mysteriously get knocked off and disappear from the house) which consists of the hired help at the Morely's home are equally hysterical and formidable catalysts to Knotts and Conway's humor. The next time you're at the video store looking for some light, funny fare, check this one out. It's well worth the rental.
