This was Elisha Cuthbert's best performance. It amazes me that she even bothers with films like "The girl next door". She is so much better than that. Cant wait for the upcoming "Captivity" in which she plays the lead role as a young women chained to a guy in a cellar as the kidnapper plays with their minds. Back to this movie...see it just for Elisha. The basic boy meets girl with a twist. the boy has a ghost in his house and he and his gal pal try to help it move on.. Tragedies in their past is what brings the two together. The ghost is what makes the story interesting even though Katherine(Elisha) is the only person in town who "believes" him. Both have bitter guardians living at home which are very well acted. See the movie...don't want to spoil the story
