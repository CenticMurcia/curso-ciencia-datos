OK, i have to admit i didn't watch 'Traumschiff Surprise', but it can hardly be any worse than this.<br /><br />There wasn't much of a story line here, but its a comedy so thats not really a big problem. But the jokes !!! Beware of the jokes!! They are so bad its painful. Except of a few they are not even funny-bad in the sense that you can laugh about how stupid they are, they are just bad.<br /><br />I'm just wondering how so many (supposedly) good German comedians could get into such a movie. what were they thinking? You have to be a REALLY great Otto-Fan to enjoy this movie.<br /><br />If there is ANY other movie playing in your local cinema go and watch that instead, it simply cant be any worse.
