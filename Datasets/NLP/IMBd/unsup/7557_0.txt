I have seen this show when I was growing up and I liked it very much<br /><br />Here in my country, the most of TV series of America came in under some format almost without any delay since decades ago.<br /><br />It is clear that this formula has been reproduced many times but I like the acting freshness, the connection with the characters, and of course the equipment they use in the rescues (who doesn't dream about a bronco)<br /><br />Well, I hope the DVD industry take care soon about the not so popular shows and release it quickly.<br /><br />PS: I loved the soundtrack
