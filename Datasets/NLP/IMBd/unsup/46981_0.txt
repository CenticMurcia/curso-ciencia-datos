People are mostly fooled by the title "ninja" and name "jubei" but this film is not the sequel of the "legendry" Ninja Scroll.<br /><br />The film is really(!) bad. A waste of money. I get bored writing these comments, but I felt like I had to this time, as I didn't want anyone else to fall into my position.<br /><br />Jubei is Jubei Yagyu from Samurai Spirits but don't be fooled, the game being good doesn't mean that the movie is good as well.<br /><br />One final important note: Film is not MANGA made, thus it is bad enough (Ninja Scroll was MANGA's)
