one of the best movies ever, i loved it it was brilliant, and i loved the parts where Ryan (Lucas Grabeel) actually fired back at his sister. all in all nothing i dislike about it. 10/10. this was one of the BEST musicals i have ever seen, i think musicals are making their comeback in the form of the HSM cast. I think the actors and actresses did a brilliant job playing and bringing the characters to life. I think this second one is better than the first, and Troy's penguin slide at the beginning made me laugh a little. My favourite song was I Don't dance which is a brilliant combo of singing and dancing and baseball at the same time. So like i said before all in all nothing to complain about.
