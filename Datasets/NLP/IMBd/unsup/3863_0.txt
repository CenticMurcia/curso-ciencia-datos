This landmark masterpiece defies strict classification. It is one of a few movies which defines cinema. It's undefinable as a genre because it works as a musical, as drama, as a comedy, as a war movie, as a social satire, as a historical epic, as a masterpiece of cinematic choreography, AND THE LIST GOES ON. Interestingly, it is over powering not only as a film, but as an original Broadway musical, a novel, a play, and most recently as a revamped musical which incorporates the new songs and choreography created especially for the film into the original show. And the Tony and other awards from other media keep pouring in. The new DVD version is a must. This is the movie that in a very tight Oscar race year (like 1939 with Gone with the Wind, etc.), won NINE Academy Awards. And that against the Godfather! (Part I, just for starters.) The late Bob Fosse did score a major coup by winning the Best Director Award over the favored legendary Director of the Godfather. Fosse's delegacy lives on...on film, and on stage right now in London, Berlin, and New York where the CABARET revival, did I mention CHICAGO?, and FOSSE, the musical- based on his life- including a piece from the movie of Cabaret continue to dazzle new generations. The DVD is a knock out too. Truly one of the best, a cliche often said. THIS CLAIM, however, IS A FACT.
