After watching the trailer for this movie, my wife and I were interested in seeing it and jumped at the chance to go to a free, advance screening.<br /><br />During the movie, it kind of felt like the story was going somewhere and even though it was fairly slow, I was interested. Then the movie ended, and it felt like nothing had happened at all. Despite the decent acting and the initial promise of the story line, the ending to the movie just made it feel like we had wasted two hours of our life.<br /><br />My wife also hated the way Rachael McAdams character was written. She said that she thought her character was written to be the stereo-typical sad, unintelligent woman.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, unless you need somewhere to go to take a nap for about 2 hours.
