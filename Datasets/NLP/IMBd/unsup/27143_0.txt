Well what can be expected with zero budget. On the other hand the movie has some highlights and it turns out just like the movies we make here for zero budget. Fun to watch for those who understand the background and a complete waste for those who want mainstream. My best moment is when the "Butte Police" character is at home and wastes some time in the sofa and stares around thinking of something to do. I guess the script said "sit in the sofa" and he had to think of the rest himself. I recommend it for people who makes home action movies for fun. There are some good punch-scenes also and some that could benefit from some more timing..
