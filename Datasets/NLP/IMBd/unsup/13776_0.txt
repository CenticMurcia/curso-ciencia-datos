I saw this when it was released and never forgot it, most of my friends also remember it clearly! It is a wonderful glimpse into the lives of lesbians in the 50s, in many ways different from now - the hidden=ness and secrecy, the butch femme culture - and in many ways so the same - who was going out with who, when, how they fell in love, broke up, wove their lives and made family of their friendships.<br /><br />Highly recommend it as an uplifting piece of Lesbian History, and a vision of what we younger lesbians may look like as we age. DELIGHTFUL!
