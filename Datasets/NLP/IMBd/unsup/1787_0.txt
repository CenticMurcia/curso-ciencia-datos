Okay, so this was not as explosive as the first "Beverly Hills Cop" movie, but it still had enough energy to succeed. Eddie Murphy is great here. His portrayal of Axel Foley in "Cop II" is just as hilarious as the character was in "Cop I." Look for appearances by Chris Rock and Gilbert Gottfried. They are funny, too. It is a must-see sequel.
