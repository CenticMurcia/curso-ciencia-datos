This is by far the worse movie I have ever seen. Everything about it is bad. The acting, the script you name it. I don't know what you people are smoking but this deserves burned. If you think 50 cent's acting was horrendous then you haven't seen anything yet. Camron acting makes 50 cent's performance in Get Rich or die trying a vintage Al Pacino acting. The supporting cast gives a very very lousy performance as well. I don't know how one of the reviewers in here can give it 10 stars. The plot is just the same old making it big time ala Scarface. It has no originality but if you are in for a good laugh then by god this is your movie right here.
