I think this is one of the first Belgium films I've ever seen so I didn't really know what to expect.<br /><br />Keeping in mind that I saw this in France, in French, with no English subtitles I think I understood well enough the plot. (je parle assez bien francais) Not to give anything away, a 40 something woman who works in a fast food shop gets locked into the shops freezer. From then she experiences I guess what you could call a mid-life crisis.<br /><br />It's funny, in an offbeat sort of way, there's not a lot of dialog... and i really must insist, if you do happen to find a copy of this film watch it in french with subtitles (i swear you lose so much from films when you watch it in the dubbed version) I'd give it 8 out of ten, because i came out of the cinema with a smile on my face thinking 'what the?' lol
