"It's 1939 and test pilot Daniel McCormick (Mel Gibson) has the world by the tail. He has a terrific job flying B-25s, a devoted soul mate (Isabel Glasser) and a long-time pal and confidant (George Wendt). In fact, he has everything. Almost. Despite his ability to confront danger, he can't look his girlfriend in the face and propose. He always decides to wait till tomorrow to pop the question but in one terrible instant he runs out of tomorrows. Tragedy takes his sweetheart away" according to the film's official synopsis.<br /><br />With his sweetheart in a coma, and given almost no chance of recovery, Mr. Gibson asks to be cryogenically frozen for one year. Gibson doesn't want to suffer through her demise, but asks to be thawed-out if she recovers. This is just one of many motivational problems with this film's characters. Why isn't he at her bedside? You're forever wondering WHY? as "Forever Young" proceeds. Anyway, Gibson awakens in 1992, and moves in with young Elijah Wood (as Nat Cooper) and his mom, nurse Jamie Lee Curtis (as Claire).<br /><br />After the camera lovingly shows his nude profile, a very fit and good-looking Gibson finds some clothing to wear, and goes to use a pay phone, outside a Ralph's supermarket. Incredibly, Gibson uses the 1992 push-button pay phone successfully. Probably, young Wood had some change in his pocket, and Gibson used a futuristic telephone at the 1939 World's Fair, or something... I can't manage those pay phones after one night's sleep, never mind 53 years.<br /><br />Nicolas Surovy does well as the "nice guy" who provides an escape route for Ms. Curtis and son, should they lose Gibson. Repeatingly telling the kids to "SHUT UP," Michael A. Goorjian has the second best scene in the movie, given the tree-house flying lesson Gibson gives Wood (but, learn how to use your wing flaps and rudder pedals properly, before trying to fly a real plane). And, cute little Veronica Lauren, recently "Sarah" in "Dark Shadows", is definitely worth serenading.<br /><br />**** Forever Young (12/11/92) Steve Miner ~ Mel Gibson, Elijah Wood, Jamie Lee Curtis
