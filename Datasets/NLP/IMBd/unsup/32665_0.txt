After watching 3 Ninjas: High Noon at Mega Mountain I have become a changed man. Before I was lost in a fog of listlessness and melancholy. I was in a state of deep depression that for all intents and purposes was inescapable. But then like a toaster dropped into the bathtub of my life, 3 Ninjas: High Ninja Mountains Hyper, changed it all. From the tight and clever writing to the on point set and lighting design everything was solid.<br /><br />A real stand out here was Terry "Hulk" Hogan as Dave "The Dragon" Dragon a semi washed up television star who is performing his final show at Mega Mountain. In what can be seen as art mimicking life in a sick form of jurisdiction.<br /><br />The only weak point here is the basic plan of the terrorists. For a group of highly trained mercs, lead by Lothar Zogg no less, it was lacking in forethought. Everyone knows you need to take into account ninjas being the monkey in your wrench.<br /><br />All in all 3 Ninjas: Mega Assault on Hyper Mountain is a fine film. I'd give it a shot if it happens to come on cable or the like.
