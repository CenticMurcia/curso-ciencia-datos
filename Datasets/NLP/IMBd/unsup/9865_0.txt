This movie resides on my top 10 of all time list. Sadly enough, I came up with a story concept not entirely unlike this story for a novel. Maybe this is why I was so enthralled by this film. Spoiler ahead!! Don't read any more if you don't want to know what happens towards the end!<br /><br />A mother's love for her son becomes more and more prominent ending in a suspenseful crescendo, where you can feel the Helen's suffering and powerlessness as she is thrown into a situation out of her control as she struggles for her life through labor pains. The rest of the film builds quite well up to this, as you are slowly shown the depths of the mother's obsession with only son.
