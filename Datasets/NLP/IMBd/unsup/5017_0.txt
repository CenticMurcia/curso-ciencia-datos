I'm not normally one for made-for-TV movies, but this one I actually hold close to my heart. It's odd.<br /><br />The movie is very cute, and very enjoyable. It's a little bit closer to reality (though, the chances of it happening the way it did is a bit far-fetched). Definitely had its funny moments and emotional ones.<br /><br />The movie suffered a little bit from the script, but then again I tend to be picky when it comes to delivery, so this might just be personal bias. There were also some parts of the movie that weren't explained clearly enough (such as Gabby's admirer and apparently hard-to-get reputation). <br /><br />I was very fond of the characters, though. Carly Pope, Sara Rue, and Brian Green did a great job. Acted very well--not over the top, yet not apathetic. Very human. I watched the movie three times in a row and I did not get sick of it. There was definitely a lot of "clever" put into the writing as well, such as when Gabby and Mel's plot from preparation to fruition. The romance was definitely very cute and enjoyable, while not being sickening.<br /><br />All in all, while it should remain as a made-for-TV movie, it's definitely a fun one to watch--a great date movie, if anything else.
