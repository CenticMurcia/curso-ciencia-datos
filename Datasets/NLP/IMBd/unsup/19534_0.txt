wha ha ha ha...kidding of course. I thought a joke like this was fairly obvious. The World's greatest lover is a complete Gene Wilder project and by this movie, he proves that he was one of the most talented comedians of his time. There often are moments of great genius to detect in this story about a fed up man who moves from Milwaukee to Hollywood to chase the American dream and become a world famous actor.<br /><br />Of course, you have to be a fan of very much over the top humor to enjoy this film but if you are...you certainly won't be disappointed. It becomes a bit boring from time to time but there are enough twists to keep you entertained till the end. There isn't a great idea behind the story but - as usual - it tries to teach you an important life-lesson by using comedy. In this case : your true love may walk beside you since a long time without you realizing it. Take a little time to stand still about your feelings and be true to your heart. Voil√†...isn't that something !!! Some great jokes ( especially the scenes with the hotel manager are hilarious ) and nice acting by Gene Wilder and Carol Kane. That's all you need for an 90 minutes of brainless but heart-warming entertainment! Enjoy...
