Unfortunately for me, i missed Sex and the City, and luckily for me, Cashmere Mafia but i would like to state for the record that this show is the pinnacle of my Sunday nights, it involves most of the things i wish i had, 100 shoes would be nice the clich√©s annoy me but the acting surprised me. The cheating on the husband fiasco loses the show some points, but i do love the rugged husband who does his washing. The underlying message that women can make it in the workforce and not have to apologize for it is strong in places, yet weak in others...like when they submit to the stereotypes of their gender. Some teething problems, but the show is dusted with a smooth romantic side including a house full of flowers and a candle lit romp. The series definitely has some potential and i look forward to enjoying the next seasons.
