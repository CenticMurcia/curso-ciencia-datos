Horrible fifties scare film starring mutant rodents gone bad, apparently Molemen and Giant Mantis weren't bad enough to scare folks. These shrews are nothing but greyhounds with poorly made costumes. The film is chalk full of racial stereotypes,bad special effects, and lacks any bit of sense. Out of all the creatures to experiment on why shrews? Our Swedish scientist tries to make the creatures sound deadly by assuring us that they will eat three times their body wait. The fake shrews weren't the worst part of the movie in my opinion. There is subtle racism at every corner. Our captain has an Uncle Tom African American counterpart and there is a helpful Mexican stereotype named Mario to assist our heroes. You know I never realized how influential Duane Jones performance in Night of the Living Dead was until I saw this piece of trash. Rent only if you want to turn off your brain for an hour or so. Works better as a comedy than a scare-film.
