I watched this movie at about 3 am one night, and perhaps it was just the late hour, but I was pleasantly surprised by this film. Aside from the aesthetically pleasing aspects of the movie (I'll leave that to your imagination), I actually didn't know who the killer was right up until the end. A feat most better movies can't pull off. I recommend renting this on a lonely, late night, if you have nothing better to do. This movie also contained a brilliant cameo by a flawless look-alike of an aged Dave Jourabchi.
