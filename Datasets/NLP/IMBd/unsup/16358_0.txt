I am like the other reviewer who saw the poster of this in a theater, oddly enough I think I was there to see Batman Returns. The poster was a picture of his shield and I said that might be cool, but alas this movie would never make it to the big screen. The problem is they apparently ran out of money after the first scene. Captain America goes after the Red Skull beating up Nazi soldiers then totally gets beaten up by the skull that doesn't look like a skull, but it is still creepy. Cap gets tied to a rocket which is launched at the White House then he diverts it to Alaska. After this the budget runs out and the middle is just the guy without his costume running around in modern America. The skull is still around and he now looks like a guy with a bad sunburn and he is trying to kidnap the Pres. There is a little action at the end, but it is not as good as the promising beginning. Cap does get to beat up the skull at the end too, but the guy has to be pretty old at this point so it isn't really a fair fight. <br /><br />The costume is pretty good and the guy looks like Captain America, but he is kinda whiney. This film isn't very good, but a worse Marvel movie is The Punisher, they couldn't even get the costume right in that one.
