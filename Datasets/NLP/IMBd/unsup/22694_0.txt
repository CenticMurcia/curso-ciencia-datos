I was one the few who saw an early edit of this film and really loved what I saw from this fun little indie. With the cameos from John Savage, Gary Bussey, Tom Sizemore, and Roddy Pipper it is worth seeing. And for the hotness of Tabitha Taylor ... Schwing...<br /><br />I don't want to give it all away , but the gist of is about an up and comer (Silvio Pollio) whose agent and producer (Joe Cortese) wants him to kill the competing top producers and catch it on film. It goes from Hollywood to Bollywood and back with laughs all the way.<br /><br />It is worth checking out for a few laughs. The action will entertain you for an hour and a half and doesn't have any downtime in it
