Some of you may have read my review of 'The Hobbit' on IMDB. If not, I suggest you do, as I think it brings up some things that should be realized.<br /><br />Like it's prequel, this movie has been plagued by bad reviews by mainly Tolkien-fans who believe that it oversimplifies the story, and that it takes things away until it has transformed their much-loved story of the beginning of the age of man into a kids-movie with no more value than being such.<br /><br />I strongly disagree. This movie is far from being a children's-film, though it is definitely enjoyed by many. As a child I watched it many, many times, until the point that the tape lost quality. And yet, after all those viewings, I didn't realize the important lessons it teaches.<br /><br />This movie tells a lot of its lessons through song. These songs can mean different things to different people, as all things in all movies do. The story, also, means different things in different perspectives -- to some, the loyalty or realizations of Samwise might be familiar to their own personality, and they will see what he goes through as their lessons. Others will see themselves as Frodo, having to go through a time of not only global(outter)-conflict, but inner as well, as they travel through that time and end up changed, and then have to move on past the troubled times they've triumphed over. Or it could be more complicated, those combined, or maybe also with the Ring becoming something they know.<br /><br />There's a lot to be learned from this movie, however you look at it, so long as it's not looked at with eyes that are searching only for the story from the book. If you watch it with an open mind, you'll learn something that will help you.<br /><br />I don't go into as much detail as I did in my review of the Hobbit, as this movie's lessons are much more broad, with there being more going on than in the prequel. It takes a mind looking for answers to see them in this movie, as everyone who looks at it with their different life-experiences and personality will interperet the songs and actions and deeds of characters differently.<br /><br />This movie and its prequel are wonderful things to experience for people of any age.<br /><br />"...and they [humans] may wonder... Is there 'hobbit' in me? Well, is there?"<br /><br />
