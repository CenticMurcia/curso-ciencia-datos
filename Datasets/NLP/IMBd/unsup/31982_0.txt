WARNING! This comment may give away what happens in the film!! I might be a little confused right now. I didn't get this movie i guess. What was Danika's problem? Did she not have that family at all or did she simple kill them all to protect them from everything? Is the shrink the nanny or is it a new affair? Is she the one who killed their neighbors dog and the schoolteacher of just a freak of nature? Is Danika a victim of her own imagination or is she really mad? I couldn't move from the DVD the entire movie, i was so sucked into the story and wanted to get it but i realize now that i didn't so now there is a hundred thoughts in my head. But don't get me wrong now! I really liked the movie, it was made good but i hope someone can explain it to me more so i can really get it in my head! I gave it 8/10.
