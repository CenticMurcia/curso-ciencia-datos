... because the gags are so quickfire and chucked into the script with little thought as to whether they suit the plot (what plot?) or whether the characters would realistically say them. No matter for me, because I was laughing all the way through, but I can appreciate why some people might not like that.<br /><br /> Like I said, don't go into this looking for a plot, because there isn't really anything other than the most basic premise to satisfy the distributors. I personally found it refreshing that the movie asked no requirement of me other than that I be able to laugh. This I did, loudly and frequently.<br /><br /> A final note on who I consider to be the main star of the show. It ain't Carrey. Jim, of course, does what we expect him to do. However, it is Daniels - in an achingly funny turn - who surprises, and in doing so effortlessly steals the movie from under the nose of the rubberfaced loon standing beside him. It may have something to do with the fact that Harry is (marginally) the more subtle of the two characters.<br /><br />
