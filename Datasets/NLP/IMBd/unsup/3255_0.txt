This is simply a masterpiece. It is the most seen Norwegian movie ever, seen by 5,5 million people in a country of only 4,5 million. It is considered to be the best Norwegian movie ever, and with reason. I've seen it around 20 times, and I can't get enough of it. It's one of very few movies out there which can appeal to a five-year old and an eighty-five-year old at the same time, on different levels.<br /><br />Caveat: it is doubtful, however, that one can truly appreciate the ingeniousness of this movie without being brought up in a traditional Norwegian way. This movie reflects in many ways Norwegian culture, and partly makes fun of it. If one doesn't know Norwegian culture by heart, this aspect is lost.
