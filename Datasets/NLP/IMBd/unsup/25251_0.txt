A fun little B-movie Zombie romp, about bank-robbers that pick the wrong night/town to rob a bank...as long as you keep in mind-it is what it is-it's enjoyable, especially if you are a fan of cheesy B-movies and/or horror...the acting is so-so(no Oscars will be handed out but I have seen much, much worse), the effects are OK(not on par with any of the Romero or big-budget horror movies...but I'm guessing they weren't working with a ton of money to begin with), and the plot/story is passable(in a movie like this logic pretty much goes out of the window and suspension of disbelief is the order of the day...or you can just laugh it up-you choose). There are quite a few hip-hop artists in the movie(Big Daddy Kane, BoneCrusher, E40...)if you are a fan of the genre;if not, there inclusion will be transparent to you.Shut off brain, eat popcorn, enjoy:)
