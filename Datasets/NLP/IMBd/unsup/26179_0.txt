This movie is a favorite of mine. I haven't seen it in years and would love to own it in my video collection but have not been able to find it anywhere :( I loved Geraldine Page and Ruth Gordon. What actresses they are! I especially loved the scene where Ruth Gordon's character is trying to call for help and catches the wrath of Geraldine Page's character!! It's been so long since I've seen it I can't even remember the names of the characters. The scenes showing the pine trees blowing in the wind are creeeeeeepy! Does anyone else love it as much as me?
