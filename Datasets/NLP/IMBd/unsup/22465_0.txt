Usually, I love this sort of film...but Wrong Way just doesn't cut it. The influence from Wes Craven's classic The Last House on the Left is clear and obvious throughout, but the film doesn't do anything new with it and overall is really rather boring. The Last House on the Left inspired a number of rape and revenge films; the majority of which hailed from Italy and are rather good if you're into this sort of stuff. That's what makes Wrong Way all the more disappointing; it's not a bad thing to rip off Craven's film, but when all you've got is a series of sex scenes, you know that it hasn't been done well. The plot is virtually non-existent, and simply focuses on a couple of girls that end up being raped and abused by a few bored hippies. The film is notorious for its rape scenes that go on seemingly forever, but it gets old fast. I have no problem with sex in movies, and in fact actively seek out this sort of dirty, grisly film...but there really is no reason to bother seeking out Wrong Way. It's currently unavailable in Britain, and that certainly isn't a bad thing.
