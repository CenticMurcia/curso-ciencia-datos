A gorgeously photographed and steamy tale of forbidden passion.<br /><br />Boasting a superb lead performance by Patrick DeWaere as a young Frenchman battling to stifle the seductive advances of his breathtakingly beautiful step-daughter, it is grounded by fascinating character detail and an intelligent, focused script that is deeply interested in the complexities of love and desire.<br /><br />Ariel Besse is the step-daughter and she is a bubbling, nubile cauldron of curiosity and mischief.<br /><br />Sacha Vierny's moody photography is worthy of a coffee table hardcover and Philip Sarde's score is perfection.<br /><br />A delicious, provocative, mature tale of sexual politics.
