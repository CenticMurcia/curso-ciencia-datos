How can people even like this crap. It wasn't completely horrible with humor only a 2 year old could laugh at. Didn't laugh once, instead, I spent most of the time shaking my head in disgust of the stupidity that this show is absorbed in. Don't get me wrong, I like my potty or dumb humor if you will. I like as much as the next moron (yes I am a moron) but there is a line to everything where it's just no longer funny and instead, completely moronic and a waste of time. This is one of the two shows that Adult Swim needs to cancel ASAP (the other being Superjail) Two horrible shows, and they canceled Harvey Birdman (one of the best shows ever) to make way for shows like this. Ugh. I wouldn't even wish this hell upon my worst enemies. I'd rather listen to Jonas Brothers than have to watch an episode of this ever again.
