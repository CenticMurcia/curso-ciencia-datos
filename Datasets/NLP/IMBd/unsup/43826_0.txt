Okay, Okay...Jean-Luc Godard and Woody Allen; two great names of cinema; two unique, idiosyncratic artists...this has promise. These two great minds could dissect for us deep insights into their films, or at least Woody's films...<br /><br />The problem is, they just don't, really.<br /><br />They don't talk about much. There are even a few moments of misunderstanding. The interpreter at times doesn't seem to explain Monsieur Godard's questions (ramblings) very well. There is a distinct sense of Woody Allen being vaguely bamboozled by it all.<br /><br />At one point, Godard brings up a point, posited somewhat eccentrically, about cultural overload stifling original creativity: Godard refers to it as "cultural radioactivity" disgorged upon us by TV. But because of the rambling nature of his question, the context regarding TV, and the bumblings of the interpreter, Woody misunderstands and takes it as literally referring to cathode tube radiation from the television set. It's all kind of embarrassing. And also unfortunate, because what would have been an interesting question is then quickly brushed over.<br /><br />Perhaps this was all Godard's intention. Perhaps he's saying something about communication. Perhaps that's why some of his inter-titles don't seem to make much sense. I don't know. What I DO know is, if you want to learn about Woody Allen and his films, this won't help very much.
