My daughter and I found this movie in a clearance bin for only $3.00 and thought, "Why not?". Now I'm thinking of asking for a refund. The acting was very poor. Scripting was third grade level and that's being generous. I've read comic books with better lines. What little plot existed could have been improved by my six year old nephew. They re-used scenes multiple times and used some cheap stock footage to fill in some time. I guess this is what you get when people without skills or talent try to make a movie. The fight scenes reminded me of very low-brow slap-stick humor. This was supposed to be an action adventure and turned out to be a bad comedy. I feel sorry for the actors and actresses. If this didn't kill their careers then nothing will. If you are thinking of buying or renting this movie give your cash to the homeless guy in front of the liquor store instead. The money will be better spent and chances are it's one of the actors.
