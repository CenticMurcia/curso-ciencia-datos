Oh my, how I really tried to like this movie. Very funny and sardonic lines here and there, good actors (well almost, but Tori Spelling actually does a good job here) and an interesting plot. But sadly, everything was in vain for me, because I just couldn't stand the pretentious tone of everything. I snickered a couple of times but more often I looked at the clock, expecting something to happen. Well it did, but not until the last quarter of the movie. I saw it, but was not amused!
