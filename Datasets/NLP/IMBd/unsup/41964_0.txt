*Really awful war movie! So why didn't I just turn it off when Van Johnston turned up as a British air marshall. I mean, John Wayne would have been much better. Some of the Dunquerque scenes are pretty good. And a lot of things --- and people --- get blown up. But it's a parade of cliche characters and predictable plot turns. Indeed it's such a bomb that if the Luftwaffe had had a few prints of it and had dropped them on London, they might have won the Battle of Britain. But I wouldn't wish that on the British people. I gave it a three and that only because I was in an exceptionally generous frame of mind.<br /><br />
