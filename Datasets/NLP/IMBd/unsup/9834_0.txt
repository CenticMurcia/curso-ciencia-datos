The only good thing I can say about this movie was I met a very beautiful lady waiting in line and was able to trash it over coffee. Shot in Ottawa, Canada, "Decoys" hits every bad cliche in the book and then pulls one of classic bad movie mistakes:<br /><br />It takes itself seriously.<br /><br />Now, had the film makers gone for 'camp' and spun it, Decoys could have been one of those films you kept on your self and pulled it out for a good chuckle once in a while (Army of Darkness, Arena, Robojox... You get the picture). Instead, the film tries to go for our fear points and give us the heebie jeebies. The only heebie jeebies I got from this was seeing that they have a sequal planned for next year.<br /><br />Bottom line: Set your money on fire or sit through Howard the Duck.<br /><br />Twice.
