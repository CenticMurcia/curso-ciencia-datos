This has to definitly be the worst horror film. Sometimes when i hear a bad review about a horror movie, I just blow it off because I like to experiene the movie myself, but this time I should have taken the advice. I rented this movie to see more than two gallons of blood, hence the title. What I got was a bunch of teenagers talking and eating food on a couch the most of the time. This is one of those fast-forward movies, where you have to fast forward to the good parts. In this case, it's the whole movie. Nothing happens until the last 10 minutes of the movie and even that ten minutes was boring. Trust me on this one. I'm surprised that any distributer would release this. Attack of the Killer Refrigerator is like 15 minutes long and still better than this one.
