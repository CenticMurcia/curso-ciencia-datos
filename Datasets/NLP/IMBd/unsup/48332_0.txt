So, we had Debra Messing and Dermont Mulroney a short while ago in a decent little romantic comedy called the wedding date, which was just above average content and humor wise, and brought up to decent by great acting by all the actors as well as the fantastic atmosphere set up by the film's location and- You must be wondering why I'm giving the review of a Hollywood movie in a bollywood forum.<br /><br />It's simple. Aap Ki Khattir is an EXACT copy of the Wedding date. The honest truth? The movie is terrible. I cannot believe that this is the same director who made Raja Hindustani. The atmosphere, the scene direction is mediocre and deplorable and the dialogue (FIRE that script writer Immediately) is even worse! When you have Lillette Dubey, Akshaye Khanna and Anupam Kher in a movie, you expect quality acting, and that you do get. But only from the three aforementioned actors. Amisha Patel needs to quit the movies. Priyanka Chopra and Suniel Shetty SERIOUSLY overact their respective roles.<br /><br />All in all, a complete flop. Please don't kill your intellect watching this sad mess of a movie.
