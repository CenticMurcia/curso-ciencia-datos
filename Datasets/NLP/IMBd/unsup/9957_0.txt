That Certain Summer is way ahead of it's time for the year 1972.I did not see the movie when it originally aired in 1972. I had not even heard of the movie until I received this movie on VHS tape from a collector.I watched it a couple of nights ago, and I was amazed at the subject matter for the year 1972.First off, the cast was excellent. Hal Holbrook, Hope Lange, Martin Sheen, and Scott Jacoby were just right for their roles.The scenery and setting of San Francisco added to the film's atmosphere.What I like best about the movie is the way that the story ended. The ending did not produce any certain answers for the family involved.The viewer can decide whether the family will make it through the heartache and hurt that all of them are experiencing.This movie was very well done,and is very tender and touching.I recommend this movie very much.I have this movie.
