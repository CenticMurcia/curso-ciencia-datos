I didn't get a chance to watch the whole thing, as I had missed the beginning when it was being shown on SBS. However, the parts that I did see, I was quite impressed with.<br /><br />The most striking aspect, was that it seemed like a poem which had been adapted to the screen. I got this impression from the strongly rhythmic nature of the dialog. Also, the dialog did not exactly match the scenario - it was more of an expression of feelings, and of unravelling a story. The scenes of the wedding party looking for the bride seemed incidental to the dialog, and was more of a device to indicate the passing of time and to give more of an urgency for the dialog to unravel.<br /><br />I found it very intriguing and couldn't stop watching. And it was not just because it was an "EROTIC TALE"!
