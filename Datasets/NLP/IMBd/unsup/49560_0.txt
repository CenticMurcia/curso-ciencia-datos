I thought this was a bad movie, and its box office totals certainly reflect that. This film wants us to believe that a doctor in a psych ward drugs his patients and then straps a weird jacket on them and puts them in a morgue drawer for a while. And all this allows the patient to time travel in his mind and apparently in reality. The doctor had no idea this would happen? Also, the film never told what type of results the doctor was expecting by putting a patient in a morgue drawer.<br /><br />While in the drawer, it shows many close ups of Jack's eyes, then starts showing flashes of images. And then some how Jack winds up about 15 years in the future. During his first trip, he meets a girl, Jackie, who he remembers from his past. She doesn't know him. But, she picks up this stranger and lets him stay at her place? Not believable. And then later she sleeps with him?<br /><br />Jack gets Jackie to help him investigate his death from 15 years earlier. He thinks it was foul play. Then there is a side plot of him helping one of the other doctors discover what is wrong with a sick child. Why was that part even in there? It just added to the confusion of the film.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: I like films that have a story that makes sense and not so confusing. So, I don't care for this one and don't recommend it.
