<br /><br />My Age: 14<br /><br /> Hah, I bet you thought just becuase I am a teenager, doesn't mean this movie is pathetic. Well, to say I loved "Out of Africa", and I have been around the block. COLUMBIA pictures has been complaining about bad business. This is why. I swear they were on drugs when they thought a rip-off of Sydney Pollack's Out of Africa was going to profit, with a budget of $34 million. Woah! I watched some of this when going to see another movie, while waiting. I was sorry. I find the lobby much more interesting than this trash. If Kim Basinger could win an Oscar(L.A. Confidential was an exception), so could Jennifer Love Hewitt and I can't stand either of them. That's all folks!
