I've not read any of the books so this review is based purely on watching Sharpe's Challenge on TV.<br /><br />As far as TV fare goes I'd rate this as a middle rung production, the battle scenes are nicely done and attention to detail in costuming is above average, for example it's good to see soldiers and officers who are not pristine and clean. Locations are stunning and the actors put in good performances overall, I can't think of a dud performance in Sharpe's Challenge.<br /><br />On the down side the plot is pretty thin and reads like a typical boys own adventure book, lots of daring-do with the usual damsel in distress type scenario. It's definitely not brain fodder but is better than most of the dross on TV at present.
