Ok...Ok....this movie don't be compared with the great series of 60's and 70's (one the best series based in super-heroes), but it was could better...the plot is confused, in 20 minutes the movie wins a new protagonist...the Daredevil, a Black Daredevil??? where's the red uniform??? Really...nothing in this don't make justice to the original series...nor the presence of Stan Lee in cast.
