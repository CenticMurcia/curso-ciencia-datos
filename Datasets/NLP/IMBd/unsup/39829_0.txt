I'll keep it short and sweet, as many have already made accurate criticism of this film, and in general I agree.<br /><br />The film is a travesty, portraying Cromwell, inaccurately, as a 2-dimensional bully. This is compounded by terrible acting (as usual) by Tim Roth. The man just can not act! Here he spurts out each line like a child in a school play, relieved that he has managed to get yet another memorised line out of the way.<br /><br />Rupert Everett as Charles 1 was unconvincing, playing the part as a brute with no class. Charles was a Scot but there was not even the faintest hint of a Scottish accent here, and only the clumsiest inclusion of badly performed stutters. He had clearly not done his homework. I guess Alec Guinness set a standard for this part (in 'Cromwell') which may be impossible to surpass. But the difference is that Guinness was a good actor.<br /><br />Dougray Scott played Fairfax better, but it just got tiresome.<br /><br />As for the script, it was dire and lazy. Easy money. Don't expect any history lessons.<br /><br />I walked away from it half way through. Life's too short to waste it on this junk.<br /><br />This film demonstrates two things: Tim Roth can't act and Mike Barker (Director) can't direct. Just goes to show, it's down to who you know, not what you can do.
