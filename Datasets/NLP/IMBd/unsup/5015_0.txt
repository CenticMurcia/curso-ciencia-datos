My cousin and I watch this movie all the time! I even recorded it so we could watch it when its not on TV! We think it is so cute and makes you smile! This movie will really cheer you up and takes the side of the girls labeled "uncool" or awkward. The fact that Brian A. Green is totally gorgeous helps, too! he-he. The characters are people you can relate to yourself as you were growing up. The main character Mel goes through complete humiliation, but keeps on going! And her best friend Gabby along the way is totally awesome! This movie also shows that the truth is always better and friendship is really important! I just am in love with this movie! Very adorable!
