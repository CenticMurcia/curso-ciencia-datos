Best film this year. Indian Cinema at its best.If its said a "lost film by David Lean"-It deserves it. Vidhu Vinod Chopra-Two Thumbs up-This man is our hope.<br /><br />No words to describe this film. A modern day masterpiece. Vidhu Vinod Chopra's best. Breathtaking performances from Big B, Saif, Boman, Jackie, Sanjay, Vidya etc. Superb music and score and wonderful cinematography and locales not to forget the awe inspiring visual effects. In the years to come will be remembered as a CLASSIC. This is a poem on celluloid. Shakespeare nestling in the sands of Rajathan. This piece of work would have made Shakespeare smile broadly<br /><br />A must watch for Cinema Lovers. EKlavya-a Royal TREAT!
