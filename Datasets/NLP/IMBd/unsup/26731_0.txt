I was an avid watcher of the television show Popular since its debut and followed it until the end. It was grossly unappreciated and not given the time on the air it deserved. Not only was it ahead of its time (the antics of Mary Cherry are some of the funniest scenes I have ever seen on television), but it was a true homage to teen life in the late nineties. It tackled every issue on any teen's mind: sex, popularity (or lack thereof), alcoholism, step-siblings, eating disorders, racism, adoption, poverty, pregnancy, cheating, etc. and accomplished it with comedy and heart. AMAZING SHOW. I suggest anyone who comes across the DVD set to purchase it immediately.
