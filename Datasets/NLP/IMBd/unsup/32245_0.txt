Note to Stephen Cannell: please, just stop. Even when you were at the top of your game, doing things like 21 Jump Street, no one would have called you a genius. And now, you've slipped down the ladder, Stephen. If this is the best thing you can come up with, I would suggest a career change.<br /><br />This movie is all about an aging Hollywood Screenwriter and his daughter. It features all the typical stereotypes, a Director who is sleeping with a Bimbo Starlet, the Kid From the Wrong Side of Town who wants to date the Screenwriter's daughter. It's like a really bad combination of "Pretty in Pink" and "The Player", trying to be a horror movie.<br /><br />The concept and the writing are just plain dead. It makes you wonder, when Stephen Cannell came up with the title "Dead Above Ground", was he describing himself?
