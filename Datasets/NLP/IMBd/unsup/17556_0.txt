MU ZAN E is an extremely rough Japanese gore/sexual violence film by anyone's standards. Anyone who doesn't find some of the scenes in this film disgusting is inhuman. That being said, since that is exactly what I was looking for - I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />I will give a brief synopsis, and this is what I gathered, since my copy has no English subtitles or dubs: A reporter is doing some research on underground sex films. She does interviews with various people in the "industry" and goes on-set during the filming of a production. During her research, she comes across some snuff material. Apparently she begins researching that type of stuff too, and when she gets too close, certain people aren't happy with her prying and decide to take action against her...<br /><br />Honestly, this film is NASTY,NASTY,NASTY. I can't think of anyone who truly enjoys this type of material as entertainment. My main interest in seeking this film is that I'm always looking for the most "shocking" films available. Let me tell ya, this is one of 'em. Not only that, but the story (what I could make of it) seemed pretty interesting (and far superior and more straight-forward than Yamnouchi's other offerings...), and I hope that Unearthed Films will release an English subtitled version. As far as I know, they hold the rights here in the U.S. but have no ETA as to when it will be released. I give this film a pretty high rating because it does exactly what it's intention is to do - repel, repulse and sicken - but again, the story is pretty decent too, and even has an unexpected twist, which doesn't always happen in this new realm of Asian "super extreme" gore films. Recommended only for you truly sick f!cks out there!!! 8.5/10
