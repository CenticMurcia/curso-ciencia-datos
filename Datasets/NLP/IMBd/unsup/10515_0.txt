The great Oliver Stone has done it again! Savior is one of the most horrifying, yet wonderfully made movie I have ever seen! With it's realism it captures you in a world of war with a feeling that you are really standing right in the middle of it. In my opinion this movies is a "must see", but it is not a movie for a date, a romantic moment or the family get-together. It is a movie that will bring you moments of extreme horror, sadness and tears with a realism that is rarely seen in movies today, and it is a movie that will leave you with open eyes and your head spinning.
