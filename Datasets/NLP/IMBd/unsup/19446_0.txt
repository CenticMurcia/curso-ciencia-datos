I'll keep this short. <br /><br />Most of what others have said is true. This is a very well done anime. It has an exremely emotional and graphic story. It is as sad or emotional as "Grave of the fireflies" and as bloody as "Berserk" (I would say its worse). <br /><br />Although it is fantasy because of the special powers the girls have you should not think it would diminish it. It is about not knowing who or what is good and bad, about tragedy and loss, it is about forgiveness. <br /><br />Just be ready for this is not for the weak of heart. <br /><br />I would definitely recommend this anime, its one of the best made anime I have ever seen.
