I saw the advanced screening of the movie last night in Hollywood. My friends and I went expecting something decent, but our expectations are never high with thriller/ suspense films. The movie started out strong; immediately you could get a sense of what it would be about, and how entertaining it would be. Throughout the movie, there were very little moments where you weren't in suspense. There were perfect moments in the film where you feel like, it could end right now, and you wouldn't feel cheated at all. The movie was well-written, no confusing plot, no unnecessary scenes, good comedic moments. It does a perfect job of making you slightly nervous and anxious at the same time. This isn't a horror flick, but I'd say it gave e more of a fright then a lot of horror movies. ( P.S. I'm not saying it's scary, I my point to be made was I was more nervous in his movie than in movies like 'Dead Silence' that were actually supposed to scare me ) I gave this a 9 out of 10 because it was entertaining; point blank. I'd recommend going to see this!!!
