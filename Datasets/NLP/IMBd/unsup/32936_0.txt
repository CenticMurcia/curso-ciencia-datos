I am not only a resident of L.A., but I also work in the music and film business, and I rented this movie to see some of the Australian landscape and the story sounded interesting.<br /><br />I have to say... it's on my list of movies that tried very hard to be something great and failed miserably.<br /><br />First of all, sure some of the scenic shots are nice, but if that was all I wanted, I'd turn on the Discovery Channel. The storyline and plot were weak, the characters were boring, and I didn't believe in their relationship for more than a few minutes.<br /><br />Furthermore, and WORST of all, I was very confused how he died simply diving into a body of water, and was really irritated that they didn't explain that in the movie. It was only after I did some research on-line and read other reviews, that someone said it's dangerous to dive head first into a "billabong." Okay, like I even knew what a "billabong" was, and I'm a former Mensa candidate.<br /><br />So... poor writing.<br /><br />The acting was very good, I'll give you that, but even great acting couldn't have saved this movie. As the old saying goes... it's a couple hours of my life I won't get back. ;-)
