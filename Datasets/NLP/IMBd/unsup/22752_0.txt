Let me preface this review by writing that I enjoyed Sanjay Leela Bhansali's "Black" so much, I have looked forward to "Saawariya" for months, with the highest of expectations. And once more, I was not disappointed. Mr. Bhansali tells Dostoevsky short story "The White Nights" as a fluid, brilliantly colored and magical fairy tale. Ever since I was turned on to Mr. Bhansali's work with "Black" - and later watched"Devdas" - I have thought of him as the modern day, Hindi film industry's answer to Luchino Visconti. So it wasn't a complete surprise to learn that Visconti made a film titled "Le Notti Bianche" which was also based on the same short story. Both directors possess a unique touch with color, texture and cinematic air quality that is truly able to transport the viewer into their story, completely and delightedly. Ranbir Kapoor and Sonam Kapoor are perfectly cast as the misguided lovers and Salman Khan is finally playing a character who seems to read deep into his soul and bring out the sultry quality that he so naturally possesses. "Saawariya" is not so much a Bollywood film meant to tug at your heart strings and leave you pining for your own unrequited love, but more a mood piece which will leave you wishing you could live in the imaginary world of pure, kind street walkers, beautiful all-white Eid nights and women's clothes that put French couturiers to shame. It is, as cinema is meant to be at its very root, a world of complete and utter escapism.
