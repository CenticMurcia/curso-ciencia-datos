I remember seeing this movie on the shelves at my local video store 15 years ago. I never watched it until now (May 09) and I wish I had just not watched it at all.<br /><br />The story is unimaginative and unremarkable. Completely cut and dry. I would have rather brought this news clipping up on one of those old timey news paper viewers and used my own imagination to fill in the gaps.<br /><br />Juliette Lewis overdid the angry teen and was mostly annoying. Brad Pitt did the best he could with the material he was given but considering how limited he was by the role, he performed it well.<br /><br />It was made for TV on a Sunday afternoon when everyone was out and they needed some crap to fill the gaps between paid programming, and it should have stayed that way.
