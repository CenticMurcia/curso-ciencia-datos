I thought this movie was just fantastic.<br /><br />the first time i saw it, i thought it was awesome. But when i watched it for the second time i thought it was Fabulous. Its probably my favourite movie now.<br /><br />It took me a while to realise but i think this movie is better then the first one.<br /><br />Ashley Tisdale is Highschool Musical she was so so so so good in this movie. Every scene she was in i was glued to the TV, she did such a good job as sharpay and she looked so beautiful in this movie, in the first one her hair was really thick and that what ruined her style but in this movie her hair was so pretty she just looked hot in every scene she was in.<br /><br />Vanessa Hudgens really did a good job. I didn't like her in the first movie but i thought in this movie her character wasn't so childish.<br /><br />To bad Chad and Taylor weren't in it more. I love Taylor i think she is funny but they didn't use her much in this film. Chad should of had a way bigger part too.<br /><br />The songs in this movie were really good. Fabulous is just a really fun feel good song. Work this out was a really good song with a really good beat. Music in me was a really pretty relaxing song. I don't dance was an okay song but i wasn't really that much into it. Music in me Sharpay version was so so so hot and it was so sharpay which i thought was fantastic. gotta go my own way was a beautiful song sung really well and acted really well during it. Bet on it was a really good song to, good beat and good lyrics. Everyday was just a really sweet, cute, fun song and all for one was pretty good not as good as were all in this together but good enough to get my attention.<br /><br />The concept for this movie was really smart and really enjoyable. It was a fabulous lead up to the first highly successful first movie.<br /><br />I highly anticipated this movie and i was so pleased that it was as good as hyped.<br /><br />I am so excited for the third movie. I hope they do as good a job as they did for this one and the first one, im sure they will.<br /><br />Brilliant.
