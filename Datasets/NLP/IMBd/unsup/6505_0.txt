I enjoyed every aspect of 61* from the wonderful character studies and contrasts to the game recreations to how well old Tiger Stadium was made to pinch hit for Yankee Stadium. I didn't know this ahead but it was done so credibly that when the end credits said Yankee Stadium had been played by Tiger Stadium I thought "What? How'd they ever manage that?" The "Making of" explained--it's almost as much a must-see as the film itself.<br /><br />It took a huge fan like Billy Crystal to make this film and I'm very glad he did. Barry Pepper as Maris and Thomas Jane as Mantle both did great work and even bore close resemblances.<br /><br />If you like baseball you'll love this film, and the "Making Of" DVD feature later.
