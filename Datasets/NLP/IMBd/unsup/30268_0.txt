I would recommend this movie to everyone to see. As a future history teacher I plan on incorporating this movie into my classes. I have studied the women's movement, and I have found the movie accurate and well told. It clearly depicts the hardships that women went through. It is a good reminder that their work isn't done. It is a good reminder that we must not rest on our laurels, but continue to stand up and fight for what we believe in. This movie had me going through so many different emotions, which is a rare quality of today's movies.<br /><br />As for the soundtrack, I thought it was appropriate for the movie. It helped bring even more emotion to the already eye-opening movie. It was a good choice of music.<br /><br />Congrats to all the actors and director for making such a wonderful movie. I wish it was longer, but they did an excellent job of showing the important events in such a constrained amount of time. We need more movies like this one!!
