"Home Alone 2: Lost In New York" is a sequel to the classic "Home Alone". A very nice sequel, let's face it! If the first one is hilarious, this one is hysterical! I consider this superior to the original. Both are great holiday films.<br /><br />The basic plot is similar to the first one's, but it's not a carbon copy. There are many things that make this a different film and a more rich and complete one. It's a movie with more heart either, with touching scenes such as Kevin and a kid in the hospital waving at each other.<br /><br />The first one basically takes place in Kevin's house and that zone. This time Kevin is not forgotten at home. Instead of Paris, this time his family is going to Florida and they nearly take Kevin... but he's accidentally left at the airport. Kevin sees a guy who wears a suit equal to his father's and confuses him with his father. He enters in the wrong plane and goes to New York City! Like in the original film, Kevin wishes to be lonely after another fight with Buzz. This time the fight is not about a pizza, but because Buzz humiliates Kevin in public when it's his solo singing of the song "My Christmas Tree", making many laugh. Of course that Uncle Frank, who has no respect for Kevin at all, laughs out loud with this.<br /><br />How come Buzz and Uncle Frank always seem to get away with everything I don't know... but at least this time Kevin gives a deserved punishment to Buzz. Besides, Buzz isn't even being sincere when he apologizes. In fact, he whispers «Beat that, you little trout sniffer». When Kevin says to his Uncle Frank «Oh, wouldn't wanna spoil your fun, Mr. Cheapskate!», it's a well deserved reply as well. Indeed, Uncle Frank is a cheapskate, besides being a jerk.<br /><br />The booby traps are more violent comparing to the first movie, but somehow they're more hilarious, although sometimes they overdo it. The "wet bandits" are no longer nicknamed like that. Now Marv nicknames them as the "sticky bandits" after stealing some money from a Santa Claus.<br /><br />The Plaza Hotel is beautiful, with stunning architecture and decoration, not to mention that it's an extremely luxurious, refined hotel.<br /><br />Cedric is a likable chap, but the Concierge not so much because he dislikes Kevin from the very first moment, although this guy is hilarious at times. Lots of hilarious moments happen in the hotel, mostly with the Concierge and Cedric. One of my favorite parts is when Kevin fools the Corcierge with that cool song "Cool Jerk" - that is hysterical! And what to say about when Kevin fools and scares the hell out of all those hotel's professionals with a gangster's movie named "Angels with Even Filthier Souls"? That is incredibly funny!<br /><br />The most hysterical part is when Kevin is about to throw a 4th brick and Marv is trying to warn Harry with a strange and almost cartoonish tone of voice, so much that it's impossible to understand what is he saying.<br /><br />Harry swears the same phrase from the original film - 'ratcha fatcha freckin' fracha' or something like that. But this time he swears that over and over. I wonder how many times he swears that. To this day, I still wonder what is he saying. Maybe it's almost as if he's saying the 'F' word?<br /><br />Duncan's Toy Chest is the most beautiful and wonderful toys's store I've ever seen in my whole life. It is absolutely amazing! It is huge and full of everything when it comes to Christmas decorations. It's almost like a world of fantasy or something from another world. Christmas decorations are also very present in this movie, as well as lovely Christmas carols and good messages about Christmas, allowing us to feel the Christmas magic and spirit.<br /><br />As for the soundtrack, there are plenty of nice Christmas songs, such as "All Alone on Christmas", "It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas", "My Christmas Tree", "Christmas Star" and "Jingle Bell Rock" (too bad it's not on Brenda Lee's version). Not a Christmas song, but "Cool Jerk" is awesome.<br /><br />Once again, Macaulay Culkin, Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern steal the show in their roles. Eddie Bracken is also great as the kind hearted Mr. Duncan. Macaulay Culkin is even more cute in this film and he has a beautiful smile. Plus, he could be a singer too, he had a beautiful voice to sing and sings beautifully in this film.<br /><br />That sequence with Kevin at the top of the World Trade Center is spectacular and nostalgic, but also painful and depressing to look now because it brings back memories of the tragic date 11th September 2001. Who could possibly imagine back in 1992 that, some years later, such horrible thing would happen?<br /><br />This movie always gave me the urge of spending a Christmas in New York City. It makes Christmas seem so beautiful in that city.<br /><br />This should definitely be on Top 250.
