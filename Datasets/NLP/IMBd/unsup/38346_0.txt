Bad acting, Bad accents, Bad dialogue. Terrible music the score is suppose to accompany the film but the bar brawl 80s electric guitar grates against you're very soul. I turned it of when the SS officer in full uniform runs through a British platoon to get to a truck and gets away with it just after he says to his side kick we will use the artillery as cover, because artillery good for that. Stupid film that try's to by putting in real footage in the hope of paying homage but the hole film seems to be taking the Mickey out of it. It's such a shame because with today's special effects they could make a great WW2 film as special after Band of Brothers think of all the different places the battles took place.
