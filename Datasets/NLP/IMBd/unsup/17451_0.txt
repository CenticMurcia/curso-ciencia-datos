Dean finally tells Sam the last words of John Winchester before dying, and opens his heart about his dilemma and feelings. Sam leaves Dean during the night and travels alone seeking answers with Ellen and Ash in the Harvelle's Bar. When he finds that another psychic was stabbed in a parking lot in Illinois, he decides to investigate his death. Meanwhile, in Peoria, the young woman Ava Wilson has a premonition with the death of Sam and meets him in the motel of her dream where Sam is lodged. Meanwhile Ellen tells Dean where his brother is, while Sam is hunted by Gordon.<br /><br />In this excellent episode, it is disclosed what John told to Dean about Sam and his dilemma and feelings; further, it seems that a demon war is coming and Sam and other psychics will fight on the demon side. Ava Wilson is introduced and I hope to have the chance to see this character again. The despicable Gordon returns but is duly framed by Sam. My vote is nine.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Ca√ßado" ("Hunted")
