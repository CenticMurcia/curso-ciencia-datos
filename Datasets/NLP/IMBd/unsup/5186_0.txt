It's Low Budget, Amateurish, and Simple. When I came across the DVD on Amazon I was only interested in buying it, because it had National Lampoons plastered over the front cover. When it arrived and I watched it for the first time I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />It's the story of Adam and Eve, but not the story we are familiar with. In National Lampoons version of Adam and Eve Adam falls for Eve a beautiful college student who happens to be a Virgin. At first the virginity thing doesn't pose a problem, but during their nine month relationship and Eve's reluctance to lose her virginity Adam's frustration causes him to question leaving the relationship and the woman he truly loves.<br /><br />This is a teen movie so there is obviously profanity, fart jokes, and alcohol filled parties with half naked girls, but blended in with a beautiful story of Love and Friendship.<br /><br />The beautiful Emmanuelle Chriqui was of course fabulous in the film. I wish I could say the same for Cameron Douglas. I could sense he was uncomfortable in certain scenes, which made him appear like a poor actor, which in all honesty he isn't just a newcomer. Maybe a little more rehearsals and he would have done the part justice.<br /><br />I'd recommended this to all National Lampoon fans and possibly anybody who likes a beautiful love story with some fart jokes in the mix. This is a great first date movie or for any guy still trying to get his girl into bed.<br /><br />7 out of 10 stars.
