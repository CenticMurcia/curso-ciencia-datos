Beautiful model in New York has to decide between two marriage-minded suitors--unfortunately, the one she decides on turns out to be a jealous psychotic, turning her back into the arms of the first boyfriend. They marry and move to California, but the jilted, delusional maniac is close on their trail. TV-made stalker-drama from producer Aaron Spelling was ahead of its time in terms of subject matter, however the story is creepy and pointless. Lesley Warren works herself into a real tizzy worrying that new hubby Ryan O'Neal won't be able to protect them from crazy Peter Haskell, though apparently Ryan has been working out at the gym behind her back (resulting in an evening street brawl which fails to raise any concern from the neighbors). The finale is directed for melodramatic chills, rendering the potentially gripping plot dynamics mute. One can easily see why up-and-coming star O'Neal signed on for this movie: he gets to be the sensitive good guy while also protecting his helpless wife from the scary villain. His performance isn't bad--and Haskell is careful not to overdo the wild-eyed bit--yet the picture takes mere surface-swipes at its own possibilities. It was designed to be a paranoia thriller for housewives, and as such is a callow, forgettable enterprise.
