My favorite Patrick Warburton character is The Tick. I went to a screening of The Civilization of Maxwell Bright at the Scottsdale Film Festival last night because it looked intriguing, but really, it was because Patrick was presenting the film and doing a Q+A after, and I didn't want to miss anything he might say about The Tick. <br /><br />And then The Civilization of Maxwell Bright ended up being the best film I've seen all year. A great story, direction, acting, cinematography - it was wonderful. Patrick Warburton was absolutely riveting. I can't think of anyone else who could present such a despicable character - an extreme misogynist, and yet keep the audience laughing even during his hateful diatribes against women. His vulnerability underneath all the bluster and anger kept you interested in what would happen instead of just dismissing him and wishing him a horrible fate. <br /><br />I don't want to reveal anything about the story, but if you think you 'know' Patrick Warburton and love him from Seinfeld or the Tick, you will be pleased and maybe surprised to find that he has this depth of talent. And the film has such an emotional impact that one audience member said it made him feel better about death. It was a life -affirming film in the best, non-Lifetime network way.<br /><br />And he DID talk about The Tick! I was very happy.
