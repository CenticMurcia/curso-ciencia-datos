This film is so good that while I'm watching it, I forget that Cloris Leachman was ever Frau Blucher! Mare Winningham is outstanding in this film. What Frosty the Snowman did to me as a child, this movie does to me as an adult; I cry every time I see it. This movie and To Dance with the White Dog are probably the best ever made by Hallmark. If you're looking for something with a lighter tone, I suggest Hallmark's What the Deaf Man Heard. It's of the same caliber, but not nearly as sad.
