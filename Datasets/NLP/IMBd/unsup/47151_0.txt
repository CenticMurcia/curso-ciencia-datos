I'd always been interested in checking out this title  even if it always promised to be a goofy and highly improbable variation on the Dracula legend. The opening crypt sequence features any number of hilariously named members of the infamous vampire familyand, then, Zoltan itself (oversized fangs and all) emerges from inside a coffin!<br /><br />The plot is quite simple-minded: Dracula's dog (actually, this film's original title) revives sinister-looking but mute vampire acolyte Reggie Nalder so that they can go to America in search of their new master  but the latter is actually determined to (pardon the pun) bury his past and, wisely, has changed his surname to Drake! An Inspector from the old country, Jose' Ferrer, follows in pursuit  but even he has a tough time persuading current vampire descendant Michael Pataki (his statement that he ought to sue the makers of previous Dracula movies is amusing, but would have undoubtedly worked better had this particular entry been somewhat better!) of the danger to his life and soul. That said, a lot of weird crap has been happening during the Drake family's would-be relaxing camping trip  mostly revolving around the two Alsation dogs they brought along and their cute puppies! <br /><br />It's rather amusing to see a plethora of canines getting vampirized as opposed to people  so much so that, at times, it feels like one's watching an antropomorphic rendition of the Bram Stoker chestnut! Adding to the inescapable feeling of absurdity here is a cheesy score; the twist ending, then, is entirely predictable but also incredibly daft. Besides, the numerous close-ups on Nalder's scarred features for ostensibly eerie effect seem merely pointlessly morbid to me! Ultimately, the film is redeemed somewhat by a couple of intense attacks by the pack of vampire hounds towards the end  one with Pataki and Ferrer inside a cabin and the other on the former's car (in which he's sheltered)  as, otherwise, I'd have rated this even lower!
