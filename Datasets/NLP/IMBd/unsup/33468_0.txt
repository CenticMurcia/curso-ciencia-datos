Imagine back to when you were 11 years old. Now imagine if you were given a $200 camcorder, permission to film in your parent's garage and on their front lawn, the incredible special effects of a kaleidoscope, and a few 'actresses' taken straight off the 'Girls Gone Wild: Too Ugly to Air' video. It's feasible that the end result could be better than this horrible waste of VHS tapes and DVD discs. <br /><br />Let me precede this by stating that I usually enjoy bad movies. Low budget, horribly written films often entertain me albeit if only by unintentional comedic value. That said, Cheerleader Ninjas is a movie that's not only terrible, it's also not the least bit entertaining or humorous. Not only did I not laugh once, but a good portion of the film was spent of me asking, 'What the hell is going on?' To say there were plot holes would be inferring that there was a plot, and it's obvious there isn't one.<br /><br />I acknowledge that the movie wasn't meant to be taken serious, but it couldn't even pull that off right. Not one second of this 96 minute torture device was funny, and the 'writers' seemed to know it (you have to use the term 'writer' loosely here, for it insinuates that the movie was written before filmed). To get a minimal amount of the audience to sit through it, they wrote in pointless fantasy scenes in which a random girl takes her top off for whatever reason. Not to mention Kangaroo Jack has been beaten for the number of fart jokes within a movie, for Cheerleader Ninjas has one in *EVERY SINGLE SCENE*.<br /><br />In conclusion, do not see this movie. Yes it's a bad movie, yes it's a horrific atrocity of a movie, but not the good way. Most bad movies are so bad they in fact become entertaining, but this one failed even in that way. Instead it relies on fart jokes, boobs, and an inane storyline about the internet or something. The hour and a half spent watching Cheerleader Ninjas could better be spent in a number of more enjoyable ways: sleeping, staring into the sun, playing Russian roulette, etcÂ… Do. Not. See. This. Movie.
