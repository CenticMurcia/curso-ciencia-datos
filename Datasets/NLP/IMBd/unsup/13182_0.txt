Saw this movie in November 2008 for the first time. Makes my eyes water and makes me feel good, real good every time. Contrary to what some folks claim, I didn't know what was going to happen from one moment to the next and there is surprise and suspense throughout. Loved the music and the dialogue. <br /><br />This movie doesn't rely on foul language, sex, violence or props like constantly ringing telephones. It's just a decent, well made, beautiful movie that reaches for goodness and delivers. <br /><br />When I'm sad or down I watch Dreamer because it never fails to make me feel good. But if you're out of touch with your feelings, hard hearted or cynical, you'll be disappointed. Thank you John Gatins for winning the "Triple Crown" with "Dreamer", my new favorite film.<br /><br />"Rags to Riches" the first filly in 100 years to win the "Belmont Stakes" in 2007 is pregnant by "Giants Causeway" the real life colt of "Mariah's Storm" the horse who is the inspiration for "Dreamer".
