I was four years old in 1977 and I saw "Star Wars" in the theater. Let me be very clear: I'm a huge SW fan, but that doesn't mean that I see the prequel trilogy as a great experience in movie-making. I do, however, believe that "Clone Wars" is simply excellent. The animation style, the pacing, the story. It's all there.<br /><br />My jaw dropped when Anakin and Ventress fought on Yavin IV for the very simple fact that they were fighting in a thunderstorm. No one has ever visualized the simplicity of a lightsaber battle where raindrops are hitting the blades and sizzling as soon as they make contact. That one idea shows to me that the animators are looking for something beyond the typical SW experience, and they found it.<br /><br />Yes, you do have to get used to the visuals, as they do look like "Samurai Jack" (but, being a "Samurai Jack" fan, I think that's a good thing). And, if you watched them as they originally aired, you had to watch them in five minute increments for Volume One and 20 minute increments for Volume Two, which could throw you off in terms of the pacing (though, again, I thought they did it very, very well and that the way the chapters aired made perfect sense).<br /><br />In the end, there is a 120+ minute SW movie (basically Episode II and 1/2) between the two volumes of the DVDs. It shows Anakin and Padme's romance in ways that Lucas couldn't get across, it allows us to see Anakin become a Jedi Knight, and it gives some great insight into not only the prequel trilogy but also the classic one.<br /><br />If you even have the slightest interest in SW, these two DVDs are time and money well spent.
