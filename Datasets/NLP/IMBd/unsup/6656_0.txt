A refreshing piece for Mexican filmaking, that's how I'd described this movie. <br /><br />Nowadays, Mexican films try to imitate Hollywood patterns with unfortunate results. Therefore is surprising and exciting to watch a film that walks away from all commercial stereotypes and proposes a new way for filmaking. <br /><br />Though I liked "Jap√≥n" better (Reygadas first feature)this film is in many ways different to his past movie. This one is set in the city and an important part of it is the chaos; this one has more dialogs but less narrative structure. In fact Reygadas is not trying to tell us a story at all. His films are more of a contemplative nature rather than a story with climax and an established ending. <br /><br />Highly influenced by Abbas Kiarostami, Reygadas characters are not played by professional actors, they're played by common people that had nothing to do with the entertainment industry. And unfortunately, here, the results aren't that good as they were on his past film.<br /><br />So, you've probably heard about the explicit sexual content. This, I think, is Reygadas biggest contribution: Never before a Mexican film has gone this far on the sex issue. He demonstrates that sex scenes are not supposed to be provocative, erotic or stimulating at all; they can be grotesque and raw because the important thing is that they look real and are not idealized.<br /><br />However I think the movie has a few weak points: the acting is terrible ( it looks like that was made on purpose), the sound design is horrible and it looks like Reygadas takes 100 min to tell you nothing; but oh! what a beautiful way of telling nothing.
