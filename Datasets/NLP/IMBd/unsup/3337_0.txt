Story of a bunch of US tunnel rats in Viet Nam over the course of a couple of days is a really good, really solid action film. The plot has a bunch of replacement guys arriving at their new station in the jungle. The film follows them as they interact with the men already there and it then follows them as they go out on a mission, which unfortunately coincides with an enemy attack. Tight dark and claustrophobic this is a film that really knows how to ratchet up the suspense. You watch the film because, like the men in the tunnel you don't know what is coming next. People die horribly in traps and fierce fighting. You wonder if anyone will get out of the situations they are put in alive. <br /><br />I really liked this film a great deal and can not understand how the director, the infamous Uwe Boll, can't make more like it. Whether Boll had directed it or not this is a very good film. I almost wish that Boll had used a different name when he made it since I doubt the film will ever get the attention it deserves because of who he is. One of the genuine surprise of the year film wise, this is a wonderful little film thats light years better than many other recent low budget war films. If you like war films I highly recommend it.
