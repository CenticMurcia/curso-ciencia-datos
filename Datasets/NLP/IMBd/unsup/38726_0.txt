I would have given this movie a much lower rating; but, the fact is, I sat through the whole thing and was never terribly annoyed with it. However, the film came very close to crossing that line.<br /><br />The movie faithfully follows the animation and comedy style of the shorts it is based on, which can be found free for the taking all over the Web. I think those shorts have a huge advantage over this movie: they are short.<br /><br />The problem is not that the quality of the humor in this movie ever dips lower than that of the shorts, it's that the jokes are endless, and you get tired of grunting out a half-hearted laugh after a while.<br /><br />The plot, and I use that word loosely, is about Queer Duck questioning being gay. Is this all there is to life: endless parties, drugs, and sex? We know that Queer Duck parties and likely uses drugs, but we also get the impression he is in a committed relationship with Openly Gator. For the sake of a laugh, this impression is ostensibly proved incorrect in an early scene, but knowing the true nature of Queer Duck and Openly Gator, we know they are committed to each other. If they were not, Openly Gator wouldn't be so upset when Queer Duck tries to live life as a straight duck and marries an old buzzard akin to our world's Liza Minelli.<br /><br />But, this is where the plot is lost. The film shows Queer Duck having a wonderful relationship with Madame Buzzard, but when she dies, it never shows why Queer Duck wants Openly Gator back so badly, except that perhaps he is lonely. We are supposed to believe that Queer Duck really accepts being gay because his wife dies. But the beginning of the film doesn't show us Openly Gator and Queer Duck's really bonding; however, the film does convincingly show the bond between Queer Duck and the buzzard. We understand that Openly Gator is heart broken, and we can assume why, but the movie never shows us why. It never shows that spark between Openly Gator and Queer Duck, even though we know they had been in a committed relationship for some time.<br /><br />I would have liked to have seen Oscar Wildcat play a bigger part in this movie. His dry banter provides a welcome respite from the other, louder jokes that play throughout.<br /><br />This movie is recommended if you can't find anything else at the video store and don't want to leave empty-handed. It's a step above that C-level-romantic-comedy you know you don't want to see, in that I think you are less likely to turn this off.
