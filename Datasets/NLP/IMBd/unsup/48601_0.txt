The best thing I can say about this episode is that it introduces us to Jenny Calander, Giles' techno-pagan girlfriend. By season two, Jenny becomes an important and generally likable character, who's death drives the show in a dark, compelling direction. For now, Jenny is just the computer science teacher and who enjoys sparring with Giles. She likes computers, he likes books... a little conventional, but fun none the less. And it's nice to see Giles interacting with a grown up.<br /><br />The rest of the episode, however, isn't very good. Being BTVS, even a bad episode has some interesting moments, but all in all this is one of the show's weaker efforts. It centers around Willow's online relationship with a demon-robot-thing who calls himself Malcolm and has infected the internet via an ancient book. To be fair, he does have a lovely speaking voice, but the ram horns are a bit much. <br /><br />The episode is pretty dated, with computers repeatedly shown as mysterious and dangerous. (And since, I'm a technological idiot most of the time, who likes nothing better than to blame computers for everything that goes wrong in my life, you can trust me when I say this episode gets a little heavy handed.) I wish Angel had been around in this episode, as his computer ignorance and tendency to live in the past are often played for laughs over on "Angel." He'd add another computer-phobic element to the story. And its nice that Willow gets an episode, but she'll get far better ones than "I Robot...You Jane" in later seasons. If you're watching the show on DVD, you can probably skip this episode and not miss much.<br /><br />My favorite part of the episode: Malcolm's changes to the world's computer system, from leaking FBI files, to embezzling funds from churches to fiddling with Sunnydale High's student book reports. "Nazi Germany was an example of a well ordered society... What?!?... I didn't write this."
