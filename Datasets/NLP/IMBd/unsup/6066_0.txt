I had nothing to do one day, so I went to watch this film.<br /><br />When the film had finished, I was demanding my money back! This film has just concentrated on toilet humour and slapstick, there is nothing that even made me chuckle the slightest bit in this film.<br /><br />*SPOILERS* One example is for the beginning where Chingy & Dr.Phil are chained up in the same room, Chingy keeps bumping his head, then keeps "axidentally" hitting Dr.Phil over the head, by knocking down objects while trying to get a rock through a basketball hoop.<br /><br />Another example is during the village parody, when they are all having a meeting and the blind woman comes in to go to the "toilet"...Toilet humour is funny though...if you are about 3! I don't even know really why i went to see this, the previous 2 were just as rubbish, the only good one was the first one that actually said "No shame. No mercy. NO SEQUEL"...I can see that it's stuck to it's word, seeing as they did change that after the second one was released.<br /><br />This film is so poor that it makes me feel like i've wasted my time just writing about how bad it is, the jokes are so bad, the humour is just the same pretty much all the way through, all they have done is thought up about 4 jokes and relied on them throughout the entire film.
