A slow movie with no psychological depth. There are a few story lines and none of them really relate, except that they all take place in a small neighborhood of Mexico City. The acting is telenovela quality and so is the plot. None of the actors motivations are evenly remotely hinted at. Why is (Alma) Hayek intrigued by the pimp? Why does she go back to him after saying she won't? What's wrong with Abel that he's madly obsessed with her? How has Susanah managed to be single her whole life? How has Rutilio managed to be gay and be a married man for so long? Can we have some character development? What is the Rutilio's son's explanation for going into a murderous rage? An uninspiring bore that not even the beauty of Hayek can save.
