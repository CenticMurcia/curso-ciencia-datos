I was 10 years old (now 26) and this film was the first gore horror i laid my eyes on and it's mentally scared me in a way.<br /><br />Now and again i watch the odd clip of it on youtube and even now it gives me this strange feeling that 'i don't really want to be watching this'..<br /><br />Even though, since... i've seen hundreds of gory films, but this one is still implanted in my head, possibly because it was my first.<br /><br />Even the front cover of the video, with the little girl and the two rabid grannies stood behind her freaks me out.<br /><br />Maybe i should talk about the plot... well, there isn't one. It doesn't need one really. It's just a couple of Grannies ripping their claws through a bunch of middle class relatives. I don't even think they're rabid from what i remember!?<br /><br />The setting of a remote mansion works really well, gives it a creepy feel to the daftness going on inside the house.<br /><br />On the downside, the films English dubbing doesn't really do it any justice, making it into more of a comedy than an actual horror. I'd like to watch the subtitled version, if one exists, to see if takes away that comedic effect.<br /><br />My verdict from what i remember 7 out of 10... and thank you for poisoning my angelic childhood Grandma's.
