I couldn't possibly say enough positive things about this film.<br /><br />This is a MUST-SEE for any film lover. Creative, brilliant use of color & characters - laced into interweaving stories that entertain, amuse & amaze. Rich costumes and sets, excellent acting and well crafted themes..this is a piece to be studied.<br /><br />Full of detail, laughs, & heart.<br /><br />My only wish is that these fellas (who've pretty much only done commercials & other nonsense) keep creating such inspiring works. I could watch this on loop & generate a countless number of flavorful pieces of art. ::love::
