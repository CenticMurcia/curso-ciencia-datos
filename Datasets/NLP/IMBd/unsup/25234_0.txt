I've never understood the 'camp' phenomenon, with its devotees (camp followers?) who actually prefer to see their cult favourites -- usually larger-than-life actresses -- in *bad* films, rather than good ones. But Joan Crawford's 'camp' credentials are unquestioned, and 'Untamed' is a campfest. Those who like to see Joan Crawford in queen-bee mode (you know who you are) will enjoy this film immensely. Me, I liked Joan better in 'Daisy Kenyon'.<br /><br />Here, she's cast as Bingo Dowling -- yes, Bingo! -- an oil heiress who's been living in the remote jungle with two older men named Murchison and Presley, whom she calls her 'uncles'. She takes a shine to handsome young Andy McAllister, and the two of them warble some bad songs. This movie was made in 1929, when silent films were fading fast and the Hollywood studios were scrambling to prove that their stars could not only talk but even sing. Actually, Joan was a pretty good singer and dancer in 'Hollywood Revue of 1929', but her singing in 'Untamed' is quite dire. And the sound recording is bad: well below the usual high standard of Douglas Shearer and MGM.<br /><br />Speaking of which: MGM were consistently the studio with the best production values, the most opulent sets and the most stylish costumes. You'd hardly know it here. Several exterior sequences -- notably in the jungle -- have clearly been filmed indoors on a set-dressed soundstage. Several other sets are too swank for their own good. A simple little shop is kitted out like a posh emporium. As Bingo, Crawford flashes too many bangles, and her jewellery tends to rattle loudly in the bad sound mix.<br /><br />SPOILERS NOW. Eventually, Bingo shoots Andy (good idea!) but they fall in love anyway (bad idea!).<br /><br />I consider myself a Joan Crawford fan (for several reasons) but 'Untamed' is not her finest hour. I'll give some slack to all concerned, as this talkie was made during Hollywood's awkward transition period. For that reason, and out of sentiment for Joan Crawford, I'll rate this movie 4 out of 10 ... but I'm being generous.
