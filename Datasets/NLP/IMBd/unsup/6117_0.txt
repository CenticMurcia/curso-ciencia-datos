Roman Polanski really outdid himself in this original film about lust,perversions,love,dependencies,relationships and the evil of man. All shaped and formed in the city of love,Paris.You're flung to and from Paris on to a cruise on open dark waters.The shift and the graphic story send your sealegs a drift.<br /><br />Hugh Grant ,in his shy studdering act of a prude sexually frustrated Englishman drawn into temptation by the french vamp,is adorable compared to the other characters in the film.<br /><br />Curiosity killed the cat!<br /><br />This movie is at times very erotic and then it slides down to real perversity's.<br /><br />It captures you and doesn't leave you unmarked.
