This movie by German director Doris Dörrie is very weak. It's mainly the dialogue (the cinematography is as always with Ms Dörrie very good), but these people seem to live in a parallel universe which has nothing to do with any real human being living in Germany. It seems to portray some kind of Munich high society which German filmmakers love (f.ex. Rossini) but who no one else in Germany really cares about. Besides I doubt that it exists in the way they like to portray it. So what's the point then? What's the point... Good question which could sum up the experience one has by seeing this movie which is not good nor bad. And this is the worst kind of movie... A bad movie at least leaves the pleasure to make sarcastic comments... This one here... nothing...
