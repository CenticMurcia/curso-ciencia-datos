I was unable to see how anyone can find this movie funny. Taste is a strange thing i guess... There is not a single scene in this movie that made me laugh. Worse, there are so few scenes that i watched and considered to be MEANT to be funny. Ice cube does his bad acting once again (look at me, i'm a rapper and i have only one facial expression!) The rest is only so-so (nothing special). One of them is when the unfunny guy meets his blind date. However, you saw it coming from a mile, so it did absolutely nothing to me.<br /><br />If you want to see funny bake movies, check out stuff like Harold and Kumar, or the all-time classic Half-baked.
