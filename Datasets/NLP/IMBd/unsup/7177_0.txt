I was telling my kids about this movie yesterday and decided to look for it on the net tonight. I have not seen it since it first aired and I was an 8 year old living a life similar to that boy in the movie. I really love this movie. I can still feel the salty tears running down my face after seeing this as a kid. I would love to find a copy of this movie to show my kids. I did a search for Carousel Films, but I could not find this movie on the companies that came up. Does anyone know where one can find a copy of this movie? This is such a lost treasure of a film. I was so glad to see others comments on how they were touched by this movie and it stayed with them all these years. So if anyone knows how to find a copy please post. Thanks!
