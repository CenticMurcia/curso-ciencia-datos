The documentary side to this is not particularly good. Just questioning random hippies who are too damn wasted to give a decent answer or tie their shoes. And these aren't funny stoners, just boring stoners. I don't think the majority even cares about peace and love they just want to follow their pig-like instincts and roll around in mud. It's like, yeah I'm in for peace, now lets have free sex. For peace, of course. Woodstock had a lot of rocking acts though, and if they were lucky, they even got to play within six hours of the announced time. Grateful Dead always jammed till whenever people were sick of it, then went on for another hour. You all know who came, you all know who rocked and who didn't, I'm just going to tell my favourite was the incredibly Van Driessen-like John Sebastian. That guy is awesome,too bad he stopped making music ages ago. Or maybe he didn't, what do I know. The Who gives an awesome show, so does Jimi. Richie Havens does a great improvisation, Ten Years After is just delightfully hard and nasty. It's not about making a statement,it's about rock and roll to me. And no war or whatever.
