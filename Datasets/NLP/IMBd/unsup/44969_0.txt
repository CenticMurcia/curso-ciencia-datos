It's not a reality show and it's not scripted sitcom comedy, it is kind of made up on the spot but with real people and scripted parts but whatever it is supposed to be it's not the one thing it should be, it's not funny.<br /><br />the comedy network has had a lot of failures recently (popculture, keys to the vip, girls will be girls, jeff ltd, etc.) but i had hopes for this show.<br /><br />the big problems are the only known names in the show are the guests and they aren't funny, they are football players or newscasters etc. the cast all over act to the point where it makes me angry, why is the fat guy acting sooo hard to come off as mentally challenged or slow? why is the main girl character so bitchy? mainly who are these people and why should i be interested in watching them drive somewhere in a van and try to make somebody better at comedy? if you're going to have people giving comedy advice shouldn't they be real comedy experts and not a bunch of no name Toronto pardon the harsh term but nobodies? can't you get jeremy hotz or mike wilmot or anybody with real comedy chops to do a show? if not that just goes to show how low comedy network has let itself go.<br /><br />the jokes are lame the written parts are poorly written and the improv parts remind me of college kids hamming it up for the camera to get attention, because they know they're funny because their friends told them so.<br /><br />this show is so lame, not the worst in comedy network history but right up there, or right down there, whatever.<br /><br />1 out of 10 and i wish i could give other comedy network shows less than 1 but the IMDb.com system won't let me give zero.
