I have just watched both series of the program and have loved every episode. I think that the whole idea is brilliant and much better than some of the other shows around today. I am however really disappointed that there will not be another series, the show leaves us on a cliff hanger and i'm sure a lot of people, would like to see a solution. If this was to be sold to UK and European television companies I am sure that this would get a hell of a lot more views. Channels like Channel 4, BBC Three and E4 would be the perfect window for this show, ratings would be assured on them channels. I would love to see a new series and i'm sure many people would agree that they would also love to see a new series.
