quite possibly the worst film of our generation: no plot, no character development, absolutely no story to be told. This is a sketch movie, and a very bad one at that. Michael Cera is top bill, he's in 1 scene, he really regrets being involved now.this is an awful movie, and not just bad in the sense of it's ironically funny, it's just EXTREMEly bad, avoid like the plague.<br /><br />Mathew Lillard was this movies only saving grace. His attempts at sexual health tapes were pretty funny.<br /><br />the musical scene at the end was also a bit humorous, but again severely lacking.
