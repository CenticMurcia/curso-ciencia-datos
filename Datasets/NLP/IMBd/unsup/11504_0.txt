I loved sliders from the very beginning. The mystery that surrounded the show was amazing. I would often find myself wishing that I was a part of the show's cast. One of my favorite things about It was the spoken "what If you could travel to parallel worlds" part. I had gotten to the point where I could mimic that line while It was being said. The first two seasons were wonderful. Then midway Into the third It started to go downhill from there. I cried when Arturo died ,It was so sad, that and the fact that I knew It would never be the same. The cast that loved each other suddenly turned to lots of bickering and arguing. Everyone's character seemed to become mechanical. I would have loved to see the show end with everyone back together and make It home.<br /><br />I still loved the show until Maggie showed up with her bossy attitude. Then when the characters started dropping off like flies we should have know the end was near. I guess what finally did It for me Is that, They no longer hid somewhere to slide anymore or just slide from one unknown destination to the next, It all was planned. Everything became out In the open and then all of the witchcraft and gory stuff was too over the top for the way how the show started. When they replaced the original Quinn and added Maggie that killed the show for me from then on. I only started watching again when Collin showed up because he brought humor once again. I wish they would have kept the original characters and kept the show they way It was In the beginning. It would not have be canceled I don't think.I love sci-fI and time travel stuff. This show made you want to learn about things you never knew existed like the Einstein-Rosen bride.I became more Interested In learning about these things after I saw the show.As In star treks end" All Good Things: must come to an end" I always say If It's not broke don't fix It!
