Mr. Chris' comments are dead-on so I will not repeat them here. I went into this movie with high hopes. Unfortunately, it failed to deliver. The movie is long on emotional appeals and short on facts. In addition, most of the material defies not only economic theory but also basic logic. For example, the movie claims that credit scores are meaningless but then goes on to "expose" a plan by the credit scorers to gather data from law enforcement agencies to feed into the credit scores. If the scores are meaningless and erroneous, why go to the expense of gathering additional data. In support of its crusade against credit reports, the movie states that 95% of credit reports contain errors. However, this is only important if those errors render the credit reports statistically uncorrelated with rates of credit default, which is clearly not the case. In fact, credit scores are excellent predictors of default rates. My own experience in reviewing my credit report and those of my clients has been that the "error" usually involve misspelling of a name or former street address. Hardly something that would have a detrimental effect on one's ability to borrow. In sum, there are some great fact-based documentaries out there (Michael Moore, Al Gore) but this is not one of them.
