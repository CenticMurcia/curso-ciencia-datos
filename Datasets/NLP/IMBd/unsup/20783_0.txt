I'm am going to give this movie a ten, yes a ten.. Mike Myers is a genius and whether this movie was his best or worst it made me laugh and it was original. It was very silly and that's a good thing, I guess what helped is I saw him on Inside the Actors Studio and he explained his thoughts on how he put the movie together and was pretty open about the raw humor etc. in the film. It has a lot of raunchy humor and it's not so different then the Austin Power movies in the way it's put together. Yes Vern Troyer is in it.... I think you really have to see it for yourself. If you like wait a few months and it will be out on DVD... People on here take these movies these days way to serious I remember when going to see a movie was supposed to be fun, not always on IMDb.com, lol Have Fun. Tom
