I never realized while this show was running what a homage it was to the original TV series with George Reeves, but it truly is in so many ways. There are dozens of little touches that echo the original show.<br /><br />For example, there is a character called Inspector Henderson, and at the end of the show the Superman cape is shown with a red "S" just as it was on George Reeve's costume, whereas Superman's actual cape has a yellow "S".<br /><br />Notice that Dean Cain's hairstyle as Superman is swept back just as George Reeve's was, even though the character never wore it that way in the comics.<br /><br />The very title is the NEW adventures of Superman, whereas the original was properly called, "The Adventures of Superman", and not merely Superman.<br /><br />At least one episode was a remake from the original series by the original writer, and both the original Lois Lane, and Jimmy Olsen appeared at least once each in the series.<br /><br />It has been pointed out that later in its run it began to unravel, and this is non unusual for any series, but this affectionate homage to both the characters and the earlier series is a fun romp that still holds up fairly well 15 years later.<br /><br />I might add that Smallville has continued the tradition of alluding to the original series countless times, and has even had Dean Caine appear, among many other actors with a Superman history.<br /><br />All in all, this series is a solid entry in the Superman story. I recommend you watch this, and not that dreadful Euro-Superman they tried to foist on us in Superman Returns.
