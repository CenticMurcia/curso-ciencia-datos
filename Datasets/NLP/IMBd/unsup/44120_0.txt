I wish the movie had not been so ridiculous. An FBI agent going undercover, under his real name, AND doing raids on more or less the same group he is trying to infiltrate? Insane. A group of 13 year-olds would take more precautions than these FBI agents are shown doing. There MIGHT have been a movie here. The agent, Keanu Reeves, is shown getting close to a surfer gal in order to get 'in' with the surfers; he tells her his parents died (which is a lie--they are still alive, we later find out, in Ohio) to gain sympathy from her, because he has found out thru records that her parents died in an accident when she was a child. This kind of thing brings out a type of remorse in the 'best' of circumstances. It is HARD to go undercover. That's why J.Edgar Hoover didn't even LET his agents go undercover: no way, back then. But the foolishness in this movie is too, too much. Too bad, because some of it is pretty cool. Altho there is a slip-up: there are no football scholarships in law school.
