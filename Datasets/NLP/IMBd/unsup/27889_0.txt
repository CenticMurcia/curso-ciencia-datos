I love this film... you can't not do if you like any of Adam Sandler's. This film has a great cast who all play off each other brilliantly, especially Chris McDonald & the guy from Rocky & I can't believe it didn't do better in the cinema in England... in fact it might have only been on selected releae here 'cause I can't remember it coming out. Sandler is great in it & all you people that say he mumbles his lines, it's his style & it's that which attracts the audience to him because he seems so non threatening to the audience. This is a beautiful film & it demonstrates the ability of all the actors brilliantly... Adam Sandlers temper, Chris McDonalds snyde nature, the loveable grandma's loveableness. It seems kinda the actors as charicatures, but instead it's just good casting. This film is awesome... I think i've seen it about 80 times & i still haven't got tired of it.
