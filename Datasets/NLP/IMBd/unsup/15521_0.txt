Well what to say about Aquaman, First I thought it was some kind of Joke after watching the Aquaman silliness in the super show Entourage. Where it is seen as an absurdity but with a super director and a house full of cash unfortunately Justin Hartley probably didn't see that much cash thrown his way in Mercy Please Aquaman the TV show. Rubbish is a good one word to describe the show awful is another so no surprise's there for what is a terrible concept. It's not even as good as Baywatch meets Buffy nether of which I a fan of, but if you like that kind of childish sci fiction you may like this but its definitely not for everyone its most positively not for anyone who likes to think about what there watching or enjoys rich provoking story lines. Give it a miss in the hope that the money may be spent on a better idea.
