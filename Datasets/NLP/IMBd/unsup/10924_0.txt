Why did I watch it through four times? First, I wanted to see the movie because I missed it in the 80's. Then I got caught up in all the bonus material, which was better than the movie, and told the exciting story of how the movie was made. I watched through once with Kevin Bacon's commentary and again with the commentary of the producer and the writer. Finally I went back and watched all the dance sequences again with the new knowledge I had acquired. So much fun to learn about the creative process by which this went from being one man's idea to being a cultural phenomenon. So interesting to see all the ways the film was almost scuttled, including the "wrong ending" the otherwise savvy director insisted on giving it, and the studio executive who said she would never, never approve of the casting of Kevin Bacon because he was not ****able enough. Imagine the movie without the final dance sequence!
