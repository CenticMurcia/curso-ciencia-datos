In Running Wild we see Gregory Harrison as Matt Robinson, a retired major and widower trying to bond with his kids so he thinks it would be nice to take them to Africa where poachers are killing elephants. His 14 year old daughter Angela acts like a snob, but she just happens to be hiding her real feelings after losing her mother and her little brother Nicky is just your average annoying little brother. Matt meets Rachel (lori Hallier) who works at the orphanage for animals and he takes a liking to her whilst Angela gets saved by an Englishman named Walton and she gets a crush on him, but the question remains is WHY she falls for him! All of a sudden they find a wounded baby elephant and Angela bonds with it naming it Dandy, but there are still poachers around hunting for elephants. I only got this movie because I am a fan of Greg, but I must admit the kids casting was terrible except from Munyaradzi Kanaventi (mouthful!) who plays Isaac the son of the ranger who works with Matt. There was no romance in this movie so you can really say, "Oh so that's how they fell in love!" They go to see Walton and yet there is NO romance! Okay so it wasn't a love story, but if it was it would've have been worth watching. It's just a bunch of people walking around in Africa or flying in a helicopter. There are 2-3 action scenes, the last one was okay, but the others lasted a few seconds. Recommended only if you're a BIG fan of one of the actors in this movie.
