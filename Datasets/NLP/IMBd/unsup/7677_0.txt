when a film is copied from a book its got to be at least a little bit like the book itself but this does not and when put beside other horror hammer films like 'the devil rides out' it makes itself look like a waste when there was so much that could have been done to make it a fine film. I give it 4 because i love hammer films, if i didn't i'd be giving it a 2.<br /><br />If i was any of the actors in the film i'd be rather ashamed but then again it could be just for the money. If your a person who's seen it or is thinking of seeing it first read the book>scare your pants reading it>then watch the film>get board and see that the only thing close from the book is just the bloody title. go on i dare you it'll be a lot better.
