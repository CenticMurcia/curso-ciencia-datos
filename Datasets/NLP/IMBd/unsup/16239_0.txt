Enid (Thora Birch) says to her father, as he tells her where she could apply for a job. The film encompasses surrealism, depression, teen angst and people who feel disenfranchised. Basically, everyone.<br /><br />As one reviewer mentioned, it is not a formulaic Disney movie, nor is it a Gothic depressive movie, like "Disturbing Behavior" or other teen movies. This film actually stands out on its own, and the performances are excellent. Steve Buscemi is believable and sympathetic as the local loser who Enid and her friend decide to stalk. Ileana Douglas portrays Enid's art teacher (classically quirky). Enid is required to take art class for the summer "for retard losers" she tells Teri Garr, her father's girlfriend.<br /><br />Enid and her friend find the world out of school has little more to offer- The hypocrisy of graduation; when the class president speaks: "I liked her so much better when she was a crack head" Johannson sneers. Classic.<br /><br />Enid also reflects that she will miss the geeky classmate who she will never see again- a familiar sense that "what is to come" may also be a disappointment. The underlying theme of Seymour's (Buscemi's) collection of 78's, and a lost world, is touching and effective. He works as a VP at what was formerly known as "Coon Chicken". Enid develops an interest in this, and brings the logo to her art class,where Douglas commends her for her awareness of the subject. Yes, there were places like that, Seymour says, now it is less out in the open. The possibility that we all live in a ghost world of our own is not just a remote possibility.<br /><br />This film is excellent for its creative portrayal of disenfranchisement, discontent, and the humor that saves us from despair. Johansson offers comic relief when Enid visits her at the local coffee house where she works: ..."mostly I just want to kill everyone"... The starkness and impersonal environment of the strip malls, the Sidewinder where Brad Renfro makes slushies, the "fake 50's diner" where weird Al works- all these places are familiar americana. Hopefully John Malkovich will make a sequel. 10/10
