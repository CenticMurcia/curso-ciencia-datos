I love Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor. Silver Streak was great. Hear No Evil See No Evil wasn't bad. I just don't get why this movie is so highly thought of. It has a few chuckles here and there, but all in all I didn't find it that funny. The funniest moments were Gene Wilder's craftiness in dealing with the guards brutality. Richard Pryor's striking a match to the big guy in jail was funny too, although it didn't make much sense. I have seen both the TV and DVD version of this film and neither were able to impress on me the reason this movie is considered to be a "classic". Both actors have had funnier films (together and on their own).
