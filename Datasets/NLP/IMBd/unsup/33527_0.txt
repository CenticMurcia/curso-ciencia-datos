This was a very good looking film. The characters were well done and the machines and robots looked excellent as well. Just as its known that for every time you have a good experience you tell one person, when you have a bad experience you tell ten, so goes this plot-less film. I thought that this looked very similar to the animation of the "Appleseed" movies as the screenplay was written by the same guy. Too bad that the first "Appleseed" (although not too great in itself) did circles around this utterly meandering story. I am not sure who thought that this had a complete story to begin with. It very much seemed like they just decided to do a bunch of cool CG then decided to fit in some sort of storyline as an afterthought. As I wrote in my heading, you will probably get just as much out of this with the mute button on as you would with it off. I would suggest skipping this unless you are a hardcore Japanese Anime fan. If you want to see something good, try watching "Appleseed" or the classic "Ghost in the Shell, Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, or Akira."
