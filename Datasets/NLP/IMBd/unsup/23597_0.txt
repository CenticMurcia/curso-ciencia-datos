Why does no one EVER talk about this movie? I'm not even that into mob movies but I feel like without a doubt this is one of the best mob films ever made. The more you watch you see all the bits you missed the first time. And what a cast! Gary Oldman, Sean Penn, Robin Wright, John C. Reilly, Nick Turturro, and of course Ed Harris. I think Oldman actually deserved an Oscar nod for this. He was outstanding in his role as Jackie. What other movie besides DAHMER would you find a guy who keeps body parts in his freezer who actually like! This movie was way underrated in the box office and on rental. . i can watch this movie over and over. Every scene is so intense and well played by the actors.
