In the spirit of minimalism stage, Alex Keaton's struggle with the loss of a friend has an impact even today. Flipping through TV Land at 3AM one night I watched both parts of this pivotal episode and was still astounded.<br /><br />Alex's entire life is controlled by him. Suddenly he is forced to deal with something way beyond his control-death. It forces him to evaluate himself, and adds some funny stuff in with the flashbacks too. My favorite is Alex being upset because "mommy, my favorite president is being impeached!" (Nixon). The laughs thrown in are in no way offensive, nor take away from the seriousness of the episode.<br /><br />These two episodes never cease to amaze me, and I always felt represented what this show really was-about family, coping with change and loving someone even if they are the polar opposite of you-the contrast in political beliefs of Alex versus his parents provided laughs and tender understanding.<br /><br />If you never have watched the show, I suggest these two episodes.
