It's a pity that this extraordinary piece of ensemble acting is currently unvavailable. It's a bittersweet piece, akin to Peter's Friends or The Big Chill, but more realistic (it's a set of scenes from lives, not a single short-term reunion). The acting is superb. Whoever has the rights: make this series available!
