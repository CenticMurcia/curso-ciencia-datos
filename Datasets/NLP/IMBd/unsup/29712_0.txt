I watched the Latin version of "USA UP ALL NIGHT". I don't know where else to comment about it.<br /><br />The host was Shelly Moreno; a sexy blonde Latina with a sexy fresh attitude. She would always wear skimpy mini skirts and bathing suits. She was extremely nice and at some points gave her opinions for some Horror movies.<br /><br />Those were the days when this program was the best possible Friday night entertainment. I miss the old days... I can't even count how many movies I watched it on this show.<br /><br />To the producers of Latin USA Network; I praise you and thank for the good memories. Hopefully, one day, this show will return in it's Latin version.
