The old communist Sergiu Nicolaescu, nowadays senator in a communist leftover party , who used to swallow every dime the poor, state owned movie industry Romania at the time had allocated for movies(usually one or two per year)has made patriotic/historical/war movies for all his communist party sponsored career. His movies were pretty much all "entertainment" Romanians had in a time when the dictator Ceausescu cut the only TV program to just two hours a day, between 20 and 22 o'clock(and this in black and white).<br /><br />As a result, this communist front liner made more than 20 communist propaganda filled, with unbelievable and pathetic characters(usually members of the communist party, or involved in the communist struggle against the "rotten capitalism"), dialog and stories(always patriotic) accompanied by an incredibly bad sound (Romanian Mono they called it).<br /><br />The movies this big communist era leftover makes today are of even worse quality than his earlier communist ideology infested flicks.
