I enjoyed Barbara Hershey in this movie. Just couldn't stop watching. The story was one of those that is predictable, but still interesting to see how they explain where the characters are going to end up. <br /><br />I could have lived without quite so much narration. It is redundant at times as the story is on the screen already.<br /><br />The locations and camera shots are just gorgeous. This part of the country is so picturesque. <br /><br />The story of a lost tribe of native Americans that are discovered by a "cowboy" and a professor while looking for clues to missing persons. The best comparison to other movies would be in the category of time travel. Since the world that the tribe lives in is isolated from the modern, and they have kept their native language and customs. Again, I have always found Barbara Hershey to be a very good character actor. She is quite attractive as well. <br /><br />This is a good movie and I would recommend it.
