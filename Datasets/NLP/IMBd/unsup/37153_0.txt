In the words of Billy Bob Thornton this movie is funny, but I don't know if it's funny ha-ha! Or funny Queer. Lorenzo Lamas is queer to begin with, then you add sorry effects and a lame story line and you have for a cocktail of queerness all around. If your a Sci-Fi fan you can watch this movie because is Sci-Fi but I warn you, you could develop some funny feelings (I don't know if funny ha-ha or funny queer) in the pit of your stomach. Over all this movie sucked like all of Lorenzo Lamas movies. What was that show he was on anyways, oh well I don't care I am just trying to fill the 10 lines so I can post this comment on a all around queer movie.
