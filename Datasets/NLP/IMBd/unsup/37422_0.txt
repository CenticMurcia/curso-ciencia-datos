Fairly average film. Fairly humorous but apart from that there was nothing else really going for it. The film doesn't really have much to keep you interested and it had the feel that I'd seen it a score or more time before. I'm sure there are films out there with the exact same plot but are about dancing or summat like. What really got my goat, though, was the worst Yorkshire accents I have ever heard in my life. Rickman didn't even bother to try and sound northern, whilst at times I thought Hartnett was trying to sound more like he was from Ireland, Italy or Kentucky than Keighley - sometimes all three at the same time!<br /><br />All in all, forgettable film, unforgettably dreadful accents. I wouldn't watch it again, but if I were, it would only be to stare wistfully at Rachael Leigh Cook.
