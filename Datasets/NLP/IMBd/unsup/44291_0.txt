Every big con movie since the "Sting" is a convoluted set of plots in which there are a bunch of good guys among the bad guys, and visa versa. There is a twist or two or three at the end, but they are so expected, they are hardly shockers. In fact, they are getting to where they are basically the "Sting" in new clothes. This movie is no exception. It uses the blueprint of con movie elements with little new ground. This is a "seen one ya seen 'em all" con game story, IMO. The newer ones just add a few more unimaginative side stories, involve modern devices such as electronic banking, computer technology, a little more of the sex angle,etc. However, complicating a tired plot doesn't make it better.
