Check out the other reviews, folks. Overwhelmingly positive, with the occasional know-it-all, "no-that-don't-impress-me-much" imbeciles here and there.<br /><br />This movie was a GREAT low-budget flick. Dirty, grimy feel, unforgiving, bleak urban landscape and an ending which follows through 100% without any retarded "surprises." I thought the first quarter of the film was moving a bit slow but, boy, did it ever make up for it.<br /><br />Despite this being a horror movie, it's not all about the gore. The virus is in fact a metaphor for greed, as it arrives at the same time as a development corporation is evicting lower income Bronx tenants via "emiment domain." The only thing that bothered me is the female character--the daughter of the protagonist--who is returning home after having, presumably, served in Iraq, complete with a scar on the left side of her face. I suppose this is to indicate that "women are capable of being soldiers too" and, not only that, but, "Look! she even got a war injury! What a hero!" Am I suppose to get all misty-eyed and pretend I'm so happy that "women today have the chance to become veterans, too"? Give me a break. It reminds me of that other mush-brained feminazi reading of the recent remake (an abomination like all remakes have been in the past ten years) of 'The Hitcher.' Keep your lefty, liberal propaganda to yourselves for once, people. Geez.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a minor quip. The female "soldier's" character was very understated in its "feminist" intend.<br /><br />Anyone who enjoys good horror should watch this film. These folks deserve all the praise they get.
