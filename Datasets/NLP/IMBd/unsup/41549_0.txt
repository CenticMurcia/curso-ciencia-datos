Of what could be one of the worst vampire movies ever made in cinematic history, "THE BREED" could probably take home the trophy for that honor.<br /><br />"THE BREED" is such a blatant rip-off of films such as "BLADE" and "THE MATRIX". Just about EVERYTHING in this movie was stolen from something else. Of what thread-bare plot existed in this movie, I gathered that there was a small existence of good vampires who team up with humans to extinguish rebellious vampires. The good vampires live on a synthetic substitute to human blood while the rebellious ones go around murdering humans by drinking their blood.<br /><br />Bokeem Woodbine (one of the worst actors to ever grace our television AND movie screens) is the human cop teamed up with Adrian Paul (of HIGHLANDER fame), the good vampire, sent on a mission to track down an evil vampire who is kidnapping young women and killing them. The setting is in some sort of weird post-Nazi Poland (yet most of the people have American accents) where the fashions and vehicles resemble that of 1941, yet pop culture of today has been blended in to give it that 'unique' flavor (ie. references to 'James Bond', the existence of a hard-core nightclub, leather/dominatrix outfits, etc.) Can someone say "TITUS", you know, that forgettable and noisy artsy trash starring Anthony Hopkins and Jessica Lange?<br /><br />Woodbine spends most of his time running around saying the 'F' word as many times as he can while Paul just looks bored, standing around with too much powder on his face and a glazed expression on his face, delivering every line with a dead-pan approach, it gets very tiresome after awhile. It is the old cliched scenario of pairing up two unlikely cops, one the brazen hero, the other, straight-laced and by-the-books. Except this time, unlike films such as "BEVERLY HILLS COP" and "LETHAL WEAPON", the formula does NOT work. They even drag in Bai Ling who looks absolutely ridiculous as an ancient Asian vampiress who spends most of her time on-screen donning ludicrous outfits (check out the leather head-piece), bad make-up, yellow eye contacts and an almost un-decipherable accent that would make even Stevie Wonder ask, "Could you say that again, please?" <br /><br />If you thought those cliches weren't bad enough, check out the cardboard cut-out characters including the obvious villain, the obligatory Asian male with platinum blonde hair, the little boy whose life is saved by Woodbine in a climatic scene... I could go on, but I have other things to gripe about.<br /><br />I could get past the bad acting and the non-existent script, but... okay, maybe I can't. The sets were awful, the usual run-down derelict building with lots of smoke and fog, minimal scenery involving a graveyard shot or 'people running through the forest while being chased by men with guns' visual. NOTHING ABOUT THIS MOVIE WAS ORIGINAL! I can't emphasize this enough! <br /><br />The most embarrassing scenes was seeing Adrian Paul flying around through the air, 'MATRIX-style', wielding a tommy gun in slow motion as he fires at the bad guys, yet you can see the 'pull-strings' that suspend him through the air, it is too hilarious for words! When the director wants to make the action scenes 'dramatic', he thinks he can fool the audience by filming everything in slow-motion, while adding an 'echo' to nearly every word spoken in the dialogue - it just boggles my mind as to why amateurish garbage such as this still gets financed in today's economy.<br /><br />I have no idea if this movie is based on a book, comic strip, legend or what, nor do I care. I just pray to God that there isn't a sequel, and if there is, then PLEASE do not release it 'straight-to-cable'. It should go straight into the trash can where this movie rightfully belongs.<br /><br />My Grade - 'Z minus'
