I caught this film in New York and it left me creeped out. It may not be for everyone, but if you like cinematic films with a Hitchcockian flavor, old Polanski thrillers, Greenaway, or Lynch type of stuff, you'll probably appreciate it. It's not a gore or exploitation film, but takes its time and sucks you in, little by little, into the world of the deranged young tailor. It's more about psychological deterioration, like the feeling you get when you haven't slept for many days and you start seeing things, imagining horrors, or getting paranoid. The final ballroom scene fascinated me with the outrageous dancers and leering old tailors. I would recommend it to anyone interested in bizarre or different films.
