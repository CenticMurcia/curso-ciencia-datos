When I first saw "The Fury" I was blown away, there wasn't a thing I disliked about it. The story was fascinating, the casting supreme and it just hit me with a hook that I could not let go of. I don't know if it was just the time in my life or what, but I have always considered "The Fury" as one of my favorite movies. The story line was plausible, if you believed or considered that our minds are capable of more than we use them for, and the tension seemed real at the right times. I did not read the book, if there was one, so the movie held up and there was no let down, just a nice roller coaster ride for all to see. This movie has held up for me in, "the test of time".
