This movie is beyond bad and I don't know how on earth I'm even gonna be able to write the 10 minimum lines that are required in order to get this review published here.<br /><br />However I will give it a go, apparently it's supposed to be funny, but having a no-sense making story or did I just write story I meant, I don't know what I meant because there is no such thing as a story in this movie.<br /><br />There aren't any jokes either, and my guess is that 99% of the "actors" in this movie had no real acting-experience prior to this movie.<br /><br />What more to say, it's a blasphemy towards comedies that it even refers itself as a comedy.<br /><br />SNOWBOARD ACADEMY starring COREY HAIM and ERNIE wasn't great by any means BUT a masterpiece nonetheless when compared to this snooze-fest.
