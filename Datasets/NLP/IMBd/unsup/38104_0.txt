***POSSIBLE SPOILERS***** The good news for this film is that I have seen worse....Children of the Dead always come to mind when trying to pinpoint the worst in the genre. The bad news, I have seen much better zombie movies which were made on the same or less of a budget than this acting mess....Meat Market, for example.<br /><br />The thing that kills this movie is not the budget (well maybe it played a part), but the terrible acting and editing. They seem to think it is okay (or that people will not notice) that the actors are constantly screwing up their lines, forgetting their lines, etc. These scenes are left in and not edited. The editing is so bad, I thought I was dozing off and missing pieces of the movie. For example, characters keep popping up from scene to scene, and all the other characters know their names, and are like long lost friends. These are main characters, I might add. There is no explanation of where these characters came from, how they know them, etc.<br /><br />The plot had good intentions, but was laughable for the most part. One of the most laughable parts of the movie was when they were held up in an abandoned building. The main alpha male told everyone that if they saw someone who was bitten or infected to raise their hand. Their was one guy standing around with half of his forearm bitten out. Huh, no one seemed to notice this when they let him in. There are so many scenes like this that I could write for days and not hint on them all.<br /><br />It appears that the director lost his wife, sister, or relative during the making of this movie. My heart goes out for his loss, but I cannot see that as an excuse to put out such a crappy and poorly made movie.<br /><br />I see that Zombie Night 2 is coming soon. Hopefully they learned their lessons making this one and will improve. I hate to say it, but I will probably rent the 2nd one. I can' help it, I am a living dead head....<br /><br />Seizya.
