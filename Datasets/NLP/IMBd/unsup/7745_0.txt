How could one not love a movie such as this. I have loved this movie since the first day I saw it. What made me watch the movie originally was the car. However, after seeing the entire movie, I was not disappointed. Plenty of cars, good story, and a good ending. Got to love it!!!<br /><br />Maximus Tyre Knight ô¿~ P.S. - Why couldn't I get the car instead of his brother? ;o)
