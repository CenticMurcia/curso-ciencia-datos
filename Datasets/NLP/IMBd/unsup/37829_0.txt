I saw this movie as a free sneak preview tonight, and it was terrible. Bad dialogue, bad acting, plot holes a mile wide, and a lousy story.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil it (well, it wouldn't hurt it much!), but I have a sneaking suspicion that military hardware would not survive in an operable condition for 1,000 years without any maintenance. Heck, even with maintenance.<br /><br />I thought John Travolta, as a Scientologist, would *like* L. Ron Hubbard and would want to put his best foot forward in this adaptation of his book, but UGH. The only highlights of the show were Kelly Preston's (Travolta's real life wife) one minute on-screen and the fact that all the aliens ran around in Gene Simmons KISS boots.<br /><br />Don't waste your money. Not even worth a rental.
