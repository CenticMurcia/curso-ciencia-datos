Kitano at his best, the images are amazing, especially the scenes on the beach. Underneath his harshness Kitano is a poet of human feelings and a world we have forgot. The first 20 minutes are the wildest I can remember in the last 10 years of Cinema. If you understand something, look again 'cause you have not! Salute one of the best directors of the last 50 years.
