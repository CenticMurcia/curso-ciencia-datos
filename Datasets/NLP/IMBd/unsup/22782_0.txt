This film is wonderful. Although slow in places, this thing is a work of art and beauty. Andy Lau is amazing, dynamic and charming! I really enjoyed the multicultural aspects, and felt the tensions between characters as their individual mysteries unfold to be very charming, sincere and often surprisingly touching. In an rather tired and often exploiting genre, this film really stands apart as an example of the value of depth in characters, theme and story no matter how two dimensional the tracking story might be. The making of footage on the flip side of the DVD is equally nifty, because seldom will a film include multiple agonizing takes of key scenes both action and non-action so that you might understand how excruciatingly demanding and exhausting film making can really be.
