Just don't bother, it's rubbish, I have no idea why Patrick Stewart and Kyle MacLachlan felt the need to do this, I cant understand why respected actors put themselves through this, It's supposed to be cheesy, it's not even funny, not cute, I feel embarrassed for the the people I'm watching, waiting for the train crash, I cant watch much more of this<br /><br />The effects are appalling, I remember some really bad blue screen stuff in the eighties, but it was like going back in time, cheap is the only word.<br /><br />The supporting actors are so wooden and the effects so plastic, I really cant find any endearing about this movie. My saving grace that it is a 2 part mini series, so I don't have to watch part 2. I have not read the book, so I cant comment on any or no similarities, all I can say that do what the others have said, read the book and or rent or buy the original.<br /><br />and please, what was with Vinnie Jones' accent.. I know now that life is too short.
