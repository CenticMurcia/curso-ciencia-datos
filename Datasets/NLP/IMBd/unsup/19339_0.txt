I actually went out of my way to find this movie because I love giant monster movies, especially King Kong related monsters.<br /><br />The effects in this movie were so bad they were embarrassing.<br /><br />It's amazing that there were better effects in 1933's King Kong compared to this...I take that back...there were better effects in 1903's The Great Train Robbery compared to this bomb.<br /><br />It's tough to mess up a movie with giant monsters and decent looking girls...but whoever made this movie did accomplish this feat. <br /><br />Anyone who is curious like I was about this film stay far away as possible. It is a total waste of your time.
