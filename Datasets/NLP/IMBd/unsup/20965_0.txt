It is a rare thing for a movie to bring me to tears, let alone, full fledged sobs. This movie revealed some of the most beautiful pictures of forgiveness, grace and freedom. Each character was a window into my heart. All the things I hate about myself, my stubborn will - my innability to forgive - and my capacity to hate. There was also the things that I would hope to be -- gracious, exceedingly forgiving, and always hopeful. I believe that the best movies are the ones that make you quiet for hours. That you walk away - not analyzing the movie itself - but exploring yourself. This movie made an impact on my life - not just my day or my top ten list.
