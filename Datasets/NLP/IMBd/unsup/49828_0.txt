Well "Dollar Mambo" its a weird movie, its kinda of a musical, or experimental film, there is no dialog at all in the whole movie, everything its express through dancing and music. In the other hand the plot its simple, US soldiers invade Panama and they rape and kill a dancer. It was funny seeing roberto sosa dance, the acting its OK, and the music use its fine but in the movie there are a lot of thing that go from strange to beyond weirdness (like a soldier dress as a ballet dancer) but a i guess it was a symbolism. <br /><br />Overall the movie its too "artistic" for my taste, it remind me "Frida naturaleza viva" another film by the same director.
