I have seen this movie because I have heard this is "the new Swedish wave", "this is the hope for Swedish cinema". Well, if this is supposed to be hope for the Swedish cinema, then Swedish cinema is pretty hopeless. The movie is about problems of actors, lots of extremely boring dialogs about art, blah, blah, blah - a really depressing "commedy" movie that is supposed to be enjoyable or even funny. I have not found anything funny at all. Nothing much happens and absolutely nothing matters. 100% boring movie in is purest form. It probably requires some northern Europe genome in your blood to be enjoyed, I really do not understand how anyone be amused by something like this. Avoid it at any cost to save 2 hours in your life for something that really matters...
