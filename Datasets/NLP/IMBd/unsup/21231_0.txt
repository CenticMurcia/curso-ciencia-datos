The passage of time could not be emphasized more emphatically than with the recent reissue by TCM of the 1935 rarity, "Metropolitan". The passing of the beloved American 'hometown' coloratura Beverly Sills may have prompted TCM to resurrect the more noted of the two movies made by the American 'hometown' baritone, Lawrence Tibbett. (The other movie was "Under Your Spell".) He was a product of Bakersfield, California.<br /><br />It is unfortunate that the name has been so easily overlooked by many who may have been born ten years too late to enjoy his voice. It is incomprehensible today why such a magnificent voice coupled with a winning personality could not have resulted in a longer illustrious career for Mr. Tibbett, especially in the burgeoning Hollywood industry. It would certainly have helped to maintain a treasure trove of history for music lovers. Suffice it to say that this film does its best to rectify this oversight.<br /><br />Mr. Tibbett provides us with a clear illustration of the power of his vocal abilities and also of his masterful interpretation of any piece be it operatic aria, Negro spiritual, or drawing room favorite.<br /><br />In this 1935 movie he presents 'Largo al Factotum' from "The Barber of Seville"; 'The Toreador Song' from "Carmen" and the prologue from "I Pagliacci", 'Si Puo'. The second of a trilogy of spirituals by the noted composer, Jacques Wolfe, 'De Glory Road' is interpreted beautifully by Mr. Tibbett. And to accommodate the hoi polloi, the wonderful soliloquy of a British veteran of old Burma as imagined in a familiar poem by Rudyard Kipling and set to music by Oley Speaks, ' On the Road to Mandalay' is given its definitive interpretation by the greatest American baritone. (Paul Robeson is not considered here only because he was deemed to be a bass-baritone and did not have the opportunity to sing at the Met)<br /><br />Both Virginia Bruce and even Alice Brady had creditable voices in their brief stints but were no match for Mr. Tibbett. MGM gave Miss Bruce the opportunity to display her musical ability further in the 1936 Eleanor Powell movie, "Born To Dance". She is the one who had the honor of introducing the Cole Porter classic 'I've Got You Under My Skin'. Also, as a nod to her pulchritude, she was the crowning model in the extravagant 'A Pretty Girl is Like a Melody' production number with the spiraling staircase in the 1936 "The Great Ziegfeld". Yes, she was the one at the top.<br /><br />Alice Brady found that comedy was more rewarding for her in Hollywood than was music and enjoyed a long and illustrious career accordingly<br /><br />Those of you who may have difficulty recalling the American baritones of yesteryear will be instantly and pleasurably reminded if you are fortunate enough to catch a viewing of "Metropolitan" on TCM.
