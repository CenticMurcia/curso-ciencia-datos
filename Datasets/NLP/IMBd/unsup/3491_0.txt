I think that even if I was not a huge fan of both leading men in this film, I would have loved it. It was entirely impossible to turn the movie off. It started off as a great concept and just got better with the characters' humor and realism. I am currently recommending it to all my friends and family (already a favorite of my mom, brother, niece, and nephew) Thoroughly enjoyable.
