This movie is, a very low, ALL-RIGHT. I saw it once, and it barely kept my attention. It wasn't very scary or weird, like exorcism movie ought to be like. The exorcist is a masterpiece. As far I am concerned, there are only two good exorcism movies, the original one, and the new "The Exorcism of Emily Rose". This one, although better than a lot of the other garbage out there about exorcism, is not nearly on the level of either of the two other movies I mentioned above. The girl does a pretty good job acting it out. However, it is not nearly good enough to be scary. The move wasn't all that well acted either. It just did not capture my interest.
