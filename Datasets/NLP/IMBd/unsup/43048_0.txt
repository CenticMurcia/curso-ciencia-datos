This was a beautiful story-would make a great bedtime story for a six year old girl- but the plot unfolded much to slow. Kirsten seemed awkward in the role.She's a lovely actress and has proved herself talented, but she plays a gruff, dirty black sheep in the film and I don't think it suited her. The movie poster/DVD cover are misleading. This movie flips back and forth from present day to the 40's, with another actress as the heroin in the present. It was confusing to see Kirsten on the DVD and put in the movie and not see her for half an hour. If this movie were remade with a bigger budget I think it could have been a hit.
