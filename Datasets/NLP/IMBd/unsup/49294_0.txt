I grew up on the Navajo Nation, and right away in the first 30 minutes I see that the movie was filmed over 200 miles away from the Navajo Nation where the story takes place.<br /><br />The movie has been filmed in the Phoenix area and the buildings that were shown were not anywhere near where they should have been.<br /><br />The first movie based on a Tony Hillerman movie had actually been filmed on the Navajo Nation. Too bad Redford decided to stray from the book.<br /><br />The casting is very dissapointing to see only people who succeed in butchering the beautiful language that we speak.<br /><br />The Navajo Police cars and uniforms are correct, but Joe Leaphorn is a Navajo character that does not know the lanuguage and customs. This is not correct... Leaphorn in all the Hillerman novels knows the customs and traditions.<br /><br />In the Dark Wind, Leaphorn was played by a Non-Indian who was able to speak Navajo. Lou Diamond PHillips did a much better job in attempting to speak Navajo. It appears that Adam Beach who butchered Navajo in Wind Talkers is doing a great job of butchering Navajo again here.<br /><br />it's now 44 minutes into the movie and i'm very dissapointed that i missed Malcom in the Middle.<br /><br />
