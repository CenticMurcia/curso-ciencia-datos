I had no idea it was based on a real story, but now that I know it I see it even worst. The worst acting ever, actors contradict their parliaments time after time. For example: <br /><br />"When Scott leaves his house once her son and wife bodies are found by the sea shore he take his car to visit Amber Frey. The Detectives where at the PD checking his moves by a satellite transmitter installed on his truck, and while the Detectives where talking the older one said they must let him go into Amber's so that he confessed to her his crimes, the younger one reply him and then suddenly the older one says they must caught him before he get her, contradicting himself previous parliament. Dean Cain was not the best acting, his silly senseless smiles where completely out of tone, no dramatical differences between strongly touching parts and the normal movie rhythm. Scott's best friend acts even badly, his face seems more than a mask put on him from the very beginning of the movie till the very end, his wife is just a sea of tears.... If you really wanna waste an hour see it, dis-satisfaction guarantee. The original story it's a real tragedy, but once more Hollywood's directors and writers prove they care nothing at all people tragedies. Why putting some more sorrow on Laci Peterson's family, why abuse of people's sad stories just for money?? Let people deal with it instead of remember them how much does they suffer!!!!
