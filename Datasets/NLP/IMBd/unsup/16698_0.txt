Another Troma-tic turkey (produced by Eric Louzil, who went on to direct those awful NUKE 'EM HIGH sequels) and substandard slasherama with one difference by default...Kevin Costner! In an uncredited supported role, Costner has two scenes as campus party animal Jimmy Scott, main suspect in a rash of killings at Dorothy College. Short fused, foul-mouthed detective Rydell King (William J. Kulzer) investigates the murder spree of "The Black Angel" (aka "The Co-ed Killer" or "The Moral Vigilante"), a mystery maniac who enjoys cutting up a group of co-eds, who used to be hookers and like to shower a lot.<br /><br />A key subplot involves a young bimbo named Judy (Elizabeth Trosper) who receives heavy breathing phone calls ("I'm coming to get you!") and whose racist brother objects to her black boyfriend. Everyone talks about how hot she is, a point that seems to require her to be in full make-up at all times (including in the shower and waking up in the morning).<br /><br />This film might set some kind of record for nude female victims, including porn star Susanna Britton/Barbara Peckinpaugh in an endless scene where she showers and runs around naked trying to elude the killer. Also featured are skinny dipping (from Terry Congie who co-starred with Costner in his first film, SIZZLE BEACH USA), a bloody stabbing, a head mashed in a car hood, a magician, a fat lesbian, a cello player and a visible boom mike. It didn't get released on video until 1986 (it was actually produced in 1981), with the publicity centering around. guess who?
