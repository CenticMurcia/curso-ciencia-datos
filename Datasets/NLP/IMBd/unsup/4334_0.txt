There aren't very many sequels I've seen but enjoyed. This is probably my most favorite sequel in the world. It's just as good as the first. Mac stars as Kevin again in this super-silly sequel, but lands in NYC. As soon as his family finds out he's missing, they do everything to find him. But he has a blast in NYC. But he uses his dad's credit card and Harry and Marv (from the first) and follow him everywhere he goes. Then he does the same thing in the first, but only at his Uncle Rob's. This is a good sequel. But just don't watch the 3rd. It sucks. This film made more cash than the first. But they're both good no matter what. So if you don't own it, rent it, watch it, enjoy it and if you love it, own it. The more Mac, the merrier.
