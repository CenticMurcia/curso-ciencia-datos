I could not remember the name of this movie. In 1984 I was 11 years old and I watched this movie every time it was on. This movie moved me. When I was 9 years old I was a lot like the innocent girl. A new girl moved across the street from me. She was from a city. I was from a very small town. She had me wanting to be like her. I even helped her steal a mini-skirt outfit for her school pictures. She was the one who told me about the "period". She used curse words, she wore makeup, and her mother used to drink vodka all day long. After she got into some trouble, her mother said I was a bad influence and we were no longer allowed to hang around anymore. She moved away 2 years later and I never saw her again. When this movie started showing on cable when I was 11 I was drawn in forever. This movie is wonderful and so real. This movie was able to show exactly what I had lived and that I was not the only one. Nobody knew then or knows now that these things had happened to me. Im glad I finally found the name and now I will look for its next showing on bravo or IFC. I will record it and have it for my daughter.
