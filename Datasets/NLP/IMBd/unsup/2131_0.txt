The first time I saw this film I thought 'Wow! I have to own that!' The telling of the story of Moses is powerfully done and the art is outstanding. It is the soundtrack, however, that brings this beauty together- the songs as well as the musical scores are catchy, beautifully composed and thoroughly breathtaking. The story has not been 'dumbed down' or watered down. It is accessible to children without alienating other generations and it humanises the characters wonderfully. The only thing in the entire film I found difficult was the pronunciation of Aaron's name- but that is obviously minor, it just took me a while to 'get' if that makes sense.<br /><br />It's amazing, beautiful wonderful the art, music and sheer intelligence of the story will blow you away.
