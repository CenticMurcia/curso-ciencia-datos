We rented Vulgar after seeing the trailer. The trailer promised a sardonic View Askew property. It looked like it was going to be tragicomic, but fun. Lighthearted. Maybe a little like DEATH TO SMOOCHY meets Jay and Silent Bob... Jason Mewes was in the trailer, we thought he was gonna have a significant role. But - Jason Mewes is basically a speaking extra... its just a little cameo for him... and oh what a shock, this film is brutal, gritty, intense...<br /><br />Even the many reviews here liken the film more to the temperament of Tarantino rather than Kevin Smith - who has a gentle edge at the end of the day.<br /><br />We sat through it, feeling utterly unclean. I had to fast forward through the really violent parts, I could only really watch a little of them, they were really harrowing. Not my cuppa joe.<br /><br />It was intense, but the redemption was dishonest and spotty, and I am not sure what the final message is meant to convey. We feel a little ripped off because the trailer really set us up to expect something else. <br /><br />Bryan Johnson and Brian O'Halloran are better together than any of these other reviews give them credit of. They have good chemistry and I'd like to see them buddy up again in a more mainstream storyline.<br /><br />I don't feel like our watching this film was a complete waste of time, but I'm really wondering how we managed not to turn it off before the bitter end, especially since the ending was not exactly satisfying.<br /><br />One last comment, the film really stirs people up. Scroll through these comments, I've never seen such a load of really verbose comments. Ever.
