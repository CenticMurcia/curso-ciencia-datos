How strange that this Pro-Serb melodrama and the over the top Saving Private Ryan, are held up as the two great 1990's films about war. Where was everyone when Welcome To Sarajevo and The Thin Red Line were on?<br /><br />The basic theme of this film seems to be that both sides in a war do evil things. I'm sure that's true, but don't make me sit through a film about 'evil Jews' during WW2. I ain't buying it. Why didn't this film give us a glimpse of a Serb run death camp, where thousands of Bosnian civilians were tortured and killed? We saw it on the TV news. Are we now asked to ignore it because Serb civilians have also suffered?<br /><br />As a flip-side to this rubbish, check out Michael Winterbottom's brilliant film 'Welcome To Sarajevo.'<br /><br />
