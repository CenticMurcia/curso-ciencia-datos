This movie sets a new definition of the terms "boring". Somehow, I guess this movie was meant to be clever and refreshing, but the implementation leaves so much to be desired that this movie ends up being a two-hour sleep-inducing affair. <br /><br />Basically, it consists of two parts, a modern-day part and a historical part, set in the 19th century. The 19th century part shows promise and actually gives a pretty interesting view of how a mysterious double murder took place, but ultimately it's underdeveloped and a bit boring.<br /><br />However, compared to the modern-day part, the 19th century part is Oscar material. The modern-day part seems to rely on one thing only: Liz Hurley's breasts. Now you won't hear me complain about that, but if that's all there is, then you just don't have much of a movie. Seriously, the modern-day part is filled with endlessly drawn out unnecessary shots and quasi-philosophical nonsense conversations. What's missing is an actual storyline, and it hurts. <br /><br />All in all, this movie is more boring than anything. Any parallels or deeper meaning get hopelessly lost under a sluggish pace and overly dramatic dialogue. Definitely not recommended.<br /><br />*1/2 out of **** stars
