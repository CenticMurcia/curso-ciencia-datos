i just watched this movie, and it was awesome. i thought it was very realistic, especially how the characters were portrayed. i think it would have sucked to have been in Roger Maris' shoes at times. he really had it bad that season from the fans and the press. this movie was really cool. i don't know if i am the only one, but i started to cry at the end, seeing mark mcgwire get choked up talking to the press about number 62. great movie, please check it out.
