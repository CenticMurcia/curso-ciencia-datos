Very possibly one of the funniest movies in the world, but probably not Oscar material, since Borat, Monty Python, Eddie Murphy, and the like will never sniff site of such honors.<br /><br />Trey Parker and Matt Stone are hilarious and before you see this film I suggest you see "South Park" and maybe even Borat, two of the funniest movies ever created. Now you're mindset will be ready for "?". Buy the 2 DVD and CD set on Amazon if you can, but rent it if you must. You will laugh every time you see it. "Pure" stroke of genius.<br /><br />If you don't think its funny then you have no soul, don't like off-the-wall humor, or are incapable of laughing because of too much botox. Not perfect, but awesome, even for you ladies out there who don't like weird and different films.
