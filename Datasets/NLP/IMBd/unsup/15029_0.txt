A guy with a shady past goes on a "graduation" trip with his friends. There's a killer in the woods and picks them off one by one and blah blah blah. Surprisingly minimal amount of gore, NO suspense (hint to whoever came up with the spoiler heavy play on words title, you stink!!), and the film's 90 minute running time is endlessly crammed with unneeded filler. The acting is horrible, the end reveal that you know is coming STILL doesn't make a lick of sense when it finally happens. In conclusion, my eyes have seen a glimpse of hell, thy name is "Adam and Evil" <br /><br />Eye Candy: Allison Warnyca as the sheriff's wife gets topless <br /><br />My Grade: F <br /><br />Where i saw it: Starz on Demand (available till September 15th, 2005)
