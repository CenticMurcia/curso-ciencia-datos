Short review for an undeserving film...I'll try to write ten lines, but I am desperately trying to work out how on Earth to waste that much effort on this movie!<br /><br />This movie has it all. Bad CGI, bad screenplay, bad story, bad acting, bad dialog, bad characterisation. Generally bad but with a redeeming 'it's so bad it's good vibe'.<br /><br />Great for a comedown Sunday when you're brain is shot to bits, but that's it.<br /><br />Check out the polystyrene snow that seems to brain everyone every five minutes. Maybe it's so easy as they're brains are so weak and tiny.<br /><br />Ben
