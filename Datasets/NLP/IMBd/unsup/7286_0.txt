The first thing I asked myself when I walked out of the theater was: "What's with the silly hats?". It was of course afterwards that I realized that this question, however the most pertinent, was far from the only one I would ask myself that night.<br /><br />In fact, going trough all those questions, I came to realize that "The Brothers Bloom" did not make one iota of sense to me. And, what's worse, I wanted to make no further effort at all to try and understand the movie better - which is rather uncommon for me.<br /><br />throughout it's labyrinthian plot, this "conmovie" from beginning to end seems to be trying only one thing: to con it's way out of any form of explanation. In stead, the plot just keeps wiggling and wurming it's way to the most unsatisfying and enigmatic conclusion I saw in years.
