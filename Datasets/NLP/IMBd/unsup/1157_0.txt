Lau Ching-Wan continues to amaze me with his transformations into his character. This was a great acting vehicle for both Lau Ching-Wan and Tony Leung. The story was good, and the direction was tightly wound and suspenseful. Unfortunately, all the tension unravels into an extremely unsatisfying ending.
