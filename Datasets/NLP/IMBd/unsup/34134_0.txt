This is a very long Carol Burnett skit with Carol playing the role of Cathy an uptight 50's housewife who discovers that her husband Frank played by Tim Conway is a little light in the loafers. Soon Cathy finds comfort in the arms of her Negro handyman played by Harvey Korman. At first Cathy is spooked to find a Negro in her garden - in fact she is surprised at least THREE times to find a Negro in her garden. On a vacation in Miami - Frank falls head over heals for a pool boy played by Lyle Waggoner. Vicki Lawrence plays Eleanor - Cathy's nosy best friend. The laughs come hard and fast as Cathy and Frank struggle to make sense of their soap opera lives.
