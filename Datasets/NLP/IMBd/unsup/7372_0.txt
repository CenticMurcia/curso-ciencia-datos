Just saw this movie at The Garden State Film Festival in Asbury Park, New Jersey. I feel so lucky to have caught it. It is such a complete film. It has everything: young boys skipping school and getting into trouble, bullies, good guys, bad guys, handsome hero, car chase and more. The photography is great and all the stunts are real! The audience was cheering and clapping throughout the film. It's a masterpiece. It has a timeless quality about it. Classic movie score was perfect. This is a miracle movie that only cost $2,000,000 to make. I don't think another dollar could have made a better movie. In fact, I can't figure out how they did some of the stunts on that budget!
