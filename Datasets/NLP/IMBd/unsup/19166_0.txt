I watched this film the first time when I was 10 or something, but was falling in love with the film when I was 17. The same age of Knox Overstreet, Todd Anderson, and other guys in the movie.<br /><br />"Dead Poets Society" talks about the lives of the students in the "Welton Academy", an elite prep-school preparing the students to ivy league school. These students were brought up in a strict and mainstream families.<br /><br />All unexpectedly, the students are exposed to Mr. Keating, an English teacher whose will change their lives through "free-will" thinking.<br /><br />One of the best film of all time!
