It lists "A Clay Brothers Film" as if that will mean something. Who you may ask are the Clay Brothers? I'm not sure. One, the co director and star John Will Clay was, according to IMDb a volleyball coach in a Hannah Montana movie, a Sailor in Deja Vu and an uncredited groomsman in Elizabethtown. His brother's credits seem to be only this movie. Neither their credits not this film make me think that they'll be the next big thing anytime soon.<br /><br />The plot of the film has a computer programmer getting the code key for a prototype weapon that was stolen by terrorists. The terrorists need the key to set off the weapon and so the chase is on.<br /><br />Low budget film might have been something had the script been better, the directing more imaginative and the performances better modulated. The film is such that it looks good and actually reasonably professional (and trust me I've seen a great deal of bad looking films lately) but there is no clear indication as to whether the film is serious or not. Take for example the scene where star John Clay is grilled by a policeman after bringing someone to the hospital. The dialog is incredibly silly in that its of the Dragnet just the facts style of writing. Adding insult to injury is the performance of the actor playing the cop who seems to be mugging to the camera. Clay isn't much better since he seems to be reacting to a scene that is playing in his head and not what is going on in front of him. I wasn't sure if I was suppose to laugh or feel tension Actually I did neither and reached for the remote in anticipation of needing it for a rapid exit. This is just a silly movie. (Its also a film that feels like its a glorified home movie with all the friends and family being brought in to be part of it).<br /><br />Its a mess.<br /><br />To be honest I think the heading over the title should be changed from "A Clay Brothers Film" to "THE Clay Brothers Film" since I'm not sure that there will be another.
