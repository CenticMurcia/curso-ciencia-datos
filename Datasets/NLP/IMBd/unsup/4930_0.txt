I saw this series on the A&E channel when high quality films were the norm for this cable network. This series follows the lives of women captured in Malaysia during the Japanese invasion and the difficulty they endured. It is 10 episodes long but each is riveting and excellent source of the history of WWII in this arena. These were plum roles for each actress and I am sure the series affected each of them as well. This is not front line fighting but what happens to people surrounded by war and how they cope to survive and keep their spirit intact. Another excellent source of the plight of women captured in Malaysia during WWII is the film "A town like Alice" based on a novel by Nevil Shute. Bryan Brown was in this film and takes you from the Malaysia arena and hardships, to Australia in the years after the war. Excellent film and actors as well.
