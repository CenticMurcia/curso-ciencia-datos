What a fine and refreshing movie. But there is more to it than this. It is a well-made film about a very common and credible situation. It shows us both sides of an ending affair and makes you feel sympathy for each character. Only two players, Salma Hayek and Russell Crowe, to play the game and carry the story to the end. They do well.<br /><br />The story doesn't go on straight. There are twists in the presentation, cuttings, slow-motion - movie-stills, split-screens, showing off a lot of the pinches of film-making. None of this ever going heavy. It all just fits in, and I like it. Enjoy it. I will again.
