Do not bother wasting your time or money on this product it really is appalling the plot is cumbersome and confused and the acting is diabolical.Its an attempt to get good actors together with a crap script and try to make it funny well I am sorry but this just isn't possible. The film transcends into ridiculous cameo performances but fails to make them spark the film into life how they managed to get so many comic actors on board with this script is beyond me because quite frankly the film is just not funny. Its a tired story anyway which has been done many times before and surely better though I haven't watched this type of film as I know what it is going to be like boring and unfunny.
