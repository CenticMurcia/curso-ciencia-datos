Story about two young men in England--Philip (Angus Macfayden) and Eliot (Corey Parker)--falling in love. Philip tells his parents--his mother thinks it's a disaster--his father (Brian Cox) remains strangely quiet. It turns out HE'S gay too and his sons coming out is forcing him into a decision.<br /><br />Low-key drama. I caught it on PBS (slightly edited) and then saw it complete on VHS in the early 1990s. I liked it but can't say I was too impressed. For starters the low-key aspect of the story was TOO low-key. Everything seemed muted. Macfayden and Parker were (surprisingly) terrible in their roles. I never believed these guys even liked each other, let alone love each other. So a crucial turn halfway through didn't carry the emotional weight it should have. The happy ending all around seemed too pat for me also.<br /><br />Still it was brave to make a movie like this back in 1991 AND get it distributed. It was well-directed and well-written. Also Cox was excellent in his role. So, it IS interesting in terms of gay cinema--it portrays gay men in a realistic manner (especially having hunky, masculine Macfayden play one) but it just doesn't come across strongly enough. Worth a viewing but don't go out of your way.
