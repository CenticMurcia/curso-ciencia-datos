I have read "In the eye of the storm", John Groberg's book about his mission to Tonga from which this movie was taken. Although, as is almost invariably the case, the book surpasses the movie in almost every important detail, "The other side of heaven" was nevertheless an enjoyable movie that was well made, with a good cast and outstanding scenery and effects.<br /><br />In most respects, the movie was quite faithful to the book, and the only knock I have is that it seemed to shy away from anything that could not be explained in a worldly way. Although people who are not members of the Church of Jesus Christ of latter-day Saints might be sceptical of the ability of a missionary to heal the sick, I think that it is important to depict a true story in its truest form, and John Groberg truly worked miracles in Tonga. I think that the majority of believers in the world (and most critics seem not to be!) believe in miracles, whether they be through a young mormon missionary or any other faithful follower of God, and I think this would have only enhanced the story. Granted, since Hollywood was funding it, they probably have a different opinion then I do! One notable exception in the movie was when he was sinking in the water after they jumped form the boat in the storm, and it seemed that a hand came and pulled him up, but no one was there. Although it was not clearly stated, I think they were insinuating that the Lord was helping him, and it was nice to see they didn't ignore that aspect altogether.<br /><br />Anyway, aside from all of that, it was an enjoyable movie that I think the whole family can watch and marvel at the difficulties people can face, and overcome, in their lives if they have the courage to try.
