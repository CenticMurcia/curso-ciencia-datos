By following the landmark first gay marriages of Massachusettes during which amendments were immediately being proposed to ban the practice, the film "Saving Marriage" literally takes the audience on a roller-coaster of emotions as politicians and people who want their equal rights battle it out in the legislative halls. This film is for everyone--for or against same sex marriage--because it is a ringside view into how banning together for a passionate cause can change laws, and how ordinary Americans can participate in politics that change lives.<br /><br />The film is extremely moving, educational, inspirational, heartbreaking...Where is the DVD? This film should be in all libraries, all classrooms and all state and federal elected offices.
