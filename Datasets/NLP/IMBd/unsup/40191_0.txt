Maybe it's because I just recently got into Indian soap operas. Or maybe it's because I am comparing to the other domestic and foreign shows/movies that I've seen over the years. Kasamh Se has to be one of the most frustrating and painful series I've sat through. Most of the time characters seem to be mute and unable to express themselves at times of relevance. People reveal their thoughts aloud when alone just for the camera. I understand wanting the audience to know what's going on, but if the writer/director/producer is looking for realism, they should consider how often they speak monologues to themselves in their lives. And to politely end my tirade, the one thing that annoys me more than the rest is how the show really takes only 10 minutes while the rest of the show just keeps cutting to characters faces repeatedly during seemingly tense moments. While the plot is possibly believable, I think a 15 year old could come up with more content for a 1/2 hour show.
