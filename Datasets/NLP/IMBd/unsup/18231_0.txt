For a television movie that set up a series afterward, Battlestar Galactica was really very entertaining. There is no doubt at all that it is a no-holds barred knock-off of Star Wars. nonetheless it has an interesting plot, enjoyable characters played by enjoyable if not great actors, some top-notch special effects for its day(and some truly horrendous ones as well), and a great score. A war between robots and humans breaks out as a human betrays his people for power. Soon the survivors of a vanquished group of human colonies make their way back to Earth to find their "mythical" sister in race. Lorne Greene plays the chief leader wonderfully and his role gives this film much of its credibility. Actors Richard Hatch and Dirk Benedict are playfully acceptable and we get the likes of ray Milland, Lew Ayres, Patrick Macnee(voice very menacing), the always affable Wilfred Hyde-White, Terry Carter, and others who all enhance this production. The film end so a series can take off and though I watched it as a kid I don't remember that all that well. It appears I am not missing much. This tele-film; however, is generally well-made and very fun to sit back and enjoy. There are some detractors of course like some corny situations, dialog, and characters. The boy with the robot dog is so nauseatingly unpleasant.
