For those of you that like the amount of cruelty and bloodshed in Lady Vengeance, this film will seem subtle.<br /><br />The acting of the female lead is convincing enough to warrant the 106 minutes of it.<br /><br />At first, the movie seemingly revolves around a young woman who kills mercilessly for justice. However, as the story continues, her actions became methodical and preempted. Only at the very end of the story do we actually get to know the angst, grief and pain that forced her into such a state of mind.<br /><br />This movie, although Korean, also reflects on the other Asian societies where wealth, materialism and self-centredness are overshadowing the importance of kindness and virtue.
