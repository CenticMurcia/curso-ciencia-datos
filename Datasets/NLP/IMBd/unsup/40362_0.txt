this show is very disappointing, and oh so predictable. overall, it has a good premise, i mean who doesn't love shows about sexy vampires and forbidden romance? but lifetime has found a way to butcher it. each episode is formulaic, and the writing, special effects, and acting are all lacking. also, the show lacks any originality. maybe this show could have been less generic if it were on another network.<br /><br />in each episode you can guess the conclusion of the episode within the first five minutes. and there's never any suspense. you always know everything is going to end up well for the characters. the Coreen character (Gina Holden) is completely ridiculous. she's into the supernatural, so she basically wears Halloween costumes in everyday life. give me a break. Dylan Neal as Det. Mike is completely lame. having to watch him on screen makes me want to claw at my arm. Christina Cox as heroine Vicki is also lacking. there is nothing special about her performance, so it makes it hard to believe two guys are fighting over her. The "love triangle" is very UNconvincing.<br /><br />the show is on lifetime, and it's soapy so it has its addictive qualities, which might make viewers return. But, the best thing about the show would have to be the Henry Fitzroy character played by Kyle Schmid. he brings a lively energy and a real presence to his role. his scenes are the most entertaining to watch.<br /><br />to some up, this show is so totally unbelievable and torturous to watch, and not because of the vampires and voo-doo zombies. (although that whole "bad juju" episode was sooo bad and contrived it made me want to through my TV out of a window). unless you have a lot of free time, u shouldn't waste it watching this show.
