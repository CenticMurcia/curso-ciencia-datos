CHET, played by bill paxton in a career starting role, is awesome. chet rules! he is the best part of the movie, and without him there is nothing to go on and it's a weak bratpack john hughes movie. the premise is interesting and fun to watch but it's sloppily done. i like that david lee roth had a part in making the girl's personality. i wish she'd have taken over the band instead of sammy 'mediocre' hagar. she is pretty (was?) but she's very annoying and her jaggerish lips get in the way when she talks and that accent is so thick. anthony michael hall is good but the story doesnt hold him up. i liked seeing robert downey jr. he is cool but looked too goofy for a bully; i think he walked off the set of 'back to school' and didnt change his clothes; or rather vice versa. there's a part in the movie where some bikers ride into the house of hall's buddy during a party and it's very dumb. the iatolla of rockinrolla from 'road warrior' (a movie that i refuse to rewatch because the dog dies) is in it and anthony hall and his buddy must fight them to be popular. but this is after the party is already destroyed by a giant atom bomb growing from the earth up into the house. dumb. but bill paxton is great especially when he is pointing his rife at anthony m. hall and his pretty blonde girlfriend, and he bangs hall's head with the nozzle and then bangs the girl in the head. we all want to be mean to hot chicks (out of our reach) and we can all relate to chet's character in a way, atleast we crazy, lonely, 80's reject people can...
