Romantic dramas tend to be very long and kinda dull. I came across the outlines, which was basically : "someone time travels unwillingly and the movie focuses on the effects it has one his daily life and relationship with his wife". This sounded so weird that I just had to see it.<br /><br />The story is so heartfelt and touching with it's realism in the odd plot of Henry time traveling. The strong and sensitive Henry and his dreamy, artistic wife are both played perfectly.<br /><br />What really took me away is that you don't really get to see much of Henry's time traveling. It's hardly even important where he goes, and I'm sure he most have experienced a bunch of stuff that would make for some action-packed breaks in the movie. But they're not included as they're not important to Henry's world and the core story: the relationship and Henry's family life. Time travel is such a huge plot to put in a movie, but they've managed to keep it as a mere side dish. Brilliant!<br /><br />Watch this if you feel emotional and/or need to have a little cry.
