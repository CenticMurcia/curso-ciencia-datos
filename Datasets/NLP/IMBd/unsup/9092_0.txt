It certainly lacks a certain rhythm, that I was tempted to compare to Wong Kar Wai's In the Mood for... but it still is an undeniably good movie ! I loved the costumes, the settings. Everything seems so accurate, it is always a pleasure with movies depicting the thirties... The actress wears these awesome dresses that I would love to have for myself, and Tony Leung is such a great actor ! I know it's a real pain, but I still have to write 4 lines of this comment for it to be submittable. I could add that the music, composed by a french composer is beautiful. It reminded me a lot of Michael Nyman's and Philipp Glass' for other movies, very voluptuous. But still I think there was something not very 'palpitant' about the movie: a certain slowness, a lack of suspense -I think- that I missed.
