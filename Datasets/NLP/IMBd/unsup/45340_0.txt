For every positive review I read for this film, I read at least two negative reviews for this film. I was extremely excited when my girlfriend pointed this movie out to me, but I couldn't find it to rent, so I had to buy it in order to watch it. Of course I was not confident because of the reviews I read prior to buying it, but I thought it would be better to have an open mind and decide for myself if "The Zombie Diaries" was good or bad. Because I really, really enjoy zombie films, it saddens me to say that all of those negative reviews were right, "The Zombie Diaries" was really bad. But make up your own mind and watch "The Zombie Diaries" for yourself. Just know you have been warned.
