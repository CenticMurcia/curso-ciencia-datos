This movie contains so much surralistic humor, so it stands for itself! The song about Chester is so funny, that there's almost no need to mention Fields' trembling voice when he's singing the song without any voice ("You know, we can't get any ipecac up in this part of the country."). The scenes where a "regiseur" throws corn-flakes into his face ("Tastes more like corn-flakes.") when he says the classic: "And it ain't a fit night out for man nor beast" and at the end of the movie don't throw any corn-flakes. It's so funny! For you fellas and girls: Don't let ya' temptations lead you to the big city, 'cause it surely will get you to "sell them bonds".
