I am not sure if this is a spoiler just my opinion. I find her dreadful and dramatic as a judge. Granted, the burlesque dancer should not have through to the top ten on Aug. 2 but when I saw Brandy be so rude to her I got mad. Some music videos are more sexual and I am sure Brandy has made a song or two and acted sexy on stage. Give me a Break!!!!!!! Then, I see these kids cover their eyes. Most kids watch far worse in the video games and the violence in movies they watch. This was just hypocrisy at its finest. I think Simon Cowell would have been far better bringing over X Factor to America than starting this show.... it is about real talent of all ages where a rapping Granny would never be in a grand finale.
