Bulworth was the most under-rated movie of 1998. Beatty- who I don't usually like-- showed both comic and dramatic flair in this film. I have seen it 3 times and each time I watch it I appreciate the brutal honesty of it all. Except for the romance being unlikely, the rest of the movie is well done- his staff is played to the hilt- including their duplicity when things start working. Beatty should have received a nomination for something- screenplay or best actor. This is a film that shows what hypocrites rich people are the true divisions is rich against the poor not the blacks against the whites.
