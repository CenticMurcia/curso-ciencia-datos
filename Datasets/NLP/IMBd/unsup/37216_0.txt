College student members of the "dare club" break into an abandoned asylum to have a scavenger hunt using their own underwear. No one has as much as a backpack on them, but suddenly about five thousand candles appear all over the house to illuminate their fun and games and right when you get into double digits counting the fake slap-on-the-shoulder scares, a psycho pops up to plant lethal booby traps everywhere.<br /><br />**SPOILERS** (If you've never seen a horror film before)<br /><br />The victims turn out to be the children of lynch mob members who hung a man outside the asylum 15 years earlier, who've been lured there and trapped inside. Meanwhile, name value stars Corbin Bernsen and Dee Wallace Stone sit around a lot and talk about the deed to the place, the murder and other things. Attempts at characterization include a black guy who dies first and a sexy/tough lesbian who masturbates while watching another couple have kinky sex through one-way glass.<br /><br />One interesting touch has all the women outliving the men, but that's probably only because they're slightly better actors and willing to go topless once in awhile to relieve several boring stretches where nothing of plot relevance is happening. I give this film a little credit because it DOES pick up a bit by the end, but otherwise it's typical slasher nonsense, done with little creativity and flair.
