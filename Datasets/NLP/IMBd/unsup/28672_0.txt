What can I say? While I was complaining about the factual errors in a movie, a wise man (Vance) once told me "Suspend your disillusion!" Even though this "Ham" in the Swiss Alps is trying to talk on 80M with a parabolic dish, I gotta admit, this _is_ a kinda neat movie. I felt good to watch this, but rather than the plot generating this fuzzy feeling, it's probably really just brought on by the memories of watching B-movies at 4AM after a good night out. My sweetheart did get to jump once, and I must admit the suspense rivals that of most of the muck in the so-called action films released in the theaters every weekend. This movie isn't DVD worthy, but neither does it belong next to TRON (in file 13, or the round file.) I'm going to put it on my shelf next to the WarGames and Sneakers VHS tapes, to be watched over and over as I dream of a hackers ideal...
