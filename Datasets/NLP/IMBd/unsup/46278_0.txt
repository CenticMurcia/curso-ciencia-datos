I was in this movie. Nothing big, just ran out of a van and up some steps and that's it. A friend of mine was in a few scenes too (trips up the main character during class I think). I remember being pulled out of class and sent down to an area where many kids were lined up to see if they'd get a part. They filmed, what I guess was the city public school scenes, at my school; Alexandria Primary School in Sydney.<br /><br />I can't remember much of the movie. I think a number of us went to see a screening of it over in North Sydney. We had an introduction from the cast & crew but that's about all I remember. Oh, and the "food & drink" they put on for us consisted of a paper cup of candy popcorn & a cup of lemonade. Ritzy! Still, it got me out of quite of bit of school that day, earned me $50 and each take of my scene (and there were a few) I had to eat an Ã©clair. Not bad.
