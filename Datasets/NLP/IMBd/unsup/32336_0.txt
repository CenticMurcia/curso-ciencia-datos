i saw this film today at the gay film festival in Sana Francisco. maybe the shaman smelled the soldier and fell in love with his dreams so he became what the soldier wanted so much to love, a boy, a sweet simple boy. a boy who would sing a silly love song to him, a boy who would wear his uniform, a boy would would kiss his hand BACK, a boy who would write back I LIKE YOU TOO. but because he wasn't a boy he had to leave. waiting in the jungle wondering and suffering WILL MY LOVE COME. the monkey was our guide and told the soldier the truth. the soldier was afraid tried to hide and run away; wouldn't it be so much easier to TRY and love like he had before instead of facing his love face to face. but he did, that look between the soldier and the tiger was LOVE
