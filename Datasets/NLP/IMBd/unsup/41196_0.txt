I got this movie in a boxed set from Troma studios. I figured that from the title "Demented Death Farm Massacre: The movie", it would at least be fun to make fun of. But this movie is so bad, it doesn't even fall into the category of the "So bad it's good" type of movie.<br /><br />The characters and writing are boring, with not much going on. At first I thought it might be a comedy, since the characters are written in such broad terms. But no, to my unhappy surprise, this movie is not meant as a comedy. At least, if it IS a comedy, there are no laughs in it.<br /><br />So then I went to idea "B" - that the movie was just a really bad drama. No luck there, since a drama would require some form of plot. This doesn't seem to have one. Oh, it starts out well enough, setting up a group that COULD have possibilities. But they are never really explored, so that idea falls through.<br /><br />Since I couldn't find any way to truly enjoy this movie, I would have given it a "1". The reason it got a "2" out of me was the fact that, unlike many other Troma releases, it was at least well lighted. So, even though you won't want to watch it, you could at least see the action.
