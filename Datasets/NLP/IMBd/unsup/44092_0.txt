The Andromeda Strain is my all time favorite movie and the first time I saw it I was about fifteen and was awed! I actually thought the movie was based on actual events. I've watched the original so many times, I can see it in my head from beginning to end. I eventually bought the book and read it without putting it down. There were a lot of differences between the movie and the book, but it wasn't deviated from too much to spoil either one. The original movie was suspenseful without being over done. Dramatic enough without being sappy. I always believed the ending could have been different, but it still left you with the sense that it was far from over. I always imagined The Andromeda Strain being remade, but with actors I could recognize. From watching the trailer, I could see no familiar cast member that made me want to watch it. I didn't watch the movie so I can't really vote on it fairly, and from reading some of the comments,I probably won't be at a loss! So I'll vote awful simply because I'm afraid they've messed up a great book! Thanks, but I think I'll pass.
