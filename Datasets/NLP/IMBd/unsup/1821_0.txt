This simple, sensitively handled love story with a WWII background is often bundled together with Mikhail Kalatozov's THE CRANES ARE FLYING (1957) - they were both issued simultaneously on R1 DVD by Criterion and will likewise be issued on R2 by Nouveaux Pictures next January - but actually they are poles apart in terms of stylistic approach. Director Chukhrai shows little of the overpoweringly visual virtuosity of Kalatozov's film (except for the superb sequence near the beginning which earns the main character his heroic status) preferring to capture the reality of the scene rather than its emotional core.<br /><br />Even so, BALLAD OF A SOLDIER is a beautifully made film with winning performances from its youthful leads: a 19-year old boy who wins a much-coveted 6-day leave from the front after blowing up two enemy tanks single-handedly and the suspicious waif he befriends (and subsequently falls in love with) on his clandestine train journey. Events beyond his control contrive to make his visit to his farm-laborer mother a pitifully short one after which, the unidentified narrator tells us, he is once again drafted off to the front to his eventual death (which we never actually see); his misadventures during that train journey and visit to his village take up the bulk of the film as he meets a one-legged soldier coming reluctantly back home to his wife, a greedy train guard who is constantly demanding food from the soldier as a bribe against his telling his superiors that they are stowaways, the duplicitous wife of a comrade of his and his bed-ridden, ever optimistic father, etc.
