<br /><br />This movie is absolutely nothing like the first one. Bateman is gone, and instead of a main character living in a complicated, fractured, psychotic world, we have one who is merely ambitious and kills people. She never really seems crazy. Or evil. Or believable, really. <br /><br />William Shatner does a typical job as the professor she's stalking.<br /><br />Every character in this movie was trite and done to death. There wasn't a single scene that had any originality or edge. A sad, sad legacy for a very interesting first movie.<br /><br />2 out of 10.<br /><br />
