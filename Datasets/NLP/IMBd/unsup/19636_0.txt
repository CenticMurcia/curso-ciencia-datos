This might not be the greatest story ever told, but who cares if Salma Hayek is in it?! (...and wearing practically nothing throughout the whole film!) Same old story: Police officer (Harrelson) is hunting thieves (Hayek and Brosnan). They develop some kind of relationship. He never managed to catch them and now they are retired. But will they come back for one last job... and can he catch them this time?!<br /><br />Well, to be honest, it isn't actually that bad. I was expecting worse! There are a couple of nice jokes and really beautiful locations in this movie...! <br /><br />I recommend: If you have a jealous girlfriend, better watch this movie on your own. Unless she likes Pierce or Woody... then it's even and all can be happy! ;)
