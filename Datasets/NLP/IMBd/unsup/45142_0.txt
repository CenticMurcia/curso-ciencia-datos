I greatly enjoyed Eat, Drink, Man, Woman. I found Tortilla Soup a failed attempt to adapt this film to a different audience. First off, I think the plot development is hinged on the relationship between the father and the daughters. However, it is important to note that this dynamic that drives the conflict and action is not so easily found in Latin-American culture as it has been (re)established in LA. With the Asian family in Asia, the father-dauthers dynamic was on the money. The new cultural paradigm for Tortilla Soup simply lacks that essential element. From this, the development of the film is beyond the realm of belief. Adding to my disappointment, was the discovery that the scripts for Eat, Drink, Man, Woman and Tortilla Soup are practically identical. The variations are few and far between, and I think the duo that put in such hard work scripting this film should have stuck to their Asian success.
