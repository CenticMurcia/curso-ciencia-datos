Make no mistake about it, Belgium is a country whose cinema is to be reckoned with. They are perfectly able to turn out some edgy psychological dramas ('De Zaak Alzeimers',or as it's known in this country,'Mind Of A Killer'),as well as some silly,surreal comedy's (as in the case of this film). The Iceberg is one of those films in the later category. The story concerns a middle aged housewife in Brussels, who accidentally gets locked in a meat locker in the local fast food take away where she manages,has a traumatic experience as a result of it, and ends up leaving her family to take up in a quirky seaside village in (one supposes)Scotland. What happens from there has to be seen to be believed. Slapstick comedy occasionally ensues this candy coloured gem of a film. I know I certainly walked out feeling good about myself. You'll have to keep your eyes opened,as this film probably won't play out at many cinemas (and as far as I know, no American standard DVD exists as of yet,despite the fact that the film was released in 2005).
