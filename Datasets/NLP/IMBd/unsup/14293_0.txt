Some college kids accidentally unleash a sex demon and she ends up turning a frat party inside out.<br /><br />With awkward nudity scenes, this might not be a date movie but if your sitting at home I would watch it. The slasher sub-genre turned into a cult genre and became a guilty pleasure. This sub-genre hid in the darkness for almost half a decade. The slasher genre was dead by 1992 and FRATERNITY DEMON was just a maggot that didn't even enter the coffin. The plot involves devil invocation, possessions, kills, and sex with a demon. Well from the title and cover picture you can expect too much. The acting is so poor it makes Voodoo Academy seem like Gone With The Wind. Avoid this at every cost.<br /><br />Rated R for Nudity and Sexual Situations.
