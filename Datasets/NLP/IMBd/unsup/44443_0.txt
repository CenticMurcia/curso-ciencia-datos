The most exciting thing about this movie is the alligator boy and after that and before that, the movie is a completely boring and a major waste of time. I keep running into these movies where all these people do is smoke weed and laugh. These two boys go on a road trip and all they do is get high and pick up hookers. There is no real point to the movie expect that the one guy wanted to get away from having his feet broken. Then they get in the car and the two do some drugs and pick up some hitchhikers. That one guy looked a lot like Weird Al. I don't think that Weird Al would waste his time in a crappy movie. It had very very little to do with Kurt Cobain too even if the box said it did. This movie was a waste of time, I was bored and now I no longer care about it.
