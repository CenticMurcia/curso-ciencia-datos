I can only assume that other commentators saw a different take from the one now serving as my coffee-coaster.<br /><br />This movie is absolutely lamentable. Even now, I can still hardly believe how bad it really is. Created in Japan, it lacks any of the shocking or subtle nuances that we in the west take for granted. By any standard: script, photography, sound-effects, lighting, directing, set-pieces, dubbing; in any aspect of theatrical evaluation it is a disaster, a failed, amateurish disaster.<br /><br />Quite a collection of ageing Hollywood movie stalwarts generously put their reputations on the line in the name of international co-operation. Well; they made a mistake. I hope they got paid for their trouble. Or maybe they did it for charity; it certainly looks that way.<br /><br />The copy I bought was called 'The Director's Cut'. Believe me; the only cut he should have made was to his abdomen when he fell on his sword. If there are other variations, go for the one that is blank.<br /><br />For the uninitiated: a virus is traded by dubious individuals. They carry it in a light plane. The plane crashes, virus is released. It's an end-of-civilisation-as-we-know-it situation. To the everlasting relief of rational viewers, everyone begins to peg-out. They just don't do it quick enough. A small mixed group finish up ekeing-out an existence in some remote research station or other. There are not enough females to go round, etc.<br /><br />Don't expect any pocket philosophy. Don't expect any insightful commentary. Don't expect anything expect poor lighting, fractured continuity, amateurish dubbing, crap dialogue, etc, etc, etc. It seems rather telling that the only other commentator who levies the criticism it deserves, happens to be Japanese. He honourably apologises on behalf of his nation (and quite right, too). Perhaps everyone else is being diplomatically polite. <br /><br />I have awarded one star for the most preposterously hammy death - Robert Vaughan's, I think (oh-yes, he's in it) - ever seen on cinema. It could have come straight out of pantomime.<br /><br />This is my nomination for 'Worst Movie Ever Made'. Watch it for that reason only. But be warned; you might wish you'd caught the virus instead.<br /><br />Fukkatsu No Hi? I couldn't have put it better myself.
