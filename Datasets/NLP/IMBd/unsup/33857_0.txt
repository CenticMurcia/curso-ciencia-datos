This movie was the gayzor. It made me choke on stuff. I do know it was a student film, but it couldn't be any worse than if my cat directed it. The movie started off with a frat house with some awesome song playing. It kept switching from that scene over to some toy train coming close to the camera. It was quite absurd. Then it went to some stupid guys going to some house and they thought it was scary. This loser had to go into it to be accepted into their frat for asshole lickers. After the story, it went over to some crappy camera into this house of some losers and stuff was talked about. There was a director with 4 normal people who were supposed to be in a house that wasn't scary. Since it was a movie, the movie people wanted them to not know about the scary stuff so they would get quality acting. Then a guy and a girl went into the house as one guy and girl stayed outside with their horrible ad libbing skills. The movie crew found out that some scary stuff wasn't due to them and they ran away because a friend of theirs got cold. Then the guy who was outside went into the house and stayed in there for a while with some old man. Then they left. And for some reason after they all left the house, they all started dying for no reason whatsoever. The only parts that stood out was some guy saying "Be up in a minute!" and the night vision wind camera. I hate this movie and everyone who was in it. The only redeeming factor was the song called "Climbing up the stairs".
