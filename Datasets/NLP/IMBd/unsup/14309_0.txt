Everyone says this movie is bad because of the plot. In some ways it is recycled material, but then again many Disney movies have similar plots. The computer animated dinosaurs were fantastic. The animators paid attention to detail, and that's usually not a problem for Disney. The backgrounds were stunning too and in some parts the POV the animators gave you were fascinating (i.e. when we see the ptaradactl fly over the herd of dinos in the opening sequence). Is the plot taken for Land Before Time? Some parts seem so, but then the Land Before Time followed little child dinos and Dinosaur followed a herd of Dinosaurs.Their destination was basically the same place, but in many ways their journeys are so different. I liked the movie and I would recommend it. However it's not for little kids who don't like to see characters fighting and mild blood shed. All in all a good Disney movie. I have to give them credit it took them twelve years to make and a lot of effort! The best visually so far, but not the best plot ever. It would be better if you saw it on the big screen though. I give it an 8/10.
