The comment about the overall editing seems harsh. The first portion of the film is admittedly not the best editing, but after that it is bordering on great. One scene in particular is worth looking at again and again. The film has the feel of two different editors and in fact that is what happened. This film is one of my all time favourites. It evokes mood and place and emotion and passion and atmosphere. All the elements of exceptional visual story telling. The fact that it is based on a real man who followed a very disciplined life and belief system, and had the courage and desire to stand up to certain perils makes this film a standout on every level.
