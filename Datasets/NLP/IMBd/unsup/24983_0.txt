An early Mike Myers film, but I think better than the far more successful Austin Powers series, though not as good as Waynes World.<br /><br />Cameos are used to great effect in this scene. Phil Hartman gets only a couple of minutes screen time but his Alcatraz tour guide, Vicki, serves up a hilarious anecdote about Machine Gun Kelly and his romantic endeavours. Alan Arkin, Michael Richards and Charles Grodin also provide the laughs in their cameos.<br /><br />The plot is not the best, but it does not take from the gags which the film is really all about. In case you were worried Nancy Travis plays quite a straight character leaving the humour to Myers et al, which is for the best. Sorry Ms Travis.<br /><br />
