After hearing kudos about this show I started watching. And after episode 7 I gave up. This show is so bad that I cannot describe. First of all acting is terrible; sets are cheap like a B grade movie (how can you even think of making a show with this theme and not have a single decent special effect) and most of all, the plot is so unrealistic that its painful. It has so many logical holes that it really insults the intelligence of the viewers. I loved the idea which had so many potentials but realization is very poor. And this show doesn't get canned?!? (like The Nine, Vanished and Kidnapped - ten times better) Well I guess I am not a typical US viewer.
