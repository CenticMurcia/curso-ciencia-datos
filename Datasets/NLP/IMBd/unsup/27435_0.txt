There are virtually no redeeming features in this tedious piece of animation. The songs are awful, the vocal characterisations weak, the story confused, the dialogue puerile and the animation, at best, a pale imitation of Disney. The only thing that it has going for it is a plea for peace, which, given the year that it was made, was certainly timely.
