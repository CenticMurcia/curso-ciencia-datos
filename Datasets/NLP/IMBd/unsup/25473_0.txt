I am almost 100% sure this movie was created from a videogame with the same name. If you are into video games and like the classic point-and-click adventure style, you're gonna love this one. Definitly you need to see both (the video game and the movie) before you can tell anything about the movie. Of course, the story is a little different, but it is the same thing. Actually the name of the main guy is the same: MAX. The plot seems to be a cliche, but as the real story reveals, you find out it is not such a thing! Forget about the low budget. This movie is awesome. The music is great and certain scenes make you believe you are really in a sanitarium. After all what could you expect from a movie with such title? Just what it has: Confusion, darkness, suspense and chills. This movie has it all, so, from my perpective, the movie reaches its goals. I am sure it was created not to be a big time but to create discussion, and leave you with a taste in your mouth. What taste? That depends on you...
