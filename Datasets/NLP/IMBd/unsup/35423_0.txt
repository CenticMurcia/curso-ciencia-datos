This has got to be one of the worse action movies I have ever seen. The plot was as predictable as a '70's B-Flick and the actors were given absolutely nothing to work with in regards to plot.<br /><br />I was especially disappointed with Ice Cubes'(XXX/Darius Stone) over the top "rough neck" performance. I've seen his acting abilities in prior movies, and this role did him no justice.<br /><br />And I don't know what possessed Samuel L. Jackson (Agent Augustus Gibbons) to be a part of this ridiculous production. An actor of his caliber should be ashamed he ever set foot on the set of this disaster. This under-developed script left its' actors no choice but to perform badly. The characters were so two dimensional and used so many clich√©'s, I literally had to turn off the movie and return later when I could compose myself.<br /><br />Even the special effects were sub-standard. I mean, everyone knows when you have a horrible movie, the effects should serve as a happy distraction, but in this movie, they just blended in with the rest of this poorly developed plot. And did you see what XXX's love interest Nona Gaye (Lola Jackson), was wearing? Can somebody say X-Men reject? Funny, through out the entire duration of the move, her outfit never changed. Fascinating.<br /><br />This movie was hard to watch, but if you're looking for a laugh, take it home. Be sure you have a 6-pack on hand, cause your gonna need it.
