I liked this role for Hack. She needed to play it low speed because she did not trust people, and she did just that. The music was sensational and the concept of finding a love years later was very romantic. Hack has a wide range. There was also a good match of Hack as a college student (another actress) while in some films it is not believable at all. The California coastline is a great backdrop for this love story. You also get an inside view of the music jingle industry and that is a riot. I am a big Hack fan. She has a vivacity that shows through and that is refreshing to see. She plays an artist, and I understand she did her own painting for the role!
