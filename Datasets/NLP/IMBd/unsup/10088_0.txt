I can't believe that there are 10 people giving this c**p a 10. This is a very boring movie. This movie has the title vampire, so what would you expect: sharp teet, spooky eyes, good effects, gore and lots of blood. This movie has absolutely nothing of these things. If you wanne see this movie and your expecting something like "from dusk till dawn" or "near dark" or "the lost boys" -all fabulous vampire movies- then you'll be wrong and you will be watching a boring drama.
