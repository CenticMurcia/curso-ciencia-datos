With so few decent prime-time shows on regular networks- we can't let this one go! My husband and I have mostly just been hooked on HBO shows for years and only have 1-2 shows that we regularly watch on the non-cable channels (like the original CSI). Lipstick Jungle, while toned down from Sex and the City, is a great option for those of us missing that show. And it's actually much more realistic- more development on the careers and family issues. If you haven't watched, check out some of the full episodes on the internet- you'll see it's worth saving. And while I'm at it- My Own Worst Enemy is also VERY worth saving- already great and with lots of potential for future story line twists...
