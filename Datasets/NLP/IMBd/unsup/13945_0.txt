Just a hint for casual viewers, ignore Mr. Crook's synopsis of the battle, it could not be more incorrect. Bismarck was a full battleship and not commissioned until 1941. Gneisenau and Scharnhost were battle cruisers and much larger than the only actual pocket battleship he mentions, the Graf Spee (there were 2 other pocket battleships in the German fleet). <br /><br />The film itself is very much in the tradition of British war films, little Hollywood glitz but much more accurate than Hollywood's history films. Very much in the vein of Sink The Bismarck and well worth watching. Graf Spee was the most effective of the German surface raiders but it once again proved that the submarine was a much more cost effective way to destroy shipping.
