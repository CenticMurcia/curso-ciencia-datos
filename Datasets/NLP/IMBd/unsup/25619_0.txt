As my girlfriend summarized it, "well... thats an hour we won't ever get back" It wasn't "It's Pat" bad but you really did feel like you wasted your time.<br /><br />It was embarrassing it was so bad. I routinely felt my intelligence insulted and because they absolutely had to isolate California from the rest of the country they had to invent that dumb pink fog concept. Yeah I'd really like to see television and the internet work AT ALL without at least full country connectivity. Ridiculous.<br /><br />Soooo Soooooo bad. I haven't picked a film this bad to watch in a long long time.<br /><br />Lots of plots which had nothing to do with the film really, nothing really tied it together either. We just kept waiting for it to have some semblance of a plot, waiting for it to get better. It didn't.<br /><br />Looks like they had at least a modest budget, they even got Evie from the old 80s show "Out of This World" who touches the tips of her fingers together to make time stop. I'm sure she was happy to get the work.<br /><br />Honestly I blame the writers. They lacked decent writers. They lacked FUNNY writers. Of course funny comes at a luxury when you don't even really have a plot or cohesive story line.<br /><br />Couldn't drop this one in the mailbox fast enough to get my next netflix rental. what a waste of a perfectly good netflix rental.<br /><br />Oh and by the way, if you think I'm exaggerating - RENT IT YOURSELF.
