Now I'll admit I do enjoy this cheesy B grade sci-fi show, despite it's contrived happy endings and ridiculous character development. But the problem with this finale is that they take this production way too seriously culminating in a ridiculously bad, pretentious montage to a misplaced, overplayed classic rock song. This was such bad art it made me cringe to watch this sequence, and this music just totally didn't belong here. Clearly the writers and production staff are B grade too. We also got more typical bad makeup jobs of our main characters growing elderly in a time dilation field and putting on razzie worthy, tear jerking scenes of pretentious sentimentality. Thrown in is possibly the worst bit of dialog I've seen since the Star Wars Prequels where for some reason Daniel goes on a ridiculous rant rejecting Claudia Black's character's sexual advances towards him. Who on Earth wrote this scene? They have absolutely no understanding of what a man would do in such a situation. Daniel is supposed to be Nerdy, but Nerds aren't against sex, often it's all they think about (i.e Revenge of the Nerds.) Nerds are just socially awkward and don't know how approach women, often harboring secret fantasies of the woman being the aggressor.(i.e Crumb) When Daniel Jackson instead went to deliver an idiotic moralistic speech following Vala's come-on I was overwhelmed with shock just how bad this bit was and that the production staff previewed this yet still allowed it to air. You'll have to see this to believe it, one of the all time worst love scenes in the history of entertainment. Staggeringly bad it makes the dismal, contrived teen love affair in The Great Outdoors seem Oscar worthy in comparison. A truly disappointing finale to this series, the silly but fun "class reunion" episode a few weeks before would have made a better send off than this atrociously bad effort to produce "art".
