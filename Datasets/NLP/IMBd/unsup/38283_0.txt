This movie isn't the way it's poster shows, and I assure you that if you don't consider my comment as a friendly warning then you'll feel very sorry after or even before finishing this movie.<br /><br />Those who have written good comments about this movie doesn't know about the real sense of what is called a movie at all.<br /><br />Despite of it's cheapness, actors are so pathetic specially the children - They have successfully put this movie in entire mess from the very beginning. It has a very bad choreography, bad make-up, the brave uncle got a funny mustache that doesn't appear to be true. If you can't make it look real then why bother to have one? It was plainly better without it.<br /><br />This an ultimate insult to the audience.
