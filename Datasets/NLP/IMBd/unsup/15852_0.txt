I have never watched the TV series, so I am going in cold on this one. This is a thoroughly enjoyable early 70's British film about a teacher Mr. Hedges, played well by John Alderton, who takes his fifth form, lower middle class upbringing class to a rural center for two weeks. Part of the fun is waiting for this to happen, as you know things will go on once they're out of London. The best thing is, things do, but nothing lewd or purely criminal just fun. The movie keeps a good rhythm throughout and I felt no need to turn it off or do anything except watch and enjoy. I'm sure if you are a fan of the series you'll like this even more. For me, a novice, I still found it well worth watching. I think you will also.
