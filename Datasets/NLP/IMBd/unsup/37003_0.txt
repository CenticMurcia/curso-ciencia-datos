Voodoo and mad science experiments on a plantation in the 19th century. In the tale of two brothers and a mother running the plantation, the mother is of the opinion that the madness of the family should end with them. One son isn't certain and has sent for fianc√©. Gothic nonsense results. Woefully talky "horror film" plays like an Andy Milligan film on a bigger budget and with a better sense of framing a shot. The film looks good (even in the poor copy I saw) but outside of that this is a chore to get through. The plot is so all over the place that it becomes silly, especially with the twists that occur. The performances are equally uneven from fine to you must joking histrionics. Nothing compares to the endless inane dialog that just bores. Recommended only for insomniacs.
