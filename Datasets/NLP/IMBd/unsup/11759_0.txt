In the movie Beethoven's 2nd, it is a lot better than Beethoven. The characters were also great, especially Debi Mazar. In the scene where Regina parked her car, got out of it, and walked over to her ex-husband to get Missy from the park, I knew it was a woman and I also hoped that she wouldn't be as creepy as Shelley Winters was in the 1973 movie Cleopatra Jones. Fortunately, Debi Mazar does have a perfect skin color, hairdo, and a body shape than Shelley. But the color of her eyes were really creepy. Some the viewers brought up Cruella De Vil in this and by looking at the color of Regina's eyes, the viewers had a point based on the fact that she did one heck of an imitation of Cruella. She was cruel to Missy and her kids, she was using Missy just because she didn't want her divorce settlement to be worth peanuts without the dog, and based on the fact that she threatened to kill her babies, Missy should have bit Regina's rear, especially when Regina carried her away from her babies. Cruella De Vil is nothing but the devil and was just as slimy in the movie 102 Dalmatians than in 101 Dalmatians. Plus, Regina is just as slimy as Cruella. On top of that, when Regina wore all red, it made look more creepier than ever. But, her red outfit did look good when she fell in the mud along with Floyd. Red is not her color. As far as the character Regina, this is something to remember, "Missy is not an aggressive dog, but if you do anything to her kids, come over here so she can take a bite out of your rear." In the end, Regina got what deserved. I'm glad the judge turned down Regina's claim for the dog because she really didn't deserve Missy in the first place. You know what they say, "Justice always wins."
