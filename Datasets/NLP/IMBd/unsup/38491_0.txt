So as I suffer from insomnia and was perfectly willing to be subjected to the normal Sunday night/Monday morning line up B-rated porn on my local movie channel, imagine my surprise to a bunch zombie-ish children standing outside waiting an ice cream man, who couldn't be just some normal evil character, no, heaven forbid we do normal, it had to be a FROGGIN STUPID SCARY PSYCHO FLIPPIN CLOWN! Which then prompted and almost asleep insomniac to be awake for the next 4 hrs. F a bunch of this bull crap little episode. Stupid clowns need to rot in hell! It's not as if things such as IT aren't scary enough but you have make the ice cream a clown, seriously can we not think of something more standard, no we have strike fear into the heart of kids, by making something that should be nice and sweet into this psychopathic thing that eats kids! UNACCEPTABLE! Frickin Hate Clowns!
