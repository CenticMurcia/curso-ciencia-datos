one of the best no/low budget movies I've seen since clerks. its funny, witty, and very entertaining, will make you wish only one thing, that it was longer. Vince knew what he wanted when he made this movie and it'll leave you wanting more.. Kisses and Caroms is a story that i felt like i've lived too many times a girl trying to prove something to her man and it backfires, or does it?? guys don't know what they want until its too late and thats one of the premises of this flick.. love the billiards angle of the movie too, adds another bit of fun as well. also the sexiness of it sure did a lot to make me want to add this movie to my collection and watch it quite a bit. Quite a job was done in the casting process to make this movie what it has become, how vince got so many top quality actors in the flick is beyond me but you will be thankful for that fact. some movies you just never get tired of and you just feel the need to watch em over and over again, this is one of those movies.. don't miss out.. i promise you its worth every moment of your time.
