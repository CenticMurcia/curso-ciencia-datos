This movie was very cheesy. The movie opens with a scene where the president gets shot in the neck with a dart full of the Ebola virus. It was wicked lame; the sniper guy shoots the president from the second floor of a building across the street. There were 2 things really bad about that. First, the secret service would have noticed the barrel of a gun sticking out of a window. Second, the shooter was at such a close range that he didn't even need to use a sniper riffle. There were many holes in the plot also, like how did the orphan kid survive the Ebola virus in the first place, and why did that crazy doctor lady fake her death? Also there is the huge coincidence that the only person who survived the Ebola virus in Uganda (the orphan) who is also the only person whose blood can be used to make a cure, miraculously is at the hospital where the breakout of the virus occurs. The movie just ends too, there isn't a scene where it shows the antidote being made, all of a sudden everyone is just healed. Overall I thought that it was a terrible movie, although I did laugh at several different points because of it being so absurd.
