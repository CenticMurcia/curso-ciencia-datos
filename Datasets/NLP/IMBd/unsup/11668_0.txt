Quite simply put, one of the worst films I have ever had the misfortune to see. The "comedy" centers around the wacky misadventures of insane vigilante Dan Aykroyd and his next-door neighbor/World War II Nazi monster Jack Lemmon. Ha. Ha. Avoid at all costs, especially to escape the horror of the most uncomfortable simulated sex scene ever captured on film (a truly horrific extended sequence between Lily Tomlin (!) and Aykroyd). The only humor provided in the entire movie is by Bonnie Hunt, via one funny line which I believe she improvised (see IMDb quotes). Trust me: you absolutely want to get as far away from "Getting Away with Murder" as possible.
