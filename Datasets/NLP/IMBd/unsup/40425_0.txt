***Spoiler Alert***<br /><br />This movie sucked. Zach Ward was terrible at times, OK at other times, but Tony Daly was just awful. He reminded me of Ben Affleck, but I think I would have rather seen Affleck than him. Let me repeat that: I would have rather seen Been Affleck in this movie than Zack Ward. <br /><br />The "movie within a movie" premise has been done before and much better. LA Twister's novel approach was to have the movie they characters are making be exactly the same as the one we're watching, and both movies sucked. <br /><br />The characters were ridiculously stupid and naive. Even after "Scotty Farkus" had been burned hard by a casting agent he still believed that a shady guy from "back East" was going to fund their movie and were shocked when it turned out he was just snowing them. <br /><br />Did I mention this movie sucked?
