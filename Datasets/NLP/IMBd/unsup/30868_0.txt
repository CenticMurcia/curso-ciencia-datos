I am not an Adam Sandler fun, but I appreciate his work when he do something good. This movie is a "it could be good, if they intended to made a trash movie" movie.<br /><br />The end of the movie is not enough to save a disastrous work that aimed to be funny, its just boring. his super commando jokes, outdated disco fewer all the crap in the movie made itself boring. Showing an ass frequently is not so funny, as mentioned in "Idiocracy", making a movie about an ass does not fit a person capable of to do better, like Adam Sandler is ridiculous. Oh I forgot to mention, he can do many things with his ass, real talent.<br /><br />Not for me, not for sane people. Save your time, save your money.
