I have no idea whose brilliant idea it was to make this movie. There's almost no action, no plot, and no point to it. As others have stated, even the MST3K-enhanced version of this movie is terrible. I heard Universal actually sold this movie to another company. It's not hard to see why.<br /><br />The Creepers' acting is horrible in the movie and so is everyone else for that matter. Pass the movie up if you see it somewhere, you will be bored to death if you don't!
