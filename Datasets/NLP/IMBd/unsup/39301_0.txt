Even the bloopers were boring. These movies show that Tim Allen's 15 minutes of fame are over. It seems that for my review to be accepted at IMDb I must have at least 10 lines. That's very difficult for a movie that offers nothing.<br /><br />The children playing the elves have outgrown their cuteness-even the doctor who co-starred in Bonnie Hunt's show a few seasons back.<br /><br />The fact that Ann Margret came out of retirement for this is quite amazing (amazing as in why pick this sinking vessel). At least Martin Short was having fun in the scenes they shared. <br /><br />For once a Hollywood movie tried to cash in on the fact that Canadians make for a big part of their revenues in regards to movie receipts. But the only thing missing to make it stereotypical is for the adults to fall in a container of maple syrup. <br /><br />Avoid at all costs.
