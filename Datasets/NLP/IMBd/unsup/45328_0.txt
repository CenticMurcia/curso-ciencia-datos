This is the most boring movie i've ever seen.I was unable to make it through to the end.<br /><br />The first 10 minutes seemed to be OK but then everything fell apart.<br /><br />I didn't see any of the final of the three "episodes" but what I saw of one and two were bad enough.<br /><br />The initial actors playing the TV crew were OK but the actors in episode 2 were embarrassing.<br /><br />Everything about episode 2 is amateurish..the actors, the direction, the editing, the script. I use these terms loosely as I'm reluctant to dignify this suckfest with these terms.<br /><br />At about the time of the unintentionally funny death I gave up. Its like slow torture. I suppose I could go back and finish it but I really can't face it.
