Oh where to begin! This movie was so ridiculous I'm almost ashamed to admit that I paid $5.99 to see it. This movie set an all time record for showing the lead characters boobs the quickest (approx. 2 minutes) and they're not even that great. The scene at the bar where the suave dude picks her up is incredibly lame. It's quite clear throughout this movie that nobody in it has ever acted before....except for possibly bit roles in Anal Paprika 3: Menage-a-Death (it's a real movie). The little girl might be the best actor in the whole movie....and considering every time she spoke you couldn't tell what the hell she was saying that doesn't bode well for the rest of the 'cast'. One area that was surprisingly decent was some of the makeup on the zombies...it wasn't great...we're not talking George Romero here...but it was good considering the quality of the rest of the movie. The end of the movie made absolutely no sense....it made my head hurt and my girlfriend still has a confused look on her face the next morning ;) I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for examples of no talent....otherwise...curl up on the toilet with a nice magazine and you'll probably be more entertained.<br /><br />Best Actor: Little Girl - can't comprehend what she's saying...but somehow that's a good thing.<br /><br />Tatum Adair's boobs - they have more scenes than several zombies....and no lines...so that's good.<br /><br />Green Ball - no matter how many times the little girl bounces this ball it always comes through...look for it in the sequel!<br /><br />Worst Actor: Mother - no acting ability....terrible...just terrible.<br /><br />Dad - bad...but at least acted paralyzed fairly well.<br /><br />Sheriff - not sure what movie he was supposed to be in...but most of what he says doesn't relate to this movie. Seemed very robotic, monotone....."Bueller.....Bueller.....Bueller"<br /><br />If the goal of this movie was to make you laugh...then in a way it's very successful....but I don't think it was the goal. It was just lame....sad....pathetic.....worst movie in history.
