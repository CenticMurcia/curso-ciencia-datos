Night Watch is a low budget Russian vampire movie that depicts the eternal battle of good and evil in modern day Moscow. Centuries after a truce between two opposing forces there is a risk that an 'Other' or gifted human (anyone seen Neo?) will tip the balance of power. As with the vampire movie Underworld there are forces that prevent the battle from spilling over into the real world. The Day Watch are vampires assigned to police their brethren who disguise themselves as Adidas tracksuit wearing chavs who drive Audi TTs and aspire to be pop stars (the UK is full of Vampires!). The Night Watch must step in to prevent evil forces from doing harm to innocent humans. The special effects in the movie are decent and one would be forgiven for mistaking the movie as a Hollywood title at times. However, there are other instances when it looks as though the movie is being acted out by a bunch of friends in a warehouse or derelict flat. The cheap grainy feel is likely to be part of the desired Gothic, art house effect so many will however enjoy its raw non glossy appeal. Whilst most sci fi/ horror fans will be instantly attracted to the story there is not a great deal of depth to the plot or characters and there is the strong feeling that you are being set up for sequel. The movie also moves very slowly at times and the surreal action can be confusing. Whilst some would argue that this adds complexity and intrigue it cant really mask the lack of depth in the story line or characters and will not somehow make it more interesting than it really is. The special effects also often seem to be on display rather than interwoven with plot. There is an interesting end to the movie but the film has been dragged out for too long by its conclusion for you to care. Overall an interesting movie that is likely to herald the start of a potentially significant contribution from Russia to the international action genre but as a stand alone entity it is average at best.
