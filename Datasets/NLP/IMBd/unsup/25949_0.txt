If Ross McElwee was aiming for a movie about a very sad, very pathetic man, then he hit the target. Unfortunately for him he made a mockery of himself instead of actually getting to a point with this uninspired, unintentionally funny documentary.<br /><br />Let's start at the beginning. Mr. McElwee sets out to make a documentary on a man named Sherman, a famous General who destroyed a lot of things in the South during the civil war. Well, we get to learn a small amount about General Sherman throughout the film, facts that have no real context in the rest of the movie.<br /><br />Now, let's get to the real point of the movie. Ross takes his camera on a mission to find out why his 'ex-flames' never really liked him. Well, I can tell you why they didn't like him just from watching this video: HE'S INSANE. The women he dated were insane. There was no sense of reality in any of the conversations he had with any of the females; the only one that seemed slightly sane he made CRY.<br /><br />I think my favorite part in this movie is when he, Ross, takes the camera to a woman he sort of saw in High school. This happens to be the only sane person in the movie, mainly because she didn't continue seeing him afterwards. He takes her to a park and proceeds to badger her to get the reasons why she didn't 'love' him. He goes as far as to say, "WHY DON'T YOU LOVE ME?" to her. After she's literally about to break down, she tells him to cut the camera off. Does he? No. He proceeds to be a jerk.<br /><br />I was told that this movie was good. It was not. I was told that this move was funny. Only because it was very sad.<br /><br />This is a horrible movie. Watch it only if you wish to feel better about your own life, and/or to laugh at a very sad, very pathetic hairy little man.
