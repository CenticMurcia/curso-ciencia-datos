This was an attempt to return to a genre that officially died in the late 90s - The slasher. Introduce teenage characters that no one cares about in any facet, make them doing "bad" things and getting killed for doing it. I thought about clicking the spoiler button, because that pretty much sums up the movie.<br /><br />While this probably would have made a decent video game or short story, it's definitely didn't make the trip from screenplay to screen without introducing every slasher clich√© imaginable. It's not worth your money for the DVD, nor was it really worth the rental fees. If you've watched any of the retro slashers, skip this one.
