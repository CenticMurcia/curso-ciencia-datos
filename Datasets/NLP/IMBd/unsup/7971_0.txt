Kevin Smith is one of my favorite Directors, not only because he can direct, but he can create funny situations out of almost thin air. We see this in Mallrats, but this film...clerks, his first one is a bit out of the league.<br /><br />First of all the actors can't act, it's a fact. None of them really convinces me. And the script sometimes focuses to much on...nothing that it almost becomes intolerable to watch. Not even the directing is that good in this movie, but I think I speak for all Smith fans when I say that we are willing to forget and forgive most of this when it comes to clerks.<br /><br />Making a movie about two guys talking crap behind the counter of a quickstop is a very original and funny idea, but Smith does not pull this of all the way. He focuses to much on duologue, duologue that you know is very rehearsed, every line is presented with the utter most perfection which makes it less believable. But not all of it is bad, as I said before the idea is very original and some of the jokes really made me laugh.<br /><br />And let's not forget that this was his first real movie and that it took him from nothing to Hollywood in like a second, now thats impressive. It's also that fact that makes this movie so good, every aspiring director (including myself) sees this movie and if it weren't there before, now there is hope, hope that someday i will make it big time to. That is what makes this movie so great and thats what makes me love it.<br /><br />May the force be with you...always. Oh, and the Empire strikes back is way better than return of the Jedi.
