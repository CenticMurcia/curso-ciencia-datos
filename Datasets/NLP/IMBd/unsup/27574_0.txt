With its bland photography, flat direction, and a lack of both gags and ambition, the only surprise to be found in this 13-years-along follow-up to the first sequel is that it wasn't designed to go straight to video. Crocodile Dundee is back and treading in the footsteps of Axel Foley as he brings his rough and ready personality to the uptight show-offy candyland of Beverly Hills. The plot, in which Mick gets a job as a movie extra and uncovers an art smuggling ring, is nonsense, and whatever steam might have been left in the series after the dismal 'Crocodile Dundee II' has entirely evaporated in the intervening years. Tiresome, repetitious and plodding, this trundles through a series of barely-linked scenes, none of which are particularly unexpected, most of which are reheated from the first film; meanwhile Linda Koslowski does very little and does it even more wetly and woodenly than before. It's all very pointless and dull, and absolutely no match for the original, which is still charming after all these years.
