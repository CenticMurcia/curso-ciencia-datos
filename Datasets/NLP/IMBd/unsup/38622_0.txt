I really don't know what to say about this. I was mildly entertained by Tom Goes to the Mayor. It had its funny moments, but it was no great show.<br /><br />This one is just bad. There's really no intended purpose to any of this. It's simply a mashing of incoherent and obscurely done live-action sketches without any jokes, and with attempts at humor which fail miserably. It just seems to be Tim and Eric's attempts to broadcast their obsession with weird noises and things to other people, like the way they like to make noises with their mouths, and dress up and talk like other people (it would be called acting if they were any good at it).<br /><br />I just can't believe how awful it is... it's not even like bad like Tom Goes to the Mayor was, this has nothing in it. No substance. I couldn't even smile watching the last episode involving David Cross without genitalia and a fat woman in fake porn.
