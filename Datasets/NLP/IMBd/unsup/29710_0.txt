I had completely forgotten about this late night movie show until I came across a reference to it on another IMDb page. And what a great show it was, with wonderful bottom-of-the-barrel flicks interspersed with the occasional legit movie, and hosted by various funny folks like Gilbert Gottfried, Such fond memories. The topic of female nudity -- a frequent occurrence in many of the flicks shown -- and how this was handled makes for some very funny reading here, and I remember that sort of thing vividly. Today, the station would simply optically obscure what it doesn't want us to see, instead of making ridiculous and downright damaging edits. Many of these films may never be seen again, sad to say. I agree with those who suggest watching G4, which runs some pretty awful and hilarious flicks from time to time. But it's not and never will be "USA Up All Night." That was one of a kind.
