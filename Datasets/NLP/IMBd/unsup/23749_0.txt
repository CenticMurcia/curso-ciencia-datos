Hooray, my first review on IMDb. Well, it was a mighty fine movie, but the beginning really confused me. Not the story, which was pretty simple, but the movie language. Mainly in the beginning they were mixing up drama and comedy really badly which was annoying me, and later I got confused with the story lines. It was about Christoffer and his wife Maja, who had gone to Prague to take care of Christoffer's dead father. He never really knew his father, who had ran away when Christoffer was 12 years old. And while he's dealing with emotions about the death, he founds out that Maja has a lover outside the marriage. The story lines of the dead father and the adultery gets mixed up, making it hard to find out which was the main storyline. Mads Mikkelsen's acting was brilliant as usual, though it gets tiring to always see him in the same role. My rating is 8 because of the great intense scenes later in the movie, and because it just gets better and better.
