Dil Chahta Hai, one word: excellent. If you've never seen a Bollywood film before, this is the best place you could start.<br /><br />Akash (Aamir), Siddharth or Sid (Akshaye), and Sameer (Saif) are best friends. They are all different; Akash is very critical and a prankster, he believes that love doesn't last more than a couple of weeks. Sid is the most serious and mature of the three, he is a little shy and often disappears in his own world of painting. Sameer, is desperately romantic and "falls in love" a lot. Often this ends in heartbreak...Nevertheless, despite their differences, the trio have something in common: their love for each other. Soon, the three find their own lives dragging them forward, forced to leave the others behind, and they realize the value and seriousness of life. They discover many things along the way, like true love, and true friendship. When their lives collide again, their individual worlds are shaken up once more, leaving them with the support they really need: each other.<br /><br />Aamir gives a very fun-filled, suave performance, he is comical and the audience will always love him, its brilliant. Saif Ali Khan does an awesome job, it's comedy, but it's a very strong performance too. Akshaye Khanna, gets full credit for the best performance in this movie. Not only did he get the best role, but he played it to perfection, the fight scene with Akash, was brilliant. I give him my full applause. The pretty Preity Zinta, also gives a noteworthy performance. Her cute smile and charming personality light up the screen and makes the movie refreshing. Sonali Kulkarni gives a gritty performance. She is forgettable, but she does play the role well. Dimple Kapadia plays the depressed alcoholic mom easily. Ayub Khan, Rajat Kapoor, and Suhasini Mulay give small, but important roles.<br /><br />The music is amazing. Certainly the best part about the film. Farhan Akhtar has done a fantastic job.<br /><br />I'd say 8 out of 10 stars...WATCH IT!
