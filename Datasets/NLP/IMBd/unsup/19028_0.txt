Another film by Andy Sidaris' kid Drew, who mostly set his movies apart by only casting one ex-Playmate per project as opposed to Dad's four or five. <br /><br />Here we've got a team of elite assassins (Penthouse Pets Julie Strain and Julie K. Smith and Playmate Wendy Hamilton) on a mission to eliminate scientists involved in some international peacemaking effort. Or something to that effect. <br /><br />Many valuable lessons are gleaned. Such as: If you have to hire Pets instead of Playmates for your pandering Cinemax crapfest, you may as well consider a career change. These girls just don't measure up as thespians. <br /><br />No, I couldn't keep a straight face writing that last sentence. But really, there's a glimmer of truth in that thought. Strain and Smith may have larger boobs than the Playmates of yore, but as performers they're cold and distant, even plastic. You don't ever desire them, let alone like them or care about what happens next.<br /><br />Not an execrable film by any stretch, but something's clearly not right when it doesn't work even with all the abundant female flesh on view.
