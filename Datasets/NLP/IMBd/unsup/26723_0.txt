This show is so good, it has everything and it is freaking hilarious. It has teen angst, like humor and like everything a show needs, i love it. Brooke rules and Nicole is funny. Everyone is excellent. I love it, I'm addicted and now loads of my friends r addicted too. It is such a good show. I like how the show is stereotypical also, like it's how high school really is. Sugar Daddy and Merry Cherry are way funny in it. Lily is cool, I'm a vegetarian also. Sam does annoy me, because she always makes assumptions, which aren't always right. I used to watch this show ages ago when I was like twelve and now I'm eighteen and watching it again, because it's really good and I adore it.
