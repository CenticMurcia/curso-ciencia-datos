A satire of the acclaimed March of the Penguins. There are also elements from Happy Feet, and some other recent movies. The only thing missing is humor. <br /><br />Dull, tedious, and lacking any wit or creativity whatsoever. A bunch of high recognition celebrity voices are drafted for inane banter pasted over some stock footage of penguins wandering around the Antarctic, apparently seeking mates (or so we are told). Interspersed are some random shots of other animals touching themselves, again with sub-moronic observations by the voice-overs. Samuel L. Jackson, as the narrator, has one of the few worth-while lines, repeatedly telling the audience how lousy this stinker is. And he's right.<br /><br />Unless you like hearing that favorite word of unemployed comedians (hint: starts with f) every few seconds, brain-dead potty humor, and rambling references to pop culture, you'll be yelling at the set for these idiots to shut up already. Unfortunately, they don't: they talk...and talk...and talk. That's pretty much all this film is. Bob Saget, formerly the "Funniest Videos" host, is apparently the one to blame for this slop, and shows no ability at creating a "funniest video" himself.<br /><br />No laughs; just irritating. Bury this junk deep in a polar ice cap somewhere and pretend it never existed.
