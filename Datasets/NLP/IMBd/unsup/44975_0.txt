Jesus Christ!! what a rotten movie. Of course I started watching it not expecting more than a predictably bad movie(aren't most bollywood movies, nowadays?!?). But this surpassed all my expectations. Come on Abhishek I know your dad is famous but that should not be the only reason for being in the movies. When they put you in front of a camera you are expected to emote not regurgitate your stupid lines with a dumb struck face.<br /><br />Admittedly Ash is no better but at least she is divinely beautiful that we can completely forgive all her transgressions. The same unfortunately cannot be said about Aby B as he seems to have inherited all the wrong genes from his progenitors. <br /><br />The script is horrible and apart from Satish Shah the acting was horribly cruel to the people watching. Some bearable songs(note: I have stretched my definition of bearable for this case).<br /><br />rating: -*(minus should be allowed.. as I would like my money back and some, for the torture doled out to me)<br /><br />Run far away or watch Glitter/Gigli instead, unless you are an Ash fan or an Abhishek B fan (god have mercy on your sense of preference)
