I liked the first film, loved the second one, but was highly disappointed with the 3rd film.<br /><br />The first two films went together. The third film is just spun out there for no reason other than trying to make more money for the studio. The magic of the first two films simply was not present in this film.<br /><br />Martin Short did a good job but the plot was silly and stupid. The exclusion of David Krumholtz as "Bernard the Elf" left a big hole in the link between the Elves and Santa. He was definitely too old looking to reprise the role and Spencer Breslin as "Curtis" was sad too see considering how big he has grown and that cute little big boy is no longer there.<br /><br />The attempt to bring a bunch of family members to the North Pole seemed to also take away from the formula that made the first two films so successful.<br /><br />It was if the writers threw every conceivable plot device at the audience to try and make us laugh. Then, tie in some sentimental Christmas message to it. It's like a big box of bricks thrown at a Christmas tree. A real holiday mess.<br /><br />This film was rarely funny, confused, poorly executed, and the only real escape clause should have been for the audience...to get out of the theater within the first 15 minutes.
