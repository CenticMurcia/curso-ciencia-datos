I watched this today on IFC knowing nothing about it, & thoroughly enjoyed it. It was really nice to see Barbara Barrie(Mrs Barney Miller)again. I emailed my 40-50 y/o golf buddies to tell them it's a must. Since I first saw Joe Pantiliano as a pimp in "Risky Business", I've always enjoyed him. In "The Fugitive"/"US Marshals", and especially in "Steal Big, Steal Little", he was one of the strongest cast members(I happen to think "Steal Big, Steal Little" is a great little ensemble piece. "Second Best" is full of humor, as well as chock full of pathos. I can totally identify with aging boomers, growing older, contemplating the roads not taken, the missteps, and the changing relationships with lifetime or oldtime friends
