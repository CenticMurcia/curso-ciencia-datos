Going into this movie I understood two things. It was about an LDS missionary and it starred Anne Hathaway. After seeing it, I know that it is far from a story about a man's mission experiences with a pretty girl on the side. The experiences that Mr. Groberg has are incredible and delightful. Understanding that he is LDS is almost meaningless in the context of the movie's plotline. Whether you are LDS or not, you will be able to understand it's simple motives.<br /><br />Love (Godly, romantic and platonic), Integrity, Loyalty and Friendship all make a presence in the deep character development. As writer of the screenplay and as director Mitch Davis has masterfully crafted this adaptation of the life experiences of John Groberg. You sense he did not go into his mission with a desire to find glory or fame, but he did go to Tonga with a desire to do what was right. This I feel is the overarching trait of the character played by Chris Gorham. It pulled him through when he didn't know how to heal a seemingly dead child or make it to land after losing his ship in the middle of the ocean. Nevertheless, in persisting to be true to his religion, his family and his love, he was able to touch the lives of hundreds in the three years he served in Tonga.<br /><br />Now, his story is able to touch the lives of thousands more through the efforts of Mr. Davis and his staff. Thank you for pouring your life into this so we may view the greatness that is the life of John H. Groberg.
