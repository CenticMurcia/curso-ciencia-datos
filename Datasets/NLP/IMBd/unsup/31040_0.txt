I really like Sci-Fi movies, and this one had a promising plot, I thought. A few of the special effects were nice, but the film never managed to catch my full attention. So, if you need to see low budget Sci-Fi, watch it! It may be useful to study for amateur directors. But I would not recommend this film to anybody looking for an exciting evening.
