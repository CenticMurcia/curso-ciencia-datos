I did not have the fortune of being able to view Burn After Reading in the theatre, but having watched it on DVD, I can say that I'm glad that I waited. Its not that the movie was bad, but there were several scenes that I had to go back and re-watch a number of times because they were just so damned funny. The trailers and TV spots for the film would have you believe that this yet another goofy Brad Pitt film where he runs around like a pretty boy for ninety minutes, but don't be fooled, this film is far more gruesome and much funnier that I believed. Like any typical film by the Brothers Coen, the film is very aesthetically pleasing, the visuals are great, but what makes Burn After Reading an enjoyable film is the dialogue. About 60 minutes into the movie, one finally realizes that this is not a spy-thriller, or a mystery film, but rather a depiction of what happens when a bunch of self-centered morons are turned loose and run around like chickens with their heads cut off, so to speak. The problem is that it really works in this movie, I didn't not expect this to be so good. Even though Burn After Reading touts an "all star" cast consisting of George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Tilda Swinton and John Malkovich, the two stand-out scenes that completely elevate the movie are scenes with J.K. Simmons and his CIA underling. These two scenes are without a doubt the best scenes in the entire and its worth renting the DVD for those two scenes alone. Be not deceived, this is NOT another "No Country for Old Men", but this is more in vein of The Big Lebowski, but its not *quite* as good Lebowski. All of that being said, rent the film its easily an 8/10 film.<br /><br />-J.
