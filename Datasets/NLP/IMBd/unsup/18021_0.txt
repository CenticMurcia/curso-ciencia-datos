There is a particular(Canadian?) gentle charm about this series that sets it above the seemingly endless dross. It promotes wholesome family values including unusually not just mom and pop but uncles, aunts and siblings. Today's episode has Zowie, the youngest member, taught the need for the words Please, Thank You and Excuse me. The clear intention is to teach those things necessary for all members of a happy family: consideration for others and tolerance but it shows that adults as well as children must follow these rules.<br /><br />It is evident that the makers have put far more into it than they perhaps need have done. The most brilliantly realised character is the dog "Spot" - a non-speaking part, everything is done with body language. It's such cleverly observed dog behaviour. In one second a scolded Spot can go from excitement to rejection, to reproach, to dejection - all absolutely unmistakeably indicated by every part. It is so well observed you can see aspects of dog behaviour not noticed before.<br /><br />The sofas and fridges with bulging eyes and wide mouths are a recognisable borrowing - presumably a respectful homage - from pioneer Max Fleischer's cartoons of the 1930's. There they were a little weird - here they're part of the story - fridges have feelings too!
