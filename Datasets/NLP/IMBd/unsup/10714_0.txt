I understand that some viewers expected this movie would be a comedy. I didn't expect anything and I liked it very much. Acting isn't great, the script is ok, but certainly not great, but I really liked the characters. But what I liked most about the movie is the soundtrack, the actors are all great singers!<br /><br />Despite the not so good end scene, this movie leaves you with a feeling of great joy when you leave the theater. 7/10
