I thought this was a very well done movie even though it had one of those disjointed plots that are so common with European flicks,(the ending had me totally confused). I thought that the dubbing was well done and the movie was quite nice to look at. There was also a death scene that came right out of nowhere and kind of reminded me of something out of a Dario Argento film. I would give this movie 3 stars. ***
