I don't know what movie the other reviewers were watching, but they must be associated with the production or are family members of one of them to write that type of review. This movie is boring and predictable. The plot, if there is one, is full of holes. This movie looks like a project a failing cinematography student may put out. Warning, I saw this movie under the title: One Step Closer. One can only imagine why the creators are trying to distribute it under a different name... As a side note, this site is here for guidance in helping us pick movies to watch. I cannot understand why it is becoming more and more a vehicle for some people to mislead the general public. I think IMDb should be aware of this!!!
