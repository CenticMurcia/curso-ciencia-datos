Judith Light is to be commended for her choice of projects; she is very good in the role of Alice, a single mother who is originally imprisoned for embezzlement, then sold out by her criminal defense lawyer; who,it turns out, made a crooked deal with a judge.<br /><br />While the story is a bit convoluted about her actual prison record, she is sentenced to 5 years, even though I doubt this would occur, as she had minor non-violent crime (apparently).<br /><br />Chelcie Ross is excellent as the bureaucratic warden, and there is a scene wherein Judith Light and he confront each other....Inmates are told they are human garbage as the prison guards rape and abuse them. Things like this go on in hospitals; so it is certainly believable that this occurs in prison. There is a scene where a suicidal inmate receives no medical attention, is restrained and hog-tied by 6 prison guards, and never sees a physician.<br /><br />Stacey Keach portrays attorney Jackson Devlin, who finally brings this story national attention, with the help of Light's character, and many of the inmates, who are named "Jane Doe" in the class action lawsuit. They are anonymous so that their supposed "rights" are protected. Apparently, though, no one has any civil rights, and one guard named Stu is found dead, a staged suicide; he was murdered by one of the prison staff to protect their jobs.<br /><br />At present, in the U.S. there are more people in prison than ever; the statistics are staggering; many mentally disabled and indigent are wrongfully imprisoned; they cannot afford a lawyer, so they rot in jail. Is this demoralizing treatment warranted?. It certainly does not make this society a better place to live; It also has been proved that executions are not a deterrent to crime.<br /><br />If you liked this movie, you may also like "The Life of David Gale" with Kevin Spacey; there are many thought provoking arguments here, decide for yourself.
