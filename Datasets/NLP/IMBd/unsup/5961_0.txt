Edge of your seat action, gory zombies and hot girls fighting evil. Is there anything wrong with this movie ... well yes The Movie lacks the scare factor we had in the RE games, and i miss that. Milla does a good job with the lead despite the fact her acting skills are limited her sexiness makes up for that! Michelle Rodriguez Is Perfect in this role and she really impressed me . I had my worries when i saw Paul Anderson because i hated Event Horison And i hated AvP ( grrr avp is the worst movie ever made, it brought shame to both franchises ) but to my surprised it was pretty damn good. The licker I'm sad to say looked horrible it did really really bad but everything that was bad about this movie is eventually washed from your mind. Nice ending, Nice Acting, nice zombies = nice movie.<br /><br />I give this movie a **** star rating.<br /><br />And if you enjoyed this review you may enjoy my Resident Evil Apocalypse.<br /><br />Thank You And Goodbye.
