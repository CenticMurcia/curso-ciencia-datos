A great film creates its own universe, which is why the subject matter of a movie is not really the point. However, every universe, no matter how perverse or obscure, still has its rules.<br /><br />"The Last Broadcast" fails miserably as a film not because of its low budget, or cheesy production values, or less-than-stellar performances (all of which exist); rather, the movie creates its universe, then, for the finale, decides to disregard everything that it has presented, in an attempt to be 'surprising,' or 'crass' or 'hip.' Instead, it makes its filmmakers look like they have no idea how to tell a story. And, worse - it treats its audience as though it has no sense of logic or reason.<br /><br />Which is a shame. For an hour or more, the picture is reasonably interesting and entertainingly directed. If the performances are somewhat shaky, at least they do not distract from the overall allure of the story. That the story bares a passing resemblance to 'Blair Witch' is irrelevant; both pictures feature film-type crews journeying into the woods to cover stories of the presumed supernatural.<br /><br />But, where 'Blair Witch' ended in inevitability, 'The Last Broadcast' ends in utter stupidity. How anybody could have read the screenplay and thought, 'wow, what a clever twist of an ending' is beyond me.<br /><br />
