The most dramatic episode of The Hire was ruined by the shaky camera effect and the quality taken for the image. Really, could be the director's decision, I never saw Babel, yet, so I don't know if it's just his style. Maybe yes, maybe no. What I know is that Powder Keg is the more serious The Hire episode, until now. Star was a jackass action-short. Powder Keg is a drama-action short, with reminders of war and terrorist crime.<br /><br />SOME SPOILERS FROM NOW ON! BE AWARE! <br /><br />The Swedish actor was alright, he portrayed a photographer who witnessed a massacre in Mexico. He was one the run, wounded by gunshots and the UN quickly sent someone to pick him up. That someone was the Driver. He eventually had to go to the New York Times. But, of course, the wounds were too deep, he got shot too and died right on the Driver's car. The Driver now shows a bit of his personality, gives the photographer's personal belongings to his mother and probably, goes to the Times' headquarters and gives the photos to them.<br /><br />One small note: The photographer starts reminiscing as we see war outside the moving BMW. This is a beautiful scene for a commercial movie--
