This slight Chaplin film has Charlie playing another troublemaker, which really did not suit him. Watching these films close together, one wonders whether or not anyone noticed. However, most of these early Chaplin films were experimental in terms of technique but rather bland in terms of plot. Many plots were repetitive it seems. This film concerns Mabel Normand having some trouble with selling what looks like hamburgers; however, one of the alternate titles for the film suggests she's selling hot dogs. You be the judge. Everyone seems to want to take poor Mabel's wares until Chaplin arrives on the scene and appears to defend her at first. Chaplin expects certain gratuities for standing up for her, and when none are forthcoming, he too absconds with her goods. Look for Keystone Producer Mack Sennett and future silent comedian Charley Chase in small roles. *1/2 of 4 stars.
