Robert Lord created a fine screen play that even seen today makes a lot sense.<br /><br />William Powell and Kay Francis play the doomed lovers. Mr. Powell, one of the handsomest figures of the time is the right man for the exquisite Kay Francis, who was one of the most popular leading ladies at Warner. Before the arrival on the scene of Bette Davis, Ms. Francis reigned supreme because of her intriguing beauty and her way of making every character she played a winner. The joy of this film though are Aline MacMahon and Frank McHugh. These two character actors give their best to make this a winning comedy.<br /><br />"One Way Passage" is a movie that will not disappoint the lovers of classical cinema.
