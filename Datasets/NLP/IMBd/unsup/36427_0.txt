Besson's weakest film by a mile, a totally unconvincing portrayal of Joan's life and France at that time. The plot struggles to develop as you feel the film going round in circles. It's a mixed bag of mystical nonsense, ineptly performed political machinations and gratuitous gore. If you're hoping for battle scenes reminiscent of Braveheart forget it. Besson attempts to tell a grand scale story with unsatisfying small scale scenes, there is little tension after the opening. And the beautiful cinematography and taught direction so typical of his previous films is in little evidence here. Milla, as Joan, is hopelessly out of her depth as she squeaks her battle cries to the army in her command (she was mildly irritating in Besson's Fifth Element, she's a royal pain in the neck in this). Perhaps the only intriguing episode in the film is the arrival of her 'conscience' played by Hoffman - a kind of quasi zen buddhist master mirroring her selfishness. Indeed this would have been all the more intriguing if the script had made more out of the aura and holiness around Joan in her attempt to deliver Jesus' message to the English in a fervently catholic France
