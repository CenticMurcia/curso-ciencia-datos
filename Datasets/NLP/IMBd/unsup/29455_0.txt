The Tunisian-French Laura (Fanny Valette) is a young woman that lives with her Orthodox Jewish family in the Jewish community in the suburbs of Paris. Her mother is a widow that left Tunisia; her sister Mathilde (Elsa Zylberstein) is having troubles in her marriage because she repressed her sexual desire based on her misunderstandings of the principles of her religion. Laura is an open minded student of philosophy and works cleaning a school in the nightshift. While Laura feels a strong passion and desire for her Muslin Algerian colleague, her sister finds that her husband had an affair with a woman and looks for an adviser that helps her to interpret the true meaning of love and the duties of a married woman.<br /><br />"La Petite Jerusalem" is a sensitive film about religion, intolerance, philosophy and repressed desire. The story exposes how religion may affect relationships through the dilemma of two sisters raised a conservative community. The older one misunderstands and is confused about the limits of intimacy of a couple, and the younger feels how prejudice and intolerance may affect relationships even of those that are less religious or more open-minded. The magnificent performances are very realistic and Fanny Valette is an extremely beautiful woman. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "A Pequena Jerusal√©m" ("The Little Jerusalem")
