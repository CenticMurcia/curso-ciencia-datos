Christian Slater is impressive here and the juxtaposition of real and surreal sequences works well. William H. Macy, as always, paints a minor character vividly, as does Elisha Cuthbert.<br /><br />Not much of a movie for Adam Sandler fans or the myriad viewers who just want to chuckle and half-sleep.<br /><br />This is a second-thought sort of film --- one that comes back at you. The creativity and uniqueness is not apparent at first, but brings belated fascination.<br /><br />The camera work is superb and the screenplay, borrowing just a tad from Ambrose Bierce (as many have), is a true work of art.<br /><br />Directors don't get enough credit - so kudos here too.<br /><br />All-in-all a great effort, well worth seeing.
