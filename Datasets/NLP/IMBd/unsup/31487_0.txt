I went into the cinema with expectations of a Mugahal-e-Azam kind of movie. It turned out to be equivalent of "Ram Gopal Varma Ki Aag" instead.<br /><br />The script is mediocre. Plot is shallow.<br /><br />Message to be conveyed is not clear. The pace of the narration is uneven.<br /><br />In short if you have time and money to be spent on nothing better, go and watch it. <br /><br />Otherwise stay away.<br /><br />The editing, screenplay, music and direction leave a lot on the table.<br /><br />Performances are mediocre at best.<br /><br />It is full of historical inaccuracies.
