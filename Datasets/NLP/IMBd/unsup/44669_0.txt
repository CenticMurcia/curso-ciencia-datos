Ever since seeing her in 10 Things I Hate About You, I've been anxiously awaiting Julia Stiles' next film. Talk about disappointment. Not that she did a poor job -- neither did Freddie Prinze, Jr. -- but there just wasn't any chemistry between the two leads. What could have been a good romantic drama/comedy turned into a confused mess. I've seen some really well made three hour movies (The Green Mile and Magnolia, to name two) in the last few months and neither of them felt as long as this mere one hour and thirty-seven minute film. About a half hour into the movie, I found myself already giving up on the characters and looking for some other redeeming quality -- a decent soundtrack, fresh cinematography ... something. About the only really good thing I can say about this movie was the role played by Shawn Hatosy. At least he was able to throw in a little comedic relief in an otherwise uncomfortable movie to watch. Word has it that Miss Stiles will also appear in four more movies in 2000 -- there's still hope!
