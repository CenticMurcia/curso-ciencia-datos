Captain America (1991) is a lame attempt to bring one of Marvel Comic's cornerstone characters to the silver screen. Whilst it's better than the mediocre t.v. movies, the end results are still the same. I wish that the filmmakers would have bothered to spend a half hour of their time and picked up an old issue of Captain America. They changed too much of the original story for this to have worked. I mean they had all the right parts to make a decent film but it winds up missing a few cogs and gears. The final product is a lemon. It has a nice body but the engine is totally trashed.<br /><br />Dude, my advice is if you're going to make a movie about a comic book hero please read it first. Because if you don't, you're going to wind up with a real stinker.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie for die hard Captain America fans only. This movie had a chance but the filmmakers blew it! They dropped the ball big time. Oh well, maybe next time.
