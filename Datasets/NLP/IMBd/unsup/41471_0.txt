In many ways this is one of the finest casts assembled in the last 5 years. Unfortunately the film always has the 'straight to video' feel. Penn and Thornton are excellent, whilst Nolte (majorly hamming it up) and Lopez are poor. The black comedy/noir works for a while. Ultimately it's source was a novel with potential, that collapsed into a messy conclusion. The film sticks to the source for once. Stone does seem to be losing it big time. The visual tricks and images are becoming increasingly irritating. For films that cover similar topics/themes, check out the superior 'Red Rock West' and 'The Music Of Chance'.
