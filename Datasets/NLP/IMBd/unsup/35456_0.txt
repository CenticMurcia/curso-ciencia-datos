This film is really called Foreigner 2: Black Dawn and Steven Seagal,(Jonathan Cold) once again appears in this film as a real bad dude dealing with all the horrible under-world characters. Seagal even directed this film and the stunts and action were very low key and not performed very professional. It looks like Jonathan Cold put on a few extra pounds and and is acting more like Marlon Brando with his almost silent whispers. Jonathan meets up with a gal he had known years ago and a very good looker, he does manage to save her from a very close shave with death. There are plenty of explosions and the real bomb is when you start watching this film and wonder when it will ever end. It is about time to put an end to these Foreigner series and move on to something more interesting.
