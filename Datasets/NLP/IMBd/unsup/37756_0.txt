I'll start with quoting other reviews I've done. You have to enjoy this movie for what it is. It had horrible stage fighting, crappy special effects, and probably had plot holes that you could drive a bus through, but it actually was fairly entertaining.<br /><br />My only real beefs with the movie include:<br /><br />1) Shin is the Fist of the South star, and has mastered several forms of Nanto Seiken. Why, in his early fight with Ken, does he feel the need to Gas peddle him. Also, why does Ken occasionally gas peddle people.<br /><br />2) Rufio.<br /><br />3) When the actor formally know as Rufio (or Bat/Bart if you want to get technical) is pretty brutally killed, he not only makes a cheesy death speak like in Hook, but Ken says something to the effect of "because of you, the village is saved." Rufio didn't do anything. He just stood off with Bondage-face and got stabbed to death.<br /><br />4) Bondage-face (whoes name eludes my at the moment) was way cooler in the anime. There, his name is Jagi, and *POSSIBLE SPOILER* he turns Shin to evil, tarnishes Ken's decent name, and trash talks him a few times during their battle. And he wears a cool mask. *END SPOILER*. In this movie, he is one of Shin's random minions, and has a really lame death (the death is the same as the anime, but the fight with Julia was just dumb).<br /><br />5) Ken doesn't scream when he punches people. It's probably for the better though, for if he had screamed, it would have just made the movie worse.<br /><br />As I said, the movie is pretty good for what it is. Also, it must be noted that it is a B-movie, and thus will never be good.<br /><br />One thing of note though, is that the makers seemed to keep some of the shots from the anime (like when Ken and Shin jump kick each other). While these shots didn't remain intact, it is worth noting that they are there.
