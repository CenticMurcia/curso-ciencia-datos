I never understood this episode. It's not interesting, nothing happens in it. During those moments when the world is spinning around, I have to laugh because they look like those old "newspapers spinning towards the camera" shots showing a series of headlines, e.g. "Boy Trapped in Refrigerator Eats Own Foot".<br /><br />Lazarus keeps falling off of cliffs all of the time. The man easily travels through Time and Space and yet he keeps falling into Space all of the Time? When TOS was originally issued on VHS, this was one episode I made sure I didn't buy. There might be more to see in this episode, I just don't have the patience to wade through all of the boredom.
