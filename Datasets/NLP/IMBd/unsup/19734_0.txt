It's long, but it's the time that it needs to explain everything that Martin Scorzese wants to show us. The hate, the love, the bad and the good, the violence of the streets and the violence of politics, racism and a country that is beging its history. The first half of hour it's great and it's unbelieveble. Daniel Day Lewis is so good that you can understand that the bad is not totally bad and the good Amsterdam is not so 100% good. Scorzese put you in a wild society that it's an unbelieveble mirror of our times, he bring us in Five points and you believe that the plot and New york's history is there but at the end we understand that we cannot see only five points in our life but even watching around to understand what's going on in all your country. So if you think only about yourself you would die in that time, hard to say now what it will happend to you... perhaps a day something will fall from the sky and we don't know what it is and for which reason they are falling down. Good to know that Miramax and Scorzese chose Cinecitt√† to do the movie! So we will see if in Oscar's night it will the movie of the year. Not for me anyway!
