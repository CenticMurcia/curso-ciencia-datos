Sorry, but I have to be partial on this movie. I was named after the lead character. My mother was a huge John Travolta fan and my father a huge Olivia Newton John fan. Then of course I had to be born in 1979. All that aside I love this movie. It has been a big part of my life growing up. The music is great. I love all the actors in it, besides Olivia and John. One of my favorite actresses is Stockard Channing.
