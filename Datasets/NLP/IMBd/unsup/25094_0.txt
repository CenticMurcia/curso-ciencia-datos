Just saw this on HBO. Good enough for an afternoon's enjoyment. This movie is very, very, very similar to Lost Horizons starring Ronald Coleman set in America. That film and the book are from the 1930's. Wasn't there a remake of Lost Horizons a few years ago? The stars have good chemistry. The dog is real star and probably smarter than the two leads, as they admit in the dialog. The saving of the sheriff is a little faked. It did not appear he was in real danger. It would appear the film makers cut a few corners. I would have liked the characters developed to a greater extent. Couldn't Gates have gone to a local vet or animal supply store and purchased penicillin off the shelf or with a vet's OK?
