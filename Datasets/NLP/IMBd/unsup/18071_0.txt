This film will undoubtedly go down in history as the greatest comedy ever!<br /><br />Now i know thats a big call, but c'mon guys?<br /><br />For once can all those serious critics and wanna be critics pull their head out of their you know whats! This is a hilarious film! This film has one thing that other american comedies dont: "The laughs are not predictable" all the other comedies are so routine and boringly funny, this one actually makes your stomach hurt from unexpected laughter. scenes like:<br /><br />"the toilet"<br /><br />"sea bass taking the bill"<br /><br />and undoubtedly my favourite moment "the bikini girls touring offer at the end"<br /><br />Unwind,get your sense of humor and enjoy this film. Anyone who judges this film criticaly has there glasses on too tight and their pants pulled too high! dont get so serious, relax.....sit back....and and get ready to laugh!
