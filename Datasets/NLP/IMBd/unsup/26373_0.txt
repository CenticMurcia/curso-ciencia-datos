This movie is very much an R-rated title, but suitable for teenagers under the right circumstances. If a parent/teacher would take the time to preview the show and explain to their charge what they're about to witness, it would be a valuable experience for the youngster(s). Hey, crazy things happen every day in the real world, right? I would argue that the violence and nudity are absolutely crucial to accurately convey the authenticity of the period. Naturally, much in the way of costumes, makeup, etc. had to be created from archaeological examples. I believe this movie is edutainment in the purest sense: A fictional tale, which relates the utter brutality, beauty and social grace that were the Mayan people. The sets, costumes and camera work really shined through, especially in the cityscape scenes. I can't remember more vivid imagery!<br /><br />Mel Gibson took full advantage of an opportunity to bring this culture in the spotlight. Hopefully, he'll straighten up his public image so as not to overshadow his professional one...
