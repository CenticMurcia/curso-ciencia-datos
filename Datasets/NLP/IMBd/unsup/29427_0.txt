I Love this movie. And this is why. This movie is about Love. What you will do for love. Now the greedy bastard in all of you can't figure out why he bothers with her. This is why. "Love" True love, the kind you die for. This is why we watch movies. To feel the way this movie makes us feel about love. I know Bonny/Jolie seams like she doesn't deserve his love. But, you have to understand Luis/Banderas doesn't care. He loves her. Bonny doesn't understand this kind of us-selfish love till it is almost too late and then in the end, finally she figures it out. Bonny finally gives into love and trusts Luis. Please watch this movie and try not to be greedy and think about all he is loosing to be with this woman. Try to understand, he doesn't care. He just loves her and will do anything to be with her. Think of it this way, you are going to buy a new car you opt for the one that is a bit cheaper and comes with out. I don't know, let's say a rear bumper. You don't think it is important. You are going to save 1000 dollars on the car because of it. Then a week later your husband gets in an accident and dies. They tell you if you had a rear bumper the accident would have been minor. Now, if you could go back in time just for one moment and buy the bumper, but now it is 100,000 dollars (just for the bumper). Would you care? No! You would buy the bumper. No mater what it cost to save his life. You can't put a price on true love. In this movie money and wealth are not a factor. It is just about love. I hope you will give this movie a chance and watch is just in the name of love. Also watch it for one of the best love scenes ever. It is right up there with the `Legends of the Fall' love scenes. But longer! It's Great!
