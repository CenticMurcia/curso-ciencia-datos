Essentially a revved-up sci-fi version of High Plains Drifter with 80s teens and the cute young spirit of vengeance driving the Mad Max Interceptor instead of riding into town on a horse, The Wraith is one I've remembered fondly since first seeing it on Monstervision with Joe Bob Briggs in the 90s.<br /><br />The story is, as other reviewers have noted, pretty hopelessly stupid, with dialogue alternating between bland and quotably goofy. Sheen, though top-billed, has little to do and isn't particularly charismatic when he's on screen. Consequently, the Wraith experience is all about the superficial elements: slick car action, hot 80s pop, eye-pleasing girls, etc. Also noteworthy, however, is the colorful supporting cast, including Randy Quaid as the sheriff, and scene-stealing comic relief cretins Skank, Gutterboy, and Rughead (the eternally fascinating Clint Howard sporting an Eraserhead 'do).<br /><br />It's amusing to see the wild array of user reactions to The Wraith, ranging from exaggeratedly laudatory ("Sheen's Post-Impressionist Masterpiece", whatever that means) to dismissive ("Really bad 80's cheese") to indignantly blunt ("crap!!"). It really depends on how you feel about the wacky decade that unleashed The Wraith, a disposable 80s trash flick par excellence. All you need to know is that this movie is 80s to the max. I might be disposed to dismiss The Wraith as time-wasting crap, myself, if it weren't for the fact that it's such utterly fun and nostalgically classic crap.
