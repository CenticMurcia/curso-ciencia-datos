I don't think I laughed once in this so-called comedy, that was phony from the start, with Katharine Hepburn's and Dennie Moore's bad accents, and the switch from con artists, running out of bad things to do, suddenly deciding to form a theatrical troupe. Out of the blue we see them in a bus-like conveyance with the name of their troupe painted on the sides. And Hepburn's disguise as a boy fools everyone in the film, but no one in the audience. The acting was pretty bad too, with Edmund Gwenn poorly acting drunk, angry and jealous - he's too calm and too articulate; Brian Aherne seemed to act too effeminate. The only actor who shined was Cary Grant, but I can't imagine anyone really liking this film in any case.
