Sexy vintage British horror tale packed with traditional atmospheric fog, shades of Gothic and hot young flesh. From the firm buttocks of the hunky men to the smooth perky breasts of the women, this film exploits the 70's free love era. <br /><br />Three interconnected tales revolve around an old lighthouse island purported to be closed but hiding deep secrets. They are . . . <br /><br />First: A man, his wife and their child escape the near by village to live in isolation. Something happens. Second: Free spirited young Americans who are for the most part naked during their flashback sequences, and we're all happy about that, visit the island for a little hot sex and weed. Surely this movie was made by content bisexuals because both sexes bare enough flesh to make your engine hum. Someone murders three of the hot and horny kids (while they're all naked). Third: A research team is sent to the island because one of the boys was murdered with an antique sword only found in southern Europe. The sword it appears belongs to a cult that worships the God of Orgies, lust and firm male butts. The team is comprised of four young hot archaeologists, and two locals, one in particular is a hungry stud (Gary Hamilton) who is by far the best looking 70's hunk I've ever seen naked on screen. There's a lot of "whose been sleeping in my bed" antics before the truth about the island is uncovered.<br /><br />The underground worship chamber is by far the funniest horror set I have ever seen.<br /><br />All in all for film history's sake and a nice slice of 70's nudity mixed with chills and thrills, this is the best of it's kind.<br /><br />Did I mention hot men and sweet women are starked naked most of the time? <br /><br />Catch it!
