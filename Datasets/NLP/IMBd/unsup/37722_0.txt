If you do, you might be tempted to see this movie. First, I didn't know there were so many horrible actors in this world. Outside of a couple performances, I've seen better acting in grade school plays. I hope they keep their day jobs. But lest I offend them, I have to say that the dialog was beyond laughable. It was pathetic. Boring and bland conversation. Like watching oil dry.<br /><br />The idea of the film was great. Not what is IN the film, but what the film jacket notes say it's about. It had all the potential of being a Hitchcock/Lynch-esque sexual thriller. I sat through the most boring movie I've ever seen. Then in the last 5 minutes, it looked like it might have some promise. Waited for the twist. Then the credits started to roll! The movie could have ended at any time and you'd never know the difference.<br /><br />I've never had a "the worst movie I've ever seen" before. I do now.
