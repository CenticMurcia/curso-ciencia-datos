I don't know about spoilers but all those cynical negative comments might spoil my pleasure if I was easily influenced or if I let them, so my simple advice to any film lover is : just watch it and you might just enjoy it. I certainly did. I do not wish to say anything about the plot, the characters and the acting and filming qualities except this: Jessica Lange is great as the seemingly sweet and soft mother, Gwynneth Paltrow is thoroughly convincing as the frail bride and mother to be, Jonathan Schaech is at least adequate, the plot is haunting, so yes, I repeat, just watch it and enjoy it !!! One of the most gripping movies I have ever seen. (Manlyn, a viewer in Switzerland)
