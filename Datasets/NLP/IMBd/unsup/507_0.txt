This fun, endearing film documents the trials, tribulations, and triumphs of a number of Hollywood's veteran "extras". You really get to know and love these people, and if at first, you wondered why anyone would put themselves through the aggravation of all those cattle calls and cold calls, and useless callbacks, by the end of the movie, you realize the love that these extras have for the movie-making process. They'll do anything to be a part of it, however small, brief, or fleeting. Director, Jason Connell, really captures the moments. He's there for the disappointments and the heroic moments of these actorsÂ—yes, the movie proves that even background players are truly actors. His use of clips from the feature films these extras have performed in is illuminating and hilarious. After spending time with the real characters in Strictly Background, you'll want to know more about their lives and what happened after the cameras stopped rolling. Do I hear a sequel or a TV show coming Jason?
