I, after performing The Threepenny Opera, playing in a German Cabaret Duo and spending $100 on KW books had to see this film. I searched from the sky to the bottom of a very very deep crevace and it was there in the music room on the shelf. *YOINK*<br /><br />After watching it, my love for Kurt Weill's music was once again rekindled. No other composer in the past century has ever been performed and interpreted as much as KW. Every musician takes a different slant on him : The Doors, PJ Harvey, Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, Radiohead, The Dresden Dolls, Nick Cave, Lou Reed and so many more.<br /><br />This movie is basically a collaboration of heaps of modern musicians taking different slants on his music set in a broken down warehouse. If you want a basic idea of what it's like think - Bertolt Brecht verse as a Rap, September Song as a Country and Western (shudder), Happy End Numbers as strange insane "interpretive" pieces, and The Alabama Song as a Strange Rock piece. Brilliant! Throughout the movie it explains KW's suppression in a fascist society and him being communist, his move to America, his love life, and of course his musical revolution with small narrated interludes interpretively very well done. I await the DVD!!!<br /><br />In my opinion, Kurt Weill is the greatest thing that has ever happened to musical theatre, ever. He created revolution and not in a "Sex Pistols" kinda way... it was intelligent.<br /><br />A must see for all revolutionists and musicians.<br /><br />Kurt Weill Shall rise again...
