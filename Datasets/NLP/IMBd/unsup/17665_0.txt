Good job turned in by all concerned. Solid acting jobs help put this film over, which contains several neat plot turns. There are also a few plot contrivances and remarkable coincidences which have to be overcome, but it's easy in this case since the rest of the picture works so well - just go with it, or 'key flow', as they say in football.<br /><br />John Payne and Preston Foster turn in first-rate jobs despite the drop in class to a "B", and Lee Van Cleef and Jack Elam are in top form as 'bad guys'.Colleen Gray is lovely but adds 20 minutes to the proceedings as the love interest - and the picture really didn't need a love interest or 20 extra minutes. Overall, a very good effort well worth seeing.
