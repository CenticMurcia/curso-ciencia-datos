This was like a bad, bad dime novel come to the big screen. What utter crap. It's obvious they did not use a military consultant, or if they did, the producers were taken for a long ride, because there was next to nothing accurate about the portrayal of things military. The inaccuracy list is far too long to go through, but just looking at the American paras, they weren't wearing jump gear, the 101st lt. colonel had a leather flight jacket and a class A officer's cap? Almost to a man the Americans are armed with Thompson submachine guns? The rock music only adds to the schlockiness of this movie, I'm surprised there wasn't a chase scene on skateboards or bmx motorbikes. I think the producers were trying to emulate "Kelly's Heroes" but fell so far short, it's pathetic.
