Bill and Connie Filler (Jack Benny and Ann Sheridan) have to movie out of their NYC apartment. Connie wants to move to the country--Bill doesn't. Connie buys a dilapidated house in the country and convinces Bill to move in and fix it up. Naturally everything goes wrong.<br /><br />VERY similar to the later "Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House" with one exception--this is funnier! I found "Blandings" more depressing than funny but I found this very funny and quick-moving. Benny tosses out one liners with ease left and right and most of them are hysterical. There are a few bad lines but Benny's dead pan expression while saying them actually make them amusing. Sheridan is beautiful as his wife. She seems uncomfortable doing comedy (she's mostly the straight person for Benny's jokes) but she's not bad. Also this is historically important as one of the first movies to deal with people moving from the city to the suburbs. However it does have its bad points--Hattie McDaniel plays a stereotypical cook, a VERY annoying little kid is thrown in towards the end and the anti-war speech was a bit much. Still, this is fast, funny and worth seeing just for Benny alone. I give it an 8.
