In 1985 I went to see this at a theater based on the impressively cool artwork used in the ad. There was nothing in the story that resembled the poster image. An absolute failure on every level, Def-Con 4 is the antithesis of entertainment. My precious _soul_ was damaged by this cinematic monstrosity.
