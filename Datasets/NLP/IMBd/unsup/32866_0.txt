I liked the main story of the movie, our heroes are lawmen for hire brought in to deal with a man who's been running roughshod over a town. The heroes have a history together and are interesting characters, the villain is a typical western baddie, crew of loyal outlaws and no conscience, the town council/owners are eastern dandy's unable to deal with the raw life of the frontier. The actions of our heroes is well done, as are the resulting confrontations although I saw a missed opportunity or two in plot execution. The thing that ruined this film was the "love interest" subplot and the fact that Cole was fool enough to keep trying to make a life with the woman even after he saw her cheat and knew she would do so again and again and again. Frankly it seemed to go against everything we knew about the character who was otherwise an intelligent if not well schooled man, who understood psychology well enough to make a crowd of 20 armed men back down. Spoiler time: Besides the repeated idiocy regarding the "romance" i feel the pardon plot point was woefully flimsy. The villain receives a pardon for all crimes committed in the county, the problem is the murders he was convicted of took place outside the sheriff's jurisdiction and thus outside the county. Overall I give this movie a "C-" its passable but could have been so much better with a little more thought and a little less forced romance.
