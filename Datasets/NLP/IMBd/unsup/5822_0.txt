This is a pretty entertaining sequel, but totally inferior to the original in almost every way!. I enjoyed this film quite a bit, however a lot of it is rehashed,and it had some shocking but bizarre plot twists, don't get me wrong i didn't see them coming, but they didn't make any sense, however Eddie gets to show off more with his comic talent, and had a lot more to do this time (in my opinion). Nick and Eddie still had awesome chemistry, and the film is constantly entertaining, it's just it's nowhere close to being as good as the original, and felt they could have done a bit more new material. I enjoyed this movie quite a bit however it can't match the original. The Direction is good. Walter Hill, does a good job here nothing special but he kept the film at a fast pace! good job. There is a bit of blood. We get lots of pretty bloody gunshot wounds but that's it. The Acting is very good. Nick Nolte is fantastic once again, he had awesome chemistry with Eddie Murphy, was likable,kicked that ass, and was lots of fun to watch!. Eddie Murphy is AMAZING as always, and is just plain hilarious,however both of them seemed to be going through the motions at times, still they gave it there all, and they were both great, plus Eddie gets to show off his comedic talent more! (Eddie Rules!). Brion James is good here,but didn't have enough screen time.Andrew Divoff, is great as the main villain, and was very menacing. Ed O'Ross is also good with his limited screen time. Overall well worth the watch, just don't expect the original. *** out of 5
