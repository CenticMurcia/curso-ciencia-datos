If you want to see a humorous movie about the hijinks of an odd group of characters looking to enrich themselves during a WWII battle, see Kelly's Heroes, instead of this movie. The Last Drop tries for humor and misses... or misfires.<br /><br />On the plus side, the movie flows fairly quickly and the action sequences are decent. There is a plot which might be interesting if some other pieces had fallen into place.<br /><br />However, the script is weak and the acting is wooden. There is a very inauthentic feel to the movie, from haircuts to background music. The last 20 minutes are somewhat confusing and in some ways, leave huge gaps of logic.<br /><br />All in all, not an utterly horrible movie, but a premise done much better in Kelly's Heroes.
