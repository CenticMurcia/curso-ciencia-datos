When I first saw in the DVD shop I thought it would be a nice show like Buffy or Angel, but I was wrong... IT WAS SO MUCH BETTER! This show is perfect. The first few episodes it was a little slow (and I mean little) but it started to pick up speed and it snowballed and its just each breath-taking episode after each other now.<br /><br />There were so many themes and metaphors that I was impressed that they managed to include on a television program. This isn't a kids show (although it is safe). It makes you think and not just about the actual show, but about your own life and what you believe.<br /><br />Definitely the best show I have ever seen. It's like watching heaps of awesome movies after each other. I have laughed, cried and been incredibly shocked by this show. It is simply superb.<br /><br />I thought Angel and Buffy were good... they really don't compare to Hex. Each script, character, stunt, special effect, camera technique is done perfectly. The opening theme... I honestly can't describe how good this show is without raving.<br /><br />Don't be discouraged by my enthusiastic answer either, I am very critical when it comes to film and television, I am a film maker myself. This show is way beyond its time and better then anything I have ever seen.
