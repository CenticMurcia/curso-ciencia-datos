Seriously, I did cry, but this wasn't an overly sappy film. I read in most of the comments that it was too sappy for some viewers. Yeah, you might cry, but rightfully. "Mask" is an excellent story. Rocky is a teenager who is very horribly disfigured. But he keeps his spirits up and just wants to fit in with the rest of the world. Cher plays his mother who is a biker chick. She loves him to death. And Rocky makes wonderful friends on the way through his life. It's a wonderful movie. I thought the story was very good and the actors were great. If you enjoyed movies like "Powder" or "Huntchback of Notre Dame", I think you would like this. I would highly recommend this film. Don't be afraid to cry.<br /><br />9/10
