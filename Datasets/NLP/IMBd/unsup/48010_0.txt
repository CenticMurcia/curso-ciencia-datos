I wanted to see what was out there for Lovecraft stuff to get in the mood for Halloween and came up with this movie. An absolutely stupid choice of lead actor combined with a really bad script makes the whole thing kind of "Killer Tomatoes" cool.<br /><br />This kind of thing happens in the story: They go into some underground tunnels beneath a graveyard with no plan, no guns, no secret charm, just Don Knotts and Mr. French going to see if the monster that killed 4 people last night is still there. They find this crazed demon-infested girl and reach near it's hugely-fanged face to pull out a hair to study. Just one dumb idea after another.<br /><br />My favorite part? Check out the sound it makes when the deputies are shooting the lock at the end.<br /><br />I didn't see the first movie, but I don't think I needed it to review this.
