I couldn't agree more with the positive comments on this film. First, the way the film captures grimy, raw Manhattan of the early 70's, beginning with a roaming helicopter shot of the city. OK, the film is slated under the genre of "Blaxploitation". Is it? Who cares, I love them all. If they could only make films like this these days, instead of poor attempts at remakes of classics (Shaft, for example). Although it would be near difficult to get actors nearing the talent of Quinn and Koto. Excellent casting throughout the film for that matter. Yaphett Koto also appears the same year in "Live and Let Die.", probably one of the best 007 movies ever. He puts in a marked performance in that film as well. Pick this movie up (may prove difficult at outlets the likes of Blockbuster) and enjoy the acting, photography, stunts, music (Bobby Womack) etc. You will recognize some other faces in this film including Burt Young (non-speaking role)(Rocky films) and Antonio Fargas (aka - Huggy Bear/Starsky & Hutch).
