Not a few critics have written negative reviews about this film for being too melodramatic. What is so wrong about a film which makes its viewers shed tears because of its sheer beauty? This film about a young boy who has so much love to give certainly won the hearts of its viewers, to hell with the critics. Personally, I think it is one of the best Filipino films ever made, and its two awards from the Berlin Film Festival should serve as proof of its greatness. I'd like to think of this film as the Philippines' humble contribution to world cinema. I believe that viewers around the world should not be deprived of movies such as this, which offer the message of hope and love, as opposed to the depravity prevalent in today's cinema.
