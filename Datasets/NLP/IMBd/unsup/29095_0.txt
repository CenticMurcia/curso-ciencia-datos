I thought this film was a really good thriller & didn't have any of the cliches these films often have, like screaming lovely American girls running round in circles.<br /><br />Spoilers:<br /><br />I was totally gripped from start to finish, so was everyone I went with and thought there was some good acting. Of course it had faults. The house was made out to be bigger than it was and like Fort Knox to get out of in one scene. The lack of Police presence & also, the ending, revealing that, in a sense nobody was responsible nor any reason for the deaths certainly lost it a mark.<br /><br />The real problem with this film was that it came out after a good genre like 'teen slasher' has been flogged to death. i thought it was better than anything of this exact topic. Unfortunately (& like the action films that try to copy Die Hard) we've really seen it all before. Shame though, as this was excellent. <br /><br />8/10
