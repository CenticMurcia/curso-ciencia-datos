When I saw this film, I was blown away by Christopher Plummer's portrayal of the Incan leader, Atahualpa. I originally saw the film because of Leonard Whiting (Romeo in the Franco Zefferelli film "Romeo and Juliet," opposite Olivia Hussey as Juliet), who plays a young member of Pizarro's party. Plummer was able to accurately capture the essence of the Incan leader, with great pride and dignity, despite his fatal flaw of trusting the representative of a culture whose only goal was domination and oppression. This story was also brilliantly presented in the Newberry Award-winning children's novel, "The Secret of the Andes," by Ann Nolan Clark, about a young boy who is the last remaining pure Incan, living in the Andes with his spiritual guide and teacher, who goes on a journey of discovery into Cuzco, to find out what contributed to the eradication of his race. Unfortunately, I have been unable to find this film to either rent or buy, but if you are able to obtain a copy, it is well worth watching. The title of the film is tied to the Incans' worship of the sun (their monetary unit is the "sol," which is "sun" in Spanish).
