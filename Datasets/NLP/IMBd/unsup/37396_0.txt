This is a slow moving drama with big name stars, but falls short of being memorable. Humphrey Bogart is an independent gunrunner in Damascus in 1925, when Syria is fighting off the occupation of French military invaders. Bogart is far from his best. Others in the cast are: Lee J. Cobb, Everett Sloane, Zero Mostel and Marta Toren.
