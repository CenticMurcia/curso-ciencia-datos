This movie was one of the best films I have seen in a long time! My kids loved it! It was nice to see a film that actually has a message as well as an adventure! <br /><br />There are a lot of plot empty movies out there! More like crappy ones with not point! This is not one of them! It has something for everyone in it. <br /><br />I saw this in the Sedona Film Festival and plan on going to it this week in the Phoenix Film Festival! <br /><br />I am taking my kids and some of our friends and family! I can't wait to cry, laugh, and enjoy the ride this movie takes you on again! I recommend everyone go see it.
