This was terrible.<br /><br />With the amount of talent and experience the team has, I am amazed that they produced such a poor example of "Science Fiction". Besides lacking any true originality or mystery, the characters and events utterly failed to be believable. The plot is furthered by leaps and bounds of crooked logic and the musical score tries too hard to compensate for it. I felt that I was watching a cheap ripoff of an episode of Outer Limits (which itself is not a fantastic example of the genre). When I started watching, I hoped to be intrigued and forced to think. Unfortunately, the message was insultingly obvious.
