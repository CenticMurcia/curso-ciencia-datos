Airwolf is one of the most enjoyable series from the 80's. There is not much to say about it rather than it's got terrific story line, music and it's fully action packed. The Pilot starts of the series by the helicopter being stolen by its creator Dr. Charles Henry Moffett, who sells it to Libyan mercenaries. One of the deputy director of the agency which developed Airwolf, calls for the help of a reclusive pilot who agrees to help them only if they locate his brother Sinjin who is MIA in Nam. Hawke successfully recovers Airwolf, but keeps it for himself because the agency, known as the FIRM, wasn't able to locate his brother. As long as Hawke is keeping Airwolf, the FIRM will keep looking for his brother but also Hawke has to fly Airwolf for the FIRM missions in return. <br /><br />The pilot episode is mostly talk and less action, but you will find the story to be quite entertaining. Well that's all folks, see it for yourself and you'll start to like it.
