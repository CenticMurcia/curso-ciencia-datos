Bored to death is really the best I can say about this movie.<br /><br />I didn't really expect a good film, I was just looking for a way to kill some time. Well, I should have done something else.<br /><br />Although this movie is enlisted as "Mystery / Thriller", I found no thrilling elements. There was some mystery in it, but then again, in most cases, it was only a conglomeration of supposedly mysterious elements - that were not that mysterious. In other cases it was simply pointless and didn't contribute to the plot or it was just inexplicable nonsense that didn't have any connection to the plot.<br /><br />To sum it all up: the acting is OK, so is camera work and so on. However, the plot is just...stupid and I was not once thrilled or scared while watching this.<br /><br />If, one day, you have nothing else to do, you might be tempted to watch this movie. I suggest: do something else.
