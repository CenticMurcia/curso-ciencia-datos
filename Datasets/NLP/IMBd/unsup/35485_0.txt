Oh Lord...haven't we had enough??? Another predictable, stereotypical "gay" movie. Admittedly I was expecting much more from this film, based on the plot summary on the DVD case. What I experienced was a slow, painful-to-watch piece of drivel that I just couldn't wait for to end. Fortunately the film was mercifully short, and I was left with "huh???" The hit-and-run plot was so thin it was practically invisible. Couldn't they at least have provided some backstory as to why the cowboy was so distraught over the death of this unseen "boyfriend"? This movie was nothing more than the worst of the worse in soft porn, with the physical attributes of the cowboy being the only thing that this movie has to offer. NEXT!!!
