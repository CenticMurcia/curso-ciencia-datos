This show is so incredibly bad that it boggles the mind. I'm a really big Iron Chef fan (of the original Japanese show) and this was just so bad to watch. Most of the people that watch the original consider this to be an insult to the original.<br /><br />- Takeshi Kaga is the chairman of the original show. He's wacky, he wears strange outfits, and he's got a voice that they didn't dub because they couldn't find anyone to replace him. This show has.. *cough* William Shatner. He can't even begin to compare. He's fake and just not good. Pricewatch is more up his alley.<br /><br />- The general feeling of the show is just bad. Kitchen Stadium is where the original show takes place. It is a place of reverence for food (sounds corny, I know); this show takes place in Kitchen Arena and is just pitiful. If you've ever watched the Japanese ones, you know how quiet the stands are because everyone is intrigued; in this, it's just people standing up and cheering for no reason.<br /><br />- What kind of judges did they pick? Bruce Vilanch is just a really, really sad "Hollywood Squares" dropout, and what kind of food critic is that Playboy chick? Pitiful. The Japanese critics might be really lame (like the fortune teller, heh) but they're much better than anything you'll see here.<br /><br />In general, this show is just a disgrace to watch. It doesn't have the feeling and respect that the first show has. FujiTV should be shamed for having granted UPN the rights to this show. Hopefully, it won't make it past the second show.
