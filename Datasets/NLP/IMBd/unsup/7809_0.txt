I liked this movie so much.<br /><br />Lana Turner was gorgeously cute and it was a very charming comedy in my opinion.<br /><br />Lana played Peggy Evans a store soda jerk in a New York department store. At the beginning of the movie she is given a merit certificate for being on time for a 1000 days straight. She feels that there is something more for her out in the world. So with a new look and a new name she is walking to the New York Star when disaster strikes - she is hit in the head with a bucket of paint. When she awakes people think she has amnesia and even though she hasn't - she goes along with it.<br /><br />Lana Turner was a much better actress than she was given credit for and really excelled in these frothy comedies.<br /><br />A very funny sequence at the start of the movie has Lana say "I can do this job blindfolded" and proceeds to make a banana split that way. This is what causes all the trouble in the first place.<br /><br />Robert Young is also in it as Bob Stuart, her boss at the department store and the only one who knows her secret. I movie I would recommend.
