As a new wheelchair user I learned more about driving a chair from this movie than from any other source. I've never seen any movie which shows as much detail of a guy in a chair and how he deals with everyday situations -- stairs, transfers, rough terrain, getting in and out of a car. Unfortunate translation of the title however.
