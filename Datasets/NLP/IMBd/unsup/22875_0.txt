A heartwarming story about a young woman, her daughter, her boyfriend (then husband)...and her battle with cancer. Christina Raines plays a young woman who is diagnosed with cancer, and rather then choosing to live her life handicapped, she chooses to live the rest of her life to the fullest. She sees life as we all should, for all it's beauty. She leaves her daughter her legacy on a series of tape recordings. Wonderful music by John Denver, sweetly performed by Cliff DeYoung. A real heart warming, tear jerking movie. I would love to obtain a copy of this wonderful film! If you can help, PLEASE email me.
