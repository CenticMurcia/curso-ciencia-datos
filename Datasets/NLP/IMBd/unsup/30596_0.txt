Despite the sweet title and the presence of Julie Christie, or perhaps, because of, this is not the pleasant movie one might, or might not have expected. Certainly when I first saw this upon release, having seen Lester's early b/w films, I was expecting another slightly arty avant-garde outing. But no, indeed this seems to have more than a touch of cinematographer, Nick Roeg. Think, 'Performance' with its darkness and 'Don't Look Now', with its edginess, heart stopping editing and Julie Christie and this film begins to find itself within a different context. Magnificently and correctly, of its time, this time capsule of a movie, captures exceedingly well that perturbing flip from 'swinging sixties' to murder and mayhem, and how true the moment when the 'in love' George C Scott skips across a room while the TV plays back images from the ongoing war in Vietnam. Scott is perhaps a little hard to believe as the casual lover (with good reason by all accounts!), Chamberlain, disturbingly believable and Christie, herself flipping from hip and happy to neurotic and self destructive. Very fine move, just not a very happy ride.
