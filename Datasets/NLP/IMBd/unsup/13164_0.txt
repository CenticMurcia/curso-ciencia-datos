The SciFi channel has knocked another one out of the park! First "Battlestar Gallactica" and now "The Lost Room." They will have more hits on their lineup than Fox for sure.<br /><br />This is an incredibly engaging drama and fascinating mystery. The characters are vivid without being "over the top." The actors have been given great material and they make the most of it.<br /><br />Having watched all six hours of the mini-series, it is hard to find fault with any aspect. The dialogue is smart without being gimmicky. When dialogue isn't necessary the writers don't feel obligated to give us "senseless chatter" and the camera isn't afraid to hold the actors' facial expressions which tell us volumes.<br /><br />The plot is very involved but its artfully divulged so we don't get overwhelmed or lost in the complexity. There are lots of "nooks & crannies" Â– some more relevant to the big picture than other, but all delicious in their own right.<br /><br />The central character, Joe Miller (Peter Krause), is easy to identify with. Much like Frodo in "The Lord of the Rings" he finds himself an unwilling participant in a plot much larger than himself. This plot has been playing out for many years before his involvement and has a "culture" of its own. This culture is as interesting to learn about as the plot it surrounds.<br /><br />Be prepared to be "sucked in." If this series were a book, you wouldn't be able to put it down.
