I wonder how Jane's HUSBAND BRADLEY WHITFORD felt about her nude scene in this one? She did this in 1999 and they have been married since 1992. If my wife did that I'd have had to fire her and set her stupid butt out on the curb and told her to wait there for the weekly trash pickup. That's what I'd do if MY wife showed her naked self to the whole world in a movie of which people will be viewing over and over for generations! I feel so sorry for her husband and her kids. How would any of you like it if that was YOUR wife or your mom whom uncounted perverts are (and will continue to be) viewing her naked and whacking off? They should feel mortified. This is something that a GOOD wife and mother would never have done. An unmarried woman would have been bad enough, but when it s a married woman, that IS in fact an act of adultery and so is lusting after a married woman too.<br /><br />IMDb solicited my comment so I gave it. Too bad if you choke on it.
