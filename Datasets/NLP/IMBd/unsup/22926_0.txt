What is your problem Roxy? You don't know what you're talking about! Freddie is awesome! I hate when people like you who obviously know nothing about talent try to judge! I've been operatically trained for 7yrs now and am about to go to school for vocal performance and I think Freddie's got a ton of talent! I also can't believe you're comparing Queen; one of the most contributing rock bands to the Spice Girls; talentless, daddy-did-not-love-me, girl powered, children! I, on the other hand believe is one of the greatest bands of all times... I have not got to hear all of this live album, but what I heard was entertaining! Maybe not their best performance, but still good!
