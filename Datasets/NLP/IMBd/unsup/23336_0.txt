OK about a month ago, the cable company was advertising the crap out NYM and to my surprise, it was a funny movie. What was more amazing the Olsen sisters aren't bad actors. NYM minute wouldn't be the type of movie I would pay $12.00 at the cinema (besides the shame factor), however if you do take the time to watch it, you might be amazed.<br /><br />I know there are going to be a lot people asking me why do I like this movie? The answer is simple it is easy to follow and it's down right hilarious. Sure NYM wouldn't last a New York Second during the theatrical release, but it is suitable for a quiet night at home.<br /><br />New York Minute may not be in the same category as House of Sand and Fog or Donnie Darko, but lets not forget it is a comedy.<br /><br />7/10
