I will start off by saying, I love stupid humor. I love movies like Talledega Nights, Dodgeball, 40 y/o Virgin, etc... This movie was the first movie I've ever walked out on. Ever. At first I didn't want to walk out. I kept thinking to myself "No, when Christopher Walken shows up, this movie will get better." Sadly it didn't. This movie used jokes that would've been funny about 10 years ago, and have since been beaten mercilessly into the ground. It seemed like the writers of this movie went about it the same way Nickleback goes about writing songs: they just recycled old stuff that was successful and hoped it would work again. Like I said, I very rarely dislike a movie, but this one just didn't do it for me.
