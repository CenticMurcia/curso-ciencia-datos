Valerie Harper is my favorite actress ever, but everybody in this show, including that sweetheart with the Betty Boop lips, Georgia Engel, is delightful and funny. To make a sitcom great, not everybody has to be funny. On I Love Lucy, Desi Arnaz was not really funny. On Seinfeld, Jerry and Elaine were not often funny. On Rhoda, David Groh was not funny, but he had three brilliant comediennes and Carlton the Doorman to be funny around him. The Mary Tyler Moore Show is that rare sitcom that allows everybody to be funny (The Golden Girls is another one.) The Rhoda show may be the best show ever but The Mary Tyler Moore Show is not far behind its greatness!
