In England, the American pathologist Dr. Richard Murray (Jeff Fahey) still grieves the death of his wife Carol (Geraldine Alexander) eight months ago in a car crash. He is drinking too much whiskey due to his guilty complex since he had a love affair with a woman when Carol left home, and he has frequent blackouts, forgetting what he has done in the previous drinking night. Meanwhile a serial-killer is attacking women in the location, and the experienced American cop DCI Collins (Martin Kove) and the psychologist Frances Beale (Kim Thomson) are invited to help the local police in the investigations. When Dr. Murray receives messages from beyond, he meets his friend Father Randall (Jon-Paul Gates) seeking spiritual support and explanation.<br /><br />"Messages" is the type of promising B-movie that is wasted due to a flawed, inconsistent and incoherent story, badly developed screenplay and terrible direction. For example, the pretentious Collins is an awful character and why would the British police asks for help to such a jerk? If the spirits could help the living, why Carol has not stopped the serial-killer in the very beginning of his crimes? The identity of the serial-killer is a silly twist and the character in a terrible collection of clichés. My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Mensagens do Além" (Messages From Beyond")
