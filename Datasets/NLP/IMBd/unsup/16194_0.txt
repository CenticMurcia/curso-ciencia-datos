Enduring Love is probably one of the most thrilling books I have ever read with its exciting storyline, memorable characters and--of course--McEwan's brilliant prose. I was very excited to find out there was a movie based on the novel, even though I stayed cautious, not wanting to be too disappointed.<br /><br />Fortunately, Enduring Love is a fine adaptation of its source material. Though it doesn't go as deep as the novel does, it certainly delivers as a smart, different type of thriller.<br /><br />Daniel Craig is one of the highlights of this film, playing the lead character, Joe, with intensity and believability. Seeing him bounce off Rhys Ifans in their awkward confrontations is equally entertaining as the latter portrays the antagonist, Jed Parry, with skillful nuance. Samantha Morton and Bill Nighy on top of all that ? Heck yes !<br /><br />Though many details have been altered, one can see that the filmmakers have a good feel for the novel because its atmosphere is brilliantly transferred to the screen. The first frantic scenes, the paranoia throughout, the looks the characters exchange, it feels right.<br /><br />The only true criticism I would have would be with the pacing. It suited me but someone who hasn't read the book and really got to know the characters might not really care about seeing some things happen and at such a contemplative pace.<br /><br />Anyway... A good film which I enjoyed, but if you want the full "Enduring Love" experience, get the book (preferably during your vacation ! ) and savor it!
