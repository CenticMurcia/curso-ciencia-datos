Just watched a rare showing of this obscure Allen Funt hidden camera movie on fancast.com. It lives up to the title when-in the beginning-a woman casually walks stark naked to an elevator asking for directions from various men walking by. From there, it goes on to frank discussions of sex to people of various ages and genders. There's also some interviews with underage kids who seem to think they know all but don't really. In fact, one of my favorite exchanges was when after Funt asked what a premature baby was, this boy said, "It's one who knows a lot for his age." LOL! I also loved seeing that scene with that red-haired woman when she faked an orgasm after getting spray-painted! And some of the reactions of the preview audience was priceless. So on that note, I highly recommend What Do You Say to a Naked Lady? P.S. Richard "Shaft" Rountree makes his debut here as part of an interracial couple seen kissing in order to get various reactions of people watching them.
