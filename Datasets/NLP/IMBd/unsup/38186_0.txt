Delta Force was really funny movie. It brought all the possible stupid elements of film-making into life. It was so funny that I haven't ever laughed as much as when I saw it for the first time. Only Bad taste has ever made me laugh louder, harder and longer. I gave it 3/10 and the points came from the comedic parts of it.<br /><br />Delta Force 2 (as DFII: The Columbian Connection) isn't funny at all. This movie really has no pros. Watching explosion has never been this boring. If I want to see explosions, I watch Winter War or Windtalkers. Watching U.S. special forces in action has never been this boring. If I want to see them, I watch news or play Delta Force series. This picture deserves a pure 1/10. Could movie get any worse?
