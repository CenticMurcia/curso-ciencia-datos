'Cry For Bobo' is almost wilfully incomprehensible. Its best gags are ripped off wholesale from The Simpsons' 'Krusty Gets Busted' episode, the remaining gags are insultingly bad, and the casting is ill-judged (note to filmmakers: when the sidekick's funnier than the lead your film's in trouble).<br /><br />The production values are very high for a short film- the costumes, sets & cinematography are all superb- but this really begs the question: why do funding commissions insist on throwing huge amounts of money at mind-numbing garbage like this?<br /><br />If you happen to catch 'Cry For Bobo' at a film festival, make better use of the 8 minute running time by going for a toilet break.
