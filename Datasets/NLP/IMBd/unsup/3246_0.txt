This film has been shown as a Christmas special for the last few years on TV. In my family it has become a tradition to watch this film on Christmas eve, though we know everything which will happen in the film, even most of the dialogue, by heart. It is a wonderful experience every time.<br /><br />The humor might, as has been pointed out, be lost on foreigners, but that hasn't hindered the film from being translated to more than 70 languages, and being shown somewhere in the world at any given time!<br /><br />I must say that it's a shame that it isn't available in the us, but I've heard rumors of a DVD release...which I certainly will buy for myself.
