I thought overall this movie was pretty good. It had good settings, characters, actors/actresses, music, and a good plot. What I don't like though is the way the movie is set up. I guess I'm not a big fan of Kenny Ortega's works. It reminded me a lot of High School Musical. It was all good except for the set up. I don't like when the songs in the movie are set up to be like a music video. If I wanted to watch a music video I would watch MTV or BET. The songs numbers need to be more realistic. How could 4 people in completely different places be singing the same song at the same time. How could 10 different dancers be dancing the same steps to the a song they've never heard with dance steps they've never seen. It kinda ruined the movie for me.
