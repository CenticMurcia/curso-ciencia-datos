Appalling commentary and people jumping off things.<br /><br />The first few seconds increased my adrenaline four fold – why was I watching this tosh? A gravely voiced doom-mongering narration of the story of our two heroes as they walk in slow motion across the desert. The photography of the base jumpers was good and the sky diving also, but that’s pretty standard stuff on IMAX these days. Meanwhile our narrator maintains his style with a delivery that you would normally find in trailers for cheap horror flicks. The film then descends into some stupid stuff about Leonardo’s’ original drawing of a parachute – will it work? They build it; they drop it from a plane with a guy holding on to it. At about 2000 ft from the ground he lets go (!) and lands using a modern parachute. Leonardo’s’ crashes to the ground – hardly a signal to uncork the champagne. A truly awful film with nice pictures.
