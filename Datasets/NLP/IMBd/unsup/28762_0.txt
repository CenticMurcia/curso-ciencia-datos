This film is is pure 80s crud. However it does have one obvious thing going for it. Attractive 80s female day-players running around half dressed! Not to mention the cut price Heather Lockleah ( Heather Thomas or possibly her double) in a state of undress- yummy! This also applies to the dead sexy Jewel Shepard !!!!!!!!!!! That is why I have awarded this masterpiece 2 out of 10, instead of 1! Apart from that is totally and utterly unwatchable. Scott Baio was and still is a third rate Steve Guttenburg. However I do like the UK video sleeve of this awful movie! But this was a long time ago. I can see why any actor involved in this rubbish is too ashamed to admit starring in it!
