A married older man has a fling with a younger woman leading to sex murder, suicide, gossip, cover ups and a lot of other fun stuff in this tv miniseries soap opera. Loosely based on the Bloomingdale scandal and a novel by Dominick Dunne, this movie is a typical trashy made for television fare that has a great cast and is very watchable..especially with DeMornay. a guilty pleasure. 7 of 10
