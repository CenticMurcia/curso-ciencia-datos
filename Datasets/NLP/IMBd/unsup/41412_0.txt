This movie is alright if you've got the remote in your hand in order to speed up the many painfully slow shots of people walking. (Perhaps I could have appreciated the photography more if the music wasn't so overbearing throughout).<br /><br />I really like Elisabeth Shue, but her lines were especially unnatural sounding. You can't make Jessica Lange look plain - it's not possible. But, kudos for trying.<br /><br />Most of the acting was actually fine, but the story line and some of the editing choices kept this movie from ever achieving any real since of rhythm.
