Although Patrick Swayze is at his best in the romantic and light humour films such as Fatherhood, To Wong Foo: Thanks For Everything; Julie Newmar, Dirty Dancing etc. 'Next of Kin' was definitely no disappointment for me. A would-be hillbilly-turn cop avenges his younger brother's murder in a lawful manner, while a third brother goes about it in typical redneck-hillbilly style, causing more problems and endangering them both, as well as the pregnant wife of Truman (Swayze). The best part has to be the graveyard scene, where Truman's whole family takes on the bad guys, but their brother's murderer ends up being shot by his own father! With an excellent twist to the end, this is nothing short of a good flick to have sitting around for a rainy day.
