I was suckered into paying to see this movie in the theater because of the title and because I like the actors.<br /><br />For 19 years now, this movie has been my standard by which to judge all terrible films.<br /><br />There was no excuse for the distribution of this film.<br /><br />Plodding, meandering, insulting to the intelligence of the viewer, and not a sufficient allegory for the cold war to have made it worth seeing.<br /><br />The only reason to watch this movie is to see how truly awful a movie can be.
