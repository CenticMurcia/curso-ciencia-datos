Silk is a mishmash of science fiction and horror which doesn't work in either field. Some scientists have captured a ghost boy in a room and want to study it. They bring in a super soldier type guy to help them and he proceeds to investigate the history behind the boy's death. The special effects in the movie start out OK, but get progressively worse as the movie nears the end until eventually it gets more and more ridiculous with each death of another character. The capper is when a ghost lady comes out of a bowl of noodle soup. I find it hard to believe the director could think this scene was going to be scary or effective, what was he thinking. The science is only hinted at and is explained away in a cursory fashion, it would have been more interesting to expand on the strange science theme instead of going for typical cheap scares which is what the movie devolves to in the conclusion. The movie has a lot of unnecessary subplots that take away from the atmosphere which can't decide between horror or science fiction or philosophy and ends up being a confused patchwork that doesn't work or jell together. I thought the lead scientist character (he is on a quest to be a ghost) was played too cheesy and it was hard to take him seriously. Although this movie had some creative ideas it had too many drawbacks to rate it higher.
