After seeing the previews I already had my suspicions. After seeing it, these were only confirmed. A lot like love from the same director Nigel Cole and this have something in common: A style that can best be described as lingering, setting some atmosphere without being very much to-the-point. I guess you have to like this but I'm more a fan of directors who do not spoil a frame or my time. Especially in the first half the whole story revolves around one joke: that it is inappropriate for civilized ladies to pose naked.(And that joke is only mildly interesting for those living in less puritan environments.) Although the sketchy way the death of John is handled is interesting that's about all there is in the beginning. Later more themes are thrown in: family problems, downsides of success, group tensions, contrast between parochialism and Hollywood.<br /><br />The small-town mentality is well portrayed and acting (especially Helen Mirren) is certainly a cut above average. But this is so targeted at a certain demographic and age group that everyone else seems to be forgotten in the script. Even the problems of Jem are mostly viewed from an older perspective.
