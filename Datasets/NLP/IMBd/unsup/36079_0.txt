One has to wonder what in the world was going on in Wesley Snipes's head when he accepted this stinker. The story is simple. The CIA develops a drug that makes people follow someone's commands offering no resistance. A dirty agent escapes with the drug. But there's a leak in his operation. A guy speaks to the CIA and now the bad guys need to know if it's safe to sell the drug. So they inject the drug in what they suppose is the CIA agent to make him talk. Unfortunately they inject the wrong guy (Snipes). Now not only does Snipes, who by the way is an ex military that carries a guilt (now that's original) has to escape from them but he also has to get the antidote or his brain will pretty much fry. The acting is awful. The script is filled with stupid situations just for the sake of blowing something up. There's no logic or even an attempt to make things slightly realistic or interesting. If you're into 'B Action' then maybe you'll get some enjoyment out of this. I like silly movies but this was too dull, too tedious and just too dumb.<br /><br />Plot holes, clich√©s, there's so much wrong with this it's a wonder how someone approved the script.
