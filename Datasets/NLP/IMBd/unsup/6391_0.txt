What a waste of time! I don't know what was more frustrating, a ridiculous plot that made little sense and seemed to go nowhere tortuously slow, the difficult-to-understand cockney accents, or the retarded cinematography. Yikes! How can this movie be in the IMDB top 250? Be forewarned, this movie SUCKS! There is a scene in the movie where a woman is bludgeoned with a large ceramic statue of a penis, and at the end, I felt as if I'd been similarly beat. I would bet that Stanley Kubrick probably smoked a phallic shaped crack vile for the inspiration to make this movie...nothing else makes sense! It oughta come with sub-titles, and while they're at it, make another movie.
