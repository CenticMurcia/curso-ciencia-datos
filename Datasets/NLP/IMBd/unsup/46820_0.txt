If you're expecting the hairy chest of David Hasselhoff and the retro cool Pontiac of KITT then don't bother with this movie. Purported to be loosely based on the original series it has no character called Knight, no reference to the Foundation for Law And Government and has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with Knight Rider. In fact, it's rubbish. A bounty hunter operating outside the law gets caught up in a love triangle with his former girlfriend and her disabled boss. Somehow he turns down a Ferrari, an AC Cobra and a 1950's piece of American automobile history to rebuild an old hot rod car, coating it in bulletproof material and making a computer that can talk. Hence the ability to trade on the Knight Rider brand. Aside from that, it's nothing other than an attempt to keep the name alive until Glen A. Larson finishes writing the script for the new Knight Rider movie, due out in 2008.
