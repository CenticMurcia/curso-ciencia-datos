The movie takes place during the Al Capone gangster era. Elliot Ness (Kevin Costner) and his untouchables wage war against Capone who ran prohibition and other various illegal activities in Chicago.<br /><br />This is a very well made and exciting movie. Connery, Costner, and Garcia deliver excellent performances as The Untouchables. One of the best things is that all the characters stay true to form and are easy to like throughout the whole movie. Definetely worth watching!
