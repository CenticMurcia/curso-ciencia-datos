The poster / DVD cover of this Thai / Cambodian co-production looks quite cool, however, the actual movie fails to deliver. We get lots of glimpses of the hair made of snakes (the image on the cover), but that's about all that's fascinating about this film. It lacks suspense, it lacks action, well it actually lacks everything. Some nice visuals don't make up for those lacks.<br /><br />I haven't seen that many Thai movies (yet) but those I have seen (among them the brilliant "Tears of the Black Tiger", the impressive "Nang Nak", the sensual "Jan Dara" and the entertaining "303 Fear Faith Revenge") made me curious for more. "Snaker" is the first disappointment in the territory. It's not completely bad, it's just not doing anything for me.<br /><br />Rating: 4/10 (and I'm being rather generous)
