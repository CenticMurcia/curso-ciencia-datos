The first segment with Vanessa Redgrave moved me to a point where I could not look at the screen. I know a lesbian couple who are in their seventies and they have not 'come out' to anyone in all these years. The film reminded me of this strange twilight world that they live in...very very sad. The second film was a good example of the transitionary period when lesbians were removing themselves from the femme/butch sterotypes. Women, gay or straight should be given the freedom to dress and behave as they wish. My favourite was the last segment for the simple reason that it was closer to home. Both females were funny and intelligent and a great chemistry was apparent between the two actresses. I loved it!
