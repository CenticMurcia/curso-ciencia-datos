..to regular teens? What normal teenager wants to watch or even cares about some spoilt brat who they have nothing common with screaming and shouting until they get their own way? MTV has started featuring the children of celebrities now as well. So not only do you have to be filthy rich to even have a chance of appearing on the show, you also need to have a famous singer or sport star for a parent. Its just a slap in the face for normal, respectful teenagers and their hardworking parents who would love to give their child a party to remember but don't have the money or the connections. MTV is also sending out the wrong messages with this programme. That everything is better if you have more money. They should start showing normal families who maybe only have a few thousand dollars saved up for their kid's sweet 16, and how even though they had a limited budget, it was still a night to remember. It would give the show a kind of feel-good quality, instead of all out greed and inconsideration.
