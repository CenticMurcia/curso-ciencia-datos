I enjoyed the film greatly. It is extraordinary clever and witty with original, incredibly amusing dialogues. I didn't want any action in the movie: it was enough just to look at the characters and to listen to their speaking. Besides, it's very moving: background is highly dramatic, though on the surface you find the funniest comedy. The real life is like that, you know  a short way from tragedy to the farce. The plot twists unexpectedly but so naturally that I never doubted the possibility of such events. Actors' works are outstanding. Jack Nicholson is the unique actor, he gives an unforgettable performer as Melvin Udall. Helen Hunt is excellent: expressive, spirited, and stylish. You feel every emotion of Carol and sympathize with her. Greg Kinnear showed all his abilities in the part of Simon  the most convincing and likable gay character I've ever seen. I also admire Shirley Knight as Carol's mother  perfect! My favourite moment is that at the end of the movie where she listens behind the door and suddenly pops out to explain that `normal boyfriends' don't exist. It was great  so funny and so true! According to the story there is no such thing as `normal people' in the world, we are all crazy. So never mind being crazy  life is just as good as it gets! Both of lead actors deserved their Oscars, however two awards are too little for such film. At least, screenwriter and director must have had Oscars. And why there is no special award for `the best animal in the film'? Verdel is an irresistibly attractive creature, and so talented! The film entertains you and touches your heart deeply, makes you smile, laugh and cry, but never depress or bore. 10/10 in every sense.
