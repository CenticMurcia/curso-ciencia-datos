The less said about this dismal feature, the better. If you ever wonder why a feature is released straight to video, rather than to theaters first, look no further for a reason than this wretched mess. Supposedly produced as a homage to 1950s "Big Bug" thrillers, it has appalling dialogue (The "F" word is used scores of times), grotesque, un-frightening horror effects, mechanical spiders that look fake, and an absurd batch of mean-spirited, foul characters, badly acted. The leading lady, in particular, is ill-suited for the role, one of the most annoying characters ever, and the worst female performance since Maria Putillo in "Godzilla" (1998). They knew how to make them back in the Golden Age, not evident here.
