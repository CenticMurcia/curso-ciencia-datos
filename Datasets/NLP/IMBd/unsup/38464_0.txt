It was the first movie I ever saw where i was about to stand up in my chair at the cinema and scream out loud "Can anything happened soon?'.<br /><br />From the first scene to the last you can almost predict everything. The stories are told in such a dull matter, that it doesn't really matter that a couple of the actors also preformed fairly poor. <br /><br />They blew the highlights by running the camera like it was beck or something. They never tried to create the moods that were appropriate for the scenes - everything felt like it was rushed and moments that were sad or romantic wasn't directed good enough to give you time to reflect - making it seem flat, meaningless and boring.<br /><br />It's been a lot of great movies from norwey in the past years, but this isn't worth it at all.
