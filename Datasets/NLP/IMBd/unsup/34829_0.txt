This movie did make me feel for the woman because of her illness, and for the cancer it made me feel like she has hope... of dieing.<br /><br />Her illness is that she is 100% materialistic and shallow and has no idea of how to live a happy life and even the fact that she is dieing, which she finds out as the movie begins, cannot seem to give her any willpower to think on how to really find any real substance to what life she has left.<br /><br />Not only does she seem to live in a void of meaning, but the entire movie and the way the effects are used seem to emphasize emotions to things that have no meaning whatsoever, as if the people behind the plot of the movie have no substance, and no understanding of any better ways to bring some color in to life then buying new curtains and such.<br /><br />Even though events take different turns towards the end, she still doesn't learn anything new, and the movie remains with the same shallow thought that is started out with: spend more, take risks and you'll be happier.<br /><br />To be fare, if buying stuff is the best thing you can imagine, if it is all you live for, then this movie probably isn't all bad for you.
