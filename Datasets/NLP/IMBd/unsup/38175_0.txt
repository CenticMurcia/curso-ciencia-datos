When the FBI comes to investigate the shady dealings of a physician in a remote hospital who is attempting to resurrect the recently dead, he dumps his test subjects in a swamp. Unfortunately, his experiments have been successful and the subjects rise as zombies and attack a group of science students.<br /><br />Swamp Zombies is a fun, fast moving "B" horror movie with lots of (fast moving) zombies, some decent martial arts fighting scenes, a fair amount of female partial nudity and an entertaining enough story.<br /><br />The acting isn't particularly good and the dialog is a bit cheesy at times, but this is still a fun movie for those who like these low budget horrors. It's not a classy, high production values art film, but it is entertaining enough for a watch...or maybe even two.
