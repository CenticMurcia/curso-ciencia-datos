In theory, it's a great idea for a black comedy: a school-kid calls a prostitute while his parents are away, and ends up running a brothel. But in truth 'Risky Business' is not so comic (the pace is too slow), and not even very black: the hookers are so sweet that they don't even ask for the money beforehand, and even their pimp gets up to nothing worse than stealing a bit of furniture. In fact, films like 'American Pie', which may be thought of as more modern equivalent of this 1980s movie, are (for good or bad) massively more vulgar and direct when it comes to presenting sex. What they have in common is a certain kind of teenage-wish-fulfilment vibe. This film, as befits its age, also features a capitalist morality and the oddly unattractive (to contemporary eyes) fashions of its times. The soundtrack, however, is more 1960s than 1980s, for reasons that are hard to fathom. Add in some fairly wooden acting, and the fact that a certain sort of teenage boy (such as those in this movie) is not the easiest type of character for others to sympathise with, and the result is more tiresome than fun or telling. But it's odd how a film about prostitution can make one feel nostalgic for a gentler age of cinema than the one we have now.
