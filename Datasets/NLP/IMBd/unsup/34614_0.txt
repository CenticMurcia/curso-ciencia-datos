I'm not going to summarize, as it's not worth my time.<br /><br />There actually were some talented actors in this film, so I can't believe that it turned out this bad! The costuming was terrible--fake hair, mustache's and beards abound...I'm surprised that they didn't use elastic strings to keep them on rather than the standard spirit gum! I've never seen such bad costuming, ever! The sets were cheesy and obvious. The dialog was marginal at best. Good Lord! Did someone need a tax write off or something?<br /><br />I even tried to call it campy fun, but the label just doesn't fit. I think I want the two hours of my life I spent watching it back...who do I have to talk to for that?<br /><br />Don't waste your money...not even to rent the DVD.
