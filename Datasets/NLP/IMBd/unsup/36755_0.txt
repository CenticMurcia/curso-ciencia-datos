The duplicity, hypocrisy and sexual aberrance of the fanatically religious makes them fodder for gargantuan quantities of side splitting hilarity. Is this show splitting hilarity? No. Is it funny? That's a tough call... Clever. In parts. Very few parts. Moral Orel clocks in around 10% on my clever meter.<br /><br />As far as the other 90% goes, it's slow, sad and a little depressing. I can watch a Mooninite centered episode of ATHF, laugh my ass off and walk away from the television feeling pretty good about myself. On the other hand, if I watch something like South Park, I'll laugh quite a bit, but after it's over, it leaves me feeling a tiny bit blah. It's not like a want to put a gun to my head, but it's also not like I get an urge to frolic outdoors.<br /><br />This show has 1/4 the laughs of South Park but 4 times the dirty feeling you get after watching it. I can be as nihilistic as the next GenXer, but this is a little too depressing for my taste.<br /><br />Other than the show being so sad... the writing is not that great either. Other than the same jokes being repeated show after show after show, the plot is pretty much being driven by Orel's stupidity. 10% clever premise filled in with 90% filler.<br /><br />The one thing I will say is consistently good about the show is the animation. The animation shows quite a bit of creative flair, especially the end credits.<br /><br />The negatives, though, far outweigh the positives.
