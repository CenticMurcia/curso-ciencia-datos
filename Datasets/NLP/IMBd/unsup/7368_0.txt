I saw this movie today and WOW! This film is one of those rare good films that you don't see anymore now this day and age. First off it's amazing how a film with such a low budget, came out AMAZING!!!! I laughed, I cried, and fell in love with the characters! This movie is not only GREAT for adults but kids as well! It can reach all ages. This film is truly original, no computer graphics, and it doesn't need any either! I am so encouraging you to see this movie! I don't even like plane movies and I can't stop raving about it! Rocco has directed a truly fantastic film worth seeing! Also fantastic acting! I will definitely be getting this movie on DVD!
