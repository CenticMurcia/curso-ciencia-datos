I've watched this movie 4 times. What so unusual about that is, that I am for capital punishment. Based on actual events, this movie recounts the transformation of a man sentenced to death by guillotine or in French slang "widow". While he awaits to be executed, he performs "community service" for an army captain's wife.<br /><br />There are two love stories I found in this movie. The most obvious one, the captain and his wife. He has so much faith and trust in her, that even as people rumour about his wife, he defends her to the bitter end. The other love story is that of human kind. Madame La, is fully aware of the horrible act the prisoner has committed, but she has enough guts and gumption to prove that behaviors can "change".<br /><br />This movie leans towards anti-capital punishment but it does not preach that at all. Madame La, like Dead Man Walking's Sister Helen Prejan, is capable of seeing through even the worst evil, and finding compassionate remorse in their fellow human beings. I don't necessarily agree with them but I must admire them for they truly understand the best and worst of human nature. Maybe that's why I watched it so many times.
