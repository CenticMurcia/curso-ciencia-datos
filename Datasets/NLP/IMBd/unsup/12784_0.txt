One of the Weirdest Movies of All Time!!! Imagine Ed Wood, Dario Argento, the Coen Brothers, Sid & Marty Kroft,The Evil Dead, Alice in Wonderland, Rocky Horror, Natural Born Killers, MTV, Kenneth Anger, Ernie Kovacs, Willy Wonka, Kill Bill, Monty Python, Terry Gilliam, Tim Burton, Herschell Gordon Lewis, Teletubbies, Battle Royale, and the Banana Splits -- all crammed into a blender! I've never seen so many silly cinematic tricks crammed into a single movie. Outrageous and hilariously entertaining. It's hard to believe it's the first-time effort of a Japanese director in 1977. He sure had fun experimenting, and I sure had fun watching. Midnight movie fans: DON'T MISS IT!
