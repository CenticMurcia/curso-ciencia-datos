Although the movie starts well, its plot twists and awful acting make this movie bad, painfully bad.<br /><br />In it's first scenes I thought the movie was promising, and it kept me going for like 20 minutes, without complaining, but when the plot begins to twist, I began to think that it was not worth watching, and then that it's one of the worst movies of the year. But When Ziyi Zhang started playing villain, the last drop of hope felt, Zhang's performance is probably the worst performance i've ever seeing, her efforts to sound sexy are in vain, no movie lover will find one of the worst performances ever, sexy. Quaid never impressed me so much, and this one is not an exception, he commits an unacceptable mistake of acting, he doesn't seem real sometimes, the least I want from an actor is for his performance to sound and look real.<br /><br />Like I said, the beginning was promising, but the plot twists are so unbelievable and dumb, that when the final twist came, I could not believe that I wasted two hours of my life watching the worst serial killer movie I had ever seeing, when I could be watching "The Silence Of The Lambs" again.<br /><br />Verdict: This is not the movie that's worth watching because it's too bad, it hurts and insult your intelligence, and by don't watching it, you will save yourself for having Zhang's performance in your mind.
