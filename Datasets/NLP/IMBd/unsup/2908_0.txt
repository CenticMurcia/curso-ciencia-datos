Good show about a river boat plying it's way from town to town in the old south giving song and dance performances to the entertainment starved locals. Along the way a suave dude who makes his living as a card player meets the show boat owner's daughter and goes off the deep end. Things are great until his old life beckons and he becomes a wanderer again. Well worth seeing with a 2 hanky ending.
