Vantage Point really didn't have any redeeming qualities. It really failed on all fronts, none of the technical aspects were especially good (but, to be fair, not especially bad either), and the story was so mottled it just got annoying. The concept was kind of interesting, and I guess executed well but without a solid plot to begin with it doesn't really matter. The acting was alright, it wasn't terrible but wasn't anything Oscar worthy either. The thing that got me with this movie was how the plot dragged on...and on...and on. For a thriller that is supposed to be action packed and only an hour and twenty minutes long, I was actually dumbfounded at how bored I was only half an hour in, and how painful the idea of another hour of this nonsense was to me. The plot is pretty basic, the President is shot and people have to find out who shot him and why. If you've seen any movie like this before (and don't let the concept of the film throw you, it is just another political thriller like the Bourne movies) you can pretty much figure out what's going to happen before it does or won't be surprised at anything that happens. The problem with the 8 viewpoints concept is that instead of adding to the scope of the film, it really limits it. You see the same events happen 8 times, and by the third time I was sick of it. The fact that the film conveniently decides to start over right before a plot twist is revealed just tells me that it didn't have much of a plot to begin with, along with the fact that a rather large twist regarding the president is revealed IN EVERY SINGLE TRAILER FOR THE FILM. This movie is garbage, I would have been happy with a basic thriller with a concept and it couldn't even manage to deliver that. If you want to see a good film with this concept, see Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon, not this one.
