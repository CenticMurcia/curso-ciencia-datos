I am a fan of Henry Miller and have read many of his books. When I saw a DVD of "Quiet Days in Clichy" on my local video store's "Staff Pick's" shelf, I excitedly plucked it off and read the back.<br /><br />It sounded great, an artistic rendition of one of Miller's works. I took it home practically rubbing my hands.<br /><br />As the previous reviewer commented, the acting is abysmal. Painful to watch. What a disappointment.<br /><br />The photography is good. There are some (filming) tricks employed, but do nothing to salvage this failure.
