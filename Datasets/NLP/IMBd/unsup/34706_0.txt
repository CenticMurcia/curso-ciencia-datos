I am so disappointed but still giving it 3 out of 10. First of all heroine is a stripper who whenever thinks, thinks herself either with her boyfriend on bed or naked in bath. Really disgusting. Story line is not awful but the direction and dialogs are extremely weak. She said "ANYBODY, SOMEBODY, LIAM" Millions of time in this movie and all the time, emotionless. The special effects are so amateur that my 8 year old brother can tell that its funny. And again the whole film was predictable and i presumed before every scene that it was going to happen. So Bad. Grim Reaper is a ghost type creature and when she her her boy friend hide behind crates right in front of the Grim Reaper, the Stupid ghost did not see them. Please Please Please do not see this movie in theater
