I rented this movie in the video store for my six year old daughter. It carried the Disney label and had some cute raccoons on the front. The movie started out with a narrator talking in a dry, boring, documentary style about developers destroying raccoon habitat in the 1960s to expand Tokyo. Then the raccoons form two armies and square off against each other. Suddenly they transform into Ninja, Sumo, and Samarai raccoons - male raccoons drawn anatomically correct and without pants. Violence and mayhem ensued and I hit the stop button as soon as I got over the shock of the visual assault on my six year old.<br /><br />The Disney label used to mean something. I thought I could count on a Disney movie being suitable for the whole family, but not anymore. I'm sure the violence in this move will appeal to boys between the ages of 10 and 12, but I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone else.
