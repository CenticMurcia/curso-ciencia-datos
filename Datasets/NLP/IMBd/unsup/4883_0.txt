This movie came from out of nowhere (as did Michael Keaton) to be one of the funniest movies around. Keaton's character of Billy Blaze was so over the top funny that it was worth seeing over and over and over again. Perfectly countered by Henry Winklers low key Chuck.<br /><br />The supports characters were great as well - the future inlaws, the judge, the pimps, the Sandwich delivery guy; even the Dog. All lines written and delivered to perfection. All characters (no matter how small) were memorable.<br /><br />I read the original script for Night Shift recently and it was not NEARLY as funny as the movie became - CUDOS to cast and Director Ron Howard for taking this modest comedy to the next level. Every scene that was intended to be funny made you crack up. The scene in the Courtroom; the girl scout on the elevator; the finale in the Club.<br /><br />In my opinion, Ron Howards best movie (along with Possibly Parenthood).<br /><br />Also, look for appearance in this movie by such future stars as Kevin Costner, Shannon Doherty, and Richard Belzer.<br /><br />
