Waiting to Exhale is guided thoroughly by a hot soundtrack from beginning to end. It is also complimented by sharply shot scenes and attractive locales. However, much of this is wasted on poor character development. Without likeable characters, this plot sinks quickly and doesn't recover. What should be shown is complex identities that the women have, but instead viewers are shown superficial confusions of the women which makes them out to be dumb and non-rational leading ladies. While the movie is supposed to highlight the women, and have males as supporting characters, the plot so demonized the men that even the "nice" men such as Gregory Hines and Wesley Snipes seem entirely out of place and more token goodness than believeable characters. <br /><br />Worst of all, were some vastly misplaced and undesirable scenes, which I honestly hope were either more deeply probed in the book, or not part of the book at all. For instance, why was the fact that Gloria's former man is gay/bi-sexual even remotely important to this script. Clearly the answer is that it isn't. Gloria's character did not need that type of nonsense to provide a background that she could work with. Why the director didn't see this, I don't know.<br /><br />Weak film, waste of acting talent by wonderful actresses like Angela Bassett, and a brutal waste of an excellent soundtrack by Babyface.<br /><br />4/10
