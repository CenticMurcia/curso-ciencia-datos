Some movies are just plain awful, and ZAPPED! has awful written all over it. Scott Baio stars as a high school kid who gains telekinetic powers after experiencing a scientific mishap. The movie is a trial to sit through and does not contain a single laugh. It is even worse than MODERN PROBLEMS and that movie was bad enough. I was never really a Scott Baio fan, although he did have a good role on TV's "Happy Days," but ZAPPED! is quite easily the worst teen movie I have ever seen in my whole life.<br /><br />0 out of 5
