"Lust for a Vampire" is the second in Hammer's Karnstein vampire trilogy.The other two were "The Vampire Lovers" and "Twins of Evil".Carmilla Karnstein is revived in a black magic ceremony and enrolls into an exclusive girls' school.Novelist Richard LeStrange is visiting the area in search of the truth behind the legends surrounding nearby Castle Karnstein and falls in love with Mircalla. "Lust for a Vampire" is definitely the weakest of the three films.It offers some moments of eroticism and Ralph Bates is excellent as the intensely creepy Barton.The story is thin,the film is cheap-looking and the pop song used in it 'Strange Love' is glaringly awful.However if you enjoy watching bare female bodies give it a try.7 out of 10.
