A thoroughly pointless film; the pretentious, pseudo-artsy direction doesn't match the kinky, trashy material. You can't make an "art" film simply by presenting a series of carefully designed pictures; you must have something meaningful to say. And you just as sure can't make a horror film simply by dealing thematically with vampires; you also need some scares (the movie's one potentially scary scene - in a shower - is badly edited). I'm sure the lesbian overtones had seemed daring back in 1971, but today they can't make the film worth your effort. (**)
