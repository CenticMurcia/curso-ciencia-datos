Can't believe that they are making a new film version! This is the creme De la creme and anyone who knows and loves the novel would see that it as near perfect as one could get!! All the characters are fully realised and perfectly cast, down to the smallest part, for example Maria Lucas who (as far as I know) has been left out of every other adaptation! There are one or two slight script errors (which only people who have watched it one thousand times like me would spot!!) but the acting is almost flawless- special nod should go to David Bamber as Mr Collins who has jumped from Miss Austen's 'little square of ivory' direct to the screen!- and all praise to the excellent Alison Steadman and Benjamin Whitrow and there will never be a prettier Lizzy Bennet (sorry Keira!!). A two hour film could never capture what a six hour mini series can and I can only think that loads will have been missed out!In my parallel universe this would have been a film on general release and would have won the 'big five' at the Oscars for Best Picture, Director, Actress (Ehle) Actor (Firth) and adapted screenplay (Davies) as well as nods for Supporting Actor for Bamber (Whitrow would also have been nominated!) and Supporting Actress for Alison Steadman (Susannah Harker would also have been nominated!) as well as costume design make -up etc!!!
