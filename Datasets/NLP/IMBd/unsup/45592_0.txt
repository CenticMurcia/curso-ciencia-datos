The main problem with Barton Fink is that nothing really happened. It never manages to lift itself above the averageness present from the start. Writer's block is not a very interesting subject, as it's just a man sitting around thinking about what to write. I am actually suffering from writer's block right now, trying to think of something to say about this film. I'm not really sure what it was trying to show and why it is thought of as a good film. The whole thing was a bit stupid and sometimes it felt like watching paint dry. I am not a massive Coen fan so this film did not appeal to me as it did to many other people. Having said that, I don't really see the appeal as it was a very bland storyline. John Turturro never seems to change and I have never been impressed by any of his performances. I didn't actually realise this film was a comedy until afterwards so it obviously wasn't very funny. The idea of showing Hollywood's 'darker side' is a concept it tried to use but didn't manage it very well. Mulholland Drive (2001) uses this concept much more effectively. Speaking of Mulholland Drive, I noticed Mr Fink flaunts a hairstyle that is most definitely copied from somewhereÂ…a famous David Lynch film; I won't spell it out to you. Anyone that loves The Coen Brothers will probably like this film, but it might seem a bit boring to anybody else. So there you go, it looks like I have managed to squeeze out a paragraph, which is more than Barton Fink managed to do.
