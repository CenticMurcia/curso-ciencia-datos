I used to watch this show religiously. Yes, I consider it equal to going to church.<br /><br />Keith has a way of lightening up the news while making important points.<br /><br />He can be depended up to bring in the very best commentators to back up his own commentary and give us the real facts behind today's news.<br /><br />Yes, it has a liberal bias, but then the truth is the truth, and Fox News needs to have something to counteract the falsehoods.<br /><br />I enjoy Olbermann because he just doesn't take himself seriously and her certainly has fun bursting the overly inflated egos of those who do not have America's interests at heart.
