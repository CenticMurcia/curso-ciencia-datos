It starts off with Anita Ekberg being attacked by an escaped lunatic. She survives but is institutionalized. A Dr. Greene (Harry Townes) becomes obsessed with her. Next thing we know she's playing a "stripper" called Yolanda. Crime reporter Bill Sweeney (Philip Carey) falls for her and Greene doesn't like that. Also there's a murderer around and it seems Yolanda may be his next victim...If that sounds disjointed you should see the movie! Hopelessly confusing and extremely dull piece of work. Ekberg is certainly gorgeous but no actress. Also her "stripping" has her not taking off anything! Then there's Gypsy Rose Lee as the owner of the "strip" club. At one point she gets on stage and sings (and "dances") to "Put the Blame on Mame"! Rita Hayworth has nothing to fear. There's also a hint of lesbianism (very daring for 1958) and a constantly barking dog named Devil! I'm probably making this sound more fun than it is. It's slow, confusing and dull with bad acting (except for Carey) and pointless musical numbers in the club to pad out the movie. This might be worth watching if you're an Ekberg fan or you want to see Gypsy Rose Lee--but it's rough going. A 1 all the way.
