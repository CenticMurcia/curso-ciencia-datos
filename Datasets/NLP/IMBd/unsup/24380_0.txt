A reasonably entertaining jungle action turkey. The plot has something to do with with the far east drugs war, CIA, young prostitutes and mercenaries. Fluffy indeed.<br /><br />Lots of pyrotechnics and gunplay make this one watchable, but bad acting and tremendously bad script work in the other direction.<br /><br />Released on video in Finland in the early eighties.
