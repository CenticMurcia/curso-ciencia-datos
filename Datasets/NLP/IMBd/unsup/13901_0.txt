Impressive. I watched this expecting to be disappointed. I've never had a movie surprise me like this, in fact, I'd say this is the only animated sequel I've seen that actually meets the standard of quality that its original set. The tears, the laughs... my kids actually were far more into this movie then they were the original. <br /><br />The artwork was detailed and intriguing. Bambi's facial expressions were superb. Sidekicks Thumper and Flower stayed true to their personalities, and all the various other animals were unique and interesting characters in their own rights.<br /><br />I'm amazed. And still laughing about those growling frogs!
