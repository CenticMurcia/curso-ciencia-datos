Once again Director/ Producer/ Actor/ Writer/ Editor/ Cinematographer Tony Zarindast has shown us the depths of his movie making skills in this Action Movie Classic. Hardcase and Fist has everything a hardcore action movie fan craves for; Good Guys you cheer for (Bud McCall and Eddy Lee) and Bad Guys you despise (Vincent and his cronies), exotic beauties (Maureen LaVette, Christina Lunde, Debra Lamb), a captivating story written by Tony Zarindast which has so many twists and turns that you'll be at the edge of your seat for the full 90 minutes, non-stop heart pounding ACTION!! Action sequences that never seem to end, and of course a terrific acting performance by Tony Zarindast who co-stars as Bud McCall's Lovable Vietnam War Veteran buddy `Tony Marino' he brings us maybe one of the best acting performances of ALL TIME. I give this movie a 10/10. So if there is one movie you must see make it Hardcase and Fist. Thank you TONY ZARINDAST for making this action movie classic you truly are a movie making LEGEND.
