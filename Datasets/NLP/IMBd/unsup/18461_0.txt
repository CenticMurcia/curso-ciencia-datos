It is difficult when making a film to stay true to the book, and that is why i believe that this version of Pride and Prejudice is one of the greatest films ever made.<br /><br />Everything in the film reflects the novel, including story lines, all of the characters and even dialogue. Once i read the novel, i expected the film to be nothing of it, however, this has proved me wrong. Every detail is correct and it is beautifully presented by this film.<br /><br />As well as this, all of the actors are fitted perfectly to their roles, with each of them managing to bring out the personalities of each character and giving them the life the Jane Austin created. The stern Mr. Darcy. The wise Elizabeth Bennet. The comical and dramatic mother of Mrs. Bennet. It is all here in this film.<br /><br />I have tried to find my faults with this film, and i have come up with none! It is very difficult to fault perfection.
