Okay, I am so fascinated with the "Sleepy Hollow" movies, but this one is the most inadequate one. The acting is horrible, the camera shots are worse, but this movie does hold a place in my heart, so I gave it a 7. It was an okay movie, Jeff Goldblum was not a good Ichabod though, but Butkus rocked. It always comes on here in Chicago the Wednesday before Halloween from 4 in the morning to 6. I have it now, it was released on video for some time.<br /><br />All in all, this is an average TV movie, and WOULD BE BETTER AS A "LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRARIE" HALLOWEEN SPECIAL. If you get a chance, check this out.<br /><br />
