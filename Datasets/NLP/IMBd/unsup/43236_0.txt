A boring night i was zapping thru the satellite channels. When i came to Norwegian channel 3 my yaw dropped to the floor with a loud bang, then i started to laugh and didn't stop until the end credits. This must be the silliest so called movie i ever have seen. The whole thing just screams "we have no money to do this but we are going to do it anyway." and the story is not a story, it's a single plot point "some ants eats some guys". The so called script is heavily based on the idea that it's impossible to run from ants so when the ants (the black dots with legs) attacks, the characters just stands in a corner and screams until they are eaten. This is really one of those so-bad-it's-funny movies where nobody involved in the making never understood how bad the whole idea was until it was to late, so i recommend it to everybody who likes bad movies.
