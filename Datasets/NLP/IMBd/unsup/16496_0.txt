Tobe Hooper's little seen remake of genre "classic" THE TOOLBOX MURDERS is a wicked little exercise in fear, terror and all-out horror. This creepy tale centers around an old-Hollywood style apartment building where tenants move in, but never seem to move out. Angela Bettis (tv's "Carrie") give a solid performance as a new resident who suspects something more sinister than her neighbour's scene-readings are taking place when she beings hearing noises, hammering and screaming emanating from within the walls of the building itself. No pulled punches and not a speck of self-referential wit here, just classic stalker/slasher mayhem, presented by Hooper in a style that skillfully evokes the low-budget, grainy realism of such earlier fright flicks as his own '74 classic, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
