I saw this movie at a screening at a local AMC theater - they were at the time considering whether or not to pick up the movie and show it at some places in their chain and randomly invited people to come and see it. I was selected and brought a friend of mine. <br /><br />I didn't have any idea what to expect so went in with an open mind. The premise of the movie was interesting and showed promise, but the characters were all complete clich√©s and had no depth. I blame the writing of the script because the actors did a decent job with what they were given to work with. The way the story carried out was just slow, slow, slow! All of the conflict felt manufactured and not real. The plot development just didn't work in my opinion. There was just no reason for me to actually care about anyone involved in the movie. <br /><br />The main plot involving the girl and her "rebelleous side" could have been lifted out of a bad "Svaed By The Bell" episode it was so shallow. The subplot involving the mom and her new boyfriend, for example, felt completely fake and contrived.<br /><br />I feel bad writing such a bad review of this movie but the fact is it just isn't good. I respect the fact that the writer really put a lot into making this movie (she was at the theater and we got to talk to her afterwards) and made it this far, but it just isn't worth seeing. I have seen many independent films that I wish would have been promoted by AMC at arthouses that never made it and they were thinking of giving THIS film a shot at the big time? Give me a break!<br /><br />Check the user ratings - currently 4.5/10. That says it all IMO.<br /><br />* 1/2 out of ****
