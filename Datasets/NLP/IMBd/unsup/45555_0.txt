Well, this movie, to tell the truth, is a total crap. No story, no acting, no mature screenplay... just sex which covered 50% of the movie. The director made a blunt effort to insert some plot with that morphology-changing ability of the villagers but that turned out to be a sheer flop. The actors, especially the child ones, are not worth to mention. Julie Cialini, the "star" of the film did her part, which consisted of nothing hard, well. The cinematography is horrible and senseless. Some childish special effects are also seen.<br /><br />Two things are worth for a brief notice about the film. One is shooting location, which is nice; and the other is the background music during sex scenes. But if you're going to waste your bucks just for that, I have nothing more to say.
