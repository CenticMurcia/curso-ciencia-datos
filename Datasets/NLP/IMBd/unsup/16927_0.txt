What a great film. Vincent Perez was fabulous as Diderot. I really liked this movie and would recommend it to anyone that is a fan of Vincent Perez and who also likes good French films. I have watched Perez's performance in other films and find he is such a great actor. This film had great acting, great photography, witty dialogue and good casting. The costuming was also really good, with an accurate portrayal of what society would wear in that time period. I really don't want to give away any of the story line so I will stop now, but to all fans of Vincent Perez. Go and see this film. Another note, I also really liked the music used in the film, it portrayed the wittiness of the dialogue.
