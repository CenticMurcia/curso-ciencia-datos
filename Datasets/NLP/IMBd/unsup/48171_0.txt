This film is better than Omega Code and Left Behind but was still unbelievably bad. I can't believe how bad Christian filmaking is today, it's a real shame. The acting was so unbelievably bad I didn't care if the whole world was wiped out by the anti-christ or not. All the characters completely overacted especially the ones that were supposed to be really evil ones. It was laughable. Anyone who like this film should really get out more and see real movies.
