Being a fan of action, sci fi and even (good) zombie movies I found this movie vastly overrated. The action is nearly non existant, the sci fi was thin and stretched but the zombies were just ok. That majority of this movie is movie is cliche after cliche and you almost always know whats going to happen next. Its pretty obvious who will survive the whole ordeal right from the begining, and who the 'secret bad guy' is amongst the team. There are also some major holes, like there is a point where everybody is surrounded by zombies right when they first get attacked, then the scene changes and some of the team are just running, wow, I guess the zombies just let them by eh? Or I love the fact that these people come back to the team later on in the movie and yet again, didn't have to deal with the dozens zombies they had to walk through to get back to their team (which you hear hitting the door when thye close it).<br /><br />If you're desperate for a zombie movie, I guess its worth a rental, or maybe you're a huge fan of the Resident Evil games, but otherwise I can't even recomend it for rental... much less the price of a movie ticket.
