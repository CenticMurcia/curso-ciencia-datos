Warning: Depending on your definition of "spoilers", there might be a spoiler here. Tread carefully.<br /><br />Like most other reviewers, I could not help but notice how "perfect" the future was, yet how much it resembled the 20th century. However, all that, IMO, is irrelevant to the plot.<br /><br />Now, I haven't read Asimov's book (as a matter of fact, I had no idea this movie was based on a book till I logged on to IMDb), but even if I had, I wouldn't go in with the highest expectations, knowing how Hollywood mucks things up.<br /><br />My parents, who have already watched this film, praised it quite highly, but my sister trashed it as boring. I went in with mediocre expectations, particularly because I don't have much affinity for movies dealing with artificial intelligence.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by the plot. Perhaps it's just me, but I really felt I could actually relate to the robot. I didn't care that it was Robin Williams. I didn't care the future was totally unrealistic. In a sense, I think I related to Andrew because of my personality; I'm awkward in social situations, and am always utterly agreeable.<br /><br />I probably fell for the plot like a sucker, but I liked falling for it. Whatever superficial goofs the movie made were more than made up for me by the story, which I found brilliantly beautiful. I really cannot think of adjectives that would sufficiently describe it, but.... it's just something that really appealed to me.<br /><br />Besides the similarities I found between myself and Andrew, I think I was also touched by many elements of the plot; independence, freedom, recognition, a spurned love... <br /><br />And the philosophical issues, most imperatively. I've always enjoyed pondering the moral issues surrounding robots, immortality, and so on. I think that's probably what drew me in. Watching the people Andrew loved die was probably the part of the film that touched me most, because I'm a very nostalgic person at heart - I love recalling past incidents, people I knew... and I felt Andrew's pain at losing the people he loved most.<br /><br />A lot of reviewers criticised this movie for its unrealistic portrayal of the future, its failure to properly adapt Asimov's book (from what I've heard about it, it does sound like a great pity, as the book seems more powerful), hell, even the music played.<br /><br />But none of that stuff really matters to me. The story was quite philosophical, with all the touches of sentimentality that make me melt like butter in a frying pan. This movie is probably one of the most touching and brilliant dramas I've watched, outdoing A Beautiful Mind, my previous most favourite drama. Neither films are without flaws, but the stories, which is what a movie is about, are beautiful.
