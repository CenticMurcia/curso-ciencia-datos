i saw this film recently, and it was the first time a movie has made me cry for so so long. i cried because rocky was so brave, because he never let anything get him down, despite being ridiculed by people simply because of his looks. i warmed to his unique personality immediately, and the way he showed Diane what colours were melted my heart; everybody should have a friend as considerate as him. Mask teaches an important lesson about life: it doesn't matter what a person looks like, its what is inside that counts. i only wish that rocky could have lived longer, to achieve everything he wanted to. the fact that the story is actually true makes this film all the more poignant and profoundly moving. i would urge people who haven't seen it already: rent it out, or buy it. it will soften even the hardest of hearts.
