I must confess I don't like Mexican movies. Quality is the main issue. Anyway, I must recognize there is people out there trying to make decent films. While we have great directors like Cuarón, Iñarritu, Del Toro, etc. we still have their counterparts who try to keep 'cine mexicano' being as bad as it has been for so many years. It's a shame 'Pajarracos' was on a film festival. It's a shame we show this to foreign audiences. Please don't judge Mexican films from this movie. It would be pretty unfair for lots of talented Mexican people waiting for an opportunity in the film industry. (sorry for any mistakes on my English =P)
