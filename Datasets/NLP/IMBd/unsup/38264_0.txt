The fact that this was actually written by a thirteen year old girl says it all. The movie begs sympathy for these girls while the only people actually doing harm to them are themselves. That alone is an extremely frustrating fact. In addition to that, the story is terrible and lacking in actual interesting points, and is obviously made only for angsty teens as delusional as these characters. If you are a depressed suburban kid under the false idea that your family hates you or that your mom's boyfriend is irresponsible for recovering from a drug addiction then I'm sure you would love this movie. If you are reasonable and mature, It would be a very good idea not to waste your time. The stupidity of the characters is not at all compelling and only frustrates you.
