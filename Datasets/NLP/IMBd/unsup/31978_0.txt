In the opening of the movie the main character thought she was in the middle of a bank robbery and her boss was murdered. All Danika could do was crawl on the floor in a separate room. While thought the robbery was really happening, the robbery was part of her imagination. It took quite a while for me to realize she had mental problem. How did the shrink turn out be be the person her husband was having an affair with? The ending of the movie did not make sense to me. What happen to her family? I noticed throughout the movie she would see the bag lady, but it turned out she was the bag lady. Was her husband really having an affair? Did her kids die in a car accident?
