Junk<br /><br />Before considering with you should give 91 minutes of your life to junk you need ask yourself why you watch zombie movies. If you love the Romero zombie movies for there sly commentary hidden in a nightmarish vision well don't bother. If you are a splatter fan that doesn't really mind little things like plot, acting or a budget on a film Junk is your ticket! It all comes down to what you are looking for in a zombie film.<br /><br />In fangoria the director stated that From dusk til dawn was a big influence and you can see that in how the film is structured. The plot starts off with little to do with zombies but with Japanese gangsters and thieves involved in a jewelry heist. To bad they intend to sell the jewels on the site of factory where Japanese scientists and the U.S. military develop Herbert west's special sauce for undead making.<br /><br />Boy this is one bad zombie movie. Of course that maybe exactly what you are looking for. I can respect what was done for the money that they had. Some moments are sorta effective.<br /><br />****spoilers****<br /><br />On to the spoiler comments. Naked zombies, only the lead woman zombie. If she is intelligent enough to turn off the nuclear warhead(connected to a pretty chaeap-ass looking PC) I think she could have mastered getting some attire. When the Japanese scientist realizes the intelligent zombie is his wife I understand why the director choose to flash to pictures of them happy. I am not sure why he continued to after she started trying to eat his flesh.<br /><br />The character Akira, had his foot stabbed but after 20 minutes it seems to have healed. And the American `actors'Â…Christ. How wooden could they make dialogue. All that being said Junk is ok considering what amount of money it was made with.
