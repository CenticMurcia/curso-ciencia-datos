This film needs at least 90 minutes of trimming. It would be a great movie, if only it did not extend its welcome. Gone are the days when audiences would be satisfied watching scenes linger on pointlessly or endure unnecessary sub-plots in the name of entertainment. Jodhaa Akbar has too much unnecessary exposition. The first 30 minutes could easily be eliminated, the whole Ila Arun track is superfluous and that elephant vs Akbar scene was a damn bore. Hrithik and Aishwarya are good in their respective roles, but there is nothing brilliant here about either of the performances. Technically though, the film is excellent. Great epic landscapes, lush set designs and costumes and a rocking background score courtesy A.R. Rahman.
