Death is nothing but a survival from this tricky world.No matter what anyone says I think this film is worth watching. Bryce acts as a perfect actor and a girl's real power is shown.Wrong impressions about the weakness of women have to be disappeared and this film may help those kind of thought's owners to change their ideas. After this film I am a fan of (not Steve's) Bryce's and expect many more films from him!..There must be more photos and movies of Bryce Johnson.This is the certain idea of my friends and mine. Although I prefer sci-fi films more than watching these kind of thrillers which include less action but the sense that makes us believe in the doubts is even enjoyable in some parts..
