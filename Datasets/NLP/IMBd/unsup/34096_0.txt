"Searching for Paradise' tells of a Gilda (Pratt) whose father dies and leaves behind evidence of an extramarital affair which she discovers. Wanting to become a movie industry camera operator, Gilda carries a small camcorder everywhere which doesn't have anything to do with anything. She also falls in like with a young man and then creates a scene in a library when he won't just drop everything and have sex with her. Posing an an Italian journalist, she goes in search of a handsome leading man, ends up cornered by him in his flat where she creates another scene. During the film she periodically has strange visions/dreams about her father...etc, blaa, blaa. If this sounds messy it not because I can't write a cogent commentary. It's because this is a mess of a film which doesn't really ever make sense of itself. It's obvious that Gilda has issues but they never crystallize and we're left wondering what the hell is wrong with the lovely and otherwise likable Gilda whose character is superficial at best. "Searching for Paradise" is a novice auteur's teeth cutter which is floating around on the Sundance channel and available on DVD. Bottom line? If you can't find something better to watch than this turkey, you're not really trying. (C-)
