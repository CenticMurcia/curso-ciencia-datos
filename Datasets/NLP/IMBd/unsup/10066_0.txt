This film is a perfect adaptation of PAco Ibáñez characters. Mortadelo, Filemon, Professor Bacterio, The Super, Ofelia, Rompeteños, people from RUE 13 PERCEBE are perfectly represented. Story and development take all the topics of the comic. Pepe Viyuela and Benito Pocino are credible and incredible as the worst couple of secret agent in the history of T.I.A.
