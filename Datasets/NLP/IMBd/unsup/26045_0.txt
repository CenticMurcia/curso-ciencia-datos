I saw this movie years ago and then watched it again the other evening. I really enjoyed it. A fun comedy with Streisand and Seagal a great team. She actually looked pretty for once in her life. Her figure was lovely and the one reviewer on this board who said she was fleshy should rethink his or her terminology. She looked fine. They are a mismatched pair who become a match by the film's end. She plays a hooker with theatrical ambitions and he wants to be a writer. They both have facades and veneers that melt by the movie's end. Very enjoyable and I also liked the character of Eleanor, her look was right out of the 1970's. Audiences will enjoy the wardrobe Barbra wears and she displays a marvelous talent for comedy. I was amazed at how pretty and sweet she appeared in some scenes. A fun movie. I recommend it.
