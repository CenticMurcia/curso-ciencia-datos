Crossing the line from sweet to saccharine is all too easy, with the majority of films that dare go near true sentiment ending up knee-deep in aspartame. But Second Best prances on that line with aplomb and grace. I realize that, "sweet," would not be the first adjective out of one's mouth after seeing Second Best, but sweet is what it is. Sweet it is to realize that average is as human as we get; sweet it is to realize that jealousy is as common as the cold; sweet it is to realize that real success has little to do with winning; and sweet it is to once again realize that the journey is far more interesting than the destination. <br /><br />So, at the risk of sounding a bit gooey, myself, I think Eric Weber has come up with a very sweet and funny movie. It deals with failure, misguided potential and loss but you actually come out of the movie feeling good. Good in the way that Garden State, or the Station Agent, or even The Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind makes you feel. The direction, the dialog and the performances  especially that of Joey Pantalione  ring true and honest and real without even a hint of the after taste of Sweet 'N Low. To me it was the kind of movie that you wished didn't end so fast. It's good for all of us second besters. The winners can stay away.
