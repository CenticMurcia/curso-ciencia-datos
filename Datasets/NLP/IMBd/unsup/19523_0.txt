This was one of the most absurd ideas for a movie I've ever had the displeasure of coming across! I know it is what it is; but the acting was probably the worst I've seen up to now. These people just couldn't spit out their lines and when they did it was hard to understand them because of all their indecipherable accents. I went in with low expectations and yet I was still disappointed because it doesn't even classify as typical mindless action-type fun such as "Bloodsport" and the like. And don't get me started on the raw cheesiness of the props such as those stupid tiki torches lighting up every part of the building/arena/outside that the bad guy owns, or the main character driving a construction machine to the fight because the car door is locked, or why the bad Asian dude does a Michael Jackson dance after he wins a fight (which I'm sorry for, but it definitely detracts from one's alleged toughness). That list is just the tip of the iceberg as well, there were seriously so many plot holes and the like that I'd go crazy if I thought about them any harder. Funding should not be handed out for fecal matter such as this.<br /><br />Final Summation:<br /><br />Movies: Awww, hellz no!<br /><br />DVD Purchase: Wouldn't collect it if you paid me.<br /><br />Rental: Not worth it in any aspect whatsoever!
