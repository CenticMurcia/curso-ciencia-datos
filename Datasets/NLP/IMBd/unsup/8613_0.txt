I will say that when I first saw the trailer for this movie, I was impressed. The idea of the stepmother getting a hold of the wand and turning back time is pretty neat! I've not seen the second movie, nor do I plan to.<br /><br />The animation for this film is decent, though sometimes Cinderella looks like a man and her head is too big. The jokes are cheesy and the majority of the plot is see-through, but what can I do? I'm an adult and may have lost some of my child-like innocence. The music is unmemorable...sort of.<br /><br />Good film for children as a sequel but is much too reminiscent of The Little Mermaid in places and other Disney films to be unique. Watch if you're intrigued by the plot setup but don't bother buying this one unless it's for your kids.
