I suppose to fully appreciate Amelie, one would first have to appreciate the work of Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Jeunet creates characters that are sweet, simple, and (of course) interesting. Amelie, as the full title suggests, takes place in France. But not quite the France you may know. The France in Amelie is borderline between surreal and real, making the story of Amelie much like a fairy-tale. The main character, Amelie, is struggling to find her place in a world in which she does not seem to fit in. She feels finally at peace with her life when she finally feels she has found her goal in life...changing people's lives for the better. I don't want to give too much away, but overall, Amelie is a uniquely sweet story, with a uniquely sweet soul; just like...well, Amelie.
