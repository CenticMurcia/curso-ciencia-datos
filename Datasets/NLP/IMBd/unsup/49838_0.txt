In between "Love Story" and "What's Up, Doc?", Ryan O'Neal sneaked in this minor, forgotten western co-starring William Holden. It's one of those outdoor character studies which critics love to label 'picaresque' (i.e., episodic story of or relating to rascals or rogues). Two Montana cowboys plan to rob a bank and retire to Mexico, but life has other plans. Holden is restrained and easy, O'Neal very awkward, but the main culprit here is writer-director Blake Edwards (of all people), who sets the early pacing at such a slow drag that the picture never recovers. Supporting cast is unusually strong, but no one here is able to do much with this colorless script. ** from ****
