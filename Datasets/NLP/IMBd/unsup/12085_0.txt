<br /><br />I agree with the last comment posted: this movie is far more than what Touchstone promoted it as and more layered than what even the good reviews give it credit for. Themes of prejudice, equality, sexism, and human perseverance quietly lay a foundation for the rousing action and adventure that is being advertised.<br /><br />Man and horse in a survival conflict with nature is what hits one on a visceral level, and Viggo Mortensen and his remarkable mount draw you in. King Aragorn is now the Lord of the Reins.<br /><br />Looking forward to the DVD and hoping for good extra features, but this one has to be seen on the big screen to experience.
