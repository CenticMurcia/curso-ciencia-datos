There are many directions an independent film may take in it's life. I found out this film was produced on a shoestring budget and the best thing you can say, if you're lucky enough to view it, is "you'd never know". The story may seem familiar, but a few twists and turns gives the spectator a nice little ride through deception. There are many reasons to give this film a look from the fine performances by some rising stars to the photographic angles which brings life to the background. I am not trying to say it's the next best thing to peanut butter and it's time for an Oscar; I am saying it was a fun ride and worth the E-Ticket!
