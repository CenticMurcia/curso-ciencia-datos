Big disappointment to see how french « cinema d'auteur » does not learn anything of his mistakes. "Sauf le Respect que je vous dois" Is a very scholar movie whose only purpose is to show a complete portfolio of the skills the director's pretending to. The main concern of Fabienne Godet is to prove that, with a little more money, she would be able to shoot in every genre. So, the social movie fast turns into a cheap thriller - with an unjustified gore - scene before sliding towards an investigation movie with dull dialogs. I wonder why Olivier Gourmet came into this thing where you can feel the weight of the large crew behind every camera move. Not only the cinematography is awful and the sets too sophisticated for that kind of story, the director seems to have watched over and over Michael Mann's Insider (2000). Despite different stories, you can sense the influence of this particular Michael Mann movie from the very beginning. But, the better, or the worst, is yet to come... In the middle of the film, the director simply uses Lisa Gerrard's music for the Michael Mann movie, presuming the audience is not only blind but also def. One small advice for Fabienne Godet : don't think Michael Mann's movie are only catalogs of great looking images. It's true the man has an awesome talent but he's also working hard on his scripts.
