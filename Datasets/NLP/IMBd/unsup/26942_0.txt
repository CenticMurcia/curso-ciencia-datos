This is an excellent Jet Li film, that is really intense, with lots of great action, and fantastic performances!. This is a really intense film, that actually has quite a few shocking moments, and pulls no punches, plus Jet Li is simply amazing in this!. Theis film really has some fantastic fight scenes, in it and the plot and story was really cool, plus i found the ending very touching!. I was really rooting for the 2 main characters as Tchéky Karyo is actually frightening as the main villain, and wanted to see what was coming to him!, plus it also had some good dialog!. The character development isn't too bad, and the finale is great and full of action, plus, i was really surprised by all the violence!. This is an excellent Jet Li Film that is really intense, with lots of great action, and fantastic performances!. The Direction is great!. Chris Nahon does a great job here, with excellent camera work, great shots during the action scenes, and really keeping the film at a fast pace!. There is actually quite a bit of blood and violence!. We get harsh bloody beating, bloody gunshot wounds, bloody gunshot wound to the head with blood and brains splattering,bloody stabbings,decapitation, chopsticks in neck, and a very nasty death scene at the end which i won't spoil. The Acting is fantastic!. Jet Li is AMAZING as always, and is AMAZING here, he does not speak much, but he is very believable, likable, had very good chemistry with Bridget Fonda, kicked that ass, and was just amazing overall (Jet Rules!). Bridget Fonda is very beautiful and is excellent as the prostitute, she is very likable, had very good chemistry with jet and i was rooting for her all the way to get her daughter back!. Tchéky Karyo is extremely menacing as the main villain, and at times frightening he was awesome!. Rest of the cast are good. Overall a must see for everyone!. ****1/2 out of 5
