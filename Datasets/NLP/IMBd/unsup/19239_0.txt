This is the first time I think I`ve seen Buddhist wild west gunslingers. The colour in this noodle western-cum black comedy are like a seriously bad acid trip and so is much of the story line. But this is probably one of the best send ups of the genre since blazing saddles. There are some potentially great karaoke sing-alongs in the soundtrack that are essentially Thai pop ballads with an old West feel (where can I get this soundtrack?). The violence is quite noteworthy and bloody and is grossly accentuated by the richness in the colour so that it almost seems characters spout bright red paint when they are shot. Altogether a unique cinema experience likely to remain a real cult classic
