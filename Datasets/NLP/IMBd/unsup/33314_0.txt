Don't let the credits mislead you, Jennifer Lopez only has a small supporting role (a dozen lines at best), and the "no-name" stars give performances which justify their subsequent demise on the Hollywood movie scene. Bad acting, unbelievably implausible plot lines, and second rate dialogue are only accentuated by cookie cutter characterizations. If I'm ever stuck in a bad-ass L.A. Latino neighbourhood, I hope I'm lucky enough to run into this movie's gang members; at worst my car would get a new paint job. The predictable happy ending is capped off by yet another forgettable dance sequence, making one yearn for the comparably energetic, stylish excellence of "Footloose" or "Dirty Dancing". If you choose to spend a few hours watching this drivel, be sure to do some housework as well so it's not a complete waste of your time.
