In my childhood days of course, this used to be one of my favourite kids shows that I'd ever seen. In a distant galaxy or something, there was a planet with a moon circling around it. This moon was Button Moon. Basically everything around the planet was similar to normal everyday little things, like a button, making the scenery and characters. For example, there was Mr Spoon with spoons for arms, and there was also broom sticks for trees. On this planet or on Button Moon itself these characters had many weird so called adventures or short stories. One of my favourite episodes that I remember was the talent show. This was a quality show. It was number 86 on The 100 Greatest Kids' TV Shows. Very good!
