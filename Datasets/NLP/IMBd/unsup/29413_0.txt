After awhile of leaving it on between British comedies on American PBS, I grew to enjoy and like watching this television show. The characters like Compo and his relationship with Nora Batty is quite hysterical. It's great to watch Frank Thornton back in comedy again as Truelove. Of course, Thora Hird is my favorite British acting dame. At almost ninety years old, she is still beautiful, sweet, and brilliant in her role as Edie. The show is more like comedic serial than a sitcom. There is the ongoing secret courtship between married Howard and single attractive golden girl, Marina. Then there is the annoying happy marriage between Glenda and Barry. It's almost nauseating to hear Glenda speak so highly of her Barry to her mother and their friends over tea as they discuss husbands with the suspicious Pearl, the widowed Nora and Ivy. Of course, it's wonderful to watch Auntie Wainwright as an antique seller in the small town. It's a delight to watch Jean Alexander thrive in this role. In fact everybody thrives in their roles on this long running British comedy. In fact, I don't mind growing old. The show gives me something to look forward too now. I am sad about Bill Owen's death but the show still manages to go on with his son. I just wish he would chase after Nora Batty now who left. Even though the characters come and go, there are now new refreshing characters. When I go to England next time, I will definitely stop in Holmfirth, England, outside of Manchester to visit this charming little Yorkshire town.
