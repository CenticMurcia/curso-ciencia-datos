From what I saw in "Looker", it appears that plastic face-lift obsession was already quite noticeable in the early '80s. They had no idea back then how far it would eventually go. But aside from that, it's still a really good movie. Albert Finney plays a Beverly Hills plastic surgeon whose clients start dying in rather gruesome ways. So when one particular young woman (Susan Dey) comes in for an operation, he decides to keep her within his sight and finds out about some slimy deeds.<br /><br />As this is a Michael Crichton story, it of course has the problem of portraying a successful middle-aged man in love with a beautiful woman half his age. But as long as we understand that, it's a very enjoyable movie. James Coburn plays the perfect kind of CEO role: he looks like a nice elderly man, but what's he hiding? Since I don't know "The Partridge Family" - and don't really have any ambition to know it - I'll just remember Susan Dey for her role here...especially that scanning scene! All in all, definitely worth seeing. That one model at the beginning was definitely setting herself up, given how she walked around in her underclothes (and those pink walls were really obnoxious).
