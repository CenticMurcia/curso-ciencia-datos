I agree with the "slickstu" comments - but had a few other problems: The actors in general did a great job, but the guy who played Will (brilliantly) and the guy who played his father (brilliantly) were really miscast. There's no way they could be genetically linked, their only connection is that they were both great actors. Also, the guy that Will had the bet with; I can't work out if he was supposed to be Australian with a bad American accent or an American with a bad Australian accent? And why not just go for an Aussie or an American, instead of trying to make one of them into another? There were a couple of other continuity problems - which are perfectly excusable for a first-time director, but this film could have been so much better if more attention had been paid to the basics (like not having a dark-haired, dark-eyed, shorter actor playing the father of a - well, let's just say a man that he could not genetically be related to). This film could have been so much better, with a little more attention to detail. Screwing up the basics can often be enough to suspend belief in the overall narrative.
