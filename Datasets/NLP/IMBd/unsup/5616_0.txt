This is a coming-of-age drama, complete with hokey voice-over intro in style of Stand by Me, about a group of lads growing up in a surfing town in the late 1950s into the 60s. I gave up after an hour, though it failed the 20 minute rule where at that point I realise it hadn't captured my imagination. My problem is the writing- it's very broad. In the first half hour there are two extended fistfights in the style of Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, you half expect a fiddle to be playing in the background. Just one punch could kill someone, but no one has a broken nose, cut lip or anything. One fight takes place at a party, where it's already been established that the long-suffering mum is upstairs reading a book and rolling her eyes at the loud music. But when it all kicks off downstairs, and someone is thrown through a glass window, she's nowhere to be seen. The Yanks in it - I was gonna say they're too American, which sounds bad. But you know The Graduate, when Benji is trying to locate Elaine in the final reel, and meets some jocks in a shower, and struggles to relate to them a bit. It's like the characters are all like that. After an hour I gave up on this. My guess is that if you've lived it, this film would be a nostalgia trip for you, as you could fill in the details where the writing doesn't bother.
