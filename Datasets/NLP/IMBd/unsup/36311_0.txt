Every once in a while, a movie on the video store shelf catches your eye. Not because it looks like it is going to be a quality film, but because it looks like it will be utter trash. This is a film of that type. For an hour and a half, one has to put up with atrocious acting, home video camera quality visuals, lame special effects, and a plot that never really seem to show up. To make the movie worse the viewer has to sit through about ten minutes of previews for action figures and the soundtrack for both this film and another one of equal bad quality. So, if you are looking for a useless cheesy movie about some guy who wants to take the world over with head exploding rap music (no I did not make that up) then rent this movie right away. If not, find something good.
