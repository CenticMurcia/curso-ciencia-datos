A multiple course feast for the film fan. A great cast. A simple story that leaves just enough unsaid. A great soundtrack. Beautiful cinematography. Some great lines. 7.5/10. This was my 2nd viewing of the movie, with the first viewing quite a few years ago.<br /><br />Warning - don't watch this movie if you're hungry. Anyone that loves Italian food, will love the talk and images of the meals that are created throughout the movie. If only we had the technology to truly capture the aromas of the food, then the only thing missing would be to actually be on the set and taste it all.<br /><br />I also found it also rather sexy. I won't comment on the appeal of the suave Italian lead men, but the ladies were just beautiful. A couple of my favourites Isabella Rossellini and Minnie Driver grab lots of sexy shots and the early role from Allison Janney is a pleasant surprise. Like other movies centered around food, the food itself adds to the sex appeal of the movie.<br /><br />Best line of the movie - "what's the matter?...my Mother was such a terrible cook". The small part of the car salesman played by Campbell Scott contributes more than its fair share of great lines, incl..."beautiful place though, Italy...yes it is, have you been?...no, never".<br /><br />I've had the soundtrack for quite some time and I use it to accompany activity in the kitchen or dinner music, but I got a better appreciation of it seeing it in the context of the movie again.<br /><br />The movie conjures up feelings of passion, perseverance, love and pride, as well as providing glimpses of a deeper understanding and appreciation for the human heart. Great movie, probably a keeper.<br /><br />
