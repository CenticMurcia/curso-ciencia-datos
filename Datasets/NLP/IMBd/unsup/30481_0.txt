Director: Rahul Rawail <br /><br />Starring: Sunny Deol, Kamaal Khan, Thomas Umer Tevana, Nupur Mehta and Shilpi Sharma Music: Anand Raj Anand<br /><br />Very nice Movies, i have watched it in cinema over south west London, THE story was nice with the songs, but i am concerned about the ban in India.<br /><br />'Jo Bole So Nihaal' is the story of a naive constable of Punjab police named Nihaal Singh, played by Sunny Deol. He has been bestowed with love from elders and youngsters alike. He is soft at heart but hard at work. But, his plain nature makes him fall a prey to easy tactics.<br /><br />And, it is where Romeo (Kamaal Khan), the dreaded mercenary, takes advantage of him. He uses Nihaal Singh to escape from law. Once out of bars, he goes on a killing spree from country to country. Back home, all hell loses on Nihaal as every one believes that it was he who helped Romeo to escape<br /><br />Excellent movie you should all watch it. <br /><br />Saibhy
