As sad as it is, whether the RESEARCHERS not filmmakers, had been there or not he would have died. These men and women are researching the lives of the meerkats and are taking great care to not interfere with their way of life. It is the harsh reality that is nature. Like when Len and Squiggy died and I cried my boyfriend had to tell me that even if the researcher's hadn't been there and this hadn't been broadcast it still would have happened. That is what makes this show so great. It is heart wrenchingly sad when something bad happens but so amazing when something good happens. The way these little creatures survive surrounded by such a harsh environment; it is truly amazing. And like in nature as in life people die and we already mess with nature enough, through urban expansion and deforestation for the researchers to keep a meerkat alive that would have died in there absence would be bad. It would mess with the meerkats and the Kalahari's delicate way of life. So while yes this show has sad scenes that a researcher could prevent, it is the hard facts of life in the Kalahari and it is an amazing show.
