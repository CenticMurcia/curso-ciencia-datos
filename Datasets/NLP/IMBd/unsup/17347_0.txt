Sea of Love isn't going to be written up in anyone's Master's Thesis on the Meaning of Cinema. It won't last decades in the canon of great film. It's just a steamy murder mystery that happens to be very well played indeed. There are few plot holes -- none that are really big or infuriating, and the murder investigation plays out well.<br /><br />Pacino is a cop with a mid-life crisis and drinking problem. He meets John Goodman, who has discovered they're both investigating very similar murders with a sexual angle. Ellen Barkin may or may not be the killer, but Pacino's attraction to her is too great to resist, even knowing the risks.<br /><br />Barkin doesn't have much to do beside emanate steam, but she does that quite well. Pacino is understated, with an edge of desperation. The mystery will keep you going, in that kind of Basic Instinct way of not knowing if any given sexual encounter will end in murder. Characters have a realistic and gritty feel to them, although Barkin is far too beautiful and sophisticated to be a down-on-her-luck single mother. <br /><br />Recommended.
