First of all,i NEVER appreciated any of the work of German movie-maker Uwe Boll,although I cant say I seen all his work. But I have seen his "skills" in "house of the dead","alone in the dark" and the one with the vampire slayer chick.<br /><br />Now,after watching "Tunnel Rats",I cant help myself wondering if this guy really improved his skills significantly,or he got lucky?...maybe he wasn't even directing,but hired someone else??...<br /><br />Yeah,I sound silly,but its all because this film was a good little solid war story and it had no feel of a low-budget production. There are plenty of moments that made me get found of some characters,even Vietnamese,the action scenes are never over the top,almost all of it feels raw and real (if you know what I mean),and last,but not least,It made me think of the value of a mans life. And all this is saying much,if not TOO MUCH,for a Uwe Boll-written/directed film.<br /><br />If he would seriously think of stopping to do all of those video game based tasteless adaptations and focus on action/drama, maybe his future works will gain more audience.
