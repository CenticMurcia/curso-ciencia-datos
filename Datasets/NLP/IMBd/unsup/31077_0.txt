Someone thought why don't we take Charles Dickens A Christmas Carol and take tiny bits of last years Maid of Honor, and you get Ghosts of Girlfriends Past. A good idea that quickly goes nowhere, It's not all funny, but mildly amusing at times.<br /><br />Connor Mead(Matthew McConaughey) a famous photographer that has pretty much slept with a lot of women, some are clients. Is invited to be best man at his brother Pauls(Breckin Meyer) wedding. During that time he meets up with an old child hood friend and former lover Jenna(Jennifer Garner), and pretty much begins hitting on most of the brides maid. But is quickly visited by the ghost of his rich uncle(Michael Douglas), and tells him that he will be visited by three ghosts, in hopes that they will make him see the error of his ways.<br /><br />Although the idea was good, but it went nowhere, cause it had very little laughs. Matthew McConaughey doesn't show much here in this role, he is so unlikable and makes it impossible to care about him. Jennifer Garner really surprised me here, she gave a real strong performance, and her performance was not week like it was in Catch and Release(2006). And she and McConaughey have very little chemistry. Now Emma Stone is pretty much a scene stealer as the ghost of girlfriends past, she got some laughs. But Michael Douglas's character began to wear out his presence.<br /><br />A little note: Christa B. Allen who plays teenage Jenna, also starred in 13 going on 30(2004), in which she also played a teenage version of Jennifer Garner character.
