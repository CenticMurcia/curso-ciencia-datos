I saw the film opening day with my botha's & sistah's. <br /><br />There were funny moments but most of the time we were trying hard to find something worth laughing at. Maybe it was too close to the truth. The funniest moment was Cedric's mexican food problem. All the actors have done better work. <br /><br />Great gag: Many missed the names of the little girls; Latonya and Lasonya !!!<br /><br />It's not a bad film, it's just not that funny.
