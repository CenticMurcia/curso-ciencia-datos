In the year 1995 at 5pm in the afternoon on ABC TV, I settled down after school to watch this show religiously. It had me hooked as it wasn't 'silly' like most of the cartoons on at that time, It is saddening that there is barely a trace of this show left on the internet, let alone on TV. I'm 25 now, and find myself rather worried at some of the cartoons that are produced these days. They're a waste of money compared to the in depth cartoons, that were shown on ABC in the early to mid 1990s.<br /><br />Hopefully one day it will be released on DVD.<br /><br />It is one of the cartoons I miss, along with Spartakus and the Sun Beneath the Sea.
