I rented this expecting a little out of this movie (the movie's graphics are grade A regardless of the B-movie feel) and got what I wanted and then some. Subtitling was great.<br /><br />SLIGHT SPOILERAGE BELOW ... nothing that explains the movie though Good premise. Along the lines of 28 days and The Thing with the way the people react to being put in a stressful situation.<br /><br />If you get the chance, definitely pick it up for rental. As far as buying ... weak buy if you're into apocalypse movies (mainly because they only show what's going on in Japan and you don't know what's going on in the rest of the world ... no 'The Core', 'Day After Tomorrow' 'feel' where stuff is going on around the world). That turns into a moderate buy if you're into Anime and want to show some other anime lovers something different, but they would appreciate (especially because the main girl sounds exactly like one of the whiny characters out of Inuyasha or something). Turns into a high moderate buy if you want something for people to say they've never seen before - and you may not get it back.
