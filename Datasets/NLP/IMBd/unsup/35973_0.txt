Oh come on now, I keep seeing posts where this movie is described as "an intelligent thriller". Uh, where's the intelligence and where are the thrills? I didn't check the "spoilers" box because the entire plot is revealed in the first 15 minutes. I've seen more scintillating plot lines on "The Streets of San Francisco". It has that 1970's made-for-TV look complete with the blurry, quick-fading, washed out MetroColor print that few will ever want to preserve for any film archive. Well, on second thought, I will check the "spoilers" box so I can state that it would have been nice to see a "Rosemary's "Baby"-like avatar of Satan play hide-the-salami with Karen Black. But alas, no such luck - only some swishy Black Mass priest dressed up like Gaius Caligula with too many lines of pretentious dialogue. If no "intelligence" or "thrills", maybe just alittle titillation!!?? Instead we get gratuitous blood and gore - several guys getting graphically gunshot. Well, enough bitchiness; at least it was nice seeing Christopher Plummer looking 20 years younger than he did in "The Sound of Music" which was filmed about 10 years previous??? And Karen Black? She's totally hot-looking here, and, dare I say it, her performance is almost UNDERSTATED.
