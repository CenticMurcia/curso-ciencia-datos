"Betty.. Judy... Josie and those hot Pussycats! They make me horny... Saturday morn'y! ...."<br /><br />"Jane, get me off this crazy thing... called 'love.'"<br /><br />My God! May all seven rings of Dante's Inferno fall upon those heads which have clicked "6" as a rating! TO HELL I CAST THEE! What an amazing catharsis for Mike Meyers' true talent. "Wayne's World"? Sure, it was good... part 2 proved to be just as good if not better. (And, if you didn't laugh your ass off to the mere SOUND of: "weird naked Indian guy"... you have problems.) But, damn... What a great movie Axe Murderer is.<br /><br />The opening sequence just sets the tone. We follow what seems to be a TUB of cafe-whatever. Low and behold, it lands right into the hands of one Charlie MacKenzie, a 2nd generation Irishman turned wiseass. He delicately holds the robuste cup and says to us-- the waitress: "Um, excuse me, but I think I order the LARGE cappuccino... HELLO!... Jeez, look at this thing... It looks like Cambell's Cup-O-Cino...." And the facial expressions, body guestures... oh my! Comedic genius, flat out.<br /><br />Mike Meyers, if you are reading this, you are a great, great comedian/actor. You've done a HELLUVA job with "So I Married..." and your powerhouse movies, both "Austin Powers...." Good stuff, my friend. Keep it up, and tell Dana (Carvey) I said to get well. Hey, it's never too late to do a part 3-- of WAYNE'S WORLD! WAYNE'S WORLD! IT'S PARTY-TIME! EXCELLENT! WAYNE'S WORLD!.... Mike, you're a 10! Behave?! Oh, I shan't!....
