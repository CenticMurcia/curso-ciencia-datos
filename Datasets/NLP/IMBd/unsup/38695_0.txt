Don't bother watching the movie. The trailer is the best part. The rest is just filler party and bar scenes and little dialog. Don't even bother to turn on subtitles because most of the dialog is just "heh baby" or "heh sweetheart".<br /><br />The only suspense in this movie was wondering if Dr Shanley has a cleaning service. There was vomit on the bed linens when he went to the ER. When he returned home the rumpled bed linens were the same but the vomit was gone.<br /><br />The film could have been condensed to 30minutes are less. I suppose this isn't the worst film I've seen--since I did stay with it till the end, but it ranks pretty low.
