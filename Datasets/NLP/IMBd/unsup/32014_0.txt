I remember the first time I bought this gem of a game it was Christmas of 2003. The first time I played it it started of slowly I had no idea where to go or what to do at all. So by than I gave up on it saying that I would play it again some other time. That other time wasn't till the next year when I picked up the game around 2004 and played it I figured out what to do and spent months training up playing the game. As well as the game-play and of course the use of magic and the Djinn the elemental spirit creatures that are used to summon attacks and of course more powerful creatures.<br /><br />As well as the RPG element I completely enjoyed the story as you Isaac or whoever you name the hero as sets out with his friend Gareth and go around the world of Weyard trying to find your missing friends and of course save the world from disaster from Saturus and Menardi. And of course lets not forget about the twist and turns of how it would end. If you buy this game I hope you enjoy it as much as I have and look out for it's sequel Golden Sun 2.<br /><br />But the only thing that annoyed me about this game was that if you where low on health and you try to return to a town just to get healed or buy medicine a monster or monsters may ambush you killing you so that you lost money as well as experience. But don't let that stop you enjoying it at all.
