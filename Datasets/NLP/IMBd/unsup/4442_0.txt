Mike Conners plays Detective Dinardo, a New York detective investigating a series of ghastly murders of various residents in high-rise apartment complex. With some suspicion pointing to the strange doorman, Dinardo recruits police rookie Kate as bait to lure the killer into the open. What more would you expect from a slasher film? It pretty much on the poster tricked us with the Tagline. Not to mention a rotten script and a poor beginning. Lots of cheapable laughs. But it has very bad music in it. This is an awful movie who has the heart to like "Girl's Nite Out". If you agree with this, this is no way to waste your money on this. Skip this one and rent Anatomy.<br /><br />Rated R for Extreme Violence, Profanity, Nudity, Strong Adult Themes and Sexual Situations.
