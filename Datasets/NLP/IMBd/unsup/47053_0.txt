After the two pathetic ones- Masti and No entry we have another similar, regressive sick film. The reason is very simple. Those two were hits unfortunately. We have again three sick, married (surprisingly how come?) MCP types unable to control their libidos, and therefore chasing the skirts outside their marriage, and who ultimately are set right as per the norms of the happily married ones by one Mr. Lucky Bhaiyya. Throughout the film, he gives 'Misaals" (Examples) which he rightly call 'Missiles" as to escape them audience actually have to look for an outlet from the Theatre. The humor if at all it is called is sadistic, self-deprecating type. The characters look like buffoons as they mouth some gibberish trash lines that are called dialogs according to writer Milap Zaveri as usual. Also our trade pundits, should take a notice about the kind of stuff Director David Dhawan is capable of delivering when both of his regular writers- Anees Bazmee and Rumi Jaffrey are not with him. Finally, it is not Shaadi no. 1 but is Barbaadi no. 1. This reminds me of a recent joke going around in the industry. Director Kunal Kohli said he find it very insulting when he is not permitted in for the premiere of this film. Little did he know how fortunate he is as he escaped this intolerable, shoddy Stuff?<br /><br />Story line - Are You Joking? Rating- No more Jokes please!
