Oh where do I begin... It is possible for a cheesy movie to still be good. Some movies, while corny, are delightfully so. This movie has a cheese factor that could beat out the entire state of Wisconsin. Now don't get me wrong, this movie will hook you with the whole "plight to save her dead sister's child from the husband who murdered her" storyline, but that doesn't mean you should sit through it to find out who gets the kid. I happened upon this stereotypical Lifetime movie on a perfectly useful Saturday morning and by the time the film was over, so was the day. It's called a Lifetime movie because it takes a lifetime to watch... For a "based on a true story" movie, it was ridiculously unrealistic. The crime scene was so outrageous and the idea that relatives would be allowed to live in the house while it's under police investigation is so unbelievable it's almost laughable. Sitting down to watch this will mean at least four hours of your life that you will never get back.
