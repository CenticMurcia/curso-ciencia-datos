Scare Tactics was entertaining for the first two minutes of each show when Shannen Doherty was on. The rest of the show was purely for people who had brain damage from too much drinking and/or drugs. The kind of nasty stunts and scares that were pulled on the supposedly innocent victims was usually moronic or else just crude. At the end of each show Shannen Doherty would be back for the re-cap. I saw a few shows all the way to the end, but it was hard to believe that anyone who was of normal intelligence could believe the silly situations that were contrived. A couple of times, they pulled some crude stunts like women who were bleeding from private areas or people that had heart attacks. Those "scare tactics" were only believable because they were so crude. Once Stephen Baldwin became the host, the show aimed totally towards the dumb factor. At that point they were raiding Special Ed programs in order to find victims for their pranks.
