When you sit down to watch a comedy that you think may have potential to be really genuine, hilarious, and have some crude adult humor thrown in beware, it may turn out to be a total stinker like "Waiting...". I thought the idea of the setting, an everyday boisterous steakhouse, and the comedy of Ryan Reynolds would make this a hit, but the film blows on every level. The plot is non-existent, there are no jokes, the single attempt at any comedy (I won't spoil it, as if I could spoil anything about this crapper) is beyond childish and is used over and over throughout this 90+ minute root canal. Stereotypical, lame, and stupid are just a few words that come to mind.<br /><br />Who voted this as a "10", children under 12 who snuck the DVD from their parents and watched it late at night while all were asleep??? Pleeeeeaaasseeeee!!!!! How do these scripts get through to be major films? Also, please, enough already with the huge overblown "UNRATED" DVD versions, so you added a 5 second scene and now the film is sooo much better than the crap fest that we saw in the theaters, all I can say is NO.
