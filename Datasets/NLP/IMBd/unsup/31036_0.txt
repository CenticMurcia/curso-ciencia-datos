The fact that this movie was allowed to advance past the "script writing" stage is beyond me.<br /><br />If I could vote it 0, believe me I would. Watching paint dry would be a more cultural experience.<br /><br />They actually re-created scenes from existing comedy movies & virtually did them note for note. Can somebody explain the word parody to the film makers??? <br /><br />Some of the acting was quite good, it's just a shame that they had so little to work with to be able to assist with making this pile of junk watchable.
