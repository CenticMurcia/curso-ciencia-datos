Let's be honest: Johnny Hallyday may be a great singer and songwriter for some (and I honestly like some of his songs very much), but he's not an actor. As in this movie he has to play himself most of the time, this shouldn't be too much of a problem, but it is. His play is flat, as is Luchini's, who isn't funny enough to pull the audience through this annoyingly foreseeable screenplay (although the basic idea behind it is quite interesting). If you like either Johnny or Luchini, you might enjoy this. If you want to spend an evening laughing - this is not going to do it. It let me chuckle several times, but never laugh. This is a waste - in production money, and in the money you spend to see it.
