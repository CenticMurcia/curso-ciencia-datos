When I heard the fuss about this movie, all I could imagine was nothing except that typical melodramatic Bollywood's theme. And they say this is a good movie indeed. I must admit that they are right. But, surprisingly this movie (even has that common Bollywood theme) is bring a new sensibilities in Bollywood cinema. It's performs more natural style depending the others typical flick such K3G or Kahona Pyar Hai.... Compares with this one, those movie is nothing except trash. This is a serious drama, with realistic plot and fantastic sound track (worth for that MTV Asia Award). In short, this is really a good modern Hindi movies, and I highly recommended this to watch.<br /><br />8/10
