With stars like Billy Bob and Sean William Scott, and with a name like Wookcock, I was expecting some funny moments. However, I was sadly disappointed. This comedy was hardly funny, which spells disaster for any movie. No wonder it did so poorly at the box office.<br /><br />Billy Bob delivers a good performance as the balls buster tough PE coach whom we discover has redeeming values in the end. He's played this sarcastic, slightly mean guy in several films. Unfortunately, he was about all this movie had going for it. A corn eating contest is just not funny. And a guy under the bed while his mom gets it on is just gross.<br /><br />FINAL VERDICT: The laughs are few and far between, skip this.
