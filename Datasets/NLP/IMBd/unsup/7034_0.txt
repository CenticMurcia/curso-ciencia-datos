Truly a horrible motion picture. I can't believe I wasted almost 2 hours watching this piece of crap. The acting was second rate at best by all involved. Should have been listed as a comedy. I see that this is the only movie script that was written by Michael Jenning, I can understand why. John Irvin must have been short of cash to agree to direct this. Found it kind of amusing that the Stiller and Baldwin characters last names came out to Isabella Rosselini and their first names equaled Joey Lawrence. This movie has no redeeming value even with a cast of well known actors. They should have all donated their salary's to the Chicago PD or Appalachian relief fund. I can't say it enough, horrible, horrible movie.
