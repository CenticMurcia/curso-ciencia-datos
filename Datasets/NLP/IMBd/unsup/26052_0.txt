I'm shocked! The American film-goer loves a good romantic comedy and this one's perfect. George Segal and Barbara Streisand shine together in this "Odd Couple" meets "Bringing Up Baby" production. Belly-laugh funny throughout, this film succeeds in convincing the viewer to root for this couple to find love, instead of the fame and fortune they think they want. I give it a ten in spite of the lame soundtrack provided by Blood, Sweat and Tears. Fortunately, the music plays a completely insignificant role. If you like romantic comedy, you'll love this sleeper. Enjoy.
