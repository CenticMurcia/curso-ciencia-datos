aw, gee, what a bummer. i'll give any film with either Catherine Deneuve or John Malkovich a fair chance, as i have long been a fan of both actors for many, many years; my critical film watching began in nyc in the late 60's and was sharpened at the cinematheque in Paris in the early 70's. i'm willing to give Catherine Deneuve a lot of slack, because she is so beautiful to watch, but the thing that's troubling me here, in part, is that both she and Malkovich are lending their names to a film where they do little else, as also in the otherwise wonderful "I'm Going Home." unlike Johnny Depp, who has made his home in France but hasn't presumed to impose himself on French cinema, Malkovich keeps turning up but never seems to vary his vocal cadence, nor his basic persona. it's the same character over and over and over again. sad to see two formerly excellent actors walk their way through yet another film to pick up a paycheck.
