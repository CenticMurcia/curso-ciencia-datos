this is kill bill 30 years ago before that douche bag milked it....the out fit Lucy lui wears in the snow garden and the music is from lady snowblood.<br /><br />This movie is one of japans greatest. Meiko Kaji is stunning as the cold blooded yet high sympathetic character of lady snowblood. The action is bloodly and stylised and you get a let bit of a history lesson about japan in the 1800's The Music is beautiful and haunting and works well with the subject matter... A must see for all fans of Asian cinema.<br /><br />And if you like this i recommend the Baby cart (lone wolf and cub)movies Unmissable! Believe me you well not be disappointed. Go on prove me wrong
