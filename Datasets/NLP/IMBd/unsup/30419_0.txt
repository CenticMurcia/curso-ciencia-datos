My Favorite Year is a comedy set in New York in 1954. The plot is based on Errol Flynn's appearance on Sid Caesar's Show of Shows. Mel Brooks was a young writer on the show and had to chaperon Flynn and keep him out of trouble. In this movie Flynn becomes Allan Swann (Peter O'Toole) and Benji Stone (Mark Linn Baker) plays Brooks. Swann is a famous hell raiser, women find him irresistible but he ends every evening drunk. Stone hero-worships Swann but fails to make him behave. Most of the comedy comes from Swann's amusing and outrageous antics. <br /><br />The cast are funny, wise-cracking New Yorkers. Joe Bologna is particularly good as the star of the show. O'Toole is brilliant and lovable. This was Richard Benjamin's first and probably finest film as a director. I saw My Favorite Year with a cinema audience in 1982, who thought it was hilarious. It loses a lot on TV, but it's still enjoyable.
