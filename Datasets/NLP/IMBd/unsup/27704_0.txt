i believe that this movie should be renamed. for one simple reason. they do not use an actual frog in a single shot. if you watch the movie closely, you will see that all the 'frogs' have warts on them, except for the one at the end that they show for five minutes. This movie has the cheesiest special effects i've ever seen in my life, as can be expected from a movie from 1972. for example, when an alligator is following this dude, you can see that they had to speed up the film. i laughed a bit at that one. the cheesy special effects were all that made this movie good. it was very funny. The plot and characters were badly carried out and badly acted, respectively. to simple. 4/10.
