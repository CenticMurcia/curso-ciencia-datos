Just thought I'd add to some of the comments here, having seen "Erin Merryweather" in New York. This is an amazing film, beautifully paced and really quite spooky. The cast is top-notch (rare for an independent film with no big "stars"), particularly the two leads, Vigdis Anholt (who plays the title role) and David Morwick (Director, Screenwriter and Producer as well as co-star). First of all, "Erin" is lovingly shot, the camera work is fluid and inventive, and much of the story is told through some of the best (and creepiest) fairy-tale artwork I've seen. The original score - at once sad, foreboding and apocalyptic - complements the tone nicely. Can't say enough about this film, but it certainly didn't fit with some of the DV "slasher" stuff I saw at the rest of the festival. If you see this around, check it out.
