This documentary sets to prove that basically, there are no differences between the lesbians and gays, with families, that came for this cruise, than with straight folks in the same situation. Shari Cookson, the director of this informative film, doesn't pull punches. She just presents the material about people that are no different than others in their same social status, These folks are seen spending a relaxing vacation aboard a luxury ship, like any other regular family.<br /><br />What comes across is a picture of caring couples who love their partners and their children, who happen to have a different sexual preference. It's evident the love for their families. Rosie O'Donnell is prominently shown. She was the driving force for bringing people of all kinds of backgrounds into this sea voyage that happened to be geared toward gays and lesbians with families, so they can share the experience and fun of a carefree vacation.<br /><br />These passengers and their families show they are more normal than the world would think they are.
