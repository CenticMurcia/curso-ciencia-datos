For you stoogeheads who haven't seen this short, but have seen (and watched repeatedly) the original version 'CORNY CASANOVAS', then stick to watching that one and don't waste your time on this clunker. All of the Besser remaking Curly or Shemp shorts miss the mark, but this attempt is extremely putrid. Poor editing, and transitions from old to new footage (and vice-versa), horribly redone gags, Moe treating diaper Joe like a delicate 2 year old instead of cracking his skull like he did with Shemp & Curly. In short, it stinks!<br /><br />1.5/10
