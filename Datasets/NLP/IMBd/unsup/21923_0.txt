i re watched this film last noc, for the umpteenth time, and it is better than i recalled. i would have to put it in my top five westerns. it is that good. i can't write a technical review; it's all about the emotion for me. a couple of folks have done what i would call technical reviews, and they are spot on. my sole purpose here is to say that this film is about dignity in a way that rarely does a film achieve. it is not, as some claim, a spaghetti western - they are visually confused, i think. it is a spare, lean film that speaks to individual human dignity. yes, it does have racial overtones, but it goes far beyond those limits. the film is absolutely universal in its compelling portrait - in a way i think it is more like a samurai film; it speaks to bushido, to honor and duty. no one ever did elmore leonard a greater service on screen. i simply can find no fault with any of the cast, writers or director. don e.
