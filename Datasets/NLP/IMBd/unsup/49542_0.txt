God! I am a big time fan of Horror movies, i get the thrill and excitement when i watch them. But, let me assure you this movie comes with no such package. It bores you to death.<br /><br />Based on some thought process, which is crazy to say the least, this movie revolves around a ghostly forest which has seen sufferings of a girl some 200 years ago. Who suddenly decides "Its my time, folks"! and she kills...<br /><br />An American, an Englishman, and a stoner head into the forest in search of a hidden burial ground (just wait for the punch line). Sean, the American, has his grandfather's leather-bound journal, which details the horrific reign of Satinka, a malicious tree ghost with sharpened twigs for fingers who haunts the forest. Using the journal and the final photographs of a vanished tourist, the trio are intent on locating Satinka's haunted tree and the sacred burial ground that lies beneath. A couple of female botany students wander into the plot, apparently to keep things interesting.<br /><br />It turns out Satinka was an American Indian who was killed by some crazy white boys intent on driving out all the Injuns. She exacts her revenge by stabbing victims with wood slivers, thus marking them, and then sucking them into the ground. Despite Satinka's Native American heritage, she looks and moves like pretty much every Asian ghost you've seen in J-horror movies (and their American remakes) since The Eye, black hair hanging in her face, dark eyes, crawling in stutters and jerks across the forest floor, with the sound of snapped twigs accompanying her arrival.<br /><br />Please avoid watching it and wasting time.
