This was my favourite film of the year by far. I always love the work of David Lynch, and this is by far his best work yet. It is 3 hours long, and some parts may seam overly long at first, but the second time you watch it it all seams perfect. This film is only let down by one minor complaint about the way it is filmed, with a Digial camera, though the shots are beautifully clear and so sharp they suck you in, there is moments of shaking and easy moving camera that at first I disliked, but it grows on you. INLAND EMPIRE will not be to everyone's taste, but i'm happy to say to those it will appeal, It is well worth it! 20 out of 10!
