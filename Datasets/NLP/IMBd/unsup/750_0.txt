This movie is stupid in a bad way. It's from the same director (John Boorman) that gave us the screen gems Zardoz and The Exorcist II, which should have told me not to see this movie. Instead of wasting two hours of my life, I think it would have been enough for him to just show a sign saying "White people = industrialization = Satan." The director isn't even content with having that message subtly portrayed, but rather goes in for the slapping us with it.<br /><br />*SPOILER* And, you have to love the plausable ending where the native people when in the end by using drugs to call their spirit people to make the dam blow up. It's like the writers thought to themselves, "Hmm, wow I blew all our money on cocaine and I still don't have an ending. I bet a happy ending would sell well." It even ended with the words on the screen saying "A few tribe still have not made contact with the outside world. They remember something we forgot." How stupid and cheesy is that? And I won't even get started on how the "Fierce People" steal the "Invisible People's" women and sell them into prostitution for alcohol. *END SPOILER*<br /><br />This movie p***ed me off. The acting was actually decent, but just completely ruined by the story line. It was melodramatic tripe, and it could have been so interesting. The only other plus is the beautiful scenery.
