I had to watch this for university and it was the worst piece of media I have ever seen in my life! They call this a documentary. It cannot be called a documentary because there are no interviews or commentary -- it's just someone following people around with a camera in Cuba. Perhaps people think it's good and arty because it's "different" and not like the average documentary but seriously, there is no movement, direction or purpose to this and it's 85 minutes of my life I will never get back!! One will not learn much from this piece of media as it is not particularly informative. I found it hard to keep watching this, alone write an essay on it afterwards. Thanks a lot university, NOT!!!
