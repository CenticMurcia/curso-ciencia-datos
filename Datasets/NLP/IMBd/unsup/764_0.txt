Emerald Forest is certainly guilty of oversimplifying the displacement of tribal peoples, but I remembered it fondly. I watched it on video, soon after it came out, and again this morning. I found that I had long since forgotten all the flashy aspects of the plot (the cannibals, the machine gun and the sex slavers), but remembered the courtship ritual very clearly. The parts I had forgotten seemed a bit forced, harder to believe.<br /><br />After my first viewing, I was certain that "Daddee" Bill had blown up the dam. Now I'm not so sure it wasn't coming down anyway.<br /><br />Also, it was hard not to be reminded of Jungle2Jungle (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119432/) while watching it now, especially where the son mystically finds his father's skyscraper apartment in a large city.
