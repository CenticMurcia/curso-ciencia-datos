This David Hamilton movie is something of a disaster. It has a half-decent story (coming-of-age/love triangle) and a mediocre script. All of Hamilton's usual trademarks are here - stunningly beautiful & innocent young girls, soft-focus photography, lots of nudity, gentle lesbianism, and a romantic soundtrack. There is/was a good movie to be made with the given material & cast, but this is not it. The editing is appalling, and at times the scene shifts seem somewhat disjointed.<br /><br />It's worth remembering that Hamilton was an iconic photographer of his time and experimented with taking his art into the movie field, in many ways pioneering the penchant for photographers in the adult industry to also dabble in video work.<br /><br />However, on the plus side, there are very good performances from Dawn Dunlap (as Laura) and James Mitchell (as Paul), and the soundtrack is quite nice.<br /><br />To summarise, I'd say that unless you're a fan of Hamilton's other work, e.g. Bilitis, Summer in St Tropez, then this is best forgotten.<br /><br />I rate it 4/10.
