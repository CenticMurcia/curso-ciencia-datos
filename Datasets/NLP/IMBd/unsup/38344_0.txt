I did not know whether to laugh or Cry and i was only 5 minutes into the movie. I am still trying to recall if i have seen acting, direction and storyline all that bad in the same film.<br /><br />I had to admit i had my reservations when i saw that Michael Madsen had a cameo role, that usually consists of him strolling around just thinking of collecting his paycheck and as for introducing David Ginola !!!! He is a football Player and as a Tottenham Hotspur fan i say a great one but if his football skills were as wooden as his acting skills he would have never scored a goal.<br /><br />Billy Zane, Billy Zane, Billy Zane what can i say, you do have Kelly Brook but yet since this has happened Jason Stathams career has gone higher and higher and i don't think you can go any lower.<br /><br />On a final note the Nazis were made to look like good guys....can i say any more, please don't subject yourself to 90 minutes of torture DO NOT WATCH THIS for your own sake.
