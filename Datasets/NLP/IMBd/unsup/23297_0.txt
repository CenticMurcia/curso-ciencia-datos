The first thought was: "why would a successful doctor with the French wife decide to return to Stalin's Russia?" Nostalgia?. But then, when I was watching the movie, all events seemed so realistic. I'm truly believe that that's exactly what would have happened to them. No life, No escape, No future! The story is about sacrifice we all make for the people we love, but the price Marie and Alexei paid was too high.
