I first went to see Dumb and Dumber, when it came to the cinemas, and brought my entire family along. I had already seen Jim Carrey in the Mask, and Ace Ventura, and loved him in those films. The review of the film was quite good, so I looked forward to this. My father wondered if it really was a movie in his taste... and then the movie started. I have never in my movie infested life had such a journey as I did that day. The atmosphere in the theathre was amazing. From the first moment (when you see Jim Carrey ask a lady about the way) to the final moment (the two dimwits walks away on the freeway), I cried of laughter. So did every member of my family. And every soul in that theathre. The humor was low, witty, crazy and, yes, dumb! This movie is on my top ten list and has deserved it ten times a round.<br /><br />Don't miss the following scenes: the Toilett scene, the beerdrinking scene, the one where Jim pours poop-potion in Jeff Daniels coffee (the result is seen in the toilett scene), and the final scene when the goofballs turns down an offering to become oilrubbers for beatiful models. Love this movie!! 11/10, simply
