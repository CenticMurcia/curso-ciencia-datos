We took our 6 year old boy to see Dinosaur this weekend, but I think my wife and I were even more amazed than he at the MARVELOUS imagery in the film.<br /><br />I saw every penny of the $200 Million it cost to produce this film ON SCREEN. The sheer beauty of the water glistening off the wet dinosaurs was enough to make us sit up and pay attention.<br /><br />You could see all the hard work the programmers and animators put in this film, and if the breathtaking opening sequence doesn't get you, the "mating dance of the monkeys" surely will.<br /><br />Simply put, this may be the finest work of animation ever.. and I'm a LION KING nut!<br /><br />**** from me!<br /><br />
