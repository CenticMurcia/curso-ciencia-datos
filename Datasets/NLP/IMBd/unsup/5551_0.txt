If seen now by young people who weren't old enough to have lived during the Viet-Nam War, this film will seem "small" and out-dated. But, when this film was released in 1969 at the peak of the war, this was not only a very funny film, but a sad reality of the society of the times. <br /><br />Sad in the fact that some draft-age males would make believe they were gay to avoid going to Viet-Nam.<br /><br />Made slightly before the Gay Liberation movement, this film gives a surprisingly sensitive view of the gay lifestyle and gay community of this era. Micheal Greer gives an academy award winning performance (he wasn't even nominated)as the gay landlord, Malcom DeJohn; in one of the screens funniest, yet sensitive performances. DeJohn is best remembered as "Queenie" in the brutal prison film, Fortune in Men's Eyes. <br /><br />The stars of the show, Kevin Coughlin as Danny and Lawrence Casey as Elliot give fresh, intense, and emotional edged performances as men living with the fear of the war lurking over their shoulders.<br /><br />Also wonderful supporting roles by Sebastian Brook and veteran character actor Jack Starrett.<br /><br />The Gay Deceivers captures a time in American history that has been forgotten. Yet, today's headlines have made this film worthwhile today. The Gay Deceivers is not deceiving at all, I rate it a 10 out of 10.
