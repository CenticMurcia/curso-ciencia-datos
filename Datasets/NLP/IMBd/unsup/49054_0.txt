In bringing a true story to the screen, directors are always hampered by the inevitable lack of suspense.<br /><br />We all know the plot of Rogue Trader, working class whiz kid brings down venerable merchant bank, gets caught & goes to prison. Fair enough. But where the director totally failed in this film is to generate any dynamism or energy in what should have been a frenetic, fast paced account of the collapse of Barings Bank.<br /><br />Rogue Trader has about as much zing as soggy custard. It's so flat, I was crying out for some passion, and I don't mean the abysmal scenes of Ewan MacGregor and Anna Friel cavorting clumsily on a heap of bearer bonds.<br /><br />MacGregor is convincing as Leeson, but the rest of the cast are just laughable. Special mention goes to the appalling efforts of Tim McInnerny as Tony Hawes and Nigel Lindsay as Ron Baker, and the entire Asian cast who were exceptionally wooden.<br /><br />You always know a film is in trouble when a character explains the technicalities of the plot to another character solely for the audience's benefit. Witness MacGregor's embarrassing explanation of the "five eights" account to his colleague. And trying to teach the complicated nuances of futures trading to his wide-eyed staff in a Delifrance? Please!<br /><br />Rogue Trader had potential. Captivating real-life plot, strong lead actor. But the film is a stinker, awash with cliches and cardboard cut-out acting. What a shame. Ewan MacGregor, you can do better than this!
