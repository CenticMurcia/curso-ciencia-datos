Having read the novel almost a year ago, I was very impatient to watch the movie knowing the magnificent cast lined up to put their talent on display for that movie. I was surprised when I found out that the younger actors/actresses have matched - and sometimes- exceeded their older and more famous counterparts. Hend Sabry continues her breath-taking displays with a very natural and heart-touching impersonation of Bouthina, the poor little girl who find herself surrounded by a crucial mother asking her to bring money home regardless of how she does so and numerous men trying to use her body to satisfy their sexual desires. Adel Imam & Nour El Sheriff put the wisdom of years of acting into producing very real characters from the Egyptian society. What came as a a surprise is Adel Imam's son in real life (The bawab's son who become a terrorist) and Khaled El Sawy (The Gay). No matter what you say about gays, Khaled El Sawy faces the difficult task of making you hate him and then sympathize with him as he recalls the lack of attention he got from his parents that caused him to become a gay. Also the scene where he tries to convince the soldier that he takes back home that being gay is not 7aram and that its 7allal. I think this would be his best ever role and he proved himself as a capable actor today. I would say a 9 over 10 and a new record for Egyptian Cinema. A Must See.
