Stylish, starmaking, still effective crime meller by the under- appreciated Bill Wellman, in which James Cagney gives a riveting, stunningly brilliant, rightly careermaking perf; one which sealed his fame, secured his rep, and in some ways haunted him for much of his early career. Splendid setpieces hilite this chronicle of a gangster's rise and fall; perhaps best known is the ol' Grapefruit to the Face trick Jim pulls on Mae Clarke, but my favorite is when they deliver the body to Mama, on a slab. Whomp! You gotta love it. This is a great film twice over. First, on its own merit; second, on its lasting appeal and impact. Not many 70 year old movies hold up so well as this one.
