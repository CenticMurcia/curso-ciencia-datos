Emmanuelle Beart is one of those paradoxical European actresses (like Penelope Cruz, Fanny Ardent, Emmanuelle Seigner......) - kind of ugly/beautiful, one moment their acting sucks (Mission Impossible, Manon des sources), the next it's sublime (A Heart in Winter, L'Enfer). For me, Emmanuelle Beart was the only good thing about this movie. She captured the upper-middle-class mother thrust into extraordinary circumstances with great skill. Just a pity the story went nowhere. The English title "Strayed" was well-deserved, it summed up the plot well. Seems that some folks watched this movie in the expectation of riveting sex scenes, and while I thought that the whole ending sequence was very contrived, the sex scene did work to make sense of the movie, which was just as well since the rest of it was kind of ludicrous.
