This was one of the best shows of its kind when it was running.<br /><br />A classic 1980's situation comedy. <br /><br />I cant believe it ran for that many episodes. I also cant believe that it finished that long ago.<br /><br />Michael J Fox really made the show, and the show was based on him, and the family he was a member of.<br /><br />Or though the episodes were only 30 minutes long, the comedy it provided was excellent.<br /><br />I hope the series can come out on DVD very soon.<br /><br />This series deserves to be seen by future generations.
