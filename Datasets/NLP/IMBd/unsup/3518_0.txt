I thoroughly enjoyed the entire movie and all of the characters. But I have to admit...I went back to see it two more times (so far) because of Terrence Dashon Howard. What can I say...those eyes and especially that smile! Oooooh, that smile! I saw the movie for the first time less than two weeks ago and saw it for the third time tonight. I'll be waiting for when it goes on sale. Please hurry!!
