I think this film is schneiders worst. Of course, this depends on what you expect of a Helge movie. As a Helge fanatic for years i am used to the kind of humor of the preceding movies - loving the sometimes senseless, sometimes daffy but mostly with a subliminal critical and ironical undertone between the lines style of this intelligent musician and comedian. But this one is really different.<br /><br />I was really looking forward to see the movie. When i went out the cinema, i was really deranged and couldn't really believe what i saw. There might be the thin storyline of the club, Helge and his fellows playing jazz at, being closed and Helge is forced to ensure his subsistence and so on. But in my opinion this is not enough even for this relative short movie of 84 minutes. The only thing happening is the band jamming at their jazz club, Helge selling fish and Helge carrying out newspapers. Additionally visiting the bum under the bridge and bearing his wife.<br /><br />I think Helge just didn't want to miss the chance making a movie with his temporary band mates Jimmy Wood and Pete York but without really having an substantial idea of a story - so this really boring movie came out.<br /><br />Nevertheless the music being played at the movie is still of high quality as we are used to from Helge. Furthermore there are indeed some funny scenes like Helge trying to get the newspapers under control in the hurricane or the alien-scene at the end of the movie.
