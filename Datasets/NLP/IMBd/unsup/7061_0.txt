I have just watched Miike Takashi' film Visitor Q, tonight, and i think that it is one of the most insane and disturbing films that i have ever seen, since Ichi The Killer another of Miike's films I almost found it too shocking to watch parts of it because of the film content. It is about a father, who is a former television reporter who is trying to make a documentary about violence and sex among youths in Japan. He has sex with his daughter who is a prostitute. There are some really disturbing sences in this film where his son beats up his mom, who is also a prostitute and also a heroin addict, and has to inject herself everyday."Q" a strange man comes and lives with the family but before he injures the father by hitting him in the head with a large stone, who he later becomes friends with. It is hard to explain how insane this film is. I would recommend this film only to people who are able to watch such disturbing images. But i thought that it was still a fantastic film. 7/10
