I picked this movie up in the Walmart $5 bin as a present for a friend. I couldn't help myself and I opened it and watched it. This has to be one of the hardest movies to sit through ever. The only good part is random nudity, but it doesn't make up for the crime that the producer committed against the viewer. Painfully bad to watch. I thought I might get some cheap laughs from it, like the laughs you get from watching Point Break. I just felt insulted. I normally think it's funny when someone tries to create the surfer lifestyle and completely screws it up. This is just sad. I don't believe that any of the characters surf at all in this movie.
