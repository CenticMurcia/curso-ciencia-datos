Movies, which are made of different stories, are often having one problem; that stories are quite different to each other by the quality. But not in this case: Jim Jarmuschs most famous work Night on earth is a perfect example of the movie, made of stories, where every story is great. The movie shows five different taxi cab drivers in one night all over the world: Los Angeles, New York, Paris, Rome and Helsinki.<br /><br />LOS ANGELES: Maybe my least favorite but Winona Ryder is fantastic and very cute in this clip. But the whole story was nothing special, maybe some cute dialog in the middle, but overall quite average.<br /><br />NEW YORK: Very funny clip, despite the fact I hate Rosie Perez (well, her voice), but the other two characters, the German ex-clown who is now very unsuccessful taxi driver, and Jojo, very funny guy who is just complaining all the time and laughing very loud, are really convincing. Funny episode.<br /><br />Paris: Great clip, Beatrice Dalle is beautiful in this clip, very convincing and the story is also very great with good message.<br /><br />ROME: The best clip of the movie. Benigni, describing his sexual relationships with sheep and pumpkin, is funny as hell. He's really a master of comedy and without a doubt this is the most funniest part of the movie.<br /><br />HELSINKI: After very humorous clip, Helsinki are quite depressing part of the movie. Three drunk workers and a depressed taxi driver with a tragic life is really too sad and sometimes I doesn't fell like this part belongs in the whole movie. But there are some funny moments (Taxi driver is asking a drunk man: "Do you know where you are?" and the drunk man says: "Yeah... Helsinki.").<br /><br />Overall, this movie is great and a cute masterpiece. Jim Jarmusch really is a king of independent movies.
