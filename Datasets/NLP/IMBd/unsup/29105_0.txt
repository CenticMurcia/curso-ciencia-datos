No offence to British film-makers, hey I'm British, but they are usually very, very bad at creating horror films, so I didn't really know what to expect when I went to see this film, but it got into the cinema so it must be worth it, with the exception of, 'Jay and Silent Bob strike back!' and 'Dog Soldiers' (that was a bit unoriginal and had some pretty pathetic lines in it), I mean. But actually it was quite good, lots of jumps and I liked the characters, at times it was quite scary and I thought the ouji (don't know how to spell it) board idea was good, people say its unoriginal but hey, how many movies about ouji boards have you seen? Anyway I found this quite a good film and the acting was quite good, I thought the way it was shot was really cool and gave a great effect to the movie, overall I give it ******** out of ********** for a horror flick<br /><br />Good Movie!<br /><br />Top_Movie_Fan-Fave-Film_Powder_4eva!
