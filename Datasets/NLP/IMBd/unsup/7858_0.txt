Unfortunately for Disney, I don't see how this loser of a movie could have made it any money. Even the great talent of Eddie Murphy couldn't save it. The premise, I understand, but what followed after the beginning credits rolled was beyond boring. Actually, I slept through about half of the movie. I'd wake up, look at it, and its boredom would knock me right back out. I felt like I needed to continue watching it, however, because I had paid for it on Pay Per View, and that was definitely one I'd ask my money back for had it been at the theater. Eddie Murphy did the best he could but could not pull it out of the fire. My cats usually watch TV, and counting their responses by walking out of the room and not coming back till the movie ended said it all! I do not recommend this movie to any one unless they want to be bored to death and join the "dead people in the backyard"! This rotten tomato is nowhere near Disney's or Eddie's good works but must be one of the worst of both!
