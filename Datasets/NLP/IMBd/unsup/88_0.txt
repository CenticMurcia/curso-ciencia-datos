Match 1: D'Lo Brown (c) vs Val Venis for the European Championship - Pretty decent opener. Back in the late 90's D'Lo could really work a decent match, but as of his recent performances on Raw in 2008 I'm not impressed anymore. So basically these two go at it for with WWE's now defunct European title on the line. Venis looked pretty good in the ring, his character was still relatively fresh at this time. But anyway towards the end of the match Val gets himself disqualified, which means D'Lo retains the title.<br /><br />Match 2: The Oddities (Kurrgan, Golga and Giant Silva) (with Luna Vachon and The Insane Clown Posse) vs Kaientai (Taka Michinoku, Dick Togo, Mens Teioh and Sho Funaki) (with Yamaguchi-san) in a Handicap Match - Extremely weak match. I did like the Oddities as comic relief, but guys like Kurrgan and Golga did better as singles wrestlers. This, as J.R. says in the commentary, is not a classic. Anyway the Oddities squash their way to a victory over Kaientai.<br /><br />Match 3: Jeff Jarrett vs X-Pac in a Hair vs Hair Match - The first good match of the night. These two put out a very crowd pleasing match at this particular Summerslam. X-Pac is able to score the win, but Jarrett retreats from getting his hair cut. He is brought back to the ring shortly and they cut his formerly long hair into the look he had all through WCW and in TNA.<br /><br />Match 4: Marc Mero & Jacqueline vs Edge & Sable - A great way to get the young Edge over. Edge has always been tremendous in the ring, and even though he faces off with the talentless Marc Mero, he still manages to put on a decent match. In the end Edge and Sable get the win.<br /><br />Match 5: Ken Shamrock vs Owen Hart in a Lion's Den match - This match was off the hook. Owen Hart completely ruled the ring, if it wasn't for his death he would have been WWE Champion at some point. This match was absolutely awesome. Shamrock is able to defeat Owen in the end, but I still applaud Owen because he was such a great wrestler. He's a guy that needs to be in the WWE Hall of Fame.<br /><br />Match 6: Mankind (c) vs The New Age Outlaws for the WWF/E Tag Team Championship - This was just a low and lame match. Kane is the tag team partner of Mankind, but he doesn't show. So Mankind is left to fend alone against Road Dogg and Billy Gunn. In the end they get the win over Mankind and claim the Tag Titles again.<br /><br />Match 7: The Rock (c) vs Triple H in a Ladder Match for the Intercontinental Championship - The match of the night. These two incredible veterans put out a great match. At this point both the Rock and the Game were on the verge of becoming main eventers, and I think this match made it for them. Honestly a fantastic, must watch, match. In the end Triple H grabs the title to win.<br /><br />Match 8: Stone Cold Steve Austin (c) vs Undertaker for the WWF/E Championship - Great main event. Really one of Summerslam's best matches of all time. Madison Square Garden completely was behind Austin as he went into battle with the Undertaker for his championship. After a vicious battle, Austin hits the Stunner to retain the title. Crowd was completely ecstatic.
