Note that these shorts are not "extreme" horror films in the American sense. The film that comes closest to contemporary American sensibilities in this vein is the South Korean one, "Cut."<br /><br />Namely, if you're a strict fan of recent American "scare-core" movies and you don't particularly go for foreign films, you should probably steer clear of these. Otherwise you'll probably yawn and feel gypped because they don't scare you out of your skin. (But please take note that they don't intend to.)<br /><br />These films are more unsettling and eerie than horrifying in the way that American audiences have come to expect in the horror genre. With the possible exception of "Cut," they are not mini "popcorn films" and should be watched with silence and an open mind.<br /><br />"Dumplings" is very strong; it immerses you in the unique (and close) ambiance of its setting. The pacing of the plot is also good. "Dumplings" seeks to make the audience feel vaguely sick and recoil rather than scream or skip a heartbeat. It has a very sly, dark sense of humor running through its core.<br /><br />"Cut" also has moments of levity and twisted creativity and is entertaining. There's something almost baroque about the visuals and it's got a denser, more packed plot than the other two shorts. Ultimately, I found it less effective than the other two pieces, which opt for the understated instead of overt "extremes." I liked the very beginning of "Cut" the best, with its strange and alluring female specter; I found myself wishing the filmmakers had developed this scene as a narrative instead of the main story.<br /><br />"Box" is more similar to "Dumplings" in feel, being dreamy and surreal; however, you are invited to inhabit the main character more. The film is a psychological drama and relies heavily on its use of wintry imagery and symbolism, which makes it an engrossing experience. Ambiguity and the audience's projections on the story are crucial; especially toward the end. You might recognize some visual motifs from other Japanese works such as the original versions of "Dark Water" and "The Ring" ("Ringu.") None of these is a "popcorn" flick, with the possible exception of "Cut." I recommend "Three ... Extremes" for fans of East Asian cinema and also aficionados of foreign films in general.
