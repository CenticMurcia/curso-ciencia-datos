This is a good movie to sit and watch on a night when you have nothing else to do. <br /><br />It's an interesting character movie where you sit and watch the life of a person for a short time frame out of his life.<br /><br />Nothing special, but if you like movies like me, then every once and a while a good independently made character film is enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />Steve Busceme's character was interesting and he played it well. An interesting slice of life yarn about a man down on his luck.<br /><br />I will rate it 7 out of 10. Based on the IMD rating scale this achieves the minimum 7 rating, that in my opinion, makes a movie worthwhile to watch.
