As a connoisseur of bad movies this makes the list of bad of the bad. I had such HIGH hopes for this movie. I LOVE Vinnie Jones in his usual tough guy film (Lock Stock Two Smoking Barrels). He is a tough convincing actor in nearly everything he stars in. Even in X Men 3 he pulled off a brief good time as "Juggernaut". I don't see how he got stuck in this movie. And Eddie Griffin is a great comedic actor and was BRILLIANT in "Undercover Brother." Why he chose to star in this movie is a mystery as well.<br /><br />Both Vinnie Jones and Eddie Griffin are incredibly talented actors and always a joy to watch. But together in this movie they just don't make up for the horrible writing, tired plot, and terrible supporting actors. And as much as I like both of them, I just can't see these two starring in anything together that will be good without good writing and better direction.<br /><br />And come on Hollywood. The George Bush jabs are just old.
