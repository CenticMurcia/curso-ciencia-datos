My girlfriend talked about wanting to see this movie for months on end and so finally I gave in and got it for her so that we could watch it together.<br /><br />I had no idea about what it was about until we started watching it.<br /><br />The plot is going to offend a lot of people. The teacher/student/illegal relationship bothered me and I'm a pretty open-minded person. There wasn't much feeling in it and it came off very unrealistic. It needed to be much more powerful to pull off such a touchy subject.<br /><br />The acting wasn't the best. The characters were horribly planned out, and I couldn't see any (real) chemistry between the two of them.<br /><br />Annabelle is your stereotypical "bad girl" that gets sent to a Catholic Boarding school. The stereotype is ridiculously overplayed. I stress that point. In fact it's so bad that you no longer even root for Annabelle's happiness because she becomes such an annoyance. Her behavior was unbelievable. And I was hoping that she would just leave her poor teacher alone.<br /><br />And why does Simone just let it happen? It's not believable that a woman like Simone would be even mildly interested in Annabelle, much-less risk that much for the stupid little girl. She doesn't even seem to be that interested in her, she seems more like a victim in their "relationship".<br /><br />The sex scene was probably the only well done thing in the entire movie, but with the rest of the plot, you didn't even want to see them have sex. In fact I was hoping throughout the movie that it wouldn't happen.<br /><br />At best, this movie was a complete joke. It was hard to take you eyes off of it in a "car crash" sort of way.<br /><br />If you're gonna watch this movie, I'd recommend borrowing it, not spending the money to rent it or buy it.
