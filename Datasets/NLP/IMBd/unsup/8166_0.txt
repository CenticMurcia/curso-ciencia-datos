Stupid love story destroyed this movie. This movie could have been a hundred times darker without the stupid teeny bopper lust fest. Give my money back and I'll stop complaining. And for god's sake where have all the good actors gone??? I mean this movie was done after the father/son crash. That was by far the most exciting part and I could have left the theater happy. Ankle bracelet for a teenager eh? Not exactly common practice but OK. I just hope they don't try to follow up this movie with some other stupid movie about that kid being more psychologically jacked up. Oh I know they are trying to come up with something just because so many of us wasted money on this pathetic piece of crap they call film.
