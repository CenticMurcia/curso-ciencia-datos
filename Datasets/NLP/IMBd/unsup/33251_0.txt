There are definitely some people who hate Greek Mythology. The proof lies in "Minotaur" movie. <br /><br />They took the story of Minotaur from the Greek Myth and they distorted so badly ending up with this awful movie.<br /><br />It is supposed to chance things cause you want to improve something not to make it worst. <br /><br />The original story of Minotaur based on symbolism is full of meaning. The story of this movie has nothing to tell. Absolutely not enjoyable. Like somebody else said... they butcher the mythology of the Minotaur story to make this. It's silly and insulting.
