Recently caught this 8-part documentary on the Sundance Channel and I can't recommend it strongly enough. "The Staircase" recounts the investigation, pre-trial strategies, familial turmoil and then the trial of a wealthy author (Michael Peterson) accused of murdering his a corp exec wife. Given incredible access to the crime scene, lawyer-accused meetings, and the trial itself, this tops the best courtroom drama films I've seen. Without spoilers, the events that are caught on film and the revelations that occur make this a riveting view. It's got all the twists, turns and emotional roller-coaster of a fine film, and the ending will have you gripped. Hopefully this will get a DVD release or replay on TV, because I keep telling people about it. If you get the chance, don't miss it. Not to give away the ending, but we sure didn't agree with the verdict, but just as the jury made up their mind, so can you.
