I do not regret to have rushed to see this movie without proper documentation, because I spent 119 minutes of pure joy, spoiled by an inexplainable ending (solved since).It is of course a testament, but I am only five years younger than Alain Resnais and I prefer to spend them without too much questions asked, about death mostly. It is of course a transcription of an English stage-play, but AR did not choose it blindly, he must be on the same wave length (or shortcut) with Alan Ayckburn. Perfect script, perfect direction, perfect players, making my disappointment even bigger. Besides, the religious devotion of Sabine Azema is far from obvious, and Isabelle Carré looks more like André Dussolier's daughter than sister. The assistance laughed a lot, like I did, and came out smiling, (not me). However, and definitely, the best movie of the year, closely followed by PRADA. harry carasso, Paris
