"Do you remember when you could sit outside and not worry about the mosquitoes and the killers?" That's the best line from this backwoods clunker filled with terrible sound, music, and "actors" who seem to be just a group of friends who took a week of acting classes and said, hey we can make a movie now! After a poorly filmed rape scene intro, some nut case in camouflage and a black motorcycle helmet straps a nail gun air canister to his/her back and starts picking off goobers in some small hick town. While some of the victims are the rapists and probably deserve this, other people are killed because they are merely construction workers(like the rapists) or because they are women who are with the workers. Very oddball stuff. The nail gun effects are all after-shots, where the gun is fired and then the camera gets a close up of the nail already in the flesh. Granted, I didn't expect much in the way of effects from a film with a title like this.<br /><br />I would have given this a few extra points, maybe even 6 out of 10, dare I admit it, if only the stupid killer didn't have that lame laugh that you couldn't tell if it was coming from the helmet or the soundtrack. It was all reverb and echo and totally ruined anything decent the movie might have had going for it(well, that and the horrid sound quality--dialogue is often lost due to the sound of passing traffic). Then there are the jokes. Apparently, this killer has to be funny when he kills, sort of like Student Bodies, except in this case, the funny scenes are when the killer isn't telling jokes. God, they are horrible zingers and you wish he'd nailgun his own face.<br /><br />I cannot in good conscience recommend this for horror fans as it is more like a comedy. I can't recommend it as a comedy either. You really need to have nothing better to do than sit through this garbage, like maybe if you are in traction and can't escape the front of the TV screen.
