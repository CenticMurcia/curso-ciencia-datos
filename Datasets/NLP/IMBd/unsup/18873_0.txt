If you like horror films then you will love this movie. 'House of 1000 Corpses' will keep you on edge, and scare the crap out of you. Rob Zombie is a brilliant horror writer, so if you are squeamish, please stay away! As far as horror movies go, this is among the best ever made. I compare almost all new horror movies to this one, and few come close to the extremity and violence of this film. People who give this movie a low rating do not appreciate true horror, and therefore should not be taken into consideration when evaluating whether or not to watch this movie. It goes from general nervous horror (like what are those crazy kids doing in that "creepy country town") to full out mutilating horror where people are getting scalped and slowly tortured. It leaves out nothing when it comes to messed up killings, Rob Zombie somehow thinks of it all. You don't have to be a Rob Zombie fan to like this movie, anyone I have ever watched this with has been horrified (to say the least) and that is what most people are looking for when turning to a truly scary movie for entertainment. I can't give 'House of 1,000 Corpses' enough praises for stepping outside the box of the general horror movie equation, adding both an intense plot and gruesome (not cheesy) effects. It is a movie that will stay with you, and will stand out in your mind when comparing it to the rest of the new millennium horror films. I absolutely love it!!!
