Lost Lake (initially titled Peak Experience) has wide appeal with adventure, awesome scenery and romance involving beautiful young people. The actors are totally suited to their roles, and Angel Boris looks like a young Natalie Wood. The music is contemporary and appropriate for the time, place and mix of characters. The plot is a romantic comedy that is not a formula. The element of reincarnation is thought-provoking for those with open minds and welcome for the believers, and polls show there are lots of believers. The skiing is superb and the humor is light and fast like the skiing. Lost Lake is upbeat, fun and never offensive. Lost Lake is an excellent movie for young adults and adults who are young at heart.
