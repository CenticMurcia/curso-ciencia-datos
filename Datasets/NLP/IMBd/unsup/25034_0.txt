I was so disappointed with this movie. After reading reviews and user comments here and elsewhere, comments mentioning the "dream-like" qualities of this movie, the surprise ending, the colorful imagery - the name "Columbo" was even mentioned - I was expecting an eerie, thought-provoking who-dunnit giallo crossing Dario Argento with Poirot. Wrong. This is a stupid body count movie that easily could have been a made-for-American-TV creepshow crap film if some of the graphic violence was removed. The only thoughts you'll be provoked into are thoughts about exactly what method will be used to kill the next victim. The imagery isn't all that colorful, either, certainly not matching Dario's worst movies. The surprise ending is extremely brief, less than 3 minutes, and utterly stupid. Can you tell I hated this movie?
