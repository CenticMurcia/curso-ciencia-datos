... to dull the incredible pain this stinkmaster causes. You really have to feel sorry for Lisa Kurdow in this film. The film's makers picked her to be in a small, uncredited cameo role. Instead of making her the lead, they chose Bonnie Pritchard. Why is beyond me. Probably the only person who can act in this entire film is Lisa. There are plot holes big enough to park the Titanic inside. The plot goes like this: A geek that has loser written all over him invents a time machine (and why in the world was he using Commodore C64 computers anyway? Did IBM & Apple wisely tell these people not to use their products? For 1994, those computers would have been about 10 years old.) He takes a reporter (Pritchard) back and forth in time, then also a swarmy businessman. The businessman copies the time machine, and starts reeking havoc on the timestream. Therefore, the inventor has to go back in time and tell himself not to show the invention to the businessman. But something I didn't understand: if you go back in time to prevent yourself from doing something, how would you know to go back in time to do it? In the end, I cheered when both inventor and businessman died in the Revolutionary war era. <br /><br />This film was produced by Peter Beckworth. He also gave us Moving Targets, a film that combines the talents of Burt Ward, Miles O'Keefe, and Linnea Quigley. It was filmed completely in Vermont, and it shows why there are no major cities in that state. Avoid this one unless you're watching the MST3K version.
