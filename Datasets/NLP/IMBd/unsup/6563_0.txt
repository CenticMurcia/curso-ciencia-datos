Very pretty New England scenery etcetera but that's about all this stinker has going for it. I saw this when it first came out and by the end of the first reel I expected there would be some sort of wry humor would emerge out of it but no, it just went on and on, and got sillier with every scene. I always wondered why Paramount didn't stop production when they saw the final script and I can imagine it would now be just an embarrassment for the entire cast. Like most of Hitchcock's post-Psycho movies it should have finished him in Hollywood but then he redeemed himself with the very watchable To Catch a Thief. This tiresome load of nonsense ranks high in my personal list of the ten worst movies of all time.
