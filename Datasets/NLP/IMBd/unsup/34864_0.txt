title of the film is "the third miracle." the priest spends the whole damn film trying to find the third miracle. In the end he finds it. And it's accepted. The other two miracles were easily proved and witnessed. So the three miracle limit was met. But then in the last 2 minutes of the film the priest says that they've had two miracles and they're waiting for another one to happen. Pisses me off.<br /><br />Honestly, I rated this film a 1 because of this horrid plot twist at the end. I would have rated it an 8 otherwise. The acting was alright, cinematography was nice as it had some footage that had to look like WWII footage, and there was an underlying plot of the priest finding his faith. Plus it managed to not bag on the Catholic church too much. I'm not Catholic, but I don't really enjoy the films that are too polar on the church.<br /><br />So anyhow, if they could just cut off the last 2 minutes of the film it would have been great. As it is, IT SUCKS. It's like reading a short story for 20 minutes only to find out that the narrator was just dreaming or something. CHEAP TRICK, YOU BUTTHEADS, don't do it again.
