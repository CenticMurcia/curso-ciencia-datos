This aussie flick starts off good,i liked the tale of it,it was well thought of,and the scenes were done fairly well.The girl finds herself in the past,40 years in the past,she witnesses a murded,a guy got wrongfully accused,she goes back to investigate with scepticle boyfriend,blah blah blah yada yada yada.What im trying to say is the film gets boring,they just walk around talking to people,asking things,touching things,bringing back flashbacks,at times many scenes were irrelivant,and the film wasnt scary,the only scary thing was the frenchmans face...VERY freaky! The film goes downhill,they talk too much,not enought relevant material,they do a little treasure digging,its just all too much to be good..UNTIL the great ending,watch it for its ending,a perfect twist to a bad movie.<br /><br />OVERALL I GIVE FRENCHMANS FARM (4 out of 10)<br /><br />GOOD POINTS OF FILM:Good Start,Few Twists,Good Ending.<br /><br />BAD POINTS OF FILM:Irrelevant Scenes,Boring,Lacks in horror Genre.
