Ghajini Just because Amir Khan  the superstar of Bollywood is attempting to make this Tamil re-make in Hindi, I was interested to see this original (which itself is a rip-off of Hollywood movie Memento).<br /><br />The story is very much similar to the original Hollywood movie Memento. The hero (Surya)  who is suffering short term memory loss - revenges his girl friend's (Asin) murder through the help of notes, photographs and in the end  another heroine (Nayantara) to track the killer Lakshman and his brother (both played by Pradeep Singh Rawat).<br /><br />The movie is told in typical Indian (Tamil) style. The big part of the story is told in flash back  in two episodes, each in first and second half. As the flash back is a love story between Surya and Asin  there are lots of songs thrown in. Whenever there is no flashback, the hero fights and kills the goons.<br /><br />I hear that this was a hit movie in Tamil when it was released  so explains the taste of Indian audiences. There is typical and cliché of everything and most things are over the top  presented unconvincingly. So if you are seeing this movie, see with a perspective of an Indian audience  may be you will enjoy.<br /><br />I think all actors and actress have overacted a bit throughout the movie. Surya is above average. Asin looks beautiful. <br /><br />Let me make it clear here  that for me, this movie even though not so good, was better than the original Memento. Seeing two movies of similar stories and both made poorly by the Director, I am interested to see what Amir Khan Productions is up to? Will he really change the script and treatment of Ghajini or present the same absurdities! Let's wait and watch! (Stars 4.5 out of 10)
