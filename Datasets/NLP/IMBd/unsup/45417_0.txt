Me and my brother had borrowed some movies......all B-rated movies.I thought it would be cool to see Corey Feldman in a horror movie. And he did really good as a computer hacker. But I found the movie as pretty lame, but still pretty fun to watch. I think a lot of new space-horror movies is trying to be in the same class as Alien and the Predator movies, but most movies are far away from close. Legion is ok, it gets 6 out of 10 from me.
