Candyman Day of the Dead was really good. The movie was based a Myth and Legends. The Candyman played by Tony Todd was really neat because you would never know where he was going to pop up. And Caroline played by Donna D'errico which who is the great granddaughter of the Candyman. And the neat thing about her part is every time she would dream the Candyman would be there in her dreams. And by the way what good acting by Tony Todd and Donna D'errico. I give the movie 7 Stars. It's the best out of them all. *******
