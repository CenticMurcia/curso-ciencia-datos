Loaded with clich√©s and "can see it coming a mile away" blood and guts, Dr. Giggles is a complete waste of time.<br /><br />Sure, the creators may have wanted to do "a genre piece", but this is the same rehashed garbage, a date movie for the stereotypical guy who laughs at the violence on screen and the girl who squeals and clings to her boyfriend. That's an insult.<br /><br />One of the worst things about the horror genre, seemingly coming out of the hack-and-slice 80s, is the lack of story and intelligence. Instead, sophomoric humor and one bloody situation after another seems to string us all along to the end credits.<br /><br />Avoid this, watch some respectful and dramatic horror that truly frightens through wit, wisdom and a compelling story.
