well, i was tempted by this film as the cover promoted, in equal measures, chainsaws and schoolgirls. what a major disappointment followed such promise.<br /><br />this is either some sort of student film or one big "in-joke" that only a select few are in on, one of which i am not. the dreary plot, that of a bus breaking down in the middle of nowhere and the passengers being killed one by one, is as long in the tooth as the majority of the schoolgirls here.<br /><br />it gets a three as there are two rather witty deaths, ones that i have not seen in any other film franchise, but even then they are not as spectacular as they could have been.<br /><br />and the chainsaw on the cover that tempted me? it has a blade as long as a conventional pencil, and does not get used on anything or, more to the point for the intended market, anyone.<br /><br />people who harbour a desire to make films one day should watch this just to see how not to do it. everyone else should give it a miss.
