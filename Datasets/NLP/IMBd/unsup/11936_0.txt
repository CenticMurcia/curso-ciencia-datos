The person's whose comments read "Alien it ain't" couldn't have been more dead on.<br /><br />The beginning of this movie starts with the girl, who is the alien in this film simply because of a slight resemblance to the blonde alien in the original (not because of ANY acting skills), is a college professor giving a lecture. She's as believable as a college professor as Steven Hawking would be playing a high school cheerleader. She looks like an 18 year old high school cheerleader. She delivers her "lecture" as awkwardly as it is for us to watch it. There wasn't a person in the world who bought her as a college professor including the director and herself. She gives the lecture and delivers the "punchline" so poorly, I knew at that point there would be no way I could finish this movie. It's insulting that anyone would think we're supposed to buy her as a college professor. It was one of the worst pieces of casting/writing I've seen this decade.<br /><br />The "acting" in the rest of the film, including Ben Cross's performance, was terrible, literally unwatchable. I've seen amateur performances on Youtube that were better. About 20 minutes into the movie I was just fast forwarding.<br /><br />The CGI looks like it was unfinished, like it was from 1992. There is nothing scary or tension building about anything in this movie. I wasted a Netflix rental on this garbage and was more mad at myself than anything - and mad at the rating this movie has in the IMDb (over 6 at this point - it HAS to go down). I really liked the original film. This movie should be taken off any video store shelf. It's just awful.
