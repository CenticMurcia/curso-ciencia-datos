Just a couple of things I thought were worth mentioning after reading the other comments. First of all, you have to remember that Kusanagi is a cyborg. Throughout the movies you as the viewer are constantly reminded that she feels a certain detachment from her body. She also takes getting shot up rather lightly. So with this in mind, I prefer to think of her body is more like clothing to her. It's not her real body after all. You almost don't notice how skimpy her wardrobe is if u can see it from this perspective. <br /><br />Secondly the movies do give u a much better understanding of the characters and scenario and are worth checking out before you watch the series. Just keep in mind that the movies and series are two directors different takes on the Manga by Masamune Shirow. <br /><br />Both the movies and series are beautifully constructed but as this is the comment area for Stand alone Complex that's what I'll rate. <br /><br />(by the way; bare with the 2nd gig. Closter towards the end it will have you nailed to the screen)
