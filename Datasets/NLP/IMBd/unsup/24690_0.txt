I remember seeing Taxi driver as a teenager, being blown away and wishing someone could do the same for my home city London. Instead for years we have suffered clich√©d, upper class twits like Hugh Grant prancing around a London few here recognise. Wonderland manages to capture the dark, grim side of London, the loneliness, the anonymity, the city of a million different stories, the same way Scorcese captured New York in 1976 for Taxi Driver. Both films too have beautiful moving scores specially written for them. A stunning, moving film. Winterbottom's earlier film 'Butterfly Kiss' has the same feel too. That just about sums it up but as I have to fill out 10 lines, I should add that my favourite Michael Winterbottom films are in this order ( I have seen nearly all) Wonderland, A Cock And Bull Story, 24 Hour Party People, Butterfly Kiss, In This World, The Claim.
