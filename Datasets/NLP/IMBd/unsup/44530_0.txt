girl moves to big city. rough neighborhood. with the emphasis on the Hood part. moves to a school where being white is being a minority. hooks up with the local fly girls who take her to the street clubs. then one girls brother wants her to dance. basically then the plot of break-dance takes over.<br /><br />black boy wants to make good and be a doctor. she wants to regain her dream of being a ballet dancer.<br /><br />the lead girl isn't much on acting.<br /><br />basically i don't like this film, nothing worse than seeing a film where it's pretty much already been done before and they just fiddled with the plot a tad to bring it into a modern day context.<br /><br />Oh, and the scenes of the black guy watching her practice ballet, not likely. her teacher would either never let him in the room or kick him out in seconds and it'd probably have earned her a pass to the street. most dance classes hate having people watch who aren't taking part. also it'd be unlikely for Sarah to be out doing club dancing before an audition for fear of getting hurt or pulling something. <br /><br />ballet dancers become obsessed with things like that, not getting hurt.<br /><br />the "oil and milk don't mix" comment was a bit unneeded. plus you know when she invites him in the house and puts on true colors they are going to have a really unnecessary sex scene. and a rubbish soft focus badly cut one at that<br /><br />the basketball game? no way. Sarah is due to have an audition, firstly she wouldn't even want to be doing sports. let alone fighting with someone. in the hospital the black kids look at Sarah as though they've never seen a white person.<br /><br />also far too many of the black characters are given very bad attitudes about themselves and their relationships to white people. I'd be interested to know what the ethnic origin of the films writer and producer were on this film.<br /><br />and Derek doing a "your mother" comment during his argument with Sarah? How biased was that?<br /><br />and why the hell is Sarah training for ballet audition with Derek anyway? How the hell can he help her in any way, shape or form?<br /><br />When Derek is asked if he'll help his friend to take revenge it's obvious someone is going to get hurt when that happens and it's more likely to be Derek, the smart black guy who wants to be a Doctor.<br /><br />Sarah's dad is poorly written with little to do and say but there to make her seem more vulnerable.<br /><br />An annoying line that gets used to often is "Why you tripping on that". What the hell does it even mean. Oh, and bull-crap way Mordecai's car blew up when it got shot? NOT going to happen, it's really hard to shoot a petrol tank.<br /><br />even the grooving judges was stolen wholesale from the end of break-dance, and it would have been unlikely that the audition judges would have given Sarah a second chance to do her contemporary dance for a place like Juliard.
