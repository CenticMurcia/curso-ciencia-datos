Writer/director Wes Anderson ("Rushmore," "The Royal Tenanbaums") has always produced strange films with rich characters and a little bit of heart. His fourth and latest adventure, "The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou," is no exception, but it is his worst to date.<br /><br />We begin at a European film festival where Steve Zissou (Bill Murray), a washed up leader of sea-faring documentary filmmakers, is showing off his latest film, "The Jaguar Shark Pt. 1." The film looks like an old documentary you'd watch in elementary school because the teacher was feeling lazy.<br /><br />Zissou is on his last leg as a professional and is desperate for revenge. While shooting his latest film, his best friend was killed by a mythological shark. To exact his revenge, he plans to take his diverse crew out once again and film the shark's demise.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Ned Plimpton (Owen Wilson), is a young pilot for Air Kentucky that approaches Zissou with the notion that he may be his son. Ned's mother has recently passed away and he only has rumors that have guided him to Zissou.<br /><br />The motley crew is comprised of several fine actors, including William Defoe as a German "engineer," and Angelica Houston as Zissou's brilliant wife. Jane (Cate Blanchett), a reporter, also joins the trip so she can write a cover story on Zissou and provide a love interest for Steve and Ned.<br /><br />Overall, the film is a slow-moving oddity that immerses us into another world. Rather than attempting any realism, Anderson and co-writer Noah Baumbach, have created an alternate universe where pirates are still attacking ships and the fanciful fish on display are computer animated. I enjoyed the unique sets and inventive atmosphere, but I did not care much for the thin story.<br /><br />For much of the first half, the audience is given the idea that a deeper plot might bubble up, but it never comes. The film treads water for the last half, slowly sinking into its shallow waters. In compensation, the audience is provided with developed characters. <br /><br />Anderson decided not to focus on story so much as developing his leading man. Zissou is an ambitious asshole who always has a frown on his face. Like many other Anderson characters, Zissou is a flawed protagonist who learns a lesson or two about life.<br /><br />Thankfully, Murray's great performance makes the film better. Murray characterizes Zissou so well that we feel like we actually know him at the film's end. If 2004 had not been so saturated with good acting performances, Murray would likely be up for an Oscar.<br /><br />Wilson also provides a notable performance, where he's not allowed to be the smart aleck he usually plays. Ned is a quiet side-kick who thinks before he speaks and somehow Wilson manages to pull it off.<br /><br />Also enhancing the movie is the great soundtrack. Anderson has always had a knack for selecting pop songs that match his movies' moods. In "Life," many David Bowie songs are sung in Portuguese, providing dreamy music that cannot be completely understood.<br /><br />"Life" is a full-fledged Anderson movie and anyone who has enjoyed his previous efforts will likely like this one. Anyone who hasn't liked Anderson's films should stay far, far away. The film requires a lot of patience, but sticking around until the end makes the movie more than the sum of its parts. <br /><br />It appears that Anderson is so hell-bent on being different from his predecessors that he has lost some of his magnificent charm. He used to have his head in the clouds, but now he's lost in outer space. Let's hope Anderson can come back down before Hollywood makes him walk the plank.
