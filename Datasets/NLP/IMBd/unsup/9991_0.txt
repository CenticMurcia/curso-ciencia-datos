This is a really dumb movie, with a very low budget, and because of that, this is a very entertaining film.<br /><br />Nick is a nerdy, bike riding teacher, who has built a little plane into a time machine. He sells his idea to JK, an evil guy from the government. Meanwhile, Nick is falling in love with his old friend from school, now reporter Lisa. The movie's low budgetness might be what makes it enjoyable. You actually get an intimate feel of the characters and their cheap surroundings. With that said, this is a terribly written and directed film. Whenever Nick goes back in time, it looks like he's going into television static. The acting is just terrible, and everyone seems like they're reading off of cue cards. The ending of the movie takes place in 1777, and leads to one of the dumbest climaxes ever.<br /><br />This is a genuinely bad movie, but it's not without it's charm.<br /><br />My rating: * 1/2 out of ****.
