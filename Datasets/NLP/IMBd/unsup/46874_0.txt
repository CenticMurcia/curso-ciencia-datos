I know that horror films have a big suspension of disbelief and major plot holes are the norm, but this film takes the cake. Basically the plot centers around the fact that a college student has a mental block about the killings of her family members and the fact that the sorority house where she is now living is the place where the killings took place (nevermind the fact that a sorority would buy a murder house to begin with, thats far fetched enough). <br /><br />Amnesia is one thing but its plain ridiculous that one cant remember something that life changing even when they were 5 years old. Besides my main gripe with the horrible plot, the kill scenes looked extremely cheap and fake (knife goes in chest, a little blood, if any comes out, no closeups either). If you are looking to see this in a quest to see all the college genre films out there, go for it, but if you are looking for a good horror or slasher film, just stay away.
