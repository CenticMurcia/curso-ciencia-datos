I really wanted to give it a perfect score because this film made me laugh harder and louder than any "intended comedy" ever has, but the film-loving being inside of me is screaming for the single star. Everything about this film is poorly done, where the, and I hesitate to even use the word in the same context, acting is by far the worst part. Some comments:<br /><br />Camera - Awful Screenplay - Awful "Acting" - Horrific example Sound - Poor Script - Typical of a budget action/thriller film (though I believe this movie falls into a genre of its own)<br /><br />Junk-o-Rama, in other words.<br /><br />It's really difficult to be constructive when criticizing this feature, since it doesn't really give a serious impression.
