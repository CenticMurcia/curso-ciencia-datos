Hello,<br /><br />I loathed this movie for the following reasons. This grotesque portrayal of the parisian life of artists is a waste of time.<br /><br />First, the structure of the narrative: the succession of short scenes is all over the place. Example, the scene where you can see the "Service pour l'enfance" on the front of the building for about 3 seconds (thank God I read fast)is immediately followed by Modigliani getting out of prison. Why? It's as if they made a mistake during the montage. Same thing with the couple's love story which is totally overlooked. One day everything's fine, and the day after Modigliani wakes up and leaves her. And their baby...She only has to talk to him for a minute and he finally decides to recognize and accept her...<br /><br />Then: the clichés. The couple dancing in the dark at night in the street, the little boy (Modigliani as child), Picasso being the first one to recognize Modi's talent (He applauds first), the punchline "I 'll paint your eyes when I know your soul"...I'm pretty sure the director lost a bet and had to include as many clichés as possible. Horrible.<br /><br />Third: Elsa Zilberstein. What a terrible actress...especially when she screams. Totally unbearable. But she's never as bad as Modigliani's agent. <br /><br />Well, an awful movie, awful...
