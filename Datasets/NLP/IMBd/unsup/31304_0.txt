« J'en suis » is without a doubt one the crappiest movies ever been made in Quebec (and, believe me, i've seen a lot of bad movies in my life). Even without mentioning the fact that it's full of the worst cliches on gays as well as on artists or on anything else it despicts, the plot is lousy, the situations are ridiculous (not in an intended way) and the dialogs are simply atrocious. Avoid losing two hours of your short lives on this deliberately low aiming piece of junk; go take a walk instead, you'll feel healthier and, above all, smarter...
