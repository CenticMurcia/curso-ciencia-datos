Costner makes a great modern day badass. Worth watching alone for his portrayal of a retired Secret Service agent hired to protect superstar Whitney Houston. As far as romantic thrillers go, this is one of the best. Highly watchable, you'll forgive the glitz if you're a fan of the genre. The soundtrack is awesome and Whitney demonstrates her awesome talent on stage, so what if she can't act. 8/10
