Watched about an hr of this dull tripe . My date and I got up and went bowling which was a much better time . If you want to catch up on your sleep , go waste a few bucks and rent this movie . We only watched about an hour and we walked out and got our money back . More like age of boredom. Joanne Woodwards narration is akin to sominex .. avoid this garbage
