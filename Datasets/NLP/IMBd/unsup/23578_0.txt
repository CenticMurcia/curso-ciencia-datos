Always enjoyed the silent films and how actors were able to show their real talents by acting from head to toe with no sound at all, except the piano player in the movie house. This film starred some great Classic actors, Wallace Berry, Lewis Stone(Sir John Paxton), and Besie Love, (Miss Paula White),"The Barefoot Contessa",'54, and many more. I could hardly believe the special effects that were created in this film, I never expected to see Dinosours and prehistoric animals with movement in the year 1925. All I can say, this picture must have been a great success years ago, however, this film at times made me think about "King Kong" and how Kong escaped and almost destroyed New York City. If you love to watch what people enjoyed in the 1920's, this is worth viewing.
