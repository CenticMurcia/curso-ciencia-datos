Beyond the cheap-yet-surprisingly-decent gore, The Final Curtain (sometimes called Acts of Death) is one of the worst pieces of Indie-Crud horror I've seen.<br /><br />The acting ranges from subpar to downright abysmal, with the script and dialogue becoming progressively worse. In horror movie fashion, the actors play their stock character in caricatured glory. The story dragged on to the point of a crawl, each scene (until the deaths, of course) duller than the last. Throughout the whole film, you'd feel that coprolalic compulsion to encourage each last character to his/her untimely and gristly doom. At the very least, the deaths were interesting. One guy gets split open, and his guts spill out as he whimpers.<br /><br />The WORST part of the film is the ending.<br /><br />I'M GONNA SPOIL IT.<br /><br />It turns out the main character raped his friend's sister and impregnated her. When she went to abort the baby, she died in the process. The film ends with enraged friend murdering richie boy and his Dean Daddy. If this was supposed to be a twist...forget it. Technically, it wouldn't count as a twist, as it is background information that wasn't revealed until the very end.<br /><br />So there you have it. In all advice, AVOID THIS FILM AT ALL COSTS. Even if you're a gorehound, I wouldn't suggest watching it.
