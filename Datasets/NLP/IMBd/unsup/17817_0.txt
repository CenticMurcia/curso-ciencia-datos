I have just seen the movie and i think it's really cool The thing i liked the most is the plot I wouldn't change a thing about it it was perfect But the thing's i didn't think were all that great Was the color of the 2000 Mitsubishi eclipse silver They should have gone for something like red or blue How ever the underground lighting kit was cool But that's not the end the other thing i did'NT like was The 2004 Pontiac GTO with the 350 horse LS1 under the hood It would have been better to have used the 05 model with the 400 horse LS2 THAT WOULD HAVE BURNED SOME SERIOUS RUBBER Also the should have used NOS nitrous instead of ZEX They should have of raced the GTO at least once to see what kind of power it had the thing that would have been really cool is to have battled the eclipse against the GTO Another thing that stumped me was how did Dennis hopper know about The drift trick with the hand brake when he was driving the eclipse
