I just saw this movie last night for the first time and taped it off of TCM as part of the Errol Flynn festival for April, and am I glad I did! Flynn is hilarious as the lovable cad he was born to play, and almost every gag line he has works with his flawless delivery and perfect timing. Flynn also turns out, not surprisingly when one thinks about it, to be a physical comedian on par with (I sh*t you not) Cary Grant. Another commenter notes that de Havilland's role was wasted on her, and I agree, but she still turns in a great performance. I would probably have cast Jean Arthur or even Claudette Colbert (anything to see her in a slinky silk slip again!) in the role, but Olivia has the chops, no doubt. Some folks might not have cared for all the phone conversations, but one in particular (here be spoilers) when Flynn has to make two dates for the same night without them overlapping is hysterical. Also, Flynn's ingenious use of the household butter supply brings forth the chortles.<br /><br />If only the black shoe bastards had let Flynn do what he wanted and make more of these screwball comedies! What a treasure trove they would be!
