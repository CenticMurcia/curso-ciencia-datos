In truth, I loathe this film - if I have to say anything positive it would be that the chases are quite good. Everything else about the movie stinks. The performances from the principal actors (Holbrook excepted) are painful, the use of a lunar module in the faked Mars landing scenes would not fool a 10 year old viewer. The factual mistakes are too numerous to list, but I guess that the average ignorant viewer would miss most goofs.<br /><br />I suppose it appeals to UFO, Atlantis, Area 51 and Moon Landing Conspiracy people, and I suppose that it does a service - adding to their sad, empty lives.<br /><br />Still,I think everyone should watch this once, it's enjoyable trash.
