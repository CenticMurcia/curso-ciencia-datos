An objective review: "Amar Te Duele" makes me really mad. I'm from Mèxico and believe me, these kind of fairy tales NEVER happen here. Never.<br /><br />Renata is a high class girl with a "cool" and fresh attitude towards everything. She has everything necessary to succeed in Mexican discriminatory society: money, a perfect body, a beautiful face, goes to a private school, etc. Although having a lot of money and friends just like her she supposedly falls in love with a lower class boy with a horrible attitude, criminal background, horrible clothes, and some awful friends. That will never happen here people! If you are like Ulises don't expect to meet a girl like her unless she goes to the same school where you study, or if you meet a girl like her in a private club. Not to mention that Renata is kind of a slut because she has a boyfriend when she starts going out with Ulises.<br /><br />Suddenly Renata kisses him as part of a bet she had with her friend and sister. Therefore, a love story begins. A love story with pink overtones. Renata and Ulises live a series only seen in movies! <br /><br />So please, watch only "Amar Te Duele" only as what it is : a fictional romantic comedy. <br /><br />Martha Higareda delivers a fun, sexy performance. She's really fresh and cute. Super sexy body and a beautiful face. TOo bad her character is too damn clichèd. But she does what she has to do; no wonder why she's a favorite among young people. Too bad that she performed in two gratuitous nudity scenes. Why would she play with her breasts? that scene was OBVIOUSLY intended to go for a male audience who would buy or watch the movie in theaters. Too bad Martha was part of a non-artistic scene and now she isn't considered for her acting skills but for her slutty attitude and physical attributes. I really liked her.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is also good. A new generation of Mexican talents. Too bad that they pick horrible roles like "Amar Te Duele". Certainly not a terrible movie, but obviously an attempt to storm the box office and spawn a new generation of Mexican romantic comedies that every time look more and more like in the USA. <br /><br />This does not happen in Mexican society! If you want to watch a movie that is close to Mèxico's reality watch Valentin Trujillo's "El Perro Callejero". Now, that's reality.
