This movie is so charming and beautiful I could be speaking hours about it. As always in Barcelon, Spain, we were looking for hours in Pakistan supermarkets until we found a spectacular pirate copy in widescreen and glorious sound.Indians are decidedly devoted not to show their movies in Spain as they premiere us to buy this movies in pirate copies and don't giving us the rights for distribution here. The Pakistan people can't understand why we prefer the copies in widescreen! The music is astonishing and the only problem with the movie is that it has only two real musical numbers.As always, all the actors are superb but specially mention to Akshaye Khanna, who is not a superstar but his acting in this movie is spellbound. Also the girl who makes the "mature" girl who drunks makes a great job.This movie attacks completely to your heart!
