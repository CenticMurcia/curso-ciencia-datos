It should be known before I start that I'm not a fan of anime at all whatsoever. It usually bores me or is way too bizarre for my taste. That wasn't the case with The Professional. I loved this film so much and I'm very glad that I saw it. I was entertained the whole way through. It truly is a blast.<br /><br />The blood is this one is absolutely awesome! I also loved Golgo's character and the story moved pretty well also. It's not a movie you're gonna wanna show to the kids but if you love gory action flicks, you'll definitely want to check it out. And please, please don't let the fact that it's an anime discourage you from seeing it, it's the best anime I've ever seen!
