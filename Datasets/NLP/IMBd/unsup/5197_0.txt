Dear Readers, I am a DBZ fan. I've only watched the Saiyan and Namek sagas and played DBZ Budokai, but I think it rocks. I've seen two of the movies: The World's Strongest and Most of Tree of Might, and now just watched Brolly: The Legendary Super Saiyan, part of a three pack of the Brolly Movies in DBZ.<br /><br />Boy what an absolute waste of money.<br /><br />The movie starts off well with Brolly destroying the South Galaxy and some funny scenes with King Kai and Goku. Also cool is Paragus and his army (which somehow disappears sometime during the movie) telling Vageta he's the heir to a new planet Vageta. Brolly himself is wicked cool and a villain possibly stronger and more vicious and ruthless than Frieza. The massive fight scene and Piccolo's dramatic appearance are cinematic triumphs. So what makes this movie bad? Gross and Disgusting images, the most sickening is the brutal killing of Brolly when he was a baby. How Brolly dies is also gross as Goku blows him up into shreds rather graphically and Paragus is crushed to death, though we are fortunately spared the gory details.<br /><br />The Fight scene with Brolly vs Goku, Vageta, Trunks, Piccolo, and Gohan is pulse-poundingly amazing. The five Z warriors get the living daylights beaten out of them while Brolly isn't even scratched! Goku's famous move, the Kamehameha, doesn't even faze Brolly and even when Piccolo, Gohan, and Trunks give their energy to Goku, he can't even scratch Brolly.<br /><br />The acting is okay. Brolly is interestingly voiced but has few lines and mostly screams his head off. Paragus is a suave villain and it's a bummer when he dies. Goku is completely annoying and stupid while Vageta (Who's my all time favorite DBZ character) just stands around moping because he can't defeat Brolly. Gohan and Trunks do a better job but are basically 2-D. Master Roshi is, as most times, a comedic persona and so is Krillin. They are completely nonessential to the plot and have no purpose except providing crude humor.<br /><br />Point blank: Avoid this movie at all cost unless you're a violence junkie who likes sick Anime. Stick with the Dragonball Z Budokai games, they're much better.<br /><br />Signed, The Constant DVD Collector
