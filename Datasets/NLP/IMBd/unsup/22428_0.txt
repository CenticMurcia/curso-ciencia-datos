This wonderfully entertaining (and hugely derivative!) flick plays out like a veritable whose who of the Italian movie industry. Indeed, regular fans of the sadly missed Italian B-movie heyday will have a field day spotting a plethora of stars of the time including top billed James Franciscus, Vic morrow, Romano Puppo, Massimo Vanni, and Giancarlo Prete. A splendid cast - in fact it could only have been topped if Luciano Pigozzi would have popped up at some point!<br /><br />Of course, the film itself is a completely shameless rip off of the Spielberg classic Jaws, but let's be honest - it's so much damned fun that you just won't care. Special mention must also go to the shark itself in this which whilst not as menacing as Bruce from the aforementioned Hollywood blockbuster, is nonetheless a very impressive rendition considering the tiny budget of the film.<br /><br />Well, what are you waiting for? Track this gem down my fellow B-movie lovers. <br /><br />Final note: Be sure to grab a beer and sing along to the cool opening soundtrack in this - ah, those high notes sure do sound wonderful don't they? ;o)
