well i have seen this movie and would like to give marks below one. there is nothing about this movie to discuss. star cast is big like sanjay dutt fardeen khan ayesha takia etc. but what went wrong with David ? such a outstanding flop really i must admit that David should take some rest instead of making movies and casting big stars, all actors played a awful character they all are totally waste in the roles they played. start to end u will never find u scene to laugh on but that is the big reason to laugh to consider this movie a "COMEDY". oh bollywood stop making such movies copies and this kind of comedy with no storyline no plot , do some serious efforts. i only wanna say about this movie that "PLZ. DON'T WASTE UR TIME AND MONEY".
