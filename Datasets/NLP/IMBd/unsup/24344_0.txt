The Care Bears movie is basically about teaching children to be compassionate; to use their words to talk about their problems instead of keeping it inside. It encourages children to be empathetic and kind when it comes to other people, that good can often triumph over bad if people work together, and that there is always room for a miracle.<br /><br />Personally, I grew up watching pretty much only the Care Bears, and I think it helped me a great deal. I have no interest in violent video games, movies or shows. They simply don't appeal to me. I am also a sensitive person by nature, and I attribute that to watching the Care Bears as a child. Their lessons had a deep imprint on me.<br /><br />I definitely think this movie should be seen by all people at least once. I admit, compared to today's degree of shows, the movie fails, but once you actually get into watching it, you don't even notice it anymore. Someday, when I have children, they will definitely be watching this movie!
