Saving Marriage is a moving, emotional documentary on the struggle for civil gay marriage in Massachusetts. More generally it is a film about human rights and hopefully will be seen by a general public, not just the already convinced or the gay community.<br /><br />If you've ever seen "Eyes on the Prize", a film about the Civil Rights Movement in the 50's and 60's, you will understand the tone and emotional power of "Saving Marriage".<br /><br />This is not exactly your mainstream action flick, but it really holds your attention. The interviews were riveting. It's really top-notch documentary film making, and, as icing on the cake, illuminates an issue that should be of concern to all Americans who value human rights.
