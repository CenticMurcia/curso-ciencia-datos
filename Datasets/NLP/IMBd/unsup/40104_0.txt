The people here who praised this episode, are obviously leading an extremely boring life. This is one of the worst episodes I have ever seen for any TV program, anyone with an IQ over 2020 can guess the ending right away. I think the people who were surprised by the ending would have thought OJ was innocent even if they saw a video of the whole crime. The beauty of English TV is the woman Stella who is supposed to be beautiful, I would call a bit dumpy and a 6 on a 10 scale. She was no raving beauty. And the guy who is the fitness fanatic, and mind you I'm not gay, looks out of shape. I think Thriller is an excellent TV series but this episode was its worst.
