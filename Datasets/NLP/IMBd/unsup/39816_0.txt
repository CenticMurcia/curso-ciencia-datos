This is, well, a silly movie. The script is terrible, even if you look at it as a movie for kids. And that's another thing -- it's geared towards kids, and yet I'm not sure this is a movie I'd show to kids. It's extremely violent and concerns a highly traumatic situation involving young children -- not to mention that the hero is a juvenile delinquent (NOT the misunderstood kind) who wins out by playing all sorts of illegal tricks. In fact, his actions are very much glorified by the fact that he can "mastermind" the "real" criminals, as well as by his constant, triumphant little asides. Oh -- and if you're only interested in this movie because you're a Vincent Kartheiser fan, don't bother. This is not what I'd call one of his best performances.
