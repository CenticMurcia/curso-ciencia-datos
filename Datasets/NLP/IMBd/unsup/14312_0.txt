Having heard the rumblings and grumblings from people who had seen the sneak previews, saying things like "typical Disney fare" and "mediocre", I had very low expectations of Dinosaur even if it was the big Diz's "most ambitious endeavor". I am happy to say I was wrong. I loved it. It was NOT cookie cutter Disney. There were NO songs, no gimmicky sidekicks placed purely for plush toy marketing. The plot had a points on several levels, the most prevalent of those being simple survival, the most elusive being the qualities of leadership. I left the theater thinking to myself, "That... was a nice story all around."<br /><br />Notice I didn't mention the graphics. There's a reason for that: They speak for themselves. Go see it.
