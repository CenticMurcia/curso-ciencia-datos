This film is but a feeble reflection of the vision and execution of the original Star Wars trilogy. In the company of Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor, two truly excellent trained actors, Natalie Portman sounds as if she's reading her lines off the side of a cereal box. Also, I think the only correct application of computer-generated effects in movies is as inconspicuous set elements, or perhaps to simulate something passing by which doesn't require the viewer to pay attention. Having a prominent supporting role filled by a being which only exists in a circuit board is an insult to the viewer. Each of the original 3 films made me want to see the next one in the series; this film made me NOT want to see the next one.
