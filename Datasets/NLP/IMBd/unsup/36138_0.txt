After watching this film I had to wonder one thing. Why was this over two and half hours long? A very simple and pedestrian story of a few relationships between a group of adults. Nothing out of the ordinary or unique about the story and it's woefully too long! I did like all the actors especially Jeanne Balibar who is the central character but I would like them even more in a more interesting film and the main problem comes from the fact that the script doesn't really let viewers know who these characters really are and instead the focus is just on their immediate problems. This had the real potential of being something really interesting but unfortunately the story doesn't allow for some needed details.
