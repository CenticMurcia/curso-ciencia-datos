This is one of the most boring films I've ever watched. I really like anime, and thought I was gonna have real fun with this one. It seemed to be a myth to many people. <br /><br />The first story is quite great, with that cynic taxi driver, and the voluptuous girl. Also good animation, different to anything I've seen before, and really refreshing. But that's all, only 10 minutes of joy. The 2 I give to this film is due to this first story, without it, it would be a 0.<br /><br />The next chapters are just a collection of naked girls and nonsense action. Action is not even spectacular, just nonsense and boredom. The animation becomes ordinary, just medium quality, similar to Heeman series and things like that. There's even some chapter without naked girls at all, what just turns them into below 0 crap xD.<br /><br />There's only another story that's not so bad as the rest of the film. It's that one of the zombies in the plane. Great animation and a quite disturbing atmosphere. Unfortunately, at that time I was so bored that I couldn't enjoy it properly. <br /><br />There's one chapter particularly stupid, 7 or 8 minutes just to make a joke about cocaine. And besides, the joke is not funny, just silly. It seems it pretends to be politically incorrect or corrosive, it's just childish and stupid.<br /><br />The ending, that fight between the girls, is so predictable and typical like a telefilm. And the real ending, with the green sphere, wants to be mysterious and even transcendental. I thought it was pathetic. Like if somebody was going to spend a second thinking about this movie. <br /><br />So if you have to choose between this and any other animation movie, choose any other animation movie, you'll have chosen right. And if you wanna see a really good anime, with loads of action, just take Blood: The Last Vampire.<br /><br />Marcuse.
