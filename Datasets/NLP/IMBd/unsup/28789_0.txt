Well, Hauer and Chen has done better acting but I really think we need movies like this. I kind of liked the movie because it still has a story to tell despite bad directing and low budget. The first thing that struck me was the bad effect's in the opening scenes but then I saw that it was computer generated graphics and not CGI in a time when Windows 95 was the hottest OS. So I can overlook that. <br /><br />The movie has a few good unexpected twists but it's an all Hollywood movie so the end is highly predictable.<br /><br />Inspite of all the bad things I had a good time watching this movie on DVD and I can recommend you to rent it or even buy it because it's an old movie and the price is really low. I bought the DVD and I will watch it a few times again.
