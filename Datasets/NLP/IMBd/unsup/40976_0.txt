if you're looking for a decent horror movie with brad pitt, go for it, but if you're looking to get scared, look elsewhere. brian woods should not have been allowed back into school- why didn't they realize how psycho this guy is? martin mull- his whole role was just running around yelling, and at the end he just told brad pitt to screw himself. this movie should have been called 'we're stupid because we let a psycho killer who killed his father back into school where people will get killed'. brad pitt doesn't seem like the type of person who would have any desire to be a murder type character, but i can see him being someone who is aggressive and passionate about killing the killer. so a good acting job by mr. pitt, way to go.
