I remember this movie serial as a boy in the thirties,we would ask our mother's for a penny on a Wednesday after school,and line up at the local movie house along with hundreds of kids..mostly boys,it always promised fast action,the Mystery Squadron who had their hideout in a mountain cave,the Black Ace the leader always seemed as though he would never would be revealed,would provide the bad deeds,as the action heated up thousands of young feet would stomp on the balcony floor,it was a wonder that it never collapsed.it would build to a crescendo,THEN it would stop suddenly,everyone would hold their breath as the hero would be put in seemingly inescapable peril,NEXT WEEK...see the next thrilling chapter,we would pile outside still gripped in the spell and discus with actions what had taken place,we would then speculate as to how he was going to get out of this latest fix,Bob Steele,Tom Mix,Hoot Gibson,Buck Jones,Ken Maynard,our heroes,who never kissed a girl,in our games no one wanted to play the Black Ace.Happy innocent days.
