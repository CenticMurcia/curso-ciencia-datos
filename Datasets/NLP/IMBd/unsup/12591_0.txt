This evening I sat down with my two kids aged 11 and 12 to watch The Adventures of Don Juan. Both kids found the movie fun and engaging. Comparing it to The Three Musketeers and Robin Hood. Getting my two children to agree on a movie is pretty spectacular.<br /><br />We all enjoyed the action scenes, and the humor that Errol Flynn displays throughout the movie. The costuming was well done not overly lavish as some of the movies from the 40's can be. The scenery was confined to a few well done sets.<br /><br />The acting was genuine from almost every character including the young Raymond Burr. The script did follow the story line of many swashbuckling hero type movies but the quality of the actors made the movie fresh.<br /><br />One of the things I like best about this movie is that the good was truly good and the bad truly bad. There is a theme of redemption for Don Juan who, in the end, quietly leaves to pursue his life. (and of course women) He leaves Spain in the hands of King Phillip III and the Queen to her King. He loves the Queen but knows he cannot have her. A noble ending for a gem of a movie.
