I just got this on iTunes and it was really amazing! Being that it is intended to be a television show, it was truly very interesting. I can see this doing well as a weekly series. Of course, only the pilot is available for viewing now...but it does leave you with many unanswered questions, hoping to see the rest of the story play out.<br /><br />there are many possibilities that the characters and the plot line can follow. production quality on the episode that i watched was very good as well. the cast was very likable and the plot was believable. Aquaman himself, AC, was a very likable hero.<br /><br />i would absolutely watch this show on TV every week if it were on.
