I do like Val Lewton's films. This one begins in an interesting setting with a war correspondent talking to a military man, Boris Karloff. He is a cruel and driven man, a total follower of military rule. Through a series of circumstances, a group of people end up quarantined from the plague. Karloff asserts his military power, forcing the people to do as he says, but some don't have the "proper" respect. He also shows himself to be very superstitious, believing in some old Greek werewolf stories. He directs his attention toward a young woman who defies him and gets people to believe that she is sort of an angel of death. As people begin to expire, he gains more and more power, but there is another woman who is, for all practical purposes, his equal. The movie is a moody portrayal of what people can do to each other when they are frightened. It's a good role for Karloff and comes off reasonably well.
