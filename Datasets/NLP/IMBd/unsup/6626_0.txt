First of all, the original "The Prince & Me" was good. This movie was just plain horrible. I agree with the original reviewer, this was not filmed in Denmark. The set (and I catch detail) looked like it was glued together. Just like it's awful sister "Princess Diaries: The Royal Engagement" (which was better) this was a bomb. Some awkward law stated a daughter, Kirsten (who appeared out of nowhere) is said to marry Edvard. Well blah blah blah, Paige (which if you turn her name from Morgan to Matthews, you got Paige from "Charmed") and oddly enough look kinda the same. Anyway, tabloid blah blah blah and girl rivalry and itching powder... Geez, can you get any more lame. Then after a little Harry Potter dungeon sitting, they find the loophole to this idiot-cratic (is that a word? LOL) marriage and voil√†! They get married and live happily ever after... Did you ever have a doubt? Oh and BTW: Do not rent this on DVD, there is an error in the encoding that will not allow you to play the movie by pressing play. It's an Omen to let you know that this movie SUCKS!
