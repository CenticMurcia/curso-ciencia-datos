I'm not kidding. This was a really funny, surprisingly thought-provoking movie. I had to watch it for work (yeah, really), and I thought it was well-shot, well-written, well-acted, and hilarious. The only thing I didn't like was the title. It didn't convey the singularity of the film as being a completely unexpected take on the rite of the bachelor party. I guess people who hated it missed the message -- yes, message. And the fat jokes and elderly jokes et cetera were tongue-in-cheek. Superficial characteristics are easy targets, and that is exactly the point of this movie. I'm wondering if some of these reviewers stopped watching before the end. Somehow, I kept watching because I had a sense that wherever this movie was going, it was not going in your average mindless direction. And it was a fun ride. I'm going to watch Eric Bernt more closely now.
