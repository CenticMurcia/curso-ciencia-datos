hi folks,<br /><br />thats the worst piece of movie since ... well i cant remember, i havent seen such dirt for a long, long time. guys i tell u, this flick is a waste of celluloid, time and money. the jokes, the dialouges, the screen play, the acting, the whole movie (well i dont want to call it a movie) isnt worth 1.- normally Mr. Ittenbach should pay us, for viewing this "film".<br /><br />so folks, keep your eyes open that the legion of brainless won't get u. PS: sorry i forgot to say that the plot was hell, i would prefer to watch duracell rabbit playing the drums for 24 hours than going into this "movie".
