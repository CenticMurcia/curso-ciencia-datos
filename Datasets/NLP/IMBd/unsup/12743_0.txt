Enchanting version of a children's book about a ten year old girl in post WWII Ireland who, following the death of her mother, is sent by her father to live with his parents in a small village near Roan Innish, the island where she grew up. Once there, she begins to hear colorful stories about her ancestry that lead her to seek her baby brother who was lost in the ocean during the evacuation of Roan Innish during the war.<br /><br />Jeni Courtney, who plays 10 year old Fiona, is a revelation. Unlike some of the precocious and/or obnoxious children so often used in Hollywood, she is miraculously innocent, sweet without being cloying, and talented. The movie lives and dies by her performance, as most of the action is seen through her eyes, and she surpasses expectations. You can't help but root for her plucky character. The rest of the small cast is superb as well.<br /><br />John Sayles is an incredibly gifted writer and director as he has shown in past films like Return of the Secaucus Seven and Eight Men Out, and he is at the top of his form here. The film has a beautiful and dreamy look to it, perfectly suited to the subject. It's never boring and always original, with a really terrific ending. Altogether a magical film experience for children and adults.
