Yashraj films are normally considered the best production house even though they have done worst copies(compared to Bhatt who give at least better films though copies) And have made trash films<br /><br />The film is a lame copy of NINE MONTHS<br /><br />The comedy scenes are puerile except Jaaved's scenes rest are nothing great, the shouting scenes are lame<br /><br />The twist is well handled but then nothing much happens and the film ends in a very bad manner<br /><br />Siddharth Anand handles only few scenes well, many scenes are over the top Music is good<br /><br />Saif repeats his DCH act and acts well though he often cribs and gets boring Preity is good in serious scenes but overdoes many parts Jaaved is funny Abhishek hams Jugal is okay
