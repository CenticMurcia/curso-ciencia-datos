i 've read some very bad reviews about this movie.. but hey people.. this movie isn't about a great storyline etc.. It's just about some entertainment...<br /><br />but i would suggest to watch this movie if you like Indiana Jones and movies comme Ã§a.. if you don't, then don't bother to watch this one...<br /><br />to those who saw the first two a long long time ago all ready..<br /><br />You must love this one too.. I did for sure.. go Dundee :)
