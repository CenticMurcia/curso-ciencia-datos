It is SO corny...it is the worst possible representation of an inspiring white hip hop prospect ever. Everything the main character says just makes him need to shut up even more. He doesn't know anything about being a rapper, he doesn't know anything about drug dealing, he doesn't know anything about being a gangster, and frankly it makes people in Iowa look really bad because i'm sure they are not really like that. He thinks becoming a hip hop star is all about being black and living in the city selling drugs. Yes, he actually wants to move to the ghetto in south side of Chicago. His head is in the wrong place and he will never become the rapper he dreams to be.
