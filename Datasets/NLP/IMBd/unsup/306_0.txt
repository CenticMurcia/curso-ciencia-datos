This movie starts off well. When the guy comes to the main characters base with that scrool then he is chopped up by the screamers. The plot also starts of well. Little ground digging (like miniature versions of those things in "Tremors") robots are used for war, and guys on the same side as them wear wrist bands that let the screamers know they are of the same side. The people in the base have to smoke some red cigarettes to protect their lungs from something in the air "We have to protect our lungs from sh*t by putting sh*t in them". But this movie gets bad in a hurry. We really want to turn it off when those kids (screamers in kids bodys) are walking and the main characters going "help me". But some decent special effects and ok atmostphere let me give this film 6/10.
