I think people are sleeping on this movie, because I think it will be a cult classic. This movie is a comedy and a horror and the same time, Youn can't help but laugh at some of the parts in the movie. Especially when earl is bit by a zombie and decides to go out like a soldier. The only thing I wish to see is more of is gore. The girl getting her face ate wasn't enough for me. The zombies should had pin her down and ate her eyes, and ate the flesh off her face until you seen nothing but her bones. When I home sitting back and relaxing,I like to keep rewinding the part of earl making a complete fool of bloody bill's zombies. I don't take points off the movie because of the graphics. I think the people who don't like that should support movies like that, so that next time the film company will have enough money to make a movie with better graphics
