I first remembered seeing part of an episode of this TV mini series when I was very young. My dad was a fan and I remember one or two moments from a particular episode which had stayed with me. It was until nearly twenty years later that I saw the whole series in all its glory. I was absolutely blown away. The acting is of the finest caliber with all the major players executing their roles with such conviction that you actually believe that these people were the Roman aristocracy. The stellar cast really is first rate and that applies to the major actors right through to the supporting characters who are all superb. The script is completely gripping with every scene getting better and better with some vicious humour thrown in. Some people may be put off as this mini series goes back almost thirty years and is not filled with the spectacular computer generated effects that are all to often visible in todays programes and films. That said if you enjoy Roman history or if you enjoy political intrigue,scandal,murder,plots and treason then this really is a must see. **********10 stars.
