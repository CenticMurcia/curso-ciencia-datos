You could just take this adviceÂ… This is a fast buck movie, so it is to be avoided. But if you want this movie to waste even more of your life, read on.<br /><br />'The hunt is on' was the tag line from this Artisan direct to video, but the hunt is hardly on in this movie. Far from claustrophobic, the movies horrid sound and camera work make you want to run away. Obviously shot on digital video, with poor performances all around, the premise is three woman house-sitting for the weekend and rudely interrupted by the well publicized 'Serial Stalker'. The plot is paper thin. It is the middle of the day in cali-suburbia, yet, these girls fear leaving the house at slight bumps. Every footstep, killer or prey, rings out like a tap dancer throwing a temper tantrum. The three 'Scares' are vastly predictable, the make up and special effects are non existent, and the dialog is total cheese. Did I mention the novel weapon is a toy crossbow that is vastly less menacing then the hunting crossbow on the promotional packaging? I don't think I could be more descriptive without being insulting, but I will. This is lower than student quality on all aspects of production and I feel bad claiming poor acting knowing that this must have been a one day shoot for Lynskey, Rappaport and Rajskub. Not their finest moment, and you can tell they know it. It also has very high saturation, not to hide the action as other reviews might suggest, but because the lighting guy mows lawns on the weekend. This is a fast buck movie, so it is to be avoided. It is a wasted 79 minutes. The only thing this movie seems to muster is novel ways to make a movie worse.
