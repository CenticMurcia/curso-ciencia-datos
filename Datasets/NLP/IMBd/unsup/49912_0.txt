Dreck heaped upon dreck and topped with yet more dreck.<br /><br />The lady who plays Supergirl looks like her. But the screenplay is just total cutesy-wutesy cornball dumbness. And Supergirl just sort of ends up being more a naive dingaling instead of being a person from a very highly sophisticated culture. She's portrayed here as a dumb blond maybe slightly more intelligent than a box of rocks, but not by much. In the comics, Kara-El was no dummy, she was a happening gal who gives the baddies a very rough time. You may or may not be able to fool her once, but you'll never fool her twice. But here, Kara-El is so annoyingly dumb, dumb, dumb. She may have been inexperienced in earthly, human ways, but she wouldn't have been that damn stupid. I'm sure that the entire El family, if they were real and had seen this movie, would have sued the movie makers for libel and defamation of the El family.<br /><br />Does anyone but me wonder how it is that Kara-El could automatically speak perfect contemporary American English although it's not likely she would have known a single word of English as she knew next to zilch about Earth as she was portrayed here?<br /><br />Did the movie makers even bother doing any background research by actually reading the comics? Apparently very little if any. I'm a great fan of the stories of the various members of the El family, and this is definitely not the Kara-El i remember reading so many stories about.<br /><br />On the plus side, the actresses playing the baddies were a hoot hamming it up being characters of unremitting egotistical sleazoidness. Without them, this movie would have been a total snoozefest.<br /><br />Basically, i've found movies made of Kal-El and Kara-El to be of extreme disappointment. They've been overly cornball and so humanish. But Kal-El and Kara-El aren't human. They may be people, but they aren't human people. The movies keep portraying them as human, but they aren't at all, no matter what they may look like on the outside. And even if Kal-El grew up in human culture, Kara-El definitely did not. Kara-El was completely Kryptonian, born and bred.<br /><br />The only actor i've seen who could pull off being a Kryptonian superhero was George Reeves. His Superman may have been human-reared, but still very much Kryptonian in his soul. And he had a sense of humor. Who says that aliens can't also have a good-natured sense of humor?<br /><br />Final analysis: This was a chick flick with some of the worst failings that chick flicks tend to have. Like a lack of authenticity and believability. And getting from point A to point C without any defining and explaining point B in between. That effect can manifest without any cause.<br /><br />If i were Kara-El, i would have put my super foot to super kicking some human movie maker butt for making me look like such an idiot.<br /><br />And rather than just whine and complain, i call for a remake, but this time, let's do it right. Do a movie that if Kara-El were real, she would proudly say "That's me, alright!" (After she learned to speak English, of course.)
