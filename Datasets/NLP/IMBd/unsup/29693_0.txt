November 1983 marked the 20th anniversary of DOCTOR WHO and I remember the media coverage given to the event . Scotland's national newspaper had its centre pages dedicated to the history of the show and Britains best selling TV guide Radio Times had a front page cover and a multiple page feature on the show . There was even a special anniversary magazine from the Radio Times dedicated to the programme . But it was this one off special that really got the fans excited <br /><br />The plot centres around someone capturing the different incarnations of the Doctor and holding them hostage in the dark zone of Gallifrey . Okay it's hardly a mind blowing premise and just sets up the story whose main function is to reunite as many Doctors and companions as possible and maybe the story is too cluttered with companion cameos for the story to work successfully , but at least we get to see some old villains like a Dalek and a Yeti and the Cybermen take centre stage in this monster mash <br /><br />As entertainment for both fans and casual viewers it works very well and is one of the better stories from the early 1980s . There are one or two bits that don't work like Sarah falling down a " mountain " and Susan twisting her ankle but Patrick Troughton's performance alone makes this worth watching
