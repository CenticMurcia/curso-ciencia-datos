For many viewers this film was spoilt by advertising, that showed a movie full of spying, hacking and big mysteries.<br /><br />Yes. Big mysteries.<br /><br />Left is one. How does a pretty smart guy lose contact to the "Reality", whatever that is meant? It is good, that this movie only had a low budget, that makes it possible to recognize the smallest change in acting.<br /><br />Simple plot, overwhelming acting, financial flop, just a terrific film.<br /><br />Thumbs up and 10 points
