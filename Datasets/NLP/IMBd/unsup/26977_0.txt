Oy, vey! Just when you thought it was safe to have a marriage, here comes yet another Lifetime "it's ok for women to cheat" yarn. This time the "sympathetic" wifey comes in the form of 80's pop culture queen Virginia Madsen (sister of Michael Madsen, infamous among cult-film fans as the sociopathic Mr. Blonde in "Reservoir Dogs"). Madsen plays--what else?-- the hardworking supermom with nary a discernable fault who is--what else?-- not appreciated by her --what else?-- undeserving husband. Don't forget the kids; their roles in these sorts of films are often varied, so the "what else?" lable can't really be applied. This time it's a bitchy teen-queen-wannabe-slut. In any case, our dear Ms. Wifey heads off to Hawaii to pay last respects to her foster mother, leaving behind the family in Good ol' New England. Out of sight, out of mind. While wifey's away, wifey shall play. Absence isn't making this heart grow any fonder: Rather, the heart is indulging in a bit of ever growing lust with-- what else?-- the physically-superior-to-and-much-younger-than husband uber-dude, here designated "Khala". If there is a message to this film it's summed up in a scene (ironically used in all the trailers) of a childishly grinning Wifey and Kala running down the beach hand in hand. Women don't want to be burdened by average looking men and family, they want to be carefree and like kids again; at least, that's what this movie tells us. As our snivelling hubby deals with the tramping daughter, mumsy is off making out in a cave with Kala and preparing to round second base. Oh, and guess what? It isn't long before our mini-heroine, trampy, is taking mum's indirect advice, likewise ditching her back-home boy toy for a hunky, dangerous uber-dude of her own, who is, oddly enough, Kala's son. All right, so maybe there are two messages: The one already stated, plus, keep your wives and daughters away from Hawaii, or you may find yourself living at the Bachelor Arms Apartments.
