Well the film is a murder mystery and actually looks like an Indian film though it's a Hollywood film<br /><br />It has Indian actors like Naseeruddin Shah, Amjad Khan, Dalip Tahil, Ratna Patak Shah<br /><br />The film is a thriller and how a cop goes an investigates it<br /><br />It touches on lots of topics on the problems cops face in India while solving cases albeit in a light manner<br /><br />The film is serious and lighthearted at the right places and there is a nice balance<br /><br />Direction is good Naseer essays his part with brilliance like always, One of India's finest actors Ratna Patak suits her role as his wife(in real life too she is his wife) Amjad Khan looks overweight and he is okay Dalip too is okay
