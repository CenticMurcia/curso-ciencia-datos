Exceptionally bad! OF course you should expect nothing less from the likes Andrew Van Slee. How the hell does that man make a living making crap? Apparently not just movies, but songs too, he has the midas touch - everything he touches is crap! Big smelling pile of steaming crap! This movie sucks so much, here's what really bad: 1) The sets are pathetic! Apparently they were so small, that in EVERY scene the actors had to walk as s l o w as possible in order to stay on set. And they were so fake and bad, like when there in the woods, yet there on sand? 2) The acting is sooo freaking bad, the cast is deplorable, where did they get these people? In one scene the guy is TRYING to cry and emote, it is terrible! This is the poorest casting EVER! 3) The title had NOTHING to do with the movie! Not like there was much plot anyway.<br /><br />4) The camera work. Wow, really bad. There are so many shots where someone was giving dialogue, but only half of their face was in the shot! They must have been in a rush to get this steaming pile of crap of a movie out to the public.<br /><br />5) The 'gore' was pathetic. The least a stupid horror movie can do is give us good death scenes, reward us with watching these stupid people getting grusemly killed - but NO, its so bad with just fake movie blood thrown on someone to show that they are dead. I would have liked a big gaping wound when a throat gets slashed instead of stupid red magic marker drawn on the victim's neck - which is exactly what this movie does.<br /><br />The best part of the movie: One of the characters says at one point "We should just all kill oursleves" to express her hopelessness at the situation. Yes, that is true, they should have killed themselves, that would have been MUCH better. In fact, everyone involved with the making of this atrocity should kill themselves.
