This was not a bad story but it had no budget. the directing was done well, but they had so little to work with. The lead actor plays Dr. Craig Wesley on Days of our Lives. It was hard seeing him in this role as I am used to seeing him in a soap opera. It is a believable story. I rented this movie as I just saw Wrong turn on the big screen. It was the same type of story. It looked like it was just put together. 4/10
