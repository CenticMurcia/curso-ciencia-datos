Sharp's Challenge! I very much enjoyed this episode. Found it by flipping channels, had thought that this series was over. Sean Bean once again displays his great acting ability. No cheesy acting, settings were great, supporting cast (as usual) was outstanding. This episode is very much like the others was very well written. Once again one of Sharp's nemesis shows his cowardice. Sharp has the support of this commanding general. This general see's the cowardice of one of his officers and sends him packing. Great acting by all. Well rounded, probably one of the best Sharp's episode. I do think that the requirement of "10 lines of text" is a bit inane, and leads one to write "chatter" just to fill up space.
