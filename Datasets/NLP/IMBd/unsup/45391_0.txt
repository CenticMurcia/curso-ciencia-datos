I ordered this movie on rental after hearing quite a lot of praise for it. <br /><br />After about half an hour, I thought, 'It's got to get better soon, surely.' I watched the whole film thinking that it couldn't remain this bad throughout but it did. <br /><br />At no point was I engaged by the film, and I only left it on until the end because I very rarely turn off a DVD early. The plot was very poor and the acting was nothing special. I'm glad to see since watching it that the ratings have come down slightly, better reflecting the quality of the film.<br /><br />In my opinion - overrated.
