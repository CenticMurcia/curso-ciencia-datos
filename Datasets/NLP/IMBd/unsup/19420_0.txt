Steve McQueen's farewell performance in The Hunter is a fine action thriller based on the true story of Ralph 'Pappy' Thorsen, bounty hunter and scourge of bail jumpers everywhere or at least those in and around the Chicago area.<br /><br />It's interesting how the film builds up the level of difficulty of McQueen's cases. His first case was bringing in LeVar Burton who was between the two roles that made his career, in Roots as Kunte Kinte and in Star Trek the Next Generation as Geordi LaForge. The two of them hit it off so well that when Burton's charges are dismissed, he goes to work for McQueen.<br /><br />The film itself builds up gradually to McQueen's last two cases where the action in the last 25 minutes doesn't let up at all, almost like an Indiana Jones film. There's a fine action sequence involving pursuit on the Chicago Metro and later in a parking lot with McQueen trying to apprehend Thomas Rosales, Jr. who is one real psycho. And then McQueen has to deal with Tracey Walter, a psycho out to kill him who kidnaps McQueens's pregnant girl friend Kathryn Harrold. Walter makes Rosales look like Cary Grant, in fact it was the best psycho act since Steve Ihnat in Madigan.<br /><br />Always a pleasure in any film is Eli Wallach, reunited with McQueen from one of McQueen's earliest triumphs in The Magnificent Seven. Wallach plays the bail bondsman who hires McQueen's services and is his friend and confidante.<br /><br />McQueen's last illness came on him with suddenness, though he looks his 50 years, he doesn't look ill in The Hunter. As so he did not get the kind of cinema valedictory that John Wayne did in The Shootist. Still The Hunter is a fine film for a screen legend to go out on.
