This was one of those films for which I used Blockbuster's "If you don't like it, we'll give you a free rental" policy. This film was no more than a very bad attempt to clone the success of films like Naked Gun 1 and 2 (which btw are very good). Unfortunately this film failed miserably. I gave it a 2 out of 10...<br /><br />If you have not seen Naked Gun 1 or 2 than I recommend those instead...if you have, then there is no point of seeing this one.
