This is an excellent art film. This is by no means your typical Bollywood offering of songs, romance, action, and masti. This movie takes an in-depth look at the lives of prisoners and the corrupt political system. Juhi wonderfully plays the role of a documentary filmmaker and a woman standing up to her abusive husband. One would think that a movie on the lives and feelings of three prisoners seems pretty hopeless, but a good script and profound and mysterious dialogues complete this film. An interesting twist at the end adds to the story and Juhi's powerful role and performance.
