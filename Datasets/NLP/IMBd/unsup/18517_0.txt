First of all, Sean Hannity has to be the biggest right-wing gas-bag I've ever heard. If you're a Liberal you might as well be a leper in his eyes. It's either his way or no way. Alan Colmes is much more respectful to the guests even if they're conservative. Hannity needs to get some manners and keep his mouth shut. I'm surprised the show has lasted as long as it has. What makes me laugh is he thinks George W. Bush is the greatest President ever, as least thats the way he acts. Hopefully in '08 we get a Democrat back in the White House so I can watch Sean Hannity cry and whine every night about not having a Conservative Republican in the White House.
