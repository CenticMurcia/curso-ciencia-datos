I know the film well, & was intrigued when I heard about this version & how it would compare. I was very happy with it. All the actors were superb-especially Fleming & Gatiss & the atmosphere was excellent, especially the use of music. The special effects were minimal, but that only contributed to the atmospshere-creepy music & good lighting & that can do a whole lot more sometimes than all the special effects in the world!! For a live production it also looked great.Its also a treat to get well acted & scripted sci-fi, & sci-fi aimed at adults. I understand that the ending used in this version is closer in feel to that used in the original TV series. I liked also that characters who were given little to to in the film were fleshed out nicely here-ie. Caroon (sp!!)the doomed astronaut & his wife but without slowing the pace. I really hope that this comes out on DVD as I would buy it.
