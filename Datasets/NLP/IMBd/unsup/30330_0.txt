This is a very quirky drama,that has some superb acting,BUT the screenplay is not very well thought out,I felt the ending was not clearly explained & was a letdown,<br /><br />NOW for reasons to see this film. The acting & excellent performances by Christian SLATER and ELISHA CUTHBERT.<br /><br />Christian Slater hardly ever has given a weak performance, This time out he has been given one of his best, and he delivers & creates a character to be remembered, Elisha Cuthbert just gets better & better,she has a very hard role here & is about perfect,<br /><br />Wm.H Macy gives another of his fine roles.(I doubt if he can do a bad performance)<br /><br />If the story were only better.<br /><br />It is another film that had next to no release & also made next to no money.<br /><br />The acting is the main reason to see this movie.<br /><br />Ratings: ***(out of 4) 81 points (out of 100) IMDb 7 (out of 10)
