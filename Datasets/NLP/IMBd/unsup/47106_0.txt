With a screenplay rewritten close to thirty times, three actresses whose only duty in the film was to whip their hair and seduce their enemies, and finally a music video director credited as McG, what could we expect. The only thing we could have hoped to save this movie were the Matrix-type shooting of fight scenes and the consistently funny performance of Bill Murray, who the director left out of much of the film.<br /><br />Many people have at least recognize that the film, as far as writing and acting, was not to be taken seriously and the only thing you were supposed to be paying attention to were the beautiful women and the fast paced action scenes. But I can not begin to understand how anyone could give this film any credit at all.<br /><br />First of all, Drew Barrymore gives a horrible performance as Dylan. Cameron Dias, whose work I have enjoyed in many other films, gives as equally an annoying performance as Drew Barrymore. And Lucy Liu is no better than the rest. The only thing I can say is, the cast relied too much on their director. In fact, the only person I could stand in the film was Bill Murray.<br /><br />Even with the action scenes, the movie is terrible and the action does not help at all. All in all, this movie is terrible, don't rent, don't even consider renting it, take your time to get a good movie.
