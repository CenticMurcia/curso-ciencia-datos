Review: <br /><br />Che: Part 1 is a brilliantly crafted film about Che Guevara and his Revolution to bring down Fulgencio Batista. It's an epic and a deep character study of the man and his ambitions. Del Toro creates the character as if it were him. His every movement and gesture is all single handedly captured by an on-form Del Toro.<br /><br />Steven Soderburgh (Traffic) directs this epic as if he were directing a David Leane epic. The scope and granger of individual shots are executed in near perfect style and substance. Of coarse Che: Part 1 has the makings and proportions of an epic that could certainly in some aspects give Leane a run for his money. Soderburgh also handles the action set pieces with great sound and charisma. Not only do you see the action, you live it and it's because of the way Soderburgh has crafted the frame by frame shots of the set pieces.<br /><br />Verdict: An amazing study and a truly reassuring film of the legend and his Revolution.
