I watched Star Trek TOS everyday after elementary school in the 1970's, so much so that after a few years I had managed to see every episode but two. Those two episodes were "Court Martial" and "The Alternative Factor" both of which rank low in my opinion for entertainment value for Trek. I would not see them until I was in my 30's so it's possible that not having seen them first as a child has made me less open to liking the, or it may be that they are just bad episodes; for me, I don't think I'm reaching too far by labeling them bad. The Alternative Factor though wins the honor as a bottom 5 episode while Court Martial doesn't reach those absolute lows based on some decent acting scenes. The reason why I think this episode is so poor is the story is just plain stupid, the characters are made to be stupid, especially Spock, there is little or no parts for characters like Scottie, Sulu, Ohura, Bones, I mean even Yeoman Rand would have helped and I hated her! LOL. OK now it's plot hole time, why couldn't they just phaser the time machine so that neither one could get through? Just make sure you have the nice Lazarus on your dimension, lol. Oh well the other Lazarus seemed like a good guy to go drinking with at a Klingon bar, right? Anyway, way too much time spent with out guest character and not nearly enough with our Enterprise crew means no matter how good the plot (which is not here anyway) it won't get sold. 3 of 10 even though it's Trek, it's a pain to watch and I won't be next time I see it on. So what are your bottom 3 Trek episodes? Here are mine, I don't think they will change if I re-watch them soon, these are based on my memories that go back several years, as a male viewer. The Alternative Factor, Obsession, and Is There No Truth In Beauty.
