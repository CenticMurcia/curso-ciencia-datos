I don't know exactly how many movies did Clint Eastwood make as a director and/or actor with basically playing the same role in also almost the same story every time, detective who makes no excuses and goes in hunt for a serial killer...sounds more than familiar? And 'Tightrope' is exactly that kind of movie, although atmosphere is a bit darker than usual in Clint Eastwood's detective movies, which is a very good thing because the more darker the atmosphere in these kind of crime-mystery-thriller movies gets they get more exciting to watch. Other than slightly different atmosphere, 'Tightrope' is same as every other Clint Eastwood's detective film, it doesn't matter what his character's name is, Wes Block or Harry Callahan, it's the same personality and work approach. Fans of 'Dirty Harry' could love this, everyone else who is into investigative-thrillers should watch this movie.<br /><br />7/10
