Okay, so here's your premise. A bunch of nubile Japanese girls running around in the stereotypical schoolgirl outfits with lots of potential for violence and teen sex: how could you screw this idea up?!<br /><br />Well, look no further than Stacy, a movie built more around odd voice overs rather than the typical tenants that drive the zombie film genre. The idea was there: girls turning into flesh-eating creatures coupled with dark sinister overtones of Fascism and pre-apocalyptic tension. Unfortunately, the production had the budget of a film school short and relied heavily on ridiculous single-shot scenes that dragged on forever. The production looked shabby at best, and the acting was hammy even for a foreign film. <br /><br />To make matters worse, the ending absolutely made no sense, and the bad gore scenes couldn't make up for all of the downfalls to the film.
