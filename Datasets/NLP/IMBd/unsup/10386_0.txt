If you're not sure what the words "purient" and "gratuitous" mean, there's no need to look them up. Just watch this embarrassing film.<br /><br />True, there is a vague hint of an important theme here, but it is clumsily handled, with very little depth. The conclusion is wrapped up with displayed text, which is the equivalent of a voice-over. No effort whatsoever. Heck, you know what you're getting into just from the title.<br /><br />This is a made-for-HBO movie, after all. All that mattered to them was showing a woman forced to undress, and this shows in the painfully simple screenplay.<br /><br />On a more positive note, it is interesting to see parallel scenes with the woman, whom we are obviously meant to empathize with, and the muslim-looking guy. <br /><br />Theoretically, one would feel bad for the woman, and then realize how wrong it is to treat the man the same way.<br /><br />-But even this is clumsily handled, to put it mildly.<br /><br />It's just gratuitous sex and humiliation, HBO-style. I'm glad I didn't see it with others present, as I would have been quite embarrassed.
