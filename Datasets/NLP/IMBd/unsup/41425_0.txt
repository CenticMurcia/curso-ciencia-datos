Nothing much to write home about... Killer robots. CHECK. Screaming people. CHECK. Gore and heads blowing up. CHECK. Gratiutous sex scenes with a peek at some boobs. CHECK. Stupid dialogues. CHECK. Illogical plot-holes. CHECK. Crappy acting. CHECK. Cheesy humour. CHECK.<br /><br />Sounds like an enjoyable 80s horror movie to me. Nothing really memorable, as this is just basically silly fun with no wires attached. A jump back to the days, when you could make silly movies and really didn't try to do anything else or sell the project as something it isn't. <br /><br />As far as I'm concerned I'm content.
