Hey, I love this gem of an overlooked major motion picture. I just saw this 15 plus-year-old film for the first time today. All the big and little name actors were credible and believable. The story and relationships rang true.<br /><br />Sure, a lot of blood is spilled but really no more than any other gang film. And there is hot romance, partial nudity, deep betrayal, lethal weapons of all types and sizes, highly manic and inappropriate anti-social behavior, dark shadows, old rooftops, bad language, slow motion gun fights, fierce fist fights, yucky dead bodies, severed body parts, things blowing up, screeching tires, dingy subways, lots of alcohol, several funerals, a grand parade - what's not to like here?<br /><br />If you liked Mystic River, Reservoir Dogs, Goodfellas, Godfather I & II, and various cop & robber shows on TV over the past 50 plus years you'll love seeing this realistic portrayal of a little self-destructive crime family that could be operating in any ethnic neighborhood in any larger city at anytime in history.
