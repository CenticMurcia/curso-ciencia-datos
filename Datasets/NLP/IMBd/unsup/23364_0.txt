I thought this movie was definitely original, funny, sad, and emotional in many ways...I didn't expect much and was simply curious about the film due to having been the number 2 movie of 2005 in Korea...I'd definitely recommend it - it really reminds us about what's important in life...I found it quite heartwarming how such adversarial parties could learn to enjoy a genuine fellowship sans the rigid, conformist partisanship that was indoctrinated by their respective countries. This symbolic "shedding" of their former identities was demonstrated quite poignantly when each of them adopted the traditional garments of the town...the fact that each of them voluntarily assumed such physical transformations evinced a willing preference and readiness for unity. It was quite moving to see the progressive dissolution of their contempt and distrust for each other evolve into such a powerful, familial bond... In many ways, this transient, new life within the village represented a form of "utopia" which seemed far more preferable than their former ways of life<br /><br />*spoiler* The only thing I didn't like was the tragic ending --and I do agree with the arguments made by a few on this board concerning the illogical nature of opting for a futile, suicidal standoff as opposed to a more practical evacuation of the village--even if that would entail some sacrifice on the part of the villagers...there was definitely an alternative to avoiding the unnecessary deaths...Just because the villagers would be losing their way of life doesn't seem to justify their deaths...on the other hand, I guess it's arguable that their deaths were heroic and almost "redemptive" for them...especially for the NK leader and the suicidal SK solider...nevertheless, it was a great film.
