2007 has been dry, but finally, we have been delivered. Aaja Nachle is full of elements Bollywood has been missing for some time and is in SORE NEED of. Namely:<br /><br />1a) Dance numbers. That is to say, numbers focused on DANCING, rather than someone's flashy Western outfit, locations, batman angles, etc. 1b) LOTS OF dance numbers. I'm sick of scanty three-song phoned-in craptations. Aaja Nachle keeps the music coming all the time! That's the way it should be done. <br /><br />2) Classical infusion. The end of the film is a knockout surprise in this respect. I don't want to spoil anything, but there is so much here for those who love the ancient stories as well as the new.<br /><br />3) Hot dudes. OH MY GOD, Kunal Kapoor! <br /><br />4) MADHURI. Looking spectacular, so charming, totally in control of her performance and giving it her all. Her hips are the world's 9th wonder. <br /><br />5) Great young leading ladies i.e. Konkona Sen Sharma. She is the best actress to have come out in the last couple of years and the girl is here to stay! Sonam Kapoor? pfft! Katrina Kaif? pfft squared! <br /><br />The story is simple but busy, with dramatic moments that touch deeply and comedic moments that have the audience rollicking. There isn't a single minute that drags; this film is not only well written and well acted, but well paced (a dear rarity in Bollywood). In short, it is here to bring Bollywood back to where it belongs! An unmitigated success from the inimitable Madhuri. I'm going to see it again this week, then I'm going to buy the DVD--ORIGINAL! Not that anyone needs to be reminded, but you must see this film!
