This was by far the worst movie I have ever seen! How did it get as high as a 4.4? It was horrendous. The only people I can imagine would be entertained by this movie are 10 or 11 year old girls. And it shames me that even they could like it. It saddens me that no matter how much I execrate this movie some poor poor fool will watch it. I have never seen a movie so awful.<br /><br />First the plot was utter crap; I have seen better one's in Bugs Bunny Cartoons. Oh, I wish I were kidding. It's about some trivial girl who wants 2 c a concert and has a rivalry with some other bitch at school. This has been done thousands of times and much, much better. It just went on and on it was horrendous. It was so bad it went right past being so bad it was good and straight into hell. This is not at all what high school is like. It seems like the entire script was written and the movie filmed in two days. No it is not just a brain dead teen movie or chick flick, it is far beyond that. it is completely ineffable the abhorrence I feel for this pathetic excuse of a movie. <br /><br />The characters r paper thin. Lola and the bitch she's fighting with r just plain obnoxious and annoying. They just bitch bitch bitch the entire movie and I wish they would both be shot. You thought the girls from Clueless were superficial Oh u haven't seen anything yet. Teenage girls have much greater issues 2 worry about than some silly concert. The are stereotypes of the typical stupid 15 year old girl: whiny, superficial, and a general pain in the ass. Not to mention the dialogue was enough to make me contemplate suicide. <br /><br />The acting was terrible and so was the soundtrack. I have to say Lindsey Lohan was dressed wonderfully for the most part, but when we got 2 the part where everyone laughs at her I couldn't help but feel satisfied after having to watch this rubbish!! This movie was so awful I wanted to physically hurt every last character. BTW her BF Sam or whatever his name is seems gay 2 me.<br /><br />The movie was annoying and I pray that there r no girls that r anything like the ones in this movie.
