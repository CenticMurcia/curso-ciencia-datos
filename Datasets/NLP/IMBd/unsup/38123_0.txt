I am a huge zombie movie fan and have watched all of George Romero's movies, and every independent, grade B, or mainstream zombie movie that I find I watch. This one was the worst I have EVER seen, scratch that this is not the worst zombie movie, this is the worst movie PERIOD.<br /><br />To start with I know kids who lie to their parents more convincingly than the actors in this movie acted. It didn't seem like the actors where just inexperienced, it seemed like they where all mentally challenged with mouths full of marbles.<br /><br />The zombie gore effects where also terrible with the camera lingering to show wriggling gummy worms and pieces of raw meat moving up and down with the rhythm of the zombies heart beat, and zombies chewing down a sausage link (intestines) and not even taking a real bite out of it???? The gunfire was made with $99.00 effects Lab software or possibly the lite free version, it seemed. The ballistics and flash didn't match up to the weapons and the weapons where lame and generic.<br /><br />The people being attacked just stood like mannequins to be eaten by the zombies, there was not any "AI or Artificial Intelligence" as they put it in the gaming world. The zombies where so slow in this movie you could outrun them with broken legs, but, healthy young adults couldn't outrun them??? The plot and concept where not original and there where huge jumps or gaps in the plot. I would only recommend this movie to people that I hate with a passion. No wait, I don't hate ANYONE that bad.
