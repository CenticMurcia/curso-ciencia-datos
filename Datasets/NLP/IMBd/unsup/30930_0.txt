I wish I had a way to give this movie a rating that would show how awful I think this movie was. I ended up seeing it yesterday after a friend and I went to see "Taken" and it was sold out. I haven't gone to a theater to see a Nicolas Cage movie for a long time and now remember why. I truly detest his on-screen movie presence. The beginning of the movie, with the time-capsule premise, was intriguing--I've always liked the idea of time capsules and what gets found in them. This movie was a bad mix of awful acting, sloppy story-telling, mixed metaphors, really bad acting, pseudo-Christian propaganda, 2nd-rate CGI, and really awful acting--yes, I know I mentioned the acting several times but it was just that bad. Nicolas Cage gets increasingly difficult to watch the older he gets, using his stern face to express emotion and his "puppy dog" eyes to show his sadness. How an alcoholic atheist(cue the laughs) is converted to believing in something more than randomness and then willingly gives up his son just made me groan with disbelief. When I saw the house that this morose professor lived in, with it's peeling paint and wallpaper, I knew it was supposed to represent something but never did figure that part out. This is a bad mix of the "Left Behind" movies and every other bad science fiction movie in the last decade. Please, Nic, you've certainly made enough money in the last decade making bad movies...don't make any more.
