The last Hammer Horror film features Nastassja Kinski in only her third film, and her first major role. The film was banned in many countries because she was only 15 at the time.<br /><br />There are several fine actors in this film. There is Oscar-nominee Richard Widmark (Kiss of Death), Christopher Lee (The Wicker Man, LOTR) in what may be his finest performance, Honor Blackman (Goldfinger), and Oscar-nominee Denholm Eliott (A Room with a View, Raiders of the Lost Ark).<br /><br />While Sister Catherine (Kinski) is being cared for by novelist John Verney (Widmark) on the eve of her 18th birthday at the request of her father (Eliott), we flashback to her bloody birth, bursting from the belly of her mother, presided over by a smiling sinister Father Michael (Lee), as the others present turn away in disgust.<br /><br />While Father Michael is using his Satanic powers to draw Sister Catherine to her destiny, Verney endeavors to protect her. A battle of will and dark forces ensues. Verney realizes the seriousness of his mission as Sister Catherine escapes after burying a comb in the head of Anna Fountain (Honor Blackman).<br /><br />That was one slimy demon that was crawling over Sister Catherine prior to her baptism, and that was a very tempting offer made to Verney at the end. Willpower to resist that offer is more than I have.
