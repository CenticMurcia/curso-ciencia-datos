This was the worst movie I have ever scene. Talk about a knock out cover though. That is probably where all the money went. I mean this is the most horrible movie I have watched. Save your time and money don't see this movie. It's gross too. ahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!! Not only is this weird and bizarre but the whole female male thing gave me the creeps. This movie also had very bad acting and non-realistic characters. The characters didn't stick to how they were written to be. I would not let anyone see this movie except in the exception of a foe. In that case I would promote it. Not only is the cover good but the back description is false. They say that the whole town ends up exploding. But it does not really happen. The End of the world sort of movie. But really, really, really bad.
