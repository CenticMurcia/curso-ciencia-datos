"Dunyayi Kurtaran Adam" was so naive and childish that I almost like that film for its mistakes and cheesiness. Nothing can render infringement valid but it is so absurd and made out of nothing, you can, in a way, understand why they came up with such movie.<br /><br />But what is this? Obviously they have budget and every kind of opportunity. I won't go into detail because I am ashamed that there are people in this country who feel easy of depicting themselves like this proudly and call the film "turks in space". If they could just donate the entire money they spent on this film to a orphanage, not only they could have the blessing of many unfortunate kids but also save a million's hatred.<br /><br />One thing I can't really comprehend is that how they dared to shoot such film after GORA. This movie is not only an unimaginably unsuccessful sequel to a movie that is unimaginably naive and problematic but also uses the very fundamental elements of GORA, like main actor starring both as the antagonist and the protagonist.<br /><br />All those stupid jokes, bad acting, CG worse than those used in worst series in worst Turkish channels... I really can't stop writing, this movie has interfered with my inner peace.
