Yes, that's right. I am a real male but i cry after i watch this movie secondly, i cry, ah! Whatever, i am a real male, this movie is telling us how to give love with pure heart not with anyelse, we should give love because we should not because anything.. This movie telling us too, that we shouldn't get word "late" for anything especially for love in this case. We teached by this movie to see other not by sight but by value of truth, yes, Sizhuru is a good-kiddy girl, Miyuki is a good-mature girl. Whatever this story is good, we teached not to lie too. Yes, this movie teach us a lot about basic lesson like Sizhuru's words and Miyuki's which is told to Makoto. I cried because i remember someone (not me) i know closely, like them, oh..
