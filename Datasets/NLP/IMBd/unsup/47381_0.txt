As a fan of Will Ferrell-style comedy (and I've loved Reilly in other movies), as well as a fan of the Johnny Cash and Ray Charles biopics, I thought mixing the two couldn't go wrong. I was horribly disappointed. Almost every joke was completely predictable Â– you could see the punchline coming from a mile away, and when it arrived, it wasn't very funny. About the only thing good in this movie was Tim Meadows, who had me howling every time he was on screen (he's the only reason I gave it two stars instead of one). If my daughter hadn't been in the next theater watching a movie with her aunt, I would have walked out and gone home.
