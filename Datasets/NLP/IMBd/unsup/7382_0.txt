I can't believe how much this kind of movie impressed me. They don't make this kind of movies these days...right from the start till the very end it's all full-throttle action...and the thing that gets you is this : you don't expect much of it when you see the title and info, thinking "yeaahhh...another dumbass kids movie"...and though it has a few aspects that defy a realistic movie, but man, it becomes more and more engaging by the minute and keeps you focused with its breathtaking scenes and intensity...I mean, damn...this is a well-built movie people, good acting, good plot, strong moral values...and it's all done by simple means and lines, not like the majority of the movies you see now with great actors, boring scenarios and pathetic lines. I saw almost all the movies in the top 250 and much more, and I'm telling you, this one definitely belongs to the top. If you want the best true friendship based adventure movie of the moment, forget about the "Indy and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull" category, which by the way is a disgrace to its kind, and give this one a go....satisfaction guaranteed ;)
