It's got a big lizard, it's got drag racers, it's got sock hops, how can it lose? Well it's also got interminable Hot-Wheels-In-The-Terrarium sequences, plus the most insufferably wholesome drag racer of all time. He keeps bursting into this song on his goddamn ukulele which goes "God wants all his children to be happy happy happy" - over and over and over again. The sock hop - which was rocking beforehand, let me tell you - screeches to a halt and everyone stands gape-mouthed at this dolt. It's like going to a hip hop show in Toronto, and it's a pleasure when the gila monster busts through the wall mid-number. And don't miss the hilarious nitroglycerin transportation sequence: the guy is like, "careful, that's nitroglycerin!" then throws it into his jeep and drives at top speed across a field.
