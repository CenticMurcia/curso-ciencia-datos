I do not want to get into too much detail about this movie, as it does not deserve that much time, however I do want to say this; THIS MOVIE SUCKS! Personally, I like Christian Slater and Wes Bentley but nothing could save this movie from the dreadful screen adaptation and directing. The movies first 30 minutes were so bad that I would not even give it the honor of having B movie status and the rest was so poorly acted due to the directing that you just wanted to shut the thing off. This movie will never make it to the big screen in the US, nor will most foreign markets entertain such horribly bad film making. The story was written by Stephen King and is a decent short story but about revenge but the only revenge should be on the audience wanting an hour and a half of their life back. (Important: Some movies are bad because the actors are bad, in this case the actors are bad because of the directing and not due to lack of skill.)
