All I can say about this movie is WTF the concept is the same as your Blair Witch,Paranormal Activity and so on but somewhere between the halfway point of the movie its almost as the director lost all his sense of thinking and drops a twist which makes you go huh,and then about another 45 minutes or so later when you see the ending credits that is when you will have the reaction WHAT THE F***.<br /><br />I read another user reviews about this movie and was looking forward to a good scare unfortunately this one does not deliver anything of such sort.I would definitely say pass on this one,i will give it 2 starts simply for the fact that it was shot well other then that hopefully the 2011 remake delivers more then this.
