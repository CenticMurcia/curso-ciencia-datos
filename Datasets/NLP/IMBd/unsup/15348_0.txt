Please release this title on video/DVD! It is a wonderful, wonderful account of Charles Darwin's Beagle Voyage, and would be a very helpful addition to the curriculum in many a college course on evolution and/or the history of science. It would be great if local PBS stations would pick up this series and show it from time to time, so that interested viewers could at least tape it (the local museum of television history was the only place I could get access to it). It's a real shame that, because of the religious beliefs of a small minority of people (who could simply elect not to watch), the rest of the TV-watching audience are deprived of excellent programming such as this.
