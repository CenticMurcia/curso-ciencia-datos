This was a nice sequel to Halloweentown. The plot was engaging. The acting was just as good as the first one. The villain was amusing, yet not sugar-coated. The character development from the first one to the sequel was VERY well done. No being a big fan of TV movie sequels I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Bottom line... if you liked Halloweentown... you like Halloweentown II: Kalabar's Revenge.
