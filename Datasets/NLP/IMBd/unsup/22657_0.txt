The biggest problem for this film was that it didn't know what it wanted to be. It started off as an absurd comedy but tried to turn into a powerful depressing drama by the end. Without a cleverly written script, it is set up for failure.<br /><br />The acting is mostly poor. Dominique Swain does a respectable job. Which makes it more of a tragedy that she was actually in a film this bad. Busy Phillips is the other actress who can impress in a few scenes. Everyone else was forgettable to say the least. Except for Thora Birch, whose motive for starring here I can't begin to understand.<br /><br />The directing was OK, it wasn't as bad as the script or the actors. The montage scenes were well done. They almost tricked you into forgetting that they were from a bad film. In the end its still an overproduced waste of film.
