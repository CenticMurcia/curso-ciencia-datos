I'm a great fan of rags to riches stories. Having lived the riches to rags to riches life personally, the idea is quite appealing to me! What I found so interesting about Jeremy Piven's character was that he was so enamored with Sherilyn Fenn's character; that he saw through the obvious. He wasn't looking at the superficial. Yes, she was pretty and very rich, but that wasn't his motivation. He was truly motivated by, gasp, LOVE! His countenance and his boyish body language when he would be around her was so wonderful to watch. And how a bond and a friendship developed between the two characters was simply delicious. Sherilyn Fenn's character, I thought, was implausible knowing today's standards. However, I loved the thought of knowing that a beautiful, young, rich, single and famous actress could have such a deep longing for true love and faithfulness - where do you find that nowadays?<br /><br />It's in this story!<br /><br />The movie was so passionate and poignant, the characters so innocently appealing, and the supporting cast was simply tremendous. I can't say enough good things about this film. Who cares if its an independent. Who cares if its low budget. A good romance doesn't need the big hollywood hype or the big production; it simply needs two characters that truly and deeply love each other and are willing to look beyond the superficial attitudes that most of us have grown accustomed to!
