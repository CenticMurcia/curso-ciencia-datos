Savior is the first western film of its kind. The movie shows that war in the former Yugoslavia was not black and white, i.e., the conflict was not one of good versus evil but rather that all sides - including Croats and Muslims - shared in the atrocities committed.<br /><br />The film lacks in fully understanding the ethnic peoples of the region, however it still is groundbreaking in its non-simplistic 'gray' portrayal of the war rather than other films that depict the combatants as 'good' or 'evil.'<br /><br />It is unfortunate that Savior was not made before 1995, while the Bosnian War was still being fought, it would have definitely helped to open viewers' eyes to the reality of the war.
