Yes, folks, in the 70s world of the double feature, this was the show at my local cinema. Of course I went. Somehow I thought the letter kid had forgotten to add the T after BUS thus making it a rude duo. Both films were very funny. Both films were completely ignored in first release. Both films are now cult faves. Other comments will tell you the details, but MUSICAL is a low budget indie that uses this constraint well to create a plausible storyline and suitably tacky musical production numbers. In the 70s there were a lot of farce sex / musicals like ALICE IN WONDERLAND and THE CASE OF THE SMILING STIFFS. Some compilation skit sex comedies about D grade film studios too: LOOSE SHOES and THAT'S ADEQUATE. This film, NUDIE MUSICAL sort of rolled all the ideas together. The idea of a comedy sex musical was not really new and was also re imagined here in Australia in the mid 90s: we saw a very similar locally made farce/musical/comedy created in 1997 called MONEYSHOT which unbeknownst to the producer with whom I later became friends, alerted him to MUSICAL which saw him flabbergasted at the similarities. It was originally called THE VENUS FACTORY... see IMDb for details. This parallel production of OZ and USA happens a lot: see PRISCILLA QUEEN OF THE DESERT vs TO WONG FOO, TWO HANDS vs KNOCKAROUND GUYS, and recently WILLFULL vs Almodovar's VOLVER
