Yet another Sci-Fi Original and not that hard to watch. We're not talking award-winning or anything. Some of the computer-animated effects with the world coming to an end and all a bit more than par for the course. Far fetched story line, but then this is science fiction...not reality. The largest solar emissions ever are detected and are about to set the whole damn world on fire. To save mankind, hurried scientists are forced to take risky steps to counter the sun's shooting flares breaching the ozone layer.<br /><br />U.S. President Gordon(Louis Gossett, Jr.)calls upon a multi-millionaire maverick scientist Lucas Foster(Mark Dacascos)for help as the clock is running down and the world is facing assured Armageddon. Is this a pulse-pounding action thriller? Let's just say there is no urgent need for Xanax. It is kind of funny that Detroit looks a whole lot like Buffalo. And if Dacascos looks familiar; you have seen him in his role as the Chairman on Food TV's American Iron Chef. Gosset, Jr. the acclaimed actor he is could have phoned in his role. Also in the cast: Joanne Kelly, Conrad Coates, Damir Andrei and Sugith Varughese.
