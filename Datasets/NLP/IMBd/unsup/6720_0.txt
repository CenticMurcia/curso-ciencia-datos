Whatever it was that they were taking when they came up with Bee Movie, I suggest you have some before watching; it'll make the experience less painful.<br /><br />I've seen some weird films in my time, from the surreal output of Lynch, Miike and Jodorowsky, to the visual excesses of Argento and Gilliam, but I've never seen a film quite as strange as this effort from Dreamworks (whose standards have really been slipping as of late).<br /><br />A kids movie that features talking bees and cows, hints at interspecies sex, mentions suicide pacts, features lengthy courtroom scenes and a freaky dream sequence in which the heroine dies, and ends with thousands of bees helping a jumbo jet to land (!!!), Bee Movie is an unbelievable stinker of monumental proportions, albeit (or should that be 'all-bee-it?') one that keeps you watching purely to see what the hell they'll come up with next.<br /><br />The story starts off with a bee questioning his role in society, turns into a bizarre (or should that be 'buzz-arre'?) love story, becomes (or should that be....alright, I'll stop now) a quest for truth, warps into a courtroom drama, and ends up as a race against time with the fate of the Earth at stake.<br /><br />With barely a laugh to be had (not including those nervous giggling noises that I made as I felt my sanity sliding slowly away from me), I left this film questioning what kind of idiot green-lighted this train-wreck of a project.<br /><br />Bee Movie narrowly escapes getting a 1 out of 10 thanks to its dazzlingly colourful CGI, the very occasional genuinely inspired joke (the bee repeatedly hitting the window, the bugs on the windshield), and the smokin' hot female character, Vanessa (only pixels, I know... but WHAT pixels!!!).
