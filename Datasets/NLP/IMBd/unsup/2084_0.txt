Probably the best film adaptation of a Steinbach novel that Hollywood ever managed. East of Eden doesn't make it since Kazan used less than a third of a towering novel.<br /><br />Of Mice and Men is a profoundly moving story of people caring for each other during a very difficult time in American history. Lon Chaney, Jr. does the best work of his career in a deceptively demanding role. The one sour note is the bewilderingly hammy performance by Betty Field.
