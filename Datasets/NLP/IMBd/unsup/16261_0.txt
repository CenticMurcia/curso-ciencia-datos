Once you get by the endless Holmes clich√©s and crutches, the weak plot and the fact that this Holmes is rather distasteful, it's a passable film. But no more than that. But then most of have have been spoiled by the late Jeremy Britt, undoubtedly the best Holmes ever. This Holmes is an arrogant bully and his Doctor Watson is a bit of a simpering goof. Lestrade is a poor clone of Poirot's Inspector Japp about thirty years down the line. And where were Mycroft and Moriarity who could have added some zing to this zingless portrayal. Most of the ingredients are there...Victorian manners and clothing...London fog...hansom cabs on cobblestones. But somehow it just doesn't fit to-gether. It's not bad but it's also not very good.
