A very pleasant, watchable movie that doesn't have much meat on it. Martin is good but not great - he's kind of recycling his Czech wild and crazy guy routine with a slightly different accent. He tries to unstuff Rick Moranis' stuffy FBI agent - Moranis is not believable in the role, but this movie doesn't ask you to believe him. Joan Cusack is wonderful as Moranis' love interest. I wish she could choose higher profile roles that are worthy of her talent.<br /><br />I like the theme of old gangsters going to "Heaven" - in this case, that's San Diego - away from the dark, dreary world of the East Coast via the witness protection program. It's a good idea, and there are a few good laughs. I just wish it had challenged me more as a viewer. There's some really deep material here that could have been explored, even in a comedy.
