I loved this picture because it has beautiful cinematography and settings of Paris. But that's not all, Uma Thurman has so damn beautiful as the wife of Fred Ward who charms the young, naive, but tricky Anais Nin played superbly by Maria de Mardieos. Fred Ward as a little weird as the American writer who charms Anais. Uma was great with her thick New York accent and her beauty. I think the rating should have been R instead of NC-17.I have seen R rated movies much worse than this picture.Rent this movie right away! It will astonish you!This picture is an epic which should not be overlooked at the video store! Have Fun!<br /><br />10/10
