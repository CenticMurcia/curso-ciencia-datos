This film is often overlooked among the great war films, but it fully holds up to the best and, at the same time, transcends the genre by offering much to those interested in classic detective themes. The cast is first-rate, and thanks to an excellent script and excellent direction, avoids the classic "walk-on" feel of many other films that have a profusion of well-known stars. Sharif is surprisingly good as the dedicated police officer, Courtney excellent as a sensitive yet firmly grounded young soldiers, and O'Toole is superb as the epitome of a ruthless SS officer. Pleasance offers a fine performance--to my mind among his very best--as a conscientious and basically decent officer. Based on an excellent novel by Hans Helmut Kirst, this film offers an excellent, gritty feel to Warsaw and Paris during the period of German occupation. It is thoroughly grounded in solid historical research, likely aided by Kirst's own wartime perspective. Well worth seeing!
