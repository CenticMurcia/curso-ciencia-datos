This is probably the most beautiful, involving game I've ever had the fortune to play! The areas look magnificent, the characters are extremely likeable and colorful and the fight scenes are excellent! The plot is very imaginative and clever, making you become absorbed in this spectacular game. Now, I've said it once and this matter still troubles me...why wasn't the movie as good? The movie should have come up with as good a plot as this and should have beautiful sets with real cast members surrounded by brilliant special effects and monsters. But instead we got a good, yet dissapointing movie adaptation. Oh well...I still have the proud memory of this great game! FF10 looks great! Final Fantasy 8 gets 10 out of 10 definatly!
