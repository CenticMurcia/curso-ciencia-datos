No one alive will convince me "Mike Pipper" isn't Steve Smith, better known as character Red Green on "The Red Green Show". Yeah I realize he's billed as Ron Anderson (III). That's Red Green, unless like 50% of Canadians look and sound like Red Green.<br /><br />The movie is about some dork who's dorky father was killed by a dorky cult. The dork snoops around and finds his dorky father's notes on a dorky cult. Dork investigates. Not surprisingly the entirety of Canada must be part of the dorky cult because somehow they show up at dork's house, looking for dork and the notes. Dork escapes and meets bigger dork. Chasing continues and rather bland uninteresting dialogue ensue until they run into Red Green. Right around this time dork finds out that bigger dork used to be in the cult, and in fact may have killed his father! Dohwell... didn't expect that now did we? In the end, some dork ends up burning and some really dorky thing happens. Perhaps the oddest thing is the apparent alien abduction of about 10 of the dorky cult members. I couldn't really figure out what exactly took place, and how this fit into the err..story? Perhaps they were walking towards the light? <br /><br />The story is horrible, acting is terrible, there are no effects, and the script is 1st to none. The only thing I can say there are actually quite a few "motion" cinema shots. That's about the only thing that get's this film a 1. It's dated 1990. I seriously wonder how many decades this sat finished before release? 1/10
