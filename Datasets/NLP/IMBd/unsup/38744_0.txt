Two unfortunate college males, heading for a shin-dig with girls, flatten their tire when coming close to hitting a hitcher(Jamie-Lynn Sigler of "Sopranos" fame)on some highway surrounded by woods. She leads them into the woods "to find help" and they meet a forest-ranger named Bill(David Johansen)around a camp fire who tells them "scary" stories supposedly teaching them lessons about life.<br /><br />The first is about what occurs to some idiot, scumbag jocks who mess around with a school janitor who just happens to be an escaped convict who was able to flee his asylum by murdering the psychotic doctor performing "pain threshold experiments" on him. They get in over their heads when the boys "chase" him into the woods and truly realize just who their up against.<br /><br />Three criminals, leather-jacket punks, and their equally repellent chick that hangs with them, attack and rob a powerful motorcycle-riding(!) Indian with a magic bag. They start smoking his stash of wacky weed and suffer horrifying hallucinations which will effect them physically as it does mentally.<br /><br />Two young couples stay at a country-house for the night for a little game of "truth and dare", drinking, and sex while a killer begins to pick them off one by one while filming the action on video camera.<br /><br />Poorly produced, gore-less, and about as scary as a Sesame Street episode. The violence almost completely takes place off-screen and it is apparently(because the whole film seems shot on someone's camcorder)because of a zero budget. Each story within the film is yawn-inducing instead of gripping and the entire cast elicit little sympathy from the viewer. The second story has horrendous computer effects during the hallucination sequences. David Johansen as the story-teller Ranger Bill is laughable. Jamie-Lynn Sigler as Natalie the hitch-hiker barely registers.
