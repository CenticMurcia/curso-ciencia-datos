I admit that I was drawn to this film by Maltin's (negative) review ("bloody, gory Western"), wondering if it could be so explicit. Well, there are many killings here, but you barely get to see any blood. Mainly, this is just an improbable, formula Western tale of revenge. Lee Van Cleef is the sadistic villain, and perhaps he had played a few too many sadistic villains by that point; he has no flair here. Early on, there is a scene so laughably bad, involving an obvious stock shot of a scorpion, that it destroys the film's credibility, and the film never regains it. (*1/2)
