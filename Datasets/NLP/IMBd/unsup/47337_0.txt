I am not one for censorship and don't like the idea of banning anything, but honestly I thought it was very appropriate that this movie was banned in 40+ countries.<br /><br />This movie is Slow and Boring with Bad Acting, Bad Mixing, Bad Sound Engineering, etc. It sounds like traffic in the background for most of the movie. The movie has no point, constantly repeated scene stills and short carnival clips, extremely choppy, even worse then your average asylum movie.<br /><br />Then there is the last 20 minutes. When the violence starts, it is your average gore fest. However, The last scene where the woman is turned into a worm is one of the worst things you could possibly see. It is not entertaining, It is not enjoyable. It is completely uncalled for. I would even understand if someone threw their rental disk away and paid the fee just so it wasn't put back on the shelf. Extremely bad taste. Even if you love horror movies like hellraiser, freddy, hills have eyes, hostile, etc. nothing is as disgusting and awful as this movie. Don't waste your money on this crap, and it's time we stop supporting asylum, they are sick people that don't belong in showbiz, and on top of that they can't even mix down their movie right.
