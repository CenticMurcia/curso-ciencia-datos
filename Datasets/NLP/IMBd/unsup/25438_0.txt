This movie was terrible. Who could believe that someone is so stupid. There is a great message in this movie about white kids who think they know the "ghetto" and try to act tough and hardcore but all they are doing is looking stupid. Its one thing to enjoy rap and the hip hop culture, buts its whole different thing to change your voice and accent to sound "cool". If you are a parent and your kids think they are "thugs", then make them watch this and they will understand how stupid they are acting. life is too short to waste time trying to act cool. I loved the Slick Rick, Doug E. Fresh cameos and am still wondering how they got Snoop Dogg to agree to show up in this cameo.
