Been meaning to give this one a watch for a while. Thank god i got round to it!.<br /><br />It has to be one of the most unique and amazing films i've seen.<br /><br />First thing you notice about this film is it's not like what you've seen before.<br /><br />The way it's shot you is fantastic. It's so cool and slick you would honestly not believe it was an "older" film. It could easily be pulled off as something that came out last year. It has stood the test of time better than many other films ever do.<br /><br />The story is what makes this film great. It's outstanding it's so interesting and often sick?! and at the same time twisted. It's not a film of beauty in anyway it's ugly and twisted but that is what it does so well you can't help but fall in love with the film and the characters involved.<br /><br />The story is pulled off that well that i actually thought it was based on a true story until i found later it wasn't. Stupid me but it is pulled off and written so well i guess it shows.<br /><br />With phenomenal performances from Woody and Juliette. I don't think i've ever seen characters come to life on screen like i did in this.<br /><br />It's not Juliette and Woody your seeing it's Mickey and Mallory! It's a great film that i think anyone with a good taste for films will love.<br /><br />Also look out for great character acting from both Tommy Lee Jones & Robert Downey JR (Playing a Australian documentary interviewer).<br /><br />And come on 7/10? what the hell is going on there. Top 250 worthy to say the least!.<br /><br />8/10
