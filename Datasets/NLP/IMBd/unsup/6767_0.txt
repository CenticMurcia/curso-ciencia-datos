Three soldiers returning from Iraq after sustaining injuries received during combat expecting a normal 30 days of leave. When their flights get canceled is when their journey starts. Expectations of home are not what they thought it would be. Being in the Army you have heard of and experienced this and know it can be true. The movie does a great job of portraying the Army in and out of Iraq. Three very different actors that do a great job of showing the diversity in the Army and going from state to state show their different backgrounds. Too much driving and not enough action. Movie was boring at parts and the ending was pretty predicable. We would recommend to watch this after dinner with the family. Good movie but could have been a little more lively. Super and Mik out!
