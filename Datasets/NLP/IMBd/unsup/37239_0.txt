I went into this movie expecting voodoo magic, an evil curse, and a dark scenic setting. The preview leads you to believe that there will be some form of monster in this movie and there is but unlike the previews lead you to believe it turns out to be a basic giant crocodile. After you discover that in fact the monster you're chasing IS the giant crocodile you're greeted with some humanitarian green piece film that will annoy you to death. The most memorable characters die and the film feeds us a surprise "plot twist" which is more like a plot flop. This film gets a deserving D -, but I will say that it may make a good rental on a buy one get one free night; and it did provide me with a few moments of shock. Finally the films ending made me laugh uncontrollably so I guess it wasn't all bad... just mostly.
