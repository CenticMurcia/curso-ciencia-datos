I was not impressed with this movie. If a movie doesn't catch my attention in the first 30 minutes I won't watch the rest. It started out violent and I had no idea what the plot even was. All I saw was violence, murder, and drug abuse but no real substance. I didn't finish it. Even the people I was watching it with didn't get the point of the movie either. I was expecting something great out of it though the actors in the film were not names which with I was familiar. Fighting for truth and justice are good causes, but I only saw that in the plot synopsis. I guess it takes a while into the movie to finally get the idea that is what is going on.
