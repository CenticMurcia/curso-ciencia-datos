Warren Beatty as a Senator who becomes a rapper? Move over, Plan 9 From Outer Space! What is this, Ishtar II, the sequel? I was surprised that this movie turned out so well. Warren Beatty took a lot of chances here, and he hit the jackpot! I would even say that his rapping is great (in the context of this film). Halle Berry was beautiful as usual, but she also played her part well (she also plays her part well as usual, not implying that she is just a pretty face). I thought I would cringe when Warren had his Adrian Brody moment, but when the inevitable happened I didn't even barf! Amazing! This film was made in 1999, but it also pertains to 2008. Warren Beatty will be a mile high in Denver at the DNC. Also hobnobbing will be Spike Lee. Wish I could be a fly on that wall. Spike Lee WISHES he could've made Bulworth (maybe he doesn't wish he made it, but I think Bulworth makes the points that Spike tries to make a lot more successfully).
