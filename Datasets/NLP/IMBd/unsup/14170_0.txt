A surprisingly good remake of the 1968 George A. Romero classic, directed by make-up effects artist Tom Savini, making his directorial debut.<br /><br />Seven strangers barricade themselves in an isolated farmhouse while cannibalistic zombies walk the countryside. The heroine is stronger, the violence and gore are more frequent and disgusting, and the zombies are ugly, to say the least.<br /><br />Sometimes characterized as a scene-for-scene remake, those critics should open their eyes a little wider because the end was completely different from the original, as was the beginning -- also taking the second paragraph's points into consideration as well.<br /><br />Good job, Mr. Savini! George A. Romero also wrote the screenplay for this one, too. Yes, Romero and Savini make a great team!
