I honestly cannot say I liked this movie. I appreciate what it is, which is a genuinely creepy movie shot in 8 days on consumer-grade digital video by one of the masters of Japanese horror. However, what I cannot appreciate is the disregard for character development or practical story-telling.<br /><br />Masuoka is obsessed with video. He's got his own apartment under surveillance (from within, oddly enough), he carries a small camcorder everywhere he goes, and he seems to be plugged into random cameras throughout the city. And what he's looking for in all of this video is the ultimate in fear. One day, walking in the subways, he encounters a bizarre suicide. The victim sees something that only he can which, apparently leads him to stab himself in the eye. Obsessed with finding out what this man saw, Masuoka goes underground. Literally. Underneath the city he finds a bizarre netherworld. And one naked girl chained to a wall. Who may or may not be his daughter.<br /><br />Sounds weird, hunh? Well, it sure is. The use of digital video, cut with even grainier digital video makes for a creepy look, and the sound work is a constant video hum which increases the paranoia and overall strange feeling. But that's really all the movie is. Just a really creepy exercise that never builds into something coherent. Characters pass through with seemingly no rhyme or reason, but they sure are creepy. Many big ideas are pitched (like another dimension of freaky demons leaking over into ours. Ouch!), but they're never taken anywhere.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Shimizu's work, you'll notice his fingerprints all over this. However, this is a departure in many ways. It is not built around the "boo" factor which pervades most of this other work. It is a much dreamier, atmospheric film than his others. It doesn't seem as concerned with scaring as it is with just creeping the hell out of people. Which it does. What is missing is who this guy is. What he's all about, why he's videotaping everything. And maybe a coherent story.<br /><br />But, holy crap, a movie shot in 8 days! Kudos.
