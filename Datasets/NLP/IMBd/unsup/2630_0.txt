I started watching Meerkat Manor about 18 months ago when I turned the T.V. on the Animal Planet and I just fell in love with it, it is in my opinion the best documentary series ever made. Those little Meerkats are some of the cutest animals I have ever seen. My favourite was and still is Flower, she was a great leader and she lead the family with an iron paw (as the narrated said in one episode). It was very sad when Flower died but that is a part of nature and it is no-one's fault not even the Researchers, that was the saddest episode of the whole series. I also loved Sharkespeare and still wonder what happened to him. I also felt sad for Mozart and Tosca when Flower evicted them from the family. Meerkat Manor isn't on here in Australia at the moment but I have the first 3 seasons on DVD so I can watch it whenever I like.
