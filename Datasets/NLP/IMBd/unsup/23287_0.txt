the best thing about this movie is the way it brought sad feeling to me without making me depressed. i enjoyed every minute of it. and i also love the ending, it's simply beautiful. somehow i still sense "hollywood things" in it, but i think it's understandable, considering we're living in a time when hollywood rules the film industry of the world.
