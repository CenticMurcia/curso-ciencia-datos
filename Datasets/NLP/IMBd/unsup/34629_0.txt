Just when you think we're coming out of the Dark Ages, along comes a film like this one ready to fling us back about 500 years or so.<br /><br />I like fairies. What's not to like about fairies - delightful, imaginary, little creatures with wings. Not in this film they aren't.<br /><br />The revelation of the past history of fairies as being malignant creatures of darkness and evil is interesting, and the scenery of Scotland and Ireland looks enchanted enough to really contain fairies.<br /><br />But then the film wanders off into the weeds of ridiculousness, as we meet present day people who straight-facedly claim to have seen the little people. Yes, these people believe in fairies.<br /><br />There is even a scene in a schoolroom where an adult visitor encourages the boys and girls to believe that fairies are quite real. I don't think that is what education is all about. We should be teaching children the truth about things not leading them back into superstition and nonsense. I personally was outraged that something like that was allowed.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars out of 10, only because the scenery is fantastic, and so is some of the artwork depicting fairies and other such creatures, but the position the film takes on this subject is all wrong otherwise.
