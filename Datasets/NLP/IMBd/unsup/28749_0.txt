What a fabulous movie! I just saw a screening of it (with a bunch of other actors and writers) and the whole place burst into applause at the end.<br /><br />Tilda Swinton is amazing as the White Witch. Her cold, evil gaze could freeze anyone.<br /><br />I loved the kids - especially the little Georgie Henley, who played Lucy. Liam Neeson as the voice of Aslan was suitably majestic and comforting and grand.<br /><br />It was beautifully filmed, and I felt Narnia was perfectly realized.<br /><br />Looking forward to the movies that will follow.
