I don't know whats worse. Putting an explanatory voice over in a films beginning or writing a dialogue that sounds like that actors are appearing in a serious Bergman-isch stage play. I think I have to go with the first. VO's may serve a purpose but more often it makes you feel like the film makers think your a complete idiot.<br /><br />This film is, as you might already know, based on the work of Jan Guilliou, well-known Swedish writer. The three novels about Arn and his adventures has been compressed down to two films. This leads to some cinematic problems, as always when you do this. Arn - Tempelriddaren is high paced and the scenes are short and leaves you with few moments to think. Take my word for it, you will be better off with the novels, which are, not amazing, but quite good. But I would, personally, recommend the writer's contemporary work.<br /><br />Swedish films depicting the dark ages or such historic times live dangerously close to being really cheezy. Those of you that have seen The Brothers Lionheart (1977) or Three Suns (2004) know exactly what I mean. 'Lionheart' is storywise really good, but other than that very cheezy. 'Suns' are actually so bad I won't even comment on that one.<br /><br />Considering Arn - Tempelriddaren (and it's sequel) is the most expensive Swedish film production ever you could understand the producers nervousness about pushing the envelope. The movie depicts several religious themes, most clearly the violent clash between Christianity and Islam but also the clash between domestic Swedish Christianity and the medieval swedes. It could be depicted so much more darker and realistic, now it becomes a little Mickey Mouse Club. A little too much politically correct and edge-less. Even if I don't like it, this move is quite understandable considering the many, many contributors and their different agendas.<br /><br />Heads up, though. The fighting and the battle scenes are ironically one of the best things I've seen on Swedish film. It's gritty and fast paced and bloody. Also, the scenographic, props and wardrobe division deserves a gold medal because thats beautiful work! The movie leaves much to wish for from its sequel but if you like well done fighting scenes and don't care much for story or acting - then, my friend, giddyupp!
