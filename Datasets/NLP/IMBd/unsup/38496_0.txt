I've only seen about a handful of these "Masters of Horror" episodes so far, but I must say that if there is a worse addition than "We All Scream for Ice Cream", I hope divine intervention dissuades me from ever sitting through it. Figuring this one was worth checking out since director Tom Holland ("Child's Play" & "Fright Night") is credible enough and William Forsythe is always cool - but unfortunately this thing is just downright derivative and dull. It kind of deals with concepts similar to "A Nightmare on Elm Street" and "It" - a mentally challenged ice cream vendor clown is accidentally killed after a prank involving some punks kids goes horribly wrong. Years later, he's back to get revenge, using a new generation of kids as pawns. There's some sort of unexplained voodoo thing going on with human-shaped Popsicles which causes the adults to melt (like ice cream) when their child bites into it... This method of murder gets boring right from the first time it's shown in the first few seconds and Forsythe's performance is nowhere near as creepy as it could've been. Him and his frosted truck are seen way too much and the end showdown includes some of the most laughable crap I've seen lately. The only real redeeming thing about this was the hot-tub scene where a pedophile redneck melts all over the place.
