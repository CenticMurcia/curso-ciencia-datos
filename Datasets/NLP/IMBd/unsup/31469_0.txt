Set about 450 years into the past, Agreed, this movie had what it takes! Beautiful sets, amazing photography, awesome music and a very talented cast. However, too many good things come with a few problems. The problem for "Jodha Akbar" is its own director - Ashutosh. No complaints about his story-telling skills - He definitely is one of the best directors out in Bollywood. But, with a film like "Jodha Akbar", Ashutosh failed to carry it on from where he left it, with a film like Lagaan!<br /><br />When asked, in an interview prior to the release of this movie, Ashutosh said that 30% of this movie is historically accurate and 70% is his fascination. Watching this movie made me realize that if someone had to come up with a fantasy after enormous amount of research, it surely can't get any worse than this movie. <br /><br />Where do I start spelling disaster?: How about those hundreds of shots in the movie which will give you a "YashRaj" effect. How about omission of facts for entertainment? <br /><br />"Omission of facts" - oh boy, Don't I sound like one of those who helped this movie get a ban in Rajasthan! Oh yea, this movie ain't no documentary - Yes, but then why on earth would you advertise it with a title that has to do with Akbar the Great! Why have a story line that tends to talk about what Akbar did as a 13-year old? Why all the fuss about those battles which were historically relevant? <br /><br />Hrithik is an amazing actor. As much as I like him for his acting talents, I can't help being nit-picky: He does a commendable job in uttering all of the well written dialogue, however he did struggle to spell out more than a few of those Urdu words in the way they are supposed to be spelled. Too much eye-blinking! and raising of eyebrow - that is too much of Hrithik and less of Akbar. Yes, none of us knew how expressive Akbar was, but if I were 400 years old, I would be more convincing if not expressive. Aishwarya is one of the most beautiful women in the world!: Women who get better with age! Thankfully she showcased her matured acting skills and I am glad that I didn't get to witness any of those weird facial expressions she owns. Kudos to the master - A.R.Rehman and his team: Brilliant compositions! Background music is the second intense thing after Hrithik's acting, that keeps you engrossed.<br /><br />Finally: <br /><br />Yes, this movie is a commercial movie. Yes, it casts Hrithik as "Ideal Akbar": Akbar, who wasn't. Yes, it doesn't care to mention his two other wives and his harem! Yes, you should go see this movie if you prefer watching historically irrelevant movies oozing with "Bollywood Cheese".
