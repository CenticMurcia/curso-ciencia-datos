Going into this film I really wasn't expecting much. The scene with the photographer and the two lumps of stupid posing for him only served to support my expectations.<br /><br />The concept was completely retarded, which in and of itself isn't enough to kill the movie. Most Sci-Fi Channel movies are ridiculous but incredibly fun. This isn't that fun. The acting is terrible, with the actors either being too intense or seeming like they just don't give a crap. The special effects aren't much better. The up close attack scenes are laughable. You can see it's clearly a rubber head. And the recycled Jurassic Park raptor screeches are more than a little distracting.<br /><br />I was most disappointed in Bianca Lawson, who did a wonderful job as Kendra during her short run on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It saddened me to see her in a movie like this.<br /><br />In all, not the WORST movie to come out of Sci-Fi Channel, but in no way a great movie by any stretch of the imagination.
