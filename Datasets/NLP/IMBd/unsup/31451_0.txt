How good is it? This movie means everything to me. It's the most perfect horror viewing experience you'll ever have. The whole trilogy is great, but I have to admit this one's my favorite. Part one is a pure creepy and extremely violent exploitation horror film. Army of Darkness (the weakest of the trilogy but still pretty good) is an awesome horror/adventure movie, with more laughs and less scares. Evil Dead 2 Dead by Dawn stands right in the middle, just where it belongs. A perfect mix of comedy and horror! I remember the day I first watched it. I was with two friends. We rented it at our local video store in the early afternoon. I laughed, I got scared, I enjoyed every little second passing by the screen. We watched it four times. Since then, I never stopped watching it. It never gets old. I never get bored. The performance by Bruce Campbell (Ash) is still the best I've ever seen in a horror movie. No wonder Sam Raimi is now directing the Spiderman series. This guy's a genius! The music is excellent, and the atmosphere... what can I say? An awesome movie is an awesome movie. If you never ever watched this film, I order you to turn off your computer right now. Life's too short not to see Evil Dead 2!!
