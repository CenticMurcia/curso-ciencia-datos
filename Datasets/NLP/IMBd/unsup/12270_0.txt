Marc Connelly co-directed and penned this adaptation of his play, based on Roark Bradford's stories of "Ol' Man Adam and His Chillun'", about Louisiana Sunday School youngsters imagining a fanciful Heaven of fish fryin', choir singin', and the Lord God Jehovah performing miracles--including the creation of Earth to drain off all the fermentation! "De Lawd" creates man and woman, but is soon displeased with the way the human race is carrying on, flooding the world after making a pact with poor preacher Noah. All-black variation on Biblical stories might strike some today as a stunt, yet the gloss and professionalism of the Warner Bros. studio is in full evidence. Lots of good humor and intentionally broad strokes make the holy teachings vivid and entertaining--and still their message comes through clearly. "De Lawd" likes his ten-cents cigars, and a little liquor is OK, but He wants to see the folks in church on the Sabbath and not gambling or messing about! Highly enjoyable movie-making, with a hypnotic edge that touches the viewer and tempers the exaggeration in the acting and writing. *** from ****
