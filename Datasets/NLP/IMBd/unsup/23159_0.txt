Things that were great: # Genuine Comedy. I laughed out loud on many occasions. # No Hidden Agenda. # Amazing music. Different genres of Indian music were used. I was pleasantly surprised with the use of Indian Classical Music to accompany Todd's (read Toad's) introduction to the poverty that surrounds his unknown friend/consultant. # Portrayal of India is very real and genuine in many of the scenes. # Acting was superb. Many actors did a pretty good job. I am surprised and glad that the director did not go for a big name in Bollywood for role of Asha. # No boring slot. I did not get bored even for a minute. # Holi Scene - This was done very nicely. Journey of surprise, scare, introduction, involvement, enjoyment, accomplishment, peace - all packed in very few minutes. I loved it. <br /><br />Things that were not-so-great: # Real call centers were not shown at all. Some of the campuses are state-of-the-art. Some offices may even be better than their counterparts in USA. # Holiday in Goa. Could have thrown in more caution and scare in this. This is still a rarity and a very unconventional/unacceptable thing to do in India. Most won't talk about it and would be uncomfortable to even watch it in movies let alone doing it. # How do you find so many English speaking people in a village. You would have to screen hundreds of people to get 15 that could work in a call center. # Scene about breaking the news to agents about closing Indian call center was done very lightly. # How do you run a call center on a roof with an Indian wedding in progress near by? # Did construction work at call center ever progress?
