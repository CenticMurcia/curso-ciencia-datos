Kisna is an interesting movie, complete with great acting,story, songs and action. It is a typical Subash Ghai movie- A love story set against the backdrop of a chase. The story is set in 1930s and 1940s. It is about the family of a British Governor of an Indian province . He is non tolerant towards Indians, but his wife and daughter love India and it's people.The daughter makes best friends with the house hold servants son, and in later years this blossoms into love.Typical problems of pre independence India follow(Frowned upon by all parties concerned-The British, The Indian Royalty, The Families and the Villagers). There is the usual Indian masala of love triangles, action, chase, family drama etc. I would recommend anyone to see this movie ,if not for anything else than the acting of Antonia Bernath and the great songs.<br /><br />It is not a great movie, but it keeps you engrossed through out.<br /><br />7/10
