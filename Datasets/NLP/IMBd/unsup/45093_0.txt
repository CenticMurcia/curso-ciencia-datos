The producer(s) of this film (I use the term film guardedly) obviously had not a prayer (and maybe no intention) of turning out anything even resembling a movie film. So why did they do it? A tax write-off by investors? Come on. This movie was the most disgusting, boring, poorly-acted, poorly directed, devoid-of-screenplay, insulting movie ever made. I had a screen pass at BBuster and decided to try it. I hoped the long odds might pay off. I have never shut down a movie this quick before in my life (5 minutes). Dumb and dumberer was Oscar material by comparison.<br /><br />I think the lines were made up on the fly. The director was flirting with the makeup girl. The grips were doing the directing.
