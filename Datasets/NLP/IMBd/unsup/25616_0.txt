Before I watched this movie I was actually excited on watching this comedy/documentary movie. However, I was led to a big time let down. I am a Mexican-American and I was thinking it was going to be a movie that jokes about our stereotypes, but it was not like that at all. It was based more on how "upper-class white" people heavily depended on the cheap work of illegal immigrants. The movie classified most immigrants of those who are very loyal and humble, and at the same time they appeared to be very weak with no character and their main purpose was to serve white people. Point is illegal immigrants are people and they do have feeling and are not just personal slaves. They do get mad and have other feelings. They also talk mess about their boss, like most people do, behind their backs. I felt that this movie did not give this illegal immigrants that chance to show that they are also people.<br /><br />Even though there is still a lot of racism out there, they showed most white people as racists whom are helpless without an illegal immigrant doing cheap labor. I am not white and it might be true, but white people are people, they can easily adapt to changes in their environment. There are some white people that do cheap labor not all white people are rich.<br /><br />One last thing that i strongly disagree with this movie is that what if there are not Mexicans around there is still a whole bunch of Central-Americans and South-Americans who are always classified as Mexicans. If you eliminate the illegal immigrant Mexican you still will have a lot of illegal immigrants of different places of this planet that will do that cheap labor work. Is not just the Mexican who is the cheap labor illegal immigrant in this nation. Finally, disregarding the rest, the movie was not funny, and I didn't even seem to get a chuckle at that. If you want to see a way better comedy movie about illegal immigrants I recommend you to watch Born in East L.A.
