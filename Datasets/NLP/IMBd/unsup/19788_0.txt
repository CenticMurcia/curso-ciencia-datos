Michael Rooker plays Father Vassey, a troubled priest who seeks personal redemption by hunting down and destroying a demon before it can unleash Hell on Earth. Following a trail of death and destruction to the sleepy town of Grand River, home of stigmatic teenager Chris Hatcher (Kevin Zegers), whose pure soul is vital to the creature's success, the pistol packing priest teams up with a local sheriff (Shawn Thompson), a veterinarian (Leslie Hope), and a crazy hobo (Tony Todd) to try and foil the evil creature's plans.<br /><br />But with the townsfolk succumbing to the demon's evil influence once the sun goes down, they have their work cut out for them...<br /><br />The UK DVD of Shadowbuilder, directorial debut for CG FX artist Jamie Dixon, comes in a day-glo pink case with a poorly rendered image of a multi-horned creature on the cover; reasoning that the film couldn't possibly be as bad as the packaging, I decided to give it a watch.<br /><br />Hoo boy, was I ever wrong!!! Dixon might be adept at manipulating pixels, but his directing skills are virtually non-existent, and this iffy demonic horror, based on a short story by Bram Stoker, is a joyless mess of botched ideas, incompetent storytelling, and ham-fisted editing that no amount of CG effects can save.<br /><br />In short, it's utter garbage and definitely one to avoid.
