Even as a double feature this DVD isn't worth the rental. Both movies were bad with little value. The first one Wiseguys vs zombies was as cheap as they come and somehow got chosen to be on this set with another bad offering Meat For satans Icebox, the second half of the feature. Bad acting in both movies. MFSI looks like it was filmed with home video equipment and had the worst music ever. WVZ had little more to work with but it look better and the music was good in points. Meat had better gore scenes and had nude, but not very pretty ones. I'm just going to stop buying movies from Troma. They are always releasing bad movies and I am surprised they still have fans.
