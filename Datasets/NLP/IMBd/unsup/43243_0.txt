This "movie" made me laugh even though it wasn't meant to be a comedy (I think). It is so awful, it shouldn't have been allowed even on the TV. The characters in the film can't act, and they get in stupid situations facing a bunch of ants. Come on, they used a shotgun to shoot at the ants, a SHOTGUN! And when a guy jumped off a barn, he said "Ahh! I broke my leg!" and he starts running off. The ants even took down a flying helicopter, a little extreme, don't you think? The only good thing this movie's for is to show film makers how NOT to make a movie, and it would also be a good comedy about making fun of other bad horror movies.
