We saw this film in a screening down at the film society. Loved it. This film is an excellent comment on the sick media world. Quite dramatic and brutal in the first part, warm and funny in the second. Full of mad ideas. A prankster movie and at the same time a political statement on the brainwash. Is it comedy? Drama? I don't know. Does it matter? <br /><br />Definitely worth seeing. I also really loved it, because it's so different from the standard European art-house flicks. More fun, more diverse, crazier. A raw film. Moritz Bleibtreu, the male lead, seems to be one of Germany's finest. Camera is doc style, hand-held, but never nauseating.
