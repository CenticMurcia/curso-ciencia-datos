Misses the mark and unmemorable. Jumping up and hitting one's head on something is mildly amusing once but it happens a lot in this film and gets tedious. Likewise, two strangers (one attractive) falling over and getting entangled just as the ugly party's wife or husband appears - a tedious clich√©, and there's a lot of it here.<br /><br /> Sid James, Hattie Jacques and Charles Hawtrey are greatly missed and although the others try to make good the deficiency the film just doesn't get going. At least Ian Lavender in a minor part was wasn't tempted to reprise Private Pike. My favourites in this film - Bernard Breslaw and Peter Butterworth.
