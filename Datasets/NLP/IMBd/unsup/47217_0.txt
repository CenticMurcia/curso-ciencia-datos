Wow this movie was a total head scratcher.Firstly I'd like to point out the cast is a bit off.Not only in who is in it but who the star is!And after watching this and checking all the names in the credits and checking here and yes googling it.You know what I have no idea at all!But it's not Carter Wong or Lau Ka Wen aka Chia Yung Liu aka Lau Kar Wing.It's the cop in Turkey yes Turkey who's a karate expert but no names in the credit fit?Anybody see this and have clue who he is?Anyhow the director of this movie is probably the worst part of it.The action is decent in fact some fight scenes are pretty good.However the story is choppy,the acting weak and the speedup of the final fight scene didn't help at all.Although I give it 9 out of 10 for location shoots!The director was intent on spicing this one up with romance and fun in the sun.And hey watch Bolo run run run!Actually there's too much running in this movie entirely.This really could have been a good movie if not for the director I think lol.Oh and don't miss Carter Wong's extended cameo in the lead role!<br /><br />Oh here's the spoiler there is no Ninja Killer at all!
