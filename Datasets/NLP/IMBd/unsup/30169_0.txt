HBO's critically acclaimed special, "Subway Stories," lived up to most of the potential its high-profile stars injected into it. Based on real-life stories sent in my NYC underground rail riders, I found myself dazzled by the situations people claimed to have experienced. The program was divided into smaller segments, each one a little story. Although you were barraged by scenarios, you could not delve too deeply into each one. That proved to be a disappointment, since some of the stories were much more intriguing than others. The other difficulty in the series was the line between heavy drama and melodrama, and the fantastical elements peppering each segment. Also some of the skits were fuzzy in meaning, leading me to believe that they were aiming too high and forgetting who really rode the subway. It was nice to see Hollywood elite in smaller, more elusive roles than usual. And the subject matter was new and exciting. You'll find yourself studying that subway car a little more carefully to find your own "Subway Story."
