This is a terrible peice of trash. The begining starts off promising, it moves in to a beautifully shot hunting trip, and then pretty much when you get to the crap weasels and stupid looking alien its all down hill. The most surprising thing the the steep grade with which it goes downhill. The ending is literally laughable. Donnie Whalberg is putting it all on the line here at least they could have given him something to put it on the line for.<br /><br />I can sum up this movie perfectly. In the film Morgan Freeman's character says "I'll show you things you wish you had never seen" Basically if you watch this film, thats exactly what you will wish. Theres a pretty simple rule of thumb on this one. If you have to pay, stay away. If you get to see it for free then please, by all means. (mostly for the first 25 mins)
