Great cinematography and quality acting.<br /><br />There is potentially a moving, evocative story here, but the director fails to tell it.<br /><br />The characters motivations are left to the viewers imagination. The viewer must create a back story for the characters, there is none. If the director is explaining their actions, she is far and away the most subtle person ever. We know nothing of the characters in the beginning of the movie and the director does nothing to develop them.<br /><br />A character piece requires insight into the characters. I honestly assumed that I had mistakenly started the movie several chapters into the movie, missing the character definition. I wanted to like the movie, and did get drawn in (mainly due to the cinematography and acting), but was highly disappointed.
