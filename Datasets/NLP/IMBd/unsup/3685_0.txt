Not exactly the best horror film film ever, but miles and miles from the worst. This was absolutely great! I loved it. The family in this film was at it's creepiest, and the chase scene gave me chills. Definitely worth watching for any horror fan. In recent years, this movie was redid, and I might add, severely ruined. Don't watch TCM 03 or the beginning. Watch the movies in order, because rather than get better down the line, they get worse. The first two Texas Chainsaw films are great, and I really enjoyed them. One of my favorite moments in this film was the ending. The final suspense chase, when finally the truck driver shows up, and one cannibal is ran over, then Leatherface chases the girl, and the long awaited ending is near. Bang! He's hit with a wrench, and she escapes. I let out a big sigh of relief at this ending. It really made me feel as if I were in the movie. Tobe Hooper definitely knows how to thrill an audience. I really wish I were alive to see this in theaters, this is definitely a must see!
