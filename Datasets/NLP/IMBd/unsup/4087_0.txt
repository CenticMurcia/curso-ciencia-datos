As silly as those "Beach Party" movies from the mid-'60s could get, at least they had energetic casts and funny screwball comedy. "Roller Boogie" does have a curly-topped Linda Blair, but backs her up with a bunch of long-in-the-tooth teen-nobodys and awful disco music on the soundtrack. Jim Bray, real-life skater and debuting romantic lead, works well with Linda and they have a few engaging scenes, but the romance is so shallowly presented that one can only scoff, and the film's big climactic chase is botched by sloppy editing. This one is truly hell on wheels. <br /><br />*1/2 from ****
