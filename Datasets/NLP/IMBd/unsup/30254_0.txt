I just saw a sneak preview in a movie theater, and my heart is still pounding. I cannot find the proper words to express how...incredible? amazing? powerful? majestic? surreal? this film was. I know I viewed it at a particularly poignant time in my life, as a young, hopeful female student in our nation's capital, but I feel confident that this story can affect any and all people fighting (or hoping) for rights, freedoms, or dreams they've yet to achieve. That's the beauty of this story. These passions, this reason, this extreme intelligence and eloquence, and die-hard persistence...it simply cannot be written off as feminist, or irrelevant, or history. No one can ignore this, and EVERYONE can be changed by it.
