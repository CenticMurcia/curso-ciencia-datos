Growing up till this day 3 Ninjas Kickback was the weak link in the series but that movie is a blessing compared to 3 Ninjas high noon at mega Mountain.<br /><br />It does have some star power and familiar faces such as Jim Varney, Loni Anderson, Hulk Hogan, and Victor Wong but not even that could save this film.<br /><br />The plot has the 3 ninjas saving a theme park from the bad guys. Not a bad plot because it introduces some fun scenarios. And some of the training and fight sequences were pretty creative, just hard to get into considering how flawed this movie was.<br /><br />The previous kids who played the ninjas obviously had outgrown the roles by the time this was made but the casting was terrible. Nothing against the replacements, its just they didn't fit the role.<br /><br />I'd suggest any of the 3 ninjas films except this one.
