Great and touching comedy that has probably the best performance by Rachel Weisz ever and that's a big thing to say considering the fact that she's great in pretty much everything she does. She simply steals this movie and grabs your funny bone with a funny and charming performance that will leave you wanting more. Mark Ruffalo and Adrien Brody are also great as the brothers who try to con her and Rinko Kikuchi is great as our generations Harpo Marx's and her performance is great as well. The ending is a bit out there but the movie itself is well worth it and will make you think back on what was going on.<br /><br />And one more thing, to Lawson from Singapore, Rachel deserves her Oscar for "The Constant Gardener" and this film solidifies it. She an amazing actress.
