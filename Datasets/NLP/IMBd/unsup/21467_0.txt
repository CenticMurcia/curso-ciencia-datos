TCM showed this movie immediately after Craig's Wife (this movie is a remake of that one) and I loved comparing the two versions of the same story.<br /><br />The Harriet in Harriet Craig is wonderfully evil and Joan Crawford was perfect in this role. I loved watching her spin her lies and was very curious as to just how her house of cards would fall.<br /><br />I was not disappointed. The scene where Walter confronts Harriet about her lies was brilliantly played by both Crawford and Wendell Corey. Scenes like this are often melodramatic or just not believable. In this movie, however, Crawford and Corey hit it out of the park.<br /><br />With just her eyes, Crawford showed Harriet's inner panic at being found out and her desperation when she realizes that Walter knows the truth.<br /><br />Corey was fantastic at showing the mixed emotions of Walter Craig. He was able to convey anger, disappointment and even love all at the same time. The moment when he found out that Harriet had lied about not being able to have children was just heartbreaking. I felt Walter's pain in that moment.<br /><br />My only quibble with this movie is Joan Crawford's hair. I know they were going for a severe look, but it was truly awful.
