Call it sick, twisted, bizarre or what have you, but I call it brilliant. Not because it is well written or animation genius, but rather it is an exact parody of life. Like the chicken, forced to be "programmed" by a wall of televisions, we are all stuck with the billions of programs our monopolistic cable providers choose for us. Piped into our homes, our creativity sits on the shelf while we down popcorn in front of the bluish glare of the glass boob-tube. Sure, there are a billion programs to choose from, but they follow a pattern of acceptability that thinks for us so that we don't have to.<br /><br />Robot Chicken breaks the mold! It isn't ashamed of anything! It makes us think! It reflects life through the animation of toys Â– real life that non-thinkers shrug away from. And the low-budget animation is perfect in the sense that it doesn't detract from the message. And every episode include brief animation snippets that smack you in the face and make your brain change course.<br /><br />This show should be winning tons of awards, if not from Hollywood then, no doubt, from human rights groups!
