This film is so boring that you will probably want to turn it off half way through, should you be so unfortunate to watch it. Think I'm exaggerating? I wanted to turn it off, but sadly I'm one of those who has to finish a film once I've started watching. The idea behind it actually sounds quite cool - cat food being made out of human bodies, which gives the cats a taste for human flesh. Sadly they didn't do the idea justice and the film turned out to be a bore-fest. There is very little gore, and when the corpses are ground up all we see is them being put into a machine, and a pink pulp coming out of a nozzle. They re-used this scene several times throughout the film to save on budget. Avoid this if you're looking for an entertaining film because you won't find it here. It's not even entertaining enough to pass the time, not even "so bad it's good".
