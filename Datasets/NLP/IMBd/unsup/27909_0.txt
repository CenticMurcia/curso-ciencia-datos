Happy Gilmore is probably one of the funniest movies since this day. I truly recommend a lot of people to go see this movie. This is Adam Sandler's best film and it sure will be for a long time. The humor of this film is outstanding. At it's best!!! Golf has never been better although Caddyshack might be a little bit better than this but I'll tell you that this was great. Norman McDonald played excellent as Shooter McGavin. He was so funny. " I eat sh*t like you for breakfast."<br /><br />" You eat sh*t for breakfast"<br /><br />" No!" Omg that part was just so funny and also when Shooter brags it's funny. I also love Happy's dreams and Chubs was great to with no hand. I love this movie and I hope you love it to.<br /><br />10/10
