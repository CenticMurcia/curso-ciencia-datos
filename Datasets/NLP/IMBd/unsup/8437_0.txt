One of the most neglected aspects in appraising DAMNATION ALLEY is Jerry Goldsmith's tough and tender score, which seamlessly links together the plot, makes the frightening opening sequence even more frightening than it really is -- and sonically wallpapers over much of the less than stellar acting and action sequences.<br /><br /> Sadly, the soundtrack to Goldsmith's panoramic score has never been released (shame on Fox!) and only a sequence has been recorded (by Goldsmith, on a CD entitled FRONTIERS for Varese).
