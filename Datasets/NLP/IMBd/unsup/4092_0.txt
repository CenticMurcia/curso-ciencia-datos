This was made to cash in on the then hot roller disco fad. Rich girl Terry Barkley (Linda Blair) inexplicably falls in love with skater Bobby Jones (Jim Bray). Then she, Bray and their friends try to stop nasty businessman Thatcher (Mark Goddard) from tearing down the local roller disco rink.<br /><br />I realize a lot of people find this campy and fun. It's campy alright but I didn't find it fun at all. I was mostly bored. The script is pretty awful--full of idiot characters (all of Brays' friends act like Three Stooges rejects) and stupid dialogue. There are continuity problems galore too--notice how Goddard and his goons look pretty clean after being pelted with tons of fruit. As for the acting...what can you say about a movie where Linda Blair gives the best performance? The acting on display here is abysmal. Bray easily is the worst but (in his defense) he was chosen to star at the last minute. No wonder this was his only film. Also that feathered hair does him NO favors! He also looks pretty unattractive (but that's just my opinion). Goddard is pretty good though--he (wisely) underplays his role. This gets a 3 because it isn't totally unwatchable--it's definitely better than "Xanadu" and the opening sequence with the kids skating through the streets IS fun. Also I admit--I LIKE some of the songs and the skating/dancing was actually pretty amazing. Years ago Blair was asked out of all the bad films she did what was her favorite. She said, "Roller Boogie. It was good for the kids." So I didn't like it but it is harmless.
