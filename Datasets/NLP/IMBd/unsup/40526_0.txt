I have seen many bad movies in my time, this one has to be at the very bottom of the list.In every aspect it hits the GONG. It was originally a German film in 1997, same writer & director..He redid his original, which was no where as bad.<br /><br />In the celluloid piece of garbage nothing works & here he has two actors who have proved there worth. Tim Roth & Naomi Watts are just awful.<br /><br />The 2 nasties are revoltingly bad & one of them has done much better work..<br /><br />I do not normally mind sleaze but here it is beyond the pale.<br /><br />Ratings * (out of 10) 14 points (out of 100) IMDb 1 (out of 10)
