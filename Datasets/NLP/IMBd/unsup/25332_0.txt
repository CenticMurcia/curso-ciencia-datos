Well I haven't really come across something like this before. "Route 666" tells the story of a cop and his buddies who retrieve a witness meant to testify in L.A. However, while on their way, aside from a group of men wanting to kill the witness, they attempt a supposed shortcut just off of Route 66, which inevitably spells death.<br /><br />Along this road lies a secret hidden for years. A small chain-gang that had, several years before, been in an "accident" lie dead in a small graveyard just along-side this road. Their spirits still walk among those roads and those who dare step out onto the road shall meet with these wrath of these long-dead criminals. In addition to that, a secret connection lies between one of the gang members and a certain traveler...<br /><br />If you have nothing else to do and you're in for a good "B" movie, take a look at this one. It has its faults and some of the effects aren't up to par with the 21st century exactly, but it's still worth a look.
