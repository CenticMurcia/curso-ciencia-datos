The name of the game in Ghost Game is that 11 people on a reality TV show must all live in a hunted location. The last one to stay with out running away wins. This year's location is an abandon war museum ware a horrific massacre took place during a time of conflick. What they don't know is that in this game they might be gambling with there lives.<br /><br />Ghost Game has a few moments that might make you jump but over all this is just another quickly made d-rated horror movie with all the same clich√©s. We have a group of young people in there twenty's, we put them in a creepy location that always dark and by the end they all die off in horrible ways. What I just describe is what most d-rated horror flicks in the U.S are like. This one the same only now it's from Asia.<br /><br />All the characters are not interesting. Our lead character is the girl who won last years show. She a stereo typical star for a horror movie. A young hot girl who over all is nice and innocent. At the end it's even reviled the only reason why she on the show is to get money to help her sick mom. The other charters just come off to me as stereo types you find in a class room. We have the nerds, the super hot snobby girl, and the prankster who has a crush on the snobby girl.<br /><br />The story is confusing. At first I thought I could follow it until it neared the end. All 11 players are to stay in what used to be a military base ware the commanding officer ruthlessly slaughter prisoners. When facing his own down fall he shoots him self in the head. Years go by and a strange death is caught on camera showing three guards just falling dead from shock. This gets the attention of the producers' of the show Ghost Game. So our 11 heroes must play a survivor rip off but our lead finds her self stallked by a Ghost of one of the victims. This slowly leads to strange events happening all around the others. That's until it lead us to the big unspeakable horror that lead me scratching my head at a pure lost. The final Climax takes a couple times to watch in order to get what happen. Even after getting it still leads to one vary stereo typical ending for a stereo typical horror movie.<br /><br />The ghost in Ghost Game are okay in some scenes but in other (especially near the end) I did not find them that scary at all. In fact I found the final ghost to be humors looking because the actor was just trying to hard to look scary.<br /><br />Its not the worst horror movie I have ever seen. Near the beginning there a few creepy scenes and I will admit there were some good moments that I enjoyed but that not enough to save it.<br /><br />I supposed this is good when you literally have nothing ells to do. There is some, but not much entertainment value in it. I for one however will guarantee you that once you see this movie you will forget about it in a week or even less. So I would not even recommend renting it. Its one of those movie you wait to come on TV (and if there really nothing ells good on) to watch out of pure boredom.<br /><br />That why I give Ghost Game a 4 out of 10
