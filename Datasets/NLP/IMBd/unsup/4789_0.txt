After Heather Fasulo sets fire to the front yard,her parents decide that boarding school is the best thing for her.As the story unfolds,we learn that Heather has an extrasensory abilityÂ–not only can she hear the trees in the forest speak,which is cleverly presented as symptomatic of paranoid psychosis,but she can balance a pencil and small rocks in gravity-defying positions by simply concentrating on the them.Enmeshed with feelings of alienation and hormonal upheaval,her powers are a source of enormous anxiety until sympathetic school mistress Ms Traverse explains the nature of her special powers. However Traverse is not what she seems and has a sinister plan that involves the evil tree-dwelling sprites and the entire student population."The Woods" is loosely based on the tree-dwelling female Dryads of Greek mythology.It's also highly influenced by "Suspiria",Serrador's "La Residencia" and "The Evil Dead".In "The Woods" Lucky McKee of "May" fame has fun with some dynamic CGI effects for the tree limbs,roots and branches that keep sleeping teens in stasis until the latest teen offering has been snatched from her bed,but the effects seem out of place in a film that's kept fancy visuals to a minimum.Still this surprisingly subtle horror is worth a look.8 out of 10.
