Any fans of unintentionally hilarious action films are in for a treat, this film was a delightful, and I mean DELIGHTFUL piece of cheese.<br /><br />As I picked it from a bargain bucket there were 3 things I spotted that gave it away; Ice-T for one, the tag line "Kill the president, kill the hostages, escape. A great idea!" which isn't really much of a great idea considering it doesn't mention making it away with millions in bearer bonds, it just promotes violence which is wrong for children, and Eric Roberts' smirking face.<br /><br />When I sat down to watch it within minutes I was hooked, Ice-T angrily slamming his hands on the table like a bullied 5 year-old, Eric Roberts firing a harpoon into a block of wood, and some INTENSELY bad acting. <br /><br />The quality in the film only continues to decrease, inexplicable decisions from the bad guy, good guy and a concerned looking Madsen (just watch his face when 3 S.W.A.T. guys plummet from the rooftop...) do nothing to help matters, and neither do the questionable stunt men, plot line, or fight scenes.. or special effects... or dialogue.. actually come to think of it how did this even get made? I propose there is some sort of official ratings board (of which I am a member) that decides if a film should get a stamp of abject disapproval, the likes of which this film thoroughly deserves.<br /><br />Things to watch out for:<br /><br />Eric Roberts - Watch this man like hawk. He gets battered by a woman (nothing against women, it just makes it funnier) and his stunt double is NOT CONVINCING.<br /><br />The Flamethrower Bit - Out of nowhere the main bad guy produces a flamethrower, and just when you think you might get to see Eric Roberts in flames, it produces a measly flame which reaches about 2 feet, not exactly ideal with Roberts at the other end of a 30 foot (at least) corridor.<br /><br />The Dummies - Two top-class dummy sequences here, the aforementioned S.W.A.T. team receive a spray of bullets from the bad guy with moments of abseiling from a chopper and we get to see 3 very competent looking dummies, twisting and turning the air this way and that.. One appears to have a leg straight out 90 degrees from this body, possibly part of S.W.A.T. training but don't quote me on that<br /><br />The second dummy sequence is the bad guy's death (not that that can count as a spoiler since it was clearly going to happen, this is the 'Nature of Die Hard' for crying out loud!). This is probably my favourite of the two. It requires THOROUGH analysis with your slow-motion button. <br /><br />The bad guy falls backwards from the top-floor, but sadly we aren't with him for his whole flight. We catch up with him probably only 50 or so feet from the ground. Looking like a ventriloquist's dummy with a bad wig (even better when you've seen the guy we're supposed to believe it is), it sort of hits the ground and crumples, and for the few bittersweet moments we see the dummy on the floor it looks more like a pile of clothes and hair than anything in the rough shape of a human, bones completely broken or not.<br /><br />So yeah<br /><br />Apologies for anyone expecting a proper review I just felt the need GET MY FEELINGS OUT THERE, no matter how incoherent.<br /><br />10 out of 10!
