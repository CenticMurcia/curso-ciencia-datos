o9 my god how bad is this movie the plot: a space cop that was reduced to a 30 cm guy with a normal woman cop try to destroy some demonic toys!!!the big problem isn't the plot(ok its really awful)but the film himself. The toys are not scary are not well controlled and doesn't appear too much at the beginning of the story. Instead of them we see the past movies from the dollman and a other 30cm girl. Run from this movie away. I've seen it because it was on tv at 2 am and i didn't feel sleepy (too much pepsi)Better wacht child's play if you wanna see some evil toy!!!
