You see movies all the time that are controlled by the flashbacks that show events not seen in the movie to explain the plot. But it is extremely unusual to have a flashback of someone actually having a flashback which is shown at least 10 times during this film. When i first witnessed the horror that was Strike the Tent, i was looking for a good film to watch with my friend, but what we got made a fourth grade spelling bee on film look exciting. From the costumes to the extremely bad dialoge, this movie just plain sucked. The only thing that kept me from throwing this disc into the fireplace was that it was funny beyond belief. There were no southern accents, and the soundtrack made me constipated. The one believable character had three lines and was a 70's comedy actor, but all in all, this movie made me watching my lame Cousins Barbe movies look like a life saving activity. Save yourself from this atrocity and if you can write your local critic and tell them of this bag-o-crap from a long line of bad Thinkfilm pictures.
