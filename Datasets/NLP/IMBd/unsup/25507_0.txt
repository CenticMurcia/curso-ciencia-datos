I first read Jane Eyre the novel many years ago and have since watched various adaptations of it but never really found one that I thought captured the essence of the book and portrayed the characters as I imagined them. That was until I was lucky enough to see the 1973 version. This one is perfect, exactly what I had been looking for. The 2 main characters are wonderful, Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack simply are Rochester and Jane. They bring the novel alive and every scene they are in sizzles! There is so much to enjoy in every scene, you never tire of watching it. This is far, far superior to the 1983 version with Timothy Dalton, it goes to show that newer versions are not always better. It's simply a classic!
