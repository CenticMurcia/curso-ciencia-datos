This was a perfect, awesome action movie that I thoroughly enjoyed, right up to the ham-handed political message that the director felt compelled to put in. I don't care how you feel about gun control (I'm against it, so I guess it made it worse) but the way it was put in it didn't even fit, and was, in my opinion, completely unnecessary. I enjoyed the rest of the movie after it, but that part kind of killed the buzz for me. Why do directors feel they need to make the audience think, or that they have to get some kind of message across? Especially when you're putting a message about gun control in a movie like this. Other than that, one of the best action movies I've seen in a long while.
