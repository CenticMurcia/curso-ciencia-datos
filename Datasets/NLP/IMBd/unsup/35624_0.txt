I had heard a lot about this movie. Its songs became the most popular, especially " One ,two, three..". "This world has slept" gave a break to legendary singer Mukesh's son -Nitin Mukesh. <br /><br />Laxmikant-Pyarelal's music was inspired by some tune they had heard a marriage band playing, so it is said. But the movie itself is a disappointment, for I expected cinema. It is a typical Hindi film with songs and dances. A rare thought provoking moment is when Suresh Oberoi's character questions Munna, about escaping responsibility. Having said this , Anil Kapoor and Madhuri Dixit have given their best performances. Their performances lift the movie, give life to some exaggerated scenes. It is probably Chunky Pandey's only well acted movie.<br /><br />Suresh Oberoi also plays his cameo well. But the film didn't deserve all the accolades it got.
