This film is as subtle a kicking a house brick with your toe, and deeply dishonest.<br /><br />The comedic characters and events are from the era of the Keystone Cops; completely over the top. This film is from the genre of farce verging on melodrama, complete with music to make sure we know what we are supposed to think. It should have been honest enough not to pretend to anything more complex.<br /><br />The life challenges faced by the characters are real enough but the plot is completely clich√© and obvious.<br /><br />The central characters are simplistic and are black & white (she all good, he all bad). The dialog is from the day dreams of a fourteen year old.<br /><br />The fact that a film uses actor Hugh Grant does not make it sensitive, uplifting or funny. The fact that a film contains sex and slapstick does not make it a romantic comedy.
