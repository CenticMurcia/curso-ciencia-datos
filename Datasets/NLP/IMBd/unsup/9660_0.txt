I saw this film in some kind of strange language that wasn't English. The subtitles were on, but they appeared to be in the same strange language. The subtitles were also very confusing. They had upside down question marks and exclamation points. And if they're going to make a film be in a different languages, they should at least use CGI to make the mouth movements match up with the actual language.<br /><br />I would give this one star, but it gains one more because the girls had HOTT breasts. Like honestly, if you could only see them without any clothes on bouncing around their God-given glory, this film would get at least a nine, despite whatever confusing, made up language it was in.<br /><br />In summary, "iAy Papi!"? What the hell is that? But the boobs were nice. Therefore, on my ratings scale of red to blue, red being Shallow Hal and blue being The Sum of All Fears, this film gets a gets Puce Minus.
