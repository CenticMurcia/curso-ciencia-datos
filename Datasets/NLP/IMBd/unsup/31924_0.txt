With a cast of Robert Shaw and Christopher Plummer, Peter Shaffer's powerful and touching stage drama of Pizarro and the Emperor/God Atahuallpa is grippingly brought to the stage. Pizarro, fighting his way from nothing leads an expedition to find gold for himself and the king of Spain. He finds and becomes intrigued with the Inca, living son of the Sun god and promises freedom in exchange for a large chamber filled with gold.<br /><br />When the deed is complete, the Spaniards refuse to accept Pizarro's promise and intend to put Atahuallpa to death. The Inca convinces Pizarro that if he is put to death he will be brought back to life at dawn of the next day by the Sun god. Pizarro, a man without much faith has come to respect this man and wants badly to believe him. Shaw's performance is, as usual, superb. Christopher Plummer is simply magnificent as the ruler of the Inca Empire.
