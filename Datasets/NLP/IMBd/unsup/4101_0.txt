Boy - this one scared me - because - it shows what can happen in a blink of an eye. by the way - from personal experience - I found out what canhappen in the blink of an eye. So - I can relate to this film - very much so. Very good story line - very good casting - very good acting. It was very unnerving to watch him suffer - real psychological suffering - can almost fell it yourself. It seemed so very realistic in its filimg & acting - scared me no end. Often wondered what others would think of this movie. I enjoyed it immensely and hope others did to - wish they would write their comments - however - my only concern is - haven't seen it since mid 1950's - have never forgotten it. I only wish it could be shown again - this time - I'd tape it & watch it a lot. Please advise ml2348@att.com
