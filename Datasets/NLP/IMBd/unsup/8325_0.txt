The Attic Expeditions was a superb film, from first time director Jeremy Kasten. I was first interested in this film because Seth Green was starring in it, but i got a lot more than i bargained for. I am literally speechless about this film. It is a wonderfully written script with characters that engulf you in their world. The plot is full of twists and turns, and really makes you think. Make sure to be awake when you watch! The movie doesn't make sense until the last scene of the movie, so don't give up. I wouldn't recommend the movie for younger viewers, considering it deals with adult themes. There is nudity, swearing, drug use, violence, gore, and sexual scenes, along with some things that would just freak a kid out.
