The fact that I keep going to Sadler's films is the victory of advertising over experience -well the fact that my ticket was free helped too. If you didn't like his previous films or if you don't generally like having your intelligence insulted don't go.<br /><br />The same crude jokes, the same life affirming naive clich√©s, the same incredibly unlikable main character, the same predictable ending. <br /><br />I generally like Kate Beckinsale and Christopher Walken but here they don't worth wasting 2 hours of your life.<br /><br />Take the film's message without having to watch it: do not waste your time, seize the day, saviour any moment, do something better with your evening: clean your house, wash your car, talk with your family, don't go and watch a film that you have already watched in thousands of different and better versions.
