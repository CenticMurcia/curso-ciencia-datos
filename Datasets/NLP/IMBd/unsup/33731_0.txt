The first impression which is going to be created in viewers' minds is that why is this film named "Matchbox" ? Yeah, it is true that all the film's actors are angry. Does that mean that the film should be titled "Matchbox" ? If the same logic is applied than its name should have been "red tomato ketchup". There is no clue to this in the film. Greek cinema is known because of masters like Angelopoulos, Pantelis Voulgaris etc. For those who wish to explore more of Greek cinema, Yannis Economidis' film "Matchbox" would come as a great shock.It is with firm conviction that I state that I am yet to come across any world cinema film in which the actors do nothing but hurl the best of filthy abuses on each other. This does not constitute a drawback for the film as it has its own virtue. One cannot term this film "low budget" but as it was entirely shot in the two rooms of a house, it can be assumed that the producer has not spent mega bucks for it. This is an ordinary Greek film which viewers would not like to remember for the rest of their lives.
