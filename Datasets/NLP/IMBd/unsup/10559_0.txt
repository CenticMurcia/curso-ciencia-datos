I actually registered an account with IMDb JUST so I could comment on this movie. I never actually thought I would say this in anything but jest, but... I am dumber for having seen this film.<br /><br />The gunfight scenes are anything but exciting, with the actors staring out into space with pained expressions.<br /><br />The time travel details were screwed up on multiple occasions. The focus was solely on SFX at the expense of a coherent theory of time travel. Folks, you don't have to get time travel right, but if you're gonna try, then stick to your own rules.<br /><br />The soundtrack was strange to say the least. Yes, some movies can pull off an odd song at an unexpected time to great effect. When you try to do it throughout the film, it just becomes sloppy and confusing.<br /><br />Poor acting, horrible science, bad directing and confusing soundtrack... This movie takes a fun premise and turns it into a painful experience.
