Broken Arrow is a solid action film with equally impressive performances from both John Travolta and Christian Slater. The film is directed by John Woo. He's a popular Hong Kong director the man behind films like Face/Off, Paycheck, and Mission Impossible 2. John Travolta and Christian Slater are great in their roles as Deakins and Hale two friends turned adversaries after a training exercise goes awry.
