This hysterical animated short is a classic that can be enjoyed by anyone who has ever had a dog or a family or even if not, anyone who enjoys a good laugh! The animation isn't that of a top blockbuster Disney, but it's cute and the family is just odd enough to make most people feel at home. <br /><br />The main story is a small dog dealing with two kids, the kids' parents, and their overall household. When the dog is left at home after indulging in too much of Mom's new recipe while the family takes in a movie, the story gets interesting. It's a small cast of characters, but each is memorable in their own right. <br /><br />My only concern is that it's not long enough! It leaves me wanting another adventure of this interesting and somewhat misfortuned canine.
