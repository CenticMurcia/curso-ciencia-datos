I remember the week I saw Casablanca and Play it Again Sam for the first time. Casablanca so authentically over the top romantic and Play it Again Sam so authentically and reverentially funny. Now about 20 years on multi-region DVD players allow us to see Play it Again Sam in the UK. What a great comedy film! Usually I am not too keen on Woody Allen, but in this one there is wonderful humorous dialogue matched with some Jacques Tati class silent movie style comedy. I have had to watch the "Blind Date" chapter twice tonight to see him wrestling with his jacket, dropping the girl's coat and finally flinging the Oscar Peterson album nonchalantly over his shoulder - the rest of the cast are biting their hands to control themselves. Makes fun of, and honours Casablanca at the same time.
