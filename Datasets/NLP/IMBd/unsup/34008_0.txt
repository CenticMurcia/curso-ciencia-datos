This movie, in its attempt to be clever, ends up being just plain ignorant. It has absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the original, and as fantastic as was the original, this detestable sequel is just that bad.<br /><br />Four years later, what does she remember? Apparently, what she does ~not~ remember are those acting lessons. I highly suggest that you watch the Exorcist, the director's cut; skip this one, and move right on to Exorcist 3.<br /><br />You won't even be able to tell you've left part 2 out of the cycle, that's how insignificant it is. It's really THE worst sequel to any franchise, even considering Batman Forever and Pet Semetery 2. Just watch Exorcist: the Beginning, Exorcist 1, and Exorcist 3. You won't even miss Exorcist 2.<br /><br />EDIT: I have to say that with the addition of the two prequels, this installment makes MUCH more sense now. It does now have a place in the run and should be viewed by franchise fans as a more necessary chapter of the Exorcist story. I'd give it a 6.4/10, now.<br /><br />It rates a 1.1/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
