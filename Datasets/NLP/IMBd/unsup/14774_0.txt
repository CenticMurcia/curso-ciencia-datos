To be honest, this is one of the movies I thoroughly enjoyed when I first watched it. Of course it is a simple and predictable story, but the actual transformation did it for me. The three boys are awesome. The way Melanie Griffith and Ed Harris fall in love with each other and how they find together despite unfavorable circumstances is nicely staged. Michael Patrick Carter is able to assert his character's emotional condition, his expectations and dreams, which puts this movie above the average family story, despite the hackneyed elements it may have. The happy end is indeed rather corny, but hey, the movie has a message, it is entertaining and funny. Thus you may watch this movie with your entire family.
