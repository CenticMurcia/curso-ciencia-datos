This is Norwegian film in a nutshell, stiff and unnatural dialouge, an introvert main character and a pretentious story filled with angst...This movie is about regret, guilt and the ability to forgive each other, to make it all too obvious most of the story involves a church.Long scenes without dialouge that are meant to be sacral and beautiful but turns out just irritating and predictable.<br /><br />I just can't understand the mainstream critics who swallows this pompous and totally boring piece of ....!Just because the movie deals with serious issues involving God and forgiveness and so on it shouldn't be praised as the work of a genius.But i guess there will always be a bunch of pseudo intellectuals which enjoy these kind of movies with their red-wine.<br /><br />If you want too see a good Norwegian movie, see FATSO, it's underrated and it didn't go well with the critics...maybe because it's filled up with good dialouge, exiting characters and spot on observations, but i guess that doesn't appeal to the elitists in the media.
