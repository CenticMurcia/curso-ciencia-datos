what a freaking' awful thing...all the greatest most important matters from the book where missing. all the fantastic scenes, the excitement, the mystery....who's responsible for this awful crap?<br /><br />and who is in charge of casting? the girl who played LB was bad bad bad. she made me want to leave the theater. and the main actors have been better too. but maybe that's because the script is so awful u'd have to have super acting skills to make it remotely likable. <br /><br />the only good thing was the actor playing pf. slughorn. great job and the only reason I didn't leave half way through.<br /><br />I love the books and up to this been quite o.k. with the movies. but this was just too bad. trying to make money. well the original story sold well. nobody cares who's into whom and what not. <br /><br />congrats on destroying a fantastic tale.
