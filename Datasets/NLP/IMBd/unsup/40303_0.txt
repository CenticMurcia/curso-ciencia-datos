Although I do not question that IMDb fans love movies, I sometimes think their critical faculties have fallen through a crack in the floorboards. I grew up literally 200 metres from the place where Veronica Guerin was shot, so the issue and the politics have been common currency and the story was well known to me before I belatedly saw this film. The cast and locations were pretty convincing, as was sense of tawdry, sleazy amorality which is the reality of crime. But the real crime here was the woeful miscasting of Cate Blanchet, and this I think, is why the movie never really took off at the box office.To any Dubliner, or indeed Irish person, her accent is just wrong, and given that she is surrounded by native Irish actors of some account, her pain is palpable. She chokes on her lines, and is never steady in any scene. She doesn't seem to have a real relationship with anyone, and is like a ghost in the world of the living. I felt genuine sympathy for this talented actress. All in all, a waste of a fine cast,and a fine leading lady.
