So this self indulgent film about absolutely nothing of any import has just wasted two hours of my life ! Set in the deep south of 1950's America the plot is as transparent as it always is in a film were nothing is always about to happen. The plot is actually so thin you will have guessed the ending & how we arrive there quickly. In my case in around 90 seconds of the opening titles. Guess what - A middle aged black club owner, with relationship crisis & broke, has to keep his 'wooden shack' / club open. Oh the unbearable excitement of wondering whether he will succeed or not! Along the way we are treated to an array of cardboard cutout characters that include the local racist, white sheriff, [ so original ] the habitual enigmatic - oh no could it be a ghost to be laid character, who in this case is a sort of blind Alan A Dale & a young itinerant, rock n' roll, electric guitar playing musician who blows into town.<br /><br />It gets worse! The dialog is at best a series of cheap, stilted diatribes fed through the mouths of comic book, deep south, 1950's black / white stereotypes. I must presume the script was written by an intellectual midget with a range of English & clich√©s rarely seen outside of Batman comics.<br /><br />Then we have the music. A poorly performed mishmash of blues going' into rock n' roll, a genre not even favoured in its own time. Long dead it should have been left that way & certainly not resurrected with stiff, stilted, zombie like musical performances.<br /><br />Lastly we have the director, one John Sayles famed for being involved with such mega blockbusters as Bruce Springstein - The Complete Video Anthology & that other great masterpiece, Passion Fish. That says it all really Lets be honest - if you have 3 brain cells or more, have enough understanding of English to know that batman should actually be two words not one, have an intellect equal to or better than a nematodes, and a musical taste beyond thinking my My Ding A Ling was a good rock song, well then you'd have a more stimulating experience watching Thomas The Tank Engine!
