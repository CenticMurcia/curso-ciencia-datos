a complex, non-narrative 20+ min. experimental film, "pandora's paradox" has a really <br /><br />interesting set of scenes, like a woman giving birth to a giant, bloody toe, an unforgettable <br /><br />sex scene, and its impossible climax, which makes this film really stand out. very inventive <br /><br />camera shots and effects are used, and it's one of the very few "art films" that make you want <br /><br />to watch it over and over!<br /><br />some may say that "pandora's paradox" is weird and inexplicable, but if you have an open <br /><br />mind, you'll quickly understand the general feeling of the film: betrayal, an urge for<br /><br />normalcy, and revenge. this director can go places!
