this show was better then that 70's show any one who had made bad comments really did not watch the show loved it wish they would bring it back. if they ever do i think they should do a reboot and leave it on for people to pay attention and get to know the characters and probably needs some fresh episodes i enjoyed it when it was on and i hope to see more of it in the future. i hope they will also bring in more characters and add some other locations if you haven't seen the show they have not released a DVD but they have the episodes floating around on the internet you can find some on you tube in parts and in torrents but some are in poor quality i recommend that you watch the first 4 episodes and to get others to watch it maybe if fox notices the increase in fans they will do a reboot
