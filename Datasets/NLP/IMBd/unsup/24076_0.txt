I saw this silent Hitchcock after seeing about twenty other Hitchcock, all the famous ones from the forties, fifties and sixties. I expected that without sound, not even Hitchcock could create suspense, but I was wrong.<br /><br />The Black Lodger's star Ivor Novello has a great appearance in this film and sure his scary way of looking adds up to the tension. The moment in which he looks out of a window, and a shadows in the form of a cross is over his face, is masterful.<br /><br />The Black Lodger was Hitchcock's third movie, and his first masterpiece, as I understand. Shortly afterwards he made Downhill, also with Novello, and a good movie too, especially the ending.
