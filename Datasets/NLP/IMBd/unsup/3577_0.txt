Since this movie came out in 1997, it has aired at least once a year, and I have yet to miss it. It's just that good! This is one of my favorite movies... Christmas or otherwise. Mimi Rogers gives an incredible performance. This is a feel-good movie. The writers of "The Christmas List" are incredibly creative. This movie just fits together wonderfully. I absolutely recommend this movie.
