I found this movie intense in a way I can't seem to find anymore. Too often, I find myself dosing off in the middle of the latest block buster only to wake up grateful that I missed it after hearing the disappointment experienced by those who stayed awake. This movie had characters that pulled me in and made me want to watch. I felt I knew them and had to know what happened to them. I laughed, cried and celebrated life's victories and cursed the curves as the plot took us through good times and bad. I smiled at the end when I realized that in the movie, as in life, we all end up exactly where we are meant to be, no matter how rough it can be getting there. The music also did an amazing job of being original and matching the mood/moment.
