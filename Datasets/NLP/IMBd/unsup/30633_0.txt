I was so hesitant to see The Pursuit of Happiness for one reason, this movie looked like an incredible tear jerker, just from the trailer I was nearly crying. But my friend and I had been hearing incredible reviews about this movie, so we decided to suck it up and see the movie today and we were just blown away by how amazing Will Smith's performance was. He and his son were just so incredibly heart warming and really reminded you of the important things in life. I was so touched by Chris's story, he was so determined, this movie makes you wanna go out and achieve your dreams and to never let anyone tell you what is right and what is wrong, what you can and cannot do.<br /><br />Chris Gardner is a struggling salesmen trying just to make the rent, buy food, and take the best care of his son that he possibly can. When his wife leaves him and his son to go get a better life, Chris is left on his own, but he wins an internship at a stocks broker company that is very competitive. Against incredible odds, he just pulls through the ultimate lows of life and keeps his head up with his son by his side. They become homeless, living in hotels, homeless shelters, and even a cruddy subway bathroom! But Chris holds on to his ultimate dream of being happy and giving him and his son the life they truly deserve.<br /><br />This movie in every way possible is perfect, it was so brilliantly made and just so inspiring. Will Smith better be nominated for an Oscar next month! This was an incredible performance and his son was just so cute, I guess talent really does run in his family. :) I would highly recommend The Pursuit of Happiness this year! It was a beautiful film that makes you feel like you can achieve anything you truly put you heart too, I just wish I brought more tissues! <br /><br />10/10
