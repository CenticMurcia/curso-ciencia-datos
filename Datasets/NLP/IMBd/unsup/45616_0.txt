I am sure this will be an unpopular review, but I really did NOT like this movie. It wasn't just because it was EXTREMELY violent (though it was needlessly graphic) but because I just didn't care about the characters and the script lacked finesse. In other Kitano films I have seen, such as Kikujir√¥ no natsu, Sonatine and Zatoichi, there was violence (particularly in the latter two) BUT there was also a certain likability of the main character--even when he was not a "good" guy. In addition, the movies abounded with wonderful little moments and extra touches that gave them charm and color (such as the idiot gangsters trying to shoot things off each other's heads when they got bored at the beach in Sonatine or when the weird guy in the diaper kept re-appearing in Zatoichi). But in Violent Cop, there were few, if any, interesting little touches--just Kitano beating the crap out of EVERYONE! He made Dirty Harry look like Captain Kangaroo! In fact, he was SO over-the-top, that you couldn't help but wonder WHAT police force would keep him one the job. Even the KGB or Nazis would find him a liability due to his MINDLESSLY violent tactics. In other words, such an out of control nut couldn't last very long on any job! I do NOT recommend this movie for kids or teens--or even adults for that matter. All violence and no style make for a poor cinematic experience.
