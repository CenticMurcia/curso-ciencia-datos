I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It really did capture the Balkan temper, passion and mentality. What I did not enjoy is the sudden transition to a tragic end, but nonetheless it deserves to be there. The main actor was great and there could not have been a better choice for the actress. The soundtrack was fantastic and added so much value to the movie (especially the transition to the last scene on the train), even though it contained really only 2 songs. I sometimes find myself re-watching that scene a few times. Also, the minute silence over Tito's death scene is masterful. Much props to the director for leaving me with two of the greatest scenes i've seen for a while. Overall, a must watch movie.
