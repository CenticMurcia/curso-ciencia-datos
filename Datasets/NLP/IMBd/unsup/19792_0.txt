Anyone who is in college or has gone to college knows what it is really about and it's not getting a good education. It's basically just getting drunk and trying to sleep with as many girls as possible. The fun thing about drinking is if you drink enough you end up waking up with a few strange girls and having a horrible headache and temporary loss of memory. However, when they are talking to their friend poking fun at him about having a drinking problem over drinking 11 or 12 beers a night, that's sad. We all know like 20 guys and 1 or 2 girls who drink like that. It's cool how the friends play basketball and work out go get drunk on any night, cause that's how my life is. And we all know a guy who is a gym freak and talks about nothing but lifting weights but who is not really built at all. Oh yeah, this movie has nudity in it so I give it a 7. Catch it if you are up late and there's nothing else really on.
