Putting Sandler and Nicholson together in a comedy was a great idea. Making it about anger management where Nicholson is a psychiatrist with a short temper himself and Sandler is his neurotic patient with repressed anger is a great premise. All in all however this movie fell short. There were some funny scenes but the plot was forced, and the ending was overly cheesy, well over the top, and a huge stretch. It also seemed to be indecisive about what type of film it was trying to be and this weakened its calibur as well. As a huge fan of Sandler and Nicholson in a variety of genres I can appreciate a good turn-your-brain-off comedy as well as a more defined romantic comedy, but this one seemed to fall somewhere in between and it really didn't work. All in all however, it was enjoyable, despite its many fall backs. I'd give it a 6.5 out of 10.
