Oh dear. This really is a sad indictment of the franchise film. I suppose it was inevitable, even unsuccessful films get sequels these days, particularly those of the horror genre. The only real good thing to come out of this was to spur William Peter Blatty into helming what would become the third Exorcist film. Despite the films best intentions, it makes little sense in relation to the original classic. The Exorcist II contains a few interesting scenes and shots but ultimately relies on the none too impressive climax to engage the viewer. The pace and direction is often slow and disjointed and I must confess to laughing out loud at a couple of unintentionally humorous passages of dialogue.<br /><br />I might say for Exorcist devotees only, but then anybody who truly appreciates the original will want to steer clear of this sequel. For morbid curiosity only.
