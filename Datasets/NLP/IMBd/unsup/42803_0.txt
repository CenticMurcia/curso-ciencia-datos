This movie sucked. Not all is as it seems, as the plot blurb says. What it seems to be is a really good slasher flick. REALLY GOOD! Until the police get involved. I won't spoil it for you if you are desperate to see it-- no wait... yes i will *******spoiler alert********<br /><br />how is it possible that she is the killer? unanswered questions to ponder: 1. how does her being the killer explain the piece at the beginning where the killer is masturbating with the head of the previous kill? <br /><br />2. where the hell does the truck come from? they drove the car to the farm house<br /><br />3. why have the man chasing the brunette, after it is revealed to be the blonde girl? <br /><br />4. how did the blonde get all bloodied up if she wasn't actually fighting anyone in the greenhouse?<br /><br />5. at the beginning, we see the blonde stop the car in the forest, and at the end we see the brunette. having the point of view switch when the cops see the video was not only jolting but bad movie making, because there was no reason beyond confusing the audience with facts that can't possibly fit the film thus far. <br /><br />had we not seen the killer at the beginning, i would have bought the whole thing. had we not seen him masturbating with a head in the cornfield, this movie would have kicked butt. as it stands someone screwed up, huge.<br /><br />don't waste your money or your time. pvp
