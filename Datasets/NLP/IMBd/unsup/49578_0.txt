If you have read the book by David Baldacci then I highly suggest that you DO NOT watch this movie!!!! The book was absolutely marvelous and intriguing and I have read it twice. Unfortunately, I watched the movie afterwords and was incredibly disappointed. It seems that Clint Eastwood has to always be the number one in all of his movies. To do that they have totally written out the main character of the book! (In fact, Eastwood's character died halfway through the novel.) This is one of the worst book to movies that I have ever seen! My sister, who watched the movie then read the book also expressed displeasure at the plot changes in the movie. I admit that if you haven't read the book you may enjoy the movie only because you don't know how good it could have been.
