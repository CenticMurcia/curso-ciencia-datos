Man! A horror movie with Lou Gossett Jr. (THE Lou Gossett Jr.) and Richard Karn (Al from Home Improvement)! Must be great - or at least good.<br /><br />I think not. There's some terribly annoying ex Scotland Yard detective who seems bent on pissing OFF everyone involved (audience included).<br /><br />NOT a real good movie. I actually had to watch this one in two shifts. Far too much bad movie crammed into one movie slot. It is honestly a not-real-good movie.<br /><br />Many times when there's a good deal of activity on screen, the camera work is such that you can't see much of anything going on. Almost, not quite. But it doesn't add to the suspense at all. Just frustration.<br /><br />Finally, why are there so many people with different type of accents. Why is it that when you could MAYBE understand what one of them was saying, the volume dropped so low that it wouldn't matter anyway.<br /><br />If they'd have just done what was required earlier, I wouldn't have wasted slightly better than an hour and a half of my life.
