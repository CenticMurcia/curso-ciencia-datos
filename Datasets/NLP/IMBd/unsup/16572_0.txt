I was very entertained by "Something to Talk About." I didn't consider it a big, important movie, I just took it as light fun. I have read some of the other comments, and it seems not everyone reacted to it that way.<br /><br />I thought this was a great cast. Robert Duvall and Gena Rowlands were fabulous, as was Kyra Sedgwick. Dennis Quaid is beyond adorable - and there is one of the flaws in the film. How could you trust that man for one second and be surprised when he cheats? The other flaw is how he managed to be in college with Julia Roberts, unless she was a child wunderkind. As for Julia Roberts, I prefer her in this kind of film rather than heavy drama, because I don't care for her very external acting. She was more believable in this and, especially at the end, she sparkled.<br /><br />I personally loved the ending, and for all you who wonder, I absolutely think they get back together. I think infidelity hurts and yes, it maybe even hurts enough that, in the heat of anger, you might try to poison your husband. I also think you can get past it, and I think this character did.<br /><br />I agree that often, when women cheat in films, it's somehow justified and the man who cheats is vilified. In life, that's not always true. Life is a lot more complicated than that. Obviously, this was written from a woman's point of view. As I said, I took it for what it was. It was entertaining. I had to think when I watched "Camille Claudel."
