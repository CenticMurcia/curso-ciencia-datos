3 deewarein is one of the best movies I have ever seen. I was so much surprised after watching this movie and my mind still can't let go of the wonderful movie. In bollywood we really do need more directors like Nagesh Kukunoor who have the guts to make different movies. The only minus point of this movie is Nagesh Kukunoor's acting. He is not a bad actor but not in this movie. He shouldn't have acted in this movie. Anyways all in all this movie rocks. My rating - 10/10
