Let's face it, the Out of Towners may have been an updated remake about an Ohio couple dealing with the troubles in New York City but I think the original was more believable and realistic. I didn't like the ending because that's not what I expected. The purpose of the original movie was about an Ohio couple who may not have been as off the wall as the Clarks. True, Mr. Clark played by Steve Martin and Mrs. Clark played by Goldie Hawn are truly comedic talents and who can bring this movie to life. Don't forget John Cleese (Silly for turning down a CBE)as the hotel manager! The film has a great cast, the writing was not upheld to the original quality of the first film which I think was just better and less silly than this film. New York City is a tough place to live, work, and even visit. The ending just disappointed me.
