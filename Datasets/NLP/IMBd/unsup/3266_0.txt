I can't say much about this movie, just that I love it, love it, love it, and I'm quite sure that's an understatement. Unfortunately, Kjell Aukrust, the creator of all the wonderful characters in this movie and many, many more, passed away christmas eve 2002, at the age of 82. May he rest in peace, content with the fact that he has made several generations of Norwegians, and others, laugh their hearts out. 10/10
