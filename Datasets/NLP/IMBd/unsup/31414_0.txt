I've heard from many people that this movie is great, but I avoided watching it because it seemed too cliché for my taste. I finally sat down and watched it. Too cliché? I was right. If it weren't for the great soundtrack this movie would be, in my opinion, utter garbage. This movie has no direction. It lacks an intriguing plot and the characters aren't interesting or likable enough for the audience to care what happens to them next. I've never seen anything Rose McGowan had done before this, besides her minor role in Scream, so I was unaware of her acting capabilities. In other words: I had no idea she was this bad. What's amusing about this movie is that some actually categorize it as 'dark comedy'. I doubt childish obscenities and lines such as, `What is this, night of the living BRAIN dead?' are considered dark humor. What was the character Amy Blue supposed to be anyway, an angst-ridden teen rebel? How trite. No wonder this movie has a following of pseudo Goths.<br /><br />Save your money and pride and skip this flick.
