Very predictable, but entertaining. Dr. Van Tasset(Barry Livingston)is an American expert on chemical weapons, who is kidnapped following a military coup in Iran. An elite squad of the Navy Seals called the "Steel Sharks" are assigned to rescue him. The "Sharks" are led by Lt. Zambroski(David Roberson)and last minute new member Bob Rogers(Billy Warlock), who has doubts of living up to the Seals standards. Capt. McKay(Gary Busey), commander of the submarine the USS Oakland, draws the assignment from Admiral Perry(Billy Dee Williams)to take the "Sharks" to Iran. Van Tasset is rescued, but along with the "Sharks" are captured and held prisoner on an Iranian submarine. Thus comes the expected underwater duel. Very few surprises. I still don't get the prudence of a gun battle on a submerged submarine. Also in the cast: Anthony Griffith, Tim Lounibos and Matthew R. Anderson. I have always been a sucker for submarine flicks.
