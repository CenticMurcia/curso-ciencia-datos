I mean, its not the worst film ever, but it's up there. I picked up this for £1 - yes £1 - at Woolworths and I can honestly say it was worth NO MORE. I picked it up because I like Matt Le Blanc - but not as an actor - and seeing him in drag was, well, disturbing. That's pretty much the only word to describe this movie - disturbing. You can forget horror films which have millions of complaints on the message board for being disturbing - if you really want nightmares, watch All the Queen's Men.<br /><br />They could have made this film so funny - Eddie Izzard and Matt Le Blanc? I expected it to be really, really entertaining and it really, really wasn't. There are about, I think, three funny moments which made me LAUGH, but the rest of it was so SERIOUS - yes it's about war, but it's also about men dressing up as women! If you want to see a FUNNY film with men in drag, go see Some Like It Hot. Stay away from this. If you like Eddie Izzard, then maybe it's worth watching. If you like Matt Le Blanc, don't watch it. If you want to see a poorly done, badly acted, disturbing film - watch it! And finally - if you really do want to see it, only watch it if it's on television or get it online, but don't spend money on it, unless it's £1 or less. Trust me, it is NOT worth it.
