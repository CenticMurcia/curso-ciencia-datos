Saw this with several people. Was recommended. But this movie was really not my thing at all. To really get into a movie like Serpent and the rainbow, I think the subject matter just has to be interesting to people to enjoy this, but even then, I think many will have problems because it is simply to hard to follow and many parts don't make any sense.<br /><br />The movie both meanders along AND moves very quickly(if that makes sense at all), or that is how it seemed to me, not a lot is explained along the way. And though I really TRIED to like it, as it had been recommended to me, there were times it just bored me silly.(many times.) The movie moved way to slow and was quite dull in certain places. Half the time one does not know what's going on and the other half I just wanted to leave the theater for yet another trip to the popcorn area.<br /><br />I doubt I'd have enjoyed this even if it had moved faster but at least it may have been involving for a time. I really didn't enjoy this at all and would not rate it above a 3 or so.Wish I'd liked it a bit more but unfortunately this is the rare movie that my friends' recommended that did absolutely nothing for me.
