The Edinburgh Festival would seem to be an excellent theme for a film, with so much going on in a vibrant, photogenic city. This film, however proves this not to be such a good idea. It is a real mess, it has no focus, instead following several different story lines with no depth or conviction. The characters are ill-conceived and two dimensional, the stories poorly written and clich√©d. All this is particularly disappointing giving this is the same writer/director (Annie Griffin) who made the brilliant TV series 'the Book Group'. The whole film has the feeling that was a rushed affair. Potential viewers would be best advised to avoid this film, instead saving the money towards a trip to Edinburgh to visit the festival for real - a far more rewarding experience.
