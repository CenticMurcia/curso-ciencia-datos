When i went to cinema i was just hopping a teenage film but this film is more than this.. u can laugh and cry at the same time... it filmed a tragedy in Turkey about choosing jobs and exams.... this is nice...Jean Claude Van Damme is the best of course but the movie is better ... There are lots of choises in our lives.. this movie depends on them and it shows that how an exam changes a life and how peaople are just like horses in the race...and how can a person do something for their future and their loves... this movie is really good. if you want to have a good Friday this is your movie.. The musics are good. we heard them in other albums but in this movie they placed in correct places.. especially Nil KARAIBRAHIMGIL is the best with her 18years song...
