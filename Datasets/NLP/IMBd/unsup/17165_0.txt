This movie is by no means good, but I can't lie and say I didn't stay entertained the entire time. Killa Cam'ron directs, writes, and stars in this movie and bring along dip set heavyweights Juelz Santana and Hell Rell. Cam seams to be trying to follow in the footsteps of 50 Cent's 'Get Rich or Die Trying' film. The movie follows Cam's life as he becomes heavily involved in the drug world. Other than that there is no actual plot. The movie looks incredibly low budget and some may find it hard to watch, but if you can look past the shoddy production and 'acting', you'll stay amused. It also boasts songs from Killa's new album, also titled 'Killa Season'.<br /><br />I gave it a 10 squarely on entertainment value. Don't expect Scarface.
