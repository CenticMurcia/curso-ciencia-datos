Original Sin is a disappointing thriller starring Antonio Banderas, Angelina Jolie, and Thomas Jane. For those of you who haven't seen it I wont say anything else about the movie except for the solid acting by most of the cast the movie failed to entertain and left me disappointed. The director does an all right job of bringing this movie to the big screen but unfortunately the pacing is slow and the film could've been a lot better. The only reason I gave this movie four stars out of ten is because of the attempt by the actors and the very steamy sex scene between Banderas and Jolie that really pushes the R rating. If you're a fan of either of the stars than you might like this movie more than me. There are a few twists and surprises you might not see coming but then again you might expect it because I for one did. Despite the talent of Banderas and Jolie who try to bring life to the characters the same can go for Jane who does an okay job with the supporting role he does have the movie itself just isn't that great. The film does have strong sexual content, nudity, language, and some violence so this is no movie for parents to see with their kids at least not until their seventeen or over. Overall Original Sin isn't that good of a movie and you're better off watching something else. Unless your a kid who wants to see Jolie featured in a graphic sex scene and without her clothes on then this is the movie for you. Otherwise skip Original Sin and watch a better thriller that's worth watching more than once.
