Priests, demon-possessed nuns, rape, pedophilia - these are the makings of a good horror film when you add demons and the devil. Will this live up to the promise? Sometimes the concept is good, and certainly Sarah-Jane Redmond and Michael Eklund were good, but the story just didn't go anywhere.<br /><br />There was very little action; mostly just running around and talking. Some characters, like the cops in the precinct seemed to be doing work that was just to explain what was happening, as if they had no other way of doing so.<br /><br />The ending was left up to the viewer and that sucked.<br /><br />No gore, no blood, some puking from a strung out doper, and no boobage whatsoever. I really must have blinked once because I didn't see the nun either.
