Lyddie is one of my favorite books for quite a while now, so when I found the film on video I decided to get it.<br /><br />It really recreates the mood and the theme of the book in my opinion, although as usual some details had to be omitted. Good acting, a beautiful landscape and "on theme" music really add to it.<br /><br />If your are looking for a good family movie which everyone in the family will enjoy, this is one for you.
