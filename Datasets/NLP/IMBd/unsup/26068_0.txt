A hilarious comedy that pulls no punches and is miles away from being politically correct. Not for the easily offended - the girls talk about everything from abortion to suicide - but packed with laughs from beginning to end. You'll be giggling the entire film.<br /><br />The 'girls' are all great, but Jack Plotnick's portrayal of Evie in the 1970-ish B-movie "Asteroid" is priceless. I still can't keep a straight face when imagining him trying to say "as-tro-phy-si-cist."
