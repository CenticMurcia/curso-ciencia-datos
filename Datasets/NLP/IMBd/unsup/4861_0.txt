Let's put Annie Hall and Manhattan aside. The Purple Rose of Cairo is a forgotten jewel on the history of cinema. The idea of someone getting out of the screen may sound ridiculous, but Allen wrote the script so perfectly that you can almost believe it can really happen. We can resume the entire film with one single word: Magical. When Allen was at the top of his career, he knew how to print humor, love and drama in a single movie. Points to consider when you watch this film: photography is sublime and music selection is fantastic.It's a film for romantic people and... well for everyone really. Personally, my favorite movie made by dear old Woody. I highly recommend it.
