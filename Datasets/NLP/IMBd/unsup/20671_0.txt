I'm a fan of bas rutten, action men, action dolls, ufc and all other actionized kindred spirits. . . but this movie was absolutely dreadful. From the wooden acting, pathetically stupid fight scenes, mis-timed action in general, and don't even get me started on the weapons. The 'flash' leaving the gun was highly comical at first in an obscure kinda way. But soon became tiresome, and oft, again mistimed. The sound man in charge of syncing the ''action'' with the sound must have been ill on the day of the final cut. If die hard has a rating of say . . . 1000, i would give this film. . . . 57 points, and thats only because ruttens in it as opposed to it being any good. If your going to watch this, don't forget your pillow.
