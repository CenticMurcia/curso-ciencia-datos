Now this is more like it, a D&D movie that people who have played will enjoy and people who have not can understand. The special effects were not top notch but it was to be expected with it being a "B" movie. The acting was actually decent. More character classes than the first,more monsters,more races, just more everything.I do agree with the poster who said get rid of Damodar he's played out. Finally if you have played the game and are worried about watching another mockery of the game you love be assured this will not let you down, watch/listen for all the realistic game stuff. Oh and be sure to watch the special features,there's some good insight to the movie and characters. The movie would have received a 9-10 if the effects were better!
