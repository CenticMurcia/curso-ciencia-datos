This is a low budget and very accurate portrayal of the world inside a big advertising agency. The movie isn't that great unless you have worked in that field specifically as a creative or as an account executive. first time I saw it I thought it was lame but with time and appreciation for independent films I developed a special appreciation for this movie after working at an advertising agency for 3 years.<br /><br />It's a must see for anyone who feels like entering that career.<br /><br />If anyone has a copy or a DVD of this please let me know I would like to buy one.<br /><br />Enjoy
