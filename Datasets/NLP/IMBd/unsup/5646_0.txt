Well this movie is nothing special, I laugh at anyone who says it's the greatest crime drama ever, it's not, it's not even at the same level as "Heat", it's typical offensive Blaxploitation.<br /><br />That about sums up the movie, except not as well known and not as effective as "Heat", Anthony Quinn and Yaphette are mirror images of Sidney Poitier's character and Rod Steiger. Pretty standard blaxplotation. <br /><br />Quinn basically plays a racist police named Capt. Mattelli whose about as racist as they come beating up any black person in his path, unfortunately no one in this film gives him an equal amount of beatings.<br /><br />Kotto as Lt. Pope who is working the case with him involving stolen loot of the mafia from a couple of black criminals. <br /><br />Man all the characters in the movie are truly revolting black and white. Mattelli isn't the only racist cop, and in fact he's a hypocrite racist who is taking money from a black mafia kingpin!!!!! Truly hilarious.<br /><br />There are other racist and corrupt white cops , and for a twist we have some black pimps and dealers who sell out their black partners in crime.<br /><br />Really there isn't too much to say about the movie, it's a Blaxploitation, we all know how this bad films ends.<br /><br />I do get a kick of Lt. Pope slamming the Captain down calling him a racist sob (which he is) and the Captain having the gall to change the subject: "You want my job, don't you!!!"<br /><br />Not really he just wants you to stop being a white beatnik racist.<br /><br />Anyhow only for true movie collectors of this type of cinema everyone else should avoid it.
