And for that you can be glad? Oh no, this has a certain scuzzy charm to it that may be only appealing to bad movie fans like myself, but I think this is a rather fun, if messy, movie. Messy being that it's by Al Adamson so therefore you know it's quality. And what exactly is this about? Well, a mad doctor, he being of the Frankenstein clan, despite his last name (he was adopted?) is experimenting on young folks at the Freak House, which is on the pier at the amusement park. His crazed assistant (as played by Lon Chaney) goes out to collect body parts when he's not standing nearby cuddling his puppy. One of the body parts he's collected is the head of a girl whose sister is a Las Vegas Lounge Performer (with an awesome hair-do) and of course when sister is missing she has to come look for her. She inquires at the local coffee house and gets something dropped into her coffee (LSD?) because they think she's a cop, and after a bad trip she wakes up in Anthony Eisley's bed. They then of course, delve into the mystery when not hanging out on the beach doing romantic things. Dracula and Frankenstein in this are pretty interesting, Dracula has some pretty strange ability to speak in echoes, while not using any visible devices, and he's missing make-up on his eyelids. Frankenstein looks rather worse for wear, as his face looks like it's been in the water too long. And why are they fighting each other? Kind of hard to tell, but there is a final struggle between them toward the end of the film and if you're not familiar with Al Adamson films, they supply their own logic, which is generally incomprehensible to viewers, so don't really worry about it, is all I can say. Just sit back and watch and gape, because you will, and not in horror either. A masterpiece of cheesiness. 8 out of 10.
