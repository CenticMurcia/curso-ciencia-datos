I missed the first advance screening of this film, so I was sure to be one of the first in line for the second one! Anyway, '?' ("Question Mark") perfectly blends a scripted story with completely unscripted encounters to make a film that is definitely the funniest, most offensive movie in the last several years, with the exception of Borat of course. I'm not actually sure how many scenes were entirely real vs. scripted, but I'm guessing about 4 Â– 6. Please correct me if I'm wrong if you wish.<br /><br />Eitherway, it's a great journey movie that reminds me of "Sling Blade" mixed with "Up in Smoke", "Jackass", "I'm Gonna Get You Sucka" and "Pulp Fiction", if that's even comparably possible; and this all coming from a woman who loves offensive, crass humor. Fans of dark, peculiar comedy will definitely be pleased, and unsuspecting viewers will watch this movie with their jaws wide open.<br /><br />I recommend '?' for anyone who wants a complete change of pace when looking for a comedy. Well, those are my comments for whatever they're worth.
