Brick Bardo (Tim Thomerson)teams up with Judith Grey (Tracy Scoggins, from Demonic Toys) to destroy the demonic toys who are trying to bring Satan back to life (Or such nonsense) also on-board is Ginger (Refered to as Dollchick played by Melissa Behr reprising her role from Bad Channels) now Brick Bardo must save his girl and destroy the toys and must not fail. Dollman Vs Demonic Toys is a guilty pleasure for many reasons, the idea is so preposterous and surreal that you end up watching in shock. Also the movie is so unbelievably short that it's impossible to be really too bored and as always Tim Thomerson is fun to watch, that being said there is too much stock footage from Dollman, Demonic Toys and Bad Channels but you never get too bored since there is always something silly going on. Also there just is something surreal about watching Tim Thomerson fight a giant baby doll while rescuing his beloved "dollchick".<br /><br />* * out of 4-(Fair)
