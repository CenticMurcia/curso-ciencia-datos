It is always nice when a movie has a point. I hook to hang your hat one. But when it doesn't, the director should take a cue from the Italians and move from set piece to set piece with the greatest of speed.<br /><br />The pluses: Lance Henriksen, Dennis Hopper, blood, gore, violence.<br /><br />The minuses: lazy story telling, unengaging characters, too much "story" between the violent gory scenes.<br /><br />If you like Dennis and Lance and gore and violence, it's worth seeing if you can FF to the good parts.<br /><br />Otherwise you are wasting your time.<br /><br />One tip to the writer: You don't need "story" if you're not going to have character development. It's like icing with no cake.
