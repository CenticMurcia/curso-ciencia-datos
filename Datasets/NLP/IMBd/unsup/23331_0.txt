The first time they made it when they called it Ferris Bueller's Day Off http://www.imdb.com/Title?0091042<br /><br />Clueless Parents = Dr. Drew<br /><br />Eugene Levy = Me. Rooney <br /><br />The Concert = The Parade<br /><br />Both movies have school cutting, and it goes on and on. <br /><br />The big difference is that in Ferris Bueller, John Hughes managed to capture the essence of teenage angst and create a film that has endured for almost two decades. <br /><br />New York Minute will be long forgotten in half as much time as it's name.
