The Lion King is a great film and the whole family was keen when I rented Simba's Pride. We thought this could match the first. But we were wrong. The story was so predictable and instead of develop the father-daughter concept the crew choose to develop the dull and typical authority father - rebel teen thing. Simba character was completely changed. Nala's too. Simba was carefree, funny, spirited, gentle and was changed into a mean and authority dictator who does not know anything about love. Nala was strong, disobedient, loyal, provocative and was changed into the typical quiet, calm mother who is blindly loyal to her husband and doesn't say nothing at all. Her character is useless in the film. Their love doesn't exist. Their daughter is stupid, spoiled and just cares about herself. Her love scenes with that idiot are just a cheap copy of her parents beautiful and innocent love scenes from the first film. The design and sets are so poor. Nala seems to be wearing contacts and Simba turned fat and orange. Timon and Pumbaa are not funny in this. Some actors had been replaced. The soundtrack is awful (Hans Zimmer is not in this) and the songs are just a copy of the ones from the previous film. And bad copy! (Elton and Tim are missing too). The whole story is just a bad try to imitate the first one. There is a fire, a big fight at the end, a stampede, same dialog, same scenes, even Kiara saying "Ewwww gross!" to grubs just like Jonathan Taylor Thomas. Some aspects aren't clarified and I hope they don't make a follow-up to this with the stupid Kiara who disrespects her own parents and don't has punishment. This film is pathetic and a way of stealing money from Disney fans pockets and just a waste of time. Disney should be ashamed.
