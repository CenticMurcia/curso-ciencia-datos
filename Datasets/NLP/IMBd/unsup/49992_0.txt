This was the surprise film at the Dublin Horrorthon this year and let's just say it was only surprising in that this is all that can be made of horror in Ireland. Firstly, the writer of the film must never have taken mushrooms in his or her life as during one "sex scene" the two unsuspecting teens take mushrooms and proceed to have sex, a noise outside is heard and they chalk it up to it being the "shrooms" taking effect. I understand that it was their first time taking them so that's the writing leeway that they allowed but there is a big difference in taking mushrooms where your entire physical senses are changed and thinking you heard a twig snapping. <br /><br />The only idea of mushrooms that stays with the "plot" after the first forty minutes is the supposed special black headed mushrooms our heroine takes that allows her to see into the future. Boll**ks, I expected the idea of how messed up it would be to have a killer chasing you wile on mushrooms to be the basis of the plot, but aghast no! They don't need an interesting plot when you can just bash together some loud noises to try and scare the audience every two minutes. <br /><br />The main character spends twenty minutes of the film walking around an insane asylum with an axe, that's not an exaggeration. Twenty bloody minutes with nothing happening. There were literally people talking amongst themselves in the audience through sheer boredom.<br /><br />The film has one redeeming feature, and that is the appearance of Don Wycherley and Sean McGinley as the two hicks. I'm Irish and personally have no problem with someone creating a stereotype of us from time to time and I think the exaggerated acting was a welcome relief. No one complained when there were extreme freak rednecks in the likes of Texas chainsaw Massacre or Wrong Turn and considering I believe there are people in this country who still believe in "the banshee", fairy rings and other such insane Carroll's Irish Gift Store endorsed ideas, that it is entirely appropriate to enhance this image into that of the drooling country freak. We've all met at least one, come on, don't deny it. <br /><br />To sum up, this film is in a word, bollo**s. Sorry to use the inarticulate "foul" language and constant air quotes but there's nothing else to go by with this one. It's the greatest waste of money. Take a hint producers, next time you want to give a new starter a chance in the business, make sure the script isn't the largest pile of cow dung to come out since, well, hell I'll just say it, The Roost. Hang on.... cow dung.... maybe that's where.......?
