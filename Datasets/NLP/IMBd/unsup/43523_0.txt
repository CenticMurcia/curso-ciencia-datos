This film is SO Overrated that it just hurts, i didn't get what the "message" of the film is, and neither both of my friends who went to see this thing with me. If Guillermo Arriaga, that snob who specializes on writing pretentious and stupid screenplays where the characters seems to be total idiots with no common sense whatsoever, wanted us to realize that 'love make us do anything' he accomplishes nothing but an endless line of cliché after cliché.<br /><br />There is the proverbial love triangle between two best friends and the girlfriend of one of them, also including the sister of one of the guys. We never get their motivations or a single sense of explanation for their actions.<br /><br />The dialogs are SO lame, so plastic, they are heard like cheesy bits from even cheesier love songs and pieces from a night of heavy drinking and weed smoking.<br /><br />There are characters with nothing to do except get naked in front of the camera (and I don't have a problem with that) but don't try to deceive us by saying that is the 'great performance of their careers'.<br /><br />The only thing I liked about the film, was the music, which was written by 'The Mars Volta'. Out of that, I don't think there was any other thing to highlight about this.<br /><br />The phrase that better describes my reaction to this film is "Guillermo Arriaga you're full of crap!"
