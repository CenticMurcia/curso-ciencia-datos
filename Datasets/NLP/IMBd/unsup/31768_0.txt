It's difficult to imagine a film getting all the way to production as bad as this one. Riddled with torture porn and meaningless editing, this could be one of the most awful movies I have experienced in my life. The plot is incoherent and the acting is beyond terrible.<br /><br />The constant flashbacks and confusing cuts to unknown locations and time makes the film go nowhere fast. I actually attempted to watch it twice just to give it a second chance to make sense, but I got about 30 minutes into it the second time and started feeling sick.<br /><br />It would have at least reached cult status or B-flick glory if it wasn't so tasteless and seriously gruesome. I suggest you save your 2 hours of life and avoid watching body parts falling off strippers, wait I think I may have just made the movie sound good!
