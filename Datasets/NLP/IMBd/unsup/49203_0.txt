This movie is horrible. A really bad version of "Bruce Almighty".<br /><br />Salman is not a good actor. Maybe ten years ago he seemed somewhat appealing. But in every comedic role he plays now, he just seems to suck even more.<br /><br />Priyanka Chopra was never meant to be an actress. She's beautiful, but a big mistake was committed when someone out there thought that models could act. I think she should have just stayed a model. In every movie I have seen that stars her, I'm always disappointed.<br /><br />Sohail Khan? I didn't even know he was an actor until I saw this movie. He's even worse than his brother.<br /><br />I just don't understand why Amitabh Bachchan signs up to play these horrible roles in cheap movies. He's so spectacular. Why doesn't anyone give him a good role in a good movie?<br /><br />The soundtrack wasn't even nice. Rumi Jaffery, I think he didn't know what he was doing. Did he think that this movie was going to be good? I don't even know what kind of audience he aimed for.<br /><br />Just not one of my favorite movies.
