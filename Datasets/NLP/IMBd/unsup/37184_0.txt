This is the worst film I have ever seen and I have seen the Avengers with Uma Thurman etc *and* I have seen Glitter *and* Crossroads *and* quite a few Madonna films. This was awful!!!! This is my first comment on IMDb and I felt I had to do it as a public service. It was entertaining watching it at the cinema as we couldn't stop laughing at how bad it was. It made no sense and just jumped from one random, badly acted scene to another. I loved Christopher Eccleston in Dr Who but I really have no idea what he was doing in this. Don't waste your money seeing it at the cinema or hiring it on DVD. Wait until it comes on TV and you have absolutely nothing else to do before you bother watching it.
