I watched Goal 1 quite solely because I'm a Newcastle fan, and Alan Shearer has a cameo role. However, the movie highly exceeds my expectations for a football movie. I enjoyed almost everything, the emotions, the story progression, the camera angles, the pacing, the acting, blah blah blah. I always thought the story should have ended there.<br /><br />Knowing there will be a trilogy, I already expected Goal 2 will not be as good as Goal 1. Moving to Real Madrid already tell us that the story WILL BE Santiago Munez being proud because of his fame and big money. Since I have already watched Goal 1, I though I should continue with Goal 2, but expecting it will not be as good, but not really bad.<br /><br />If Goal 1 greatly exceeds my expectations, then Goal 2 will be the direct opposite. It turned out to be even lousier than expected. The story never really build up, useless extended footage on the pitch, lousy snow cgi, all the blame is put on Gavin Harris when Real did not score, when they have Ronaldo, Raul, Robinho, Baptista (that's already 4 strikers in 1 pitch at the same time), with super playmakers Beckham, Zidane, Graveson, etc. Then there's a out-of-nowhere long-lost mother and brother, going-nowhere Gavin Harris wine-story, terrible pacing, and maybe a whole lot more story mistakes and good director shouldn't have made.<br /><br />I usually only go to the cinema when I think its a movie that has at least potential of being good, and this is the first time I came out of the cinema confirming I have just watched a lousy movie.<br /><br />I just found out it is by a different director. If I were director of he first one I would be very sad.
