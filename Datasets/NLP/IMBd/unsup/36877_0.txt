I couldn't decide from the first few minutes of the film - is this a trailer for a movie or a very long flashback sequence?<br /><br />The movie listed itself as 71 minutes and became a shade over 60 (on DVD)<br /><br />All the action sequences changed POV so quickly it was impossible to latch onto the story. Character development was practically non nonexistent and the final scene was over so quickly it was a surprise to see the credits. Acting ranged from appalling to not so bad. I should have known in the final fight scene that it was the main bad guy who was killed - that was the most realistic makeup of the entire move !!! And that's saying something...<br /><br />Give me my hour back :)
