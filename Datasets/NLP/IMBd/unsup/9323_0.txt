Definitely one of the worst I've ever seen!! When my cousin called me up to let me know that Megalodon was on TV, I immediately performed an acrobatic run towards the TV room, not knowing that it was going to turn into a total disaster...<br /><br />I just adore sharks, so I love shark movies (even if they're not very good) but this was just total and utter waste of time!<br /><br />Where to begin? The thing that irritated me the most was the rapid movements of Meg. A Megalodon can't move that fast. He should be slow and heavy. But he was wagging his tail like a little fish! How could you dare make a fool out of the coolest fish ever?! <br /><br />The acting, the story building and the ending were way below average. <br /><br />*Spoiler* <br /><br />The guy disappeared after the explosion. Not a single part of his ship could be seen in the crystal clear water after his completely pointless suicide mission, I mean he could have got away easily. <br /><br />And the Meg, broken into two, bleeding like a broken jar of strawberry jam. Ahh, a very very bad scene. <br /><br />The only nice thing about the movie was the final scene where we see the Meg's silhouette under the boat. <br /><br />*spoiler*<br /><br />Overall it was an awful movie with no real shots (all done in computer), no good actors and no interesting or thrilling scenes. So don't even think about watching it.You'll just waste your time.
