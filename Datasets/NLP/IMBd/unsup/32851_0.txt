This is without a doubt the worst film I've seen since Boxing Helena. It really is that bad.<br /><br />I can only begin to imagine why it has a decent IMDb score (friends and family of the film-makers?). I cannot imagine anybody enjoying this film, so banal is the script and so lacking is the plot.<br /><br />After (roughly) the 20 minute mark, the film has become so utterly, irredeemably rubbish that one is forced to consider whether it is intentional and intended as a form of challenging art rather than as a linear film.<br /><br />Terrible, terrible film.<br /><br />Avoid like the plague.
