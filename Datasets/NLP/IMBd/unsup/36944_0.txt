Where should I start? this is probably the question when the people wrote the script. The story just goes nowhere. After the 'so called' comedy "Down to you", Freddie Prince Jr. tortures us with another uninspired, boring, "I have to watch it through the ending just to bash it on IMDb"-Type movie, it's just terrible.<br /><br />It rips off the cult film "When Harry met Sally". The two truly bad actors meet each other several times through the years and discuss every topic from A like relationships to Z like relationships. Nothing else happens in this movie and it's just painfully boring to watch Freddie Prince Jr. and Claire Forlani getting philosophical on each other. The directors actually thought this was entertaining and... funny. The comedy aspect is nowhere to be found. So they hired another terrible actor called Jason Biggs, you might heard of him, no what I'm talking about? Of course you heard of him, these days bad actors are more famous than good actors. He gets even more idiotic than in American Pie and leads to me shaking my head due to his clown behavior because I know there are many people who think that he's funny. Maybe I just haven't kept with the time and it's the new humor that I don't get, even though I'm only 20 years old.<br /><br />It's very predictable how this movie ends, like all the other teen movies, so that the little girls can sleep well at night.<br /><br />I suggest that you ignore this movie at all costs.
