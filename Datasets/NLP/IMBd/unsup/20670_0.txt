OK, who the hell is this Scott Dupont guy? You either worked on the film or you are on crack. If somebody watches the film because of your great review, they should have the right to slice you with razor blades and pour alcohol all over you. This film was horrible, I can't think of a better way to describe it. It amazes me that this crap gets made in Hollywood, you would think there would be better projects out there. I am sure there are worse movies out there, but I pray I never see them. The only thing that stopped me from slicing my own wrists was the occasional laugh I had. Those laughs were me making fun of the horrible dialogue or the God awful script. I could go on and on about bad it was, but I think you all get the point. Don't ever watch this movie and if somebody suggests it, they either worked on it or are on crack, or both. So instead of spending that 5 dollar rental fee and watching the film, give yourself an enema it would be more enjoyable.
