I hated the stage play. So static and talky. But being an immense fan of Margulies' other work, I decided to give the movie a shot. WOW! Maybe it was the chemistry, direction and the ability to have multiple locations, but for some reason, everything fell together and I truly appreciated Margulies' dialogue.
