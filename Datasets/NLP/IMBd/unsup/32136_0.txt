This wasn't the best PPV of course but it was still okay in my opinion<br /><br />FIRST MATCH- SHELTON BENJAMIN & CHARLIE HAAS VS. LOS GUERREROS {EDDIE & CHAVO GUERRERO} FOR THE WWE TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP Nice long tag team match to start the Backlash PPV. Great athletic abilities by Benjamin & Haas & great mind games by Chavo & Eddie. Benjamin & Haas win the hard fought tag team match to retain their WWE Tag Team Championship. After the match Eddie & Chavo steal the Tag Team titles & run backstage. 5/10<br /><br />SECOND MATCH- BIG SHOW VS. REY MYSTERIO Just a squash, nothing special. Big Show wins after a Chokeslam on Mysterio for the win. After the match Mysterio is badly hurt & can't breathe {Because Big Show seriously hurt him during the match}. Suddenly Big Show returns & while Mysterio is on a stretcher, Big Show grabs the stretcher & slams it against the ring post with Mysterio still on it adding more injury to Mysterio. 2/10<br /><br />THIRD MATCH- JAZZ W/ THEODORE LONG VS. TRISH STRATUS FOR THE WWE WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP Not a bad match but it was still pretty boring at some times. Theodore Long tries to interfere at some times, Jazz gets the win after what looks like a Gory Powerbomb sort of move. 3/10<br /><br />FOURTH MATCH- SEAN 'O' HAIRE W/ ROWDY RODDY PIPER VS. RIKISHI Not a bad brawl from these two men but when did Sean 'O' Haire & Roddy Piper form an alliance together. Anyways Sean 'O' Haire gets the win after a finishing move {Which looks like an F-U but you toss them backwards from your shoulders}. 3/10<br /><br />FIFTH MATCH- ROB VAN DAM & KANE VS. DUDLEY BOYS FOR THE WORLD TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP SPECIAL GUEST REFEREE: CHIEF MORLIEY {VAL VENIS} Just like the Smackdown tag team match earlier in the night. It was long & it was a bit more good adding Val Venis as the referee. Val as the referee tries to help the Dudley Boys after low blowing Kane but to no avail gets Chokeslammed by Kane for his troubles. Kane & RVD win after a Chokeslam, followed by a Five Star Frog Splash on D-Von {Another referee came to the match} to retain their World Tag Team titles. 5/10<br /><br />SIXTH MATCH- TRIPLE H, CHRIS JERICHO & RIC FLAIR VS. SHAWN MICHAELS, KEVIN NASH & BOOKER T IN A 6-MAN TAG TEAM MATCH Good 6-man tag team match with all 6 men seriously taking it to each other. After the referee tries to take care of the match by taking Jericho, Booker, Flair & Michaels out of the ring. Behind the referee HHH nails Nash with the Sledgehammer for the 3 count & to get the win. 5/10<br /><br />SEVENTH MATCH- BROCK LESNAR VS. JOHN CENA FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP A good Smakdown Main Event match of the night. During the match Cena makes Lesnar's head busted open which Cena tries to take advantage. But Lesnar fights his way back & nails an F-5 on Cena for the win & to retain his WWE Championship. 5/10<br /><br />EIGHT MATCH- ROCK VS. GOLDBERG It is great to see Goldberg come back. Goldberg gets the great win against Rock after a Spear followed by a Jackhammer to get the win. 3/10<br /><br />This wasn't really a bad PPV, it was actually good. The Raw & Smackdown tag team matches were excellent & the Smackdown Main Event between Cena & Lesnar was very good as well. All in all this was a good Raw, Smackdown joint PPV.<br /><br />Overall: I'll give it 7/10 & a D+
