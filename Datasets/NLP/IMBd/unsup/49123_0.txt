First, I would like to voice my outrage at the exploitation of Vladimir Vysotsky's talent five years after his death for this piece of Reagan-esquire propaganda. Another dehumanization of the USSR, especially when it was it had only 6 years of existence left. Another contrived plot that has nothing in common with reality. If an artist defected, they would not try to pull him back, this would be beneath them. Besides, he is not a government worker or a military officer--- he does not have any secrets that they would want to keep him quiet about it. This is "so-called" art done for the benefit of Reagan's propaganda. If Americans want to see what Russian society was really like, they should see any of the Soviet films(PREFERABLY of the 60's, 70.s, and 80's) found in abundance on this website.
