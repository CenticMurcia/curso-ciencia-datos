Katt Williams is one of the best comedians out there today. He understands how to mix comedic genius with insight like not over spending on your children in with his routine. I've found that some of his comedy gets repetitive over the years but nonetheless, it never loses any of its humor in my opinion. I am anxious for some new and fresh material from him though as some of this was repeated in the Pimp Chronicles on his HBO Special. Check him out on that too. He is a great comic. If you like Dave Chappelle or Chris Rock, you'll really appreciate the comic sty lings that Katt brings to the stage. But one thing - he is NOT a PIMP - cut it OUT Katt!!!! I hope you found this review helpful.
