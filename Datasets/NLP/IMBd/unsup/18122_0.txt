I believe the only reason anyone would have seen this film is because Russell is in it.<br /><br />That was my reason.<br /><br />Russell does well in his role.<br /><br />Love his hair cut in this one.<br /><br />A better script was needed.<br /><br />But, we have to keep in mind, this was not a big budget film.<br /><br />Helen's character Mary could GET on the audience's nerves as well, even though she was a good person & meant well.<br /><br />You could tell why she got on Zack's nerves.<br /><br />Course, she has not done much in her career. When you consider the best thing she ever did was her guest spot on "Seinfeld".<br /><br />By the book, not really exciting action scenes.<br /><br />To be seen only if you are a fan of Russell's.
