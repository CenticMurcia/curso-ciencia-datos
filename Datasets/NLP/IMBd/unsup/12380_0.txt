I'm shocked that this movie and it's cast didn't get more recognition or get nominated for Academy Awards. Terrence Howard, was magnificent in his roll as Darius. He showed TRUE emotions as James' son in this flick. Terrence was so REAL. Hunter Howard who played young Darius in the beginning of the movie -- Is he Terrence Howard's real life son? I believe Terrence has a son named Hunter, and this young man sure did look just like his Daddy. I loved this movie. I'm so stoked to see Terrence Howard finally get the respect and attention he's having now in Hollywood. Terrence deserves an Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal as DJay in Hustle & Flow. If they had nominated him as Best Supporting Actor in Animal, he would have had a good chance of winning it as well.
