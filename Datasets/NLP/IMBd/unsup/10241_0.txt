Its been a while since I've commented on IMDb, the only excuse I have for that is that no film in the past year or two has moved me, or even made me want to comment at all on here.<br /><br />Well I'm back at it and might I say its an uplifting return. "Attack the Gas Station" by Kim Sang-Jin was above and beyond what I expected for a pick off the blockbuster wall. This film takes you from the beginning all the way to the end, at first you really don't like these protagonist, but near the end you want to join their gang.<br /><br />Anarchy is an understatement here, The film centers around 4 guys who have all grown a grudge with society for one reason or another, and one night decide to take it out on a little gas station and the enviorment around that station.<br /><br />This film is awesome, and if you really want to have a good time(Laugh, Root, and Edge of your seat action) WATCH THIS MOVIE.... out of a possible 10, I give it a sparkling DIME!<br /><br />Don't know what took me so long to watch this film, but it was sure worth the wait.
