"Radio Days" is one of the only perfect representations of an era. Woody Allen's script and direction creates a near-perfect view into the "Golden Age" of radio. Several actors have played the "Woody" character as a child over the years, but I believe that Seth Green is the best. Several stories run throughout the film, including a particularly amusing one starring Mia Farrow, who goes through a "My Fair Lady"-esquire transformation.<br /><br />"Radio Days" is basically the opposite of the highly underrated film "Radioland Murders", which shows radio from the broadcast side of things. Both show a more imaginative and idealistic world - a world nearly forgotten these days. This film is truly wonderful, and I'm grateful to Allen for making it.<br /><br />8.1 out of 10
