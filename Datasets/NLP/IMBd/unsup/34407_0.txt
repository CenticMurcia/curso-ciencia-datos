In 1974 Rankin & Bass created a television special called "The Year Without A Santa Claus" that is considered a classic along with their "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" special.<br /><br />In 2006 NBC decided to remake the classic as a live action movie of the week with John Goodman as Santa Claus. My question to NBC is: "Why did you do this?" The movie did not need to be remade and it does not work as a two hour movie. The story seems just seems like a writer took the story and had to expand it somehow by throwing in some filler to make up the time. NBC has ruined a classic, I hate to think what they will try next year.
