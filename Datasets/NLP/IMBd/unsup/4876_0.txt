This is the absolute worst play I've ever seen. The whole point to it was, "Yea lets get inside Emily Dickinson's head and learn more about her life". In that respect, its good, but its terribly done. You'll find yourself wondering why Julie Harris is yelling at you throughout the play. Yes that's right, whenever she has an emotional line, she tends to yell at the audience and scream her thoughts. Um...yea less of the crap and more of something productive. But, nevertheless, it never gets above the crap and I found myself crying at the end wondering: "WHY ME!!!???". So, if you're interested in seeing this play, I would highly encourage you to rethink your life and ask yourself, "Is 2 hours of pain really worth it???"
