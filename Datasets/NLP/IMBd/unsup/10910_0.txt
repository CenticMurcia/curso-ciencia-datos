Don't want to be a spoiler but the movie goes like this at the beginning. This nice couple moves to a new town after the husband gets a job running game design and the company seems to be very involved in controlling the lives of it's employees. This companies games includes mind control software that most people would be against. Movie sounds pretty good so far but wait.<br /><br />It seems that having sex is one of the primary roles of this software and the characters themselves including the main characters and after setting up the story everything starts falling apart and the storyline that could be good gets ground to a halt.<br /><br />I don't know how Ian Ziering's agent could have ever approved of this career ending part. The star power at the time of Steve from 90210 is not enough to keep this movie going<br /><br />The storyline is a good idea and could be done at least as good today and that was the one thing that had me up late watching this on TV but in the end a great idea poorly executed makes you more mad then a bad idea done well.<br /><br />Dumb, dumb, dumb
