Satirical soap opera in the vein of "Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman". In this the women are in charge and the men are objectified.<br /><br />This was controversial when it aired on TV. Norman Lear already had "Mary Hartman..." on the air and figured he could try another show in the same format. Most stations aired this late at night (it didn't show here until 11:30) so this never had a chance. Also there was a transsexual character--a real first for TV. I was only 15 when this aired and found it pretty funny--but obvious. This was basically a one-joke satire--it just put women in the place of men and that was it. All the obvious issues were addressed pretty quickly and then this had nowhere to go. The writing was sharp and they had a great cast but, after the initial controversy, this show quickly died. It would NOT be made today. So--on one hand I enjoyed it. On the other I found it obvious. I wonder if it would hold up today.
