Ages ago, in a once glorious past, wise-cracking, cartoon mammals dominated the television airways and brought us funny situations, lovable characters, and hilarious villains.<br /><br />Sonic the Hedgehog was one such mammal.<br /><br />This show had a wonderful style of animation reminiscent of the classic cartoons of the eighties and a sense of humor not unlike the "Looney Tunes" shorts. The plot was excellently justifiable; that of a beloved gaming character and his tiny sidekick on the lam from a ruthless madman and his three metallic peons. It was a show filled with all sorts of slapstick humor and backfiring, dreamy schemes, as well as morals learned at each episode's end.<br /><br />While it was long since canceled, int won't be soon forgotten.
