Oh, that was a really bad film. I like sci-fi very much, but this one... this is not sci-fi, this is a low-budget, low-story, low-acting "low-film". During watching the film I was waiting for something good, a good scene, a new idea, or... something. Unfortunately the end credits came before I found anything like this. Such a bad plot, the conversations... how could somebody write it down and make a film from it? Did he/she mean it really? I don't understand why such films are born, and why the people like it. Maybe I'am wrong, or something. <br /><br />If you want to absolutely rest your brain and see something dumb, without humor, without actions or drama, then this is your film, go for it.
