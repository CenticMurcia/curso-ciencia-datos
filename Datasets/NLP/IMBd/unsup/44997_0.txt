What is the point to this movie? It just seem like pointless torture that goes on and on and on. The character has little to no development. Making a movie about a kid who just gets his ass kicked from the beginning to end is pointless. The kid's struggle is not inspirational nor thought provoking. Why am I watching movie about a kid who couldn't do anything and is unable to rise above it. It doesn't even try to tell the audience maybe from all this, something came out of it years and years from now. No, just end with his loser for dad knocking over trash can again. I have never taken the time to write movie reviews. This movie is so bad and so frustrating that I just had to do it. It is so awful that the director should never be allowed to touch another camera again.
