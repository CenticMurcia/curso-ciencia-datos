This movie absolutely stunk! It's nothing like the book, which is much better than this turkey of a movie. I hate that some of the characters names were changed (why? Your guess is as good as mine), or one or more characters were combined into one composite character.<br /><br />Don't waste your money. Search for the book and read it. It is far and away better than this movie could ever hope to be.<br /><br />I can't see any of the actors in the roles they play in this. Perry King as Russ? He's not as good looking as Myrer's book makes Russ out to be. And why are some actors listed, but not the role they played (were that bad? Probably)?<br /><br />Some characters I don't even recognise from the book! Who's "Italian Kid"? The only Italian kid I remember from the book is Guido, Teresina's son, from when George and Opp were in Italy during WWII.<br /><br />--bbd
