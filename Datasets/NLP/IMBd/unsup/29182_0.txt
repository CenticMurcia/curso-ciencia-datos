What a great film. Contradiction is the king and nothing is what it seems. Yet, if we analyze the reality of life The Phantom of Liberty does not seem so crazy. I will not describe what happens in the film because you need to see for yourself, but I would like to say why I like it. I love surrealism and Bunuel is the king of surrealism. He would put things together, twist them, run them through a wash machine and come out with elements that one might think would never work together, yet they make perfect sense. He would analyze ones desires, urges, thoughts, social behavior, and when we go deep to ourselves, we discover that, yes, we do have thoughts similar to what we see in his film but, most of us, we keep them to ourselves because we are afraid to voice them loud out. We are afraid that others will perceive us as crazy. Well, not Bunuel, he is not afraid of anything. He wants to go deep, and why not. Perhaps the world would be a better place if we followed BunuelÂ… or at list we can watch his film and forget our own life for the duration of his film.
