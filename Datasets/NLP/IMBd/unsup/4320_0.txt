I'm usually not so passionate when rating movies, especially family films, but please don't mind me when I say that *BLEEP* all those filmmakers who shoved this atrocity up my face.<br /><br />Let me give you some glimpses of what's inside this 'family film': a guy repeatedly gets hit in the head by bricks; a guy gets electrocuted by an electric generator on high intensity; a guy's footwear wears off as he walks on a staircase with nails stuck upright on it, to the point that his bare feet have nails embedded in them.<br /><br />The entire movie tries to make you laugh with the mere notion that all these ridiculous acts of violence are meticulously planned out and perpetrated by some sadistic, spoiled 10-year-old yuppie accidentally left behind by his family when on vacation in NYC.<br /><br />While most of the adult cast gives a mediocre to decent performance, the only acting criteria for Culkin apparently is to look as cute as possible; which is ironic, since most of the time I felt like chokeslamming him off a skyscraper. Couple that with thin character development, especially the two main villains who have an intelligence lower than that of a special-needs 4th-grader.<br /><br />Obvious inconsistencies and illogicalities aside (such as the "10-year-old pro carpenter"), I was infuriated by the fact that the Home Alone series tries to pass itself as 'family film', when what it shows is blatant violence in the name of cuteness. The fact that this movie is rated below PG-13 is even more ridiculous. Even after Home Alone 2's sadistic effort, there are very few laughs -- in fact, many young kids will be frightened by what they see, while only the nuttiest of adults will laugh.<br /><br />Please stay away from this movie and discourage filmmakers from trying to make such perverted 'family films' ever again. RATING: 1/10.
