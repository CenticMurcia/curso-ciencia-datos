So, the story begins with an average couple, the unemployed musician husband, Brad(Rory Cochrane), is already up, making coffee and running a shower for his wife, Lexi(Mary McCormack). Soon after she leaves for work he hears reports on the radio of multiple explosions in Downtown LA. He tries calling his wife, no answer. So after a bit of walking about the house frantically,causing me to have a headache as the camera was all over the place, he gets in his car to attempt to reach her. He gets a burst tyre and turns into a garage, when he returns to his car the reports now say a dirty bomb was detonated. So he goes back in the garage and gets duct tape to ceil(sp?) the house, then returns home...giving up rather easily on the woman he supposedly loves.<br /><br />Once home an older Mexican man intrudes on the house and persuades Brad to let him stay. They Ciel the house after waiting a bit to see if Lexi will come home, but, oh dear! She comes home little after they've ceiled the house. Now, again, the woman Brad loves so much, comes home, coughing up blood, covered in smoke etc. Would you not let her in? even if it meant u maybe becoming infected? Considering you want to live and die with this person.<br /><br />Selfishly she breaks a window, he quickly covers it back up. Later the old Mexican man leaves, to be with his wife..Still Brad isolates his. Lexi goes wandering and sees a small boy, Timmy, who was earlier in the film.<br /><br />Lexi goes to the hospital with the kid, soldiers in contamination suits come to the house when she's gone and take a sample of ash from when Lexi broke the window. She returns, turned away from the hospitals, and then the two sit there, for a good ten/twenty minutes, talking. The men return and take Lexi away from the house...By this point i couldn't give a damn what happened to the characters, as the acting, story and general presentation of the film has failed to keep me interested or feel for the characters.<br /><br />The twist. The twist is something that wasn't really a twist, it was in all honesty, as the whole idea of the dirty bomb is to intoxicate all those who encounter it, which the bomb hasn't done. I won't say the twist, but by the time it happens, you won't even care.<br /><br />Bad story, good initial idea. Mediocre acting, uneventful script, and the camera work was just plain, amateur. I spent Â£7 to see this film, me and my two friends with whom I saw it with, were very disappointed. <br /><br />This may have been the worst film I have ever seen, it's certainly in the top 10 worst films. Horrendously poor.
