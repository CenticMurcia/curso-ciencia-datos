Oh honestly. The dialog is terrible, I couldn't care less for the characters and the acting is... so bad. SO bad. Calling it stale, flat and cheesy would be letting it down easy.<br /><br />I watched the first four episodes, because I wanted to like it, especially since Queer as Folk has yet to find a worthy replacement at the gay drama throne. Well, I'll just have to keep on looking. QAF gave us interesting characters and exciting twists and turns in the storyline. During these few episodes of Noah's Arc I fast-forwarded several times because I wasn't intrigued with what was happening.<br /><br />Darryl Stephens is very cute, I'll give you that. But this show is just too painful to watch.
