I liked this film from the moment I heard the story-line. The thing that I REALLY like about it is the fact that the production team found a way to put sci-fi elements into the story while still making it believable. The acting was good on all fronts; the African-American woman (I think her name was Shasta or something to that effect) was very natural in her conversations with Washington. Carlin's (Washington's) curiosity about the inner working of the agency he is later employed by in the beginning of the film is very believable. It is this seamlessness that makes the movie as a whole more believable. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone old enough to understand it; although it's gotten mixed reviews, I still think it's a gem among other more shallow, lackluster films.
