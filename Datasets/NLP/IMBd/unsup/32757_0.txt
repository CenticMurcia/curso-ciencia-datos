OK first off, I would like to say that Hulk Hogan has appeared in some amazingly bad films since he became famous. Most were rather bad and a few just plain unwatchable. But this film is hands down the worst most farcial display of acting I have ever seen, NO LIE.<br /><br />I was bored one day simply flipping through channels where I come across this film. OK I see Hulk Hogan, being a ex wrestling fan I decided to watch it. At no point could I even comprehend what was going on, I mean where was the plot? even if there was one. Basically its just a movie out in some Florida swamp where Hogan and his wrestling buddies put on some amazingly laughable fight scenes while looking for buried treasure. Other actors chime in and desperately try to save the movie but it just ends of being even more laughable.<br /><br />I honestly wish I could write to the Hulkster himself and ask for the 99 minutes of wasted life he stole from me. That is how bad this movie is.<br /><br />On a positive note this film however could be used to show aspiring filmmakers on how not to make movies, that about all it is good for.
