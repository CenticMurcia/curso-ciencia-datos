This movie is awful. The plot is shallow and underdeveloped and the "horror" is just useless violence. The costumes of the "freaks" are obvious and not made well. There was random information thrown in that led to nowhere. The movie was utter crap. My friends and I feel like we wasted and hour and a half of our lives watching this "movie" don't waste your time. Below are some choice words describing this movie. Nonsense, Pointless, Unnecessary. Reading the cover of this movie is even wasting time. Milking a cow would be more entertaining. The producer of this movie should be shot on the spot for even thinking about this piece of trash. If you want some slasher movie just watch Saw.
