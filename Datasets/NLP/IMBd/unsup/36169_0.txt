OK, this is NOT a film with superb acting, clever direction or high quality sound or production values...but hey, it doesn't claim to be. It clearly states at the beginning that this is a dramatisation of entries from William Allen Grone's journals, with the two-and-a-half minutes of Super 8 film recovered by police, thrown-in at the end.<br /><br />The fact that the 84 minutes preceding the "real footage" is b-grade quality, adds to the realism. Its gritty, dirty, rough and raw - and because of this you are more easily affected by the events that transpire. I agree that the added Super 8 footage at the end is it's biggest selling point, but if you love films that challenge the concept of what film should be, than you will appreciate this film.<br /><br />Overall, not the most shocking of films, but a worthy entry into exploitation cinema.
