This film serves a great purpose: whenever someone tells me that they love Boondock Saints, I feel justified in ignoring everything else they have to say about cinema. It is the worst movie I have ever seen. The only people that have ever said anything positive about this movie have been highschoolers that don't know anything about cinema.<br /><br />This movie isn't entertaining to me, but that's a subjective claim. This movie also happens to be completely unoriginal. It's about vigilante justice (70s crime movies anyone? Dirty Harry? French Connection? They all do it better.). It's about Irish-Catholic violence in Boston (even though it came afterwards, Gangs of New York portrays this theme more powerfully). It has characters marked with meaningful tattooes (Belly, Memento). It includes a cross-dressing detective (David Duchovny in Twin Peaks? What was that, 15 years earlier?). It depicts prayers before murder (Godfather Trilogy, Pulp Fiction). This movie was so unremarkable and derivative that I can't even remember more things to criticize.<br /><br />On a final note, it's just not a cool movie. The things that the filmmakers and the appreciative audiences think are cool are just not. The violence is sluggishly portrayed. The gay detective is just a caricature of an emphatic queen (unlike Gay Perry in Kiss Kiss Bang Bang). The whole movie sucks. There is nothing to like about this that hasn't been done a million times better in other films.
