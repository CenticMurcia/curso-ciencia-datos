There was a lot of information in this documentary. None of it is very pleasant, unfortunately, but it is vitally important that more people get to see shows like this to really bring across the dire state of the world as we know it. The film cleverly and clearly explains many aspects of why the world is in trouble while allowing that we do still have time to stop the worst happening IF WE CHANGE NOW. It is not all total gloom and doom. There are people who are trying to get the right message across and there are things that can be done to reduce our impact, but we all need to reduce our toxic emissions, reduce our consumption of unnecessary goods and plant trees and gardens. It was great to hear an explanation of how the environment provides many free services to humans - services we take for granted but which are being damaged and used up; such as free provision of oxygen, soils, animals, medicines (and many more)- all things that are getting spoilt by our greed and pollution.I'm pretty aware of a lot of environmental problems but there were a few things in this film that surprised me. If you get the chance, watch this excellent film. The soundtrack and the visual style is interesting too, so it helps you relax a little while being shocked.
