I just finished watching A Black Woman Speaks and I'm still crying. One of the last things Beach Richards said was "the last word has not been spoken" and I heard myself talking back to the TV saying "Yes Mam, Yes Mam". I felt like I was listening to and taking instructions form my GrandMother who was from Vicksburg. I had the honor of experiencing Miss Richards in person reciting "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark". Lisa Gay Hamilton, thank you, thank you, thank you for believing in your vision and for documenting this beautiful courageous lady, sojourner of truth and African Queen.<br /><br />A Black Woman Speaks should be required reading in every elementary, middle school and high school in this country. I thank God I am a Black Woman!
