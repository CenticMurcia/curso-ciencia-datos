...in September 1986 when I was 13 and caught it on opening weekend - the only weekend it appeared at a theater - because it sucked so bad no one saw it besides me and some others that barely helped it crack that weekend's top 10 grossing film. Just glancing at this IMDb page reminded me that it remains one of the WORST movies I've ever seen. Don't torture friends or family with this stinker unless you don't want to associate with them anymore. Where do I start? The trailer with the exploding toilet received heavy exposure on MTV, where I suppose the Weinstein brothers got a favor thrown their way for advertising this bomb of bombs, or the horrible acting and non-existent script. If you're looking for good 1980s flicks marketed towards younger moviegoers, anything is better than this with the exception of "St. Elmo's Fire". Find "Fast Times At Ridgemont High," "The Breakfast Club," "Ferris Bueller's Day Off," "Say Anything," "Heathers" or "The River's Edge" - just don't go near "Playing For Keeps."
