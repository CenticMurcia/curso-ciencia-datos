I was forced to endure this film a while ago, and can honestly say that it is one of the worst films I have ever seen. <br /><br />The plot (such as it was) was completely derivative, nicking ideas from just about every gangster film since "Brighton Rock." <br /><br />The characters make cardboard seem fully rounded, mostly being off-cuts from the Quentin Tarantino "chirpy-arrogant-violent-criminal-with-no-regard-for-anyone-else" block, while the script was abysmal.<br /><br />The lack of anything good about this film is particularly disappointing, as it was the last film Gary Olsen made. It's a great shame that his last appearance should be as a barely thought-out criminal weirdo with pseudo-mystical characteristics forced upon him in a vain attempt to make the character seem interesting.<br /><br />This is a heap of rubbish with no redeeming features whatsoever, and should be avoided at all costs.
