This is the kind of movie that you can't wait for the success of the protagonist. The protagonist, looking for the success, has a lot of difficulties, expending money, time, energy, and all is a disaster. All the people in the movie is great. All is so real, so well acted, that the first time you are seeing the movie, you really think all is true. All the actors who want fame and glory, should see this movie. Sometimes this movie works as drama, sometimes as comedy. But in the end, you really think you are working and trying with Nick, giving strong to his determination, and is so terrible the karma, you feel sad. Great, 10 points.
