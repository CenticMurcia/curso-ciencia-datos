I don't know why people should watch this film when it even doesn't take its cues from the original. The original film works because it had all the ingredients to make it great: Class, Sass, and a whole lot of...well you get the idea. But the point stands. I'm not sure either the director, writers, etc etc realized what was at hand when they made this, but they clearly kicked themselves in the butt for this one. Queen Latifah has proved herself to be a fairly good actress, but one has to wonder why she was cast in this? Instead of giving her character witty and smart dialog, it's replaced with potentially insulting racial epithets. So this is their idea of "hip and coolness". I digress. I think the fact that Hollywood's idea of what it thinks the audience wants to see, clearly undermines the bottom line of the moviegoers intelligence. And that speaks volumes about what passes for entertainment these days.
