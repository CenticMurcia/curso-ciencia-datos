After the excellent BBC version of 'The Hound of the Baskervilles', I was really looking forward to 'The Case of the Silk Stocking', although not in general a great fan of Conan Doyle. How disappointed I was to find myself waiting for the end of this tedious, hackneyed serial-killer plot. Before long I suspected that Conan Doyle had no connection with this story, apart from the name of the main characters, and from then on it became a game of 'spot the anachronisms', of which there were too many to count. Rupert Everett was okay, I suppose, but the splendid Ian Hart was completely wasted in this production. So unlike the dynamic partnership between Holmes and Waterson in 'Baskervilles'. By the time the story had dribbled to its silly conclusion, I had become convinced that it had originated from a recently written screenplay, so I scrutinised the credits, beginning and end, for any sign of 'Conan Doyle'. No, nothing. Not even a 'Based on characters created by'. I'm surprised that the script was written by the man who did the screenplay for 'Baskervilles'. I would have thought he would have realised that aristocratic girls back then did not 'pass out' but rather fainted. Very disappointing indeed. Please, BBC, don't continue down this road!
