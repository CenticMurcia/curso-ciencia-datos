The plot line is familiar: nice young guys get involved with prostitutes and gangsters, rough and tumble action follows but with a lighthearted touch, and all ends well. While derivative of RISKY BUSINESS and rougher, more recent fare from Tarantino and Guy Ritchie, this movie has a touch that is all its own. I'm not Polish and don't speak the language, so I'm sure I miss a lot of the jokes, but on its subtitled face this movie still exerts a certain charm; it seems to be more than the sum of its parts, and left me feeling oddly elated.<br /><br />Ostensibly the hero is Maciej Stuhr as the music student, and the meatiest role goes to Cezary Pazura as the gangster, but to me the heart of the film is Michal Milowicz as the bumbling son of the mafia boss, a wanna-be tough guy who hides his dachshund from the real tough guys, who expect a pit bull; I'll be watching for more of his movies.
