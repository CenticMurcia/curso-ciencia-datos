I thought this film would be about an aspiring white hip hop artist or rapper who was going through some reverse racism while he was trying to get his career started, and boy was I wrong. This has nothing to do with hip hop. The acting is terrible, the camera work is terrible, and their are several sequences that have irritating static over the dialogue.<br /><br />I saw this film during its world premiere in Philly and I am ashamed it had anything to do with Philadelphia. I understand it was meant not to be a masterpiece, but instead like great pics like the Naked Gun and Airplane, but this had no flow to it the scenes made no sense. Like the ridiculously bad and unfunny scene where KO is tied up and two chicks come in and act crazy and take his pants off. Oh and the scene where two goons tie up KO and leave him in his office, why would you tie him up just to leave him in the same place he was at? Myself and my date could not get to sleep over how bad this film was. If anyone even remotely found this funny please tell me why because I will be in disbelief. This is the first and probably last film I will ever submit anything to on this site because it is that bad. the only person in this film that still should have some dignity left is the chef guy who claimed all black people are addicted to ranch dressing, that scene was not bad.<br /><br />Again, this has nothing to do with hip hop, it has one scene where a white guy raps and that is all, so where the title came from I do not no. this is what happens when a white director tries to make a film about black culture, do yourself a favor and stay away.
