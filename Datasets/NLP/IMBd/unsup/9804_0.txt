What defines a conspiracy theorist (CT)<br /><br />1) Believes any weird theory blindly, as long as it goes against all logic and reason. 2) Is a virgin. 3) Is willing to lie and manipulate as much as possible as much as possible to convince/convert people to their believes. <br /><br />But that aside, this is an awful film - yes it is not a documentary, i think it is fiction.<br /><br />Do you CT's (Conspiracy theorists) really believe that Dylan Avery have uncovered the "truth", by digging trough old government records, websites and archive footage to expose this? The man is a college student or dropout - he has no experience in the world (but then again neither do you CT's).<br /><br />Do you really think it is possible that Dylan Avery have exposed that the white house have cynical killed 3000 people 9/11?? And that the white house somehow let Dylan Avery do this documentary? The answer is no. If all what is in this "documentary" is correct, then we can assume that the government is "all powerful" and "all knowing". We can assume that the government have no moral problems with killing thousands of innocent people. The government are according to all CT's cynical mass-murders, who kills people without second thought. And yet Dylan Avery was allowed to live and make his "documentaries" that could bring down the whole government-system, and he has also been allowed to make a second and now even a third version of his film (he keeps updating them, because he has to replace his exposed his old lies and disproved facts with new lies and facts). The point is that he is allowed to live proves that all the conspiracy theories are lies.<br /><br />The thing about conspiracy theories is that they are not scientific in nature, they are political and psychological of nature. People want to see a big conspiracy theory behind it all. They want Americans to be responsible. Because according to their prejudges Arabs and Muslims aren't clever enough or angry enough to do such a thing - only Americans. Conspiracy theorists wants some American conspiracy to be responsible for everything ad that has ever happened in human history. <br /><br />The fact is that there are evil men in the American government, as well as in every single government in the world, and in every religion. They have to be evil, to combat evil, and to do good in the end. <br /><br />Every man or woman who cant see that there is an undying hate towards the USA is an idiot. Of course Al-Quada exists, and of course they planned 9/11 and executed it - even though you conspiracy theorists wants it to be Americans.<br /><br />I have known many Muslims, and in many of them, the hate exist - so move out of your grand-mothers basement, conspiracy theorists, see the world, and you will know that evil does not only exist in USA - it is all around us all. <br /><br />Conspiracy theorists: do you actually think that the US-Government planned all this, and then somehow got the thousands of FBI-agents, fire-fighters, demolition-experts, scientists, CIA, rescue-workers, NSA, airline pilots, Police, the house of representatives, high-level military contractors, air-traffic controllers and the whole Bush-administration to keep this big secret?? Do you actually believe that?
