Adolescent, uninspired movie about a girl who is dying and decides to buy things, kiss girls, and become unbearably shrill.<br /><br />There's no sense of reality here. Seriously, this movie makes the television programme "Friends" look gritty. <br /><br />We've seen this all before SO MANY TIMES. Not a note of originality in the tinny, clich√©-ridden screenplay. <br /><br />Pretentious? This movie is so self-important it's almost sickening. It's a lame, boring artistic failure. <br /><br />Some of the supporting roles are well cast. <br /><br />I wish Ms. Redford more luck next time.
