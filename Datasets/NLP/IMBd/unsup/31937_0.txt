Jarred from her sleep by dark memories of the past, the Sorceress of Castle Grayskull is guided by a magical sword, a sword fashioned much like He-Man's, to a room whose doors have been closed for as long as she can remember. It is at that moment the sword reveals its purpose and the Sorceress realizes it is time for the true heir to the sword to emerge. But she cannot accomplish her goal alone, for she cannot leave the vicinity of Grayskull and retain her powers. So she calls on Prince Adam/He-Man to assist her. And there is where the adventure begins. . . .<br /><br />It's easy to tell this movie was made in the 80's because of it's animation. But that aside, this is a cool movie about faith, hope, and love. It's a somewhat difficult movie to find, both in the stores and online, but if you can find it, it's worth watching.
