This is a textbook on how not to get away with a crime. All the people in this movie are preposterous. The efforts made by the bad guys are so over the top and convoluted and use so much energy to get what they want, things fizzle and go out long before the end of the movie. Then there's that stupid dream. Why did he have that dream? Did he have real mental problems? Lydon is so calculating. Why can't he give people a straight answer. This is really Oedipul as well. He does have fixation on his mother (the call her the Princess). The crook has a big face and a pencil thin mustache. Anyone could have told the widow that this is a bad combination. Finally, there's that stupid malt shop talk and the way the kids interact with one another. The funniest scene in the movie is when Jimmy is talking to his friend, the Doc, and his buddy is trying to tell him something. They didn't say anything about him being deaf in his right ear. Don't get me going.
