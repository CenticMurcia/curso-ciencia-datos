I have only two things to say about this Gary Daniels farce of a film.<br /><br />One, the fighting in this movie is ridiculous. True, the fighters are all real martial artists and their moves are very good. They are all trained and their techniques look good. However, one must ask: how many times can someone get kicked in the head before he gets knocked out? When Daniels does a jump-spinning-hook-kick to the guy's face in the airport or train station or wherever it was, and the guy gets back up from it--would not happen!!! Two, every cast member in this film sucked! Not a one of them has any acting skill at all--especially Daniels! Don't watch this movie unless you want to see a whole lot of good martial arts techniques applied for show without the slightest bit of realism. If you want to see really good fights or even okay acting, pass this film over.
