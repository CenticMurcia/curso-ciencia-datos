Not badly acted, but it almost seems like you had moments where there were three different movies going on here, and they inadvertently intersected.<br /><br />Essentially, an evil Real Estate woman unearths a bog body and orders it dumped instead of reporting it to the authorities. Well, when the Bog Body comes back to life by being put in water (are they like "Sea Monkeys"?) it starts wandering around modern Ireland looking for people (and yappy dogs) to kill. Meanwhile, our six main characters gather at the house of a "hunter".<br /><br />We find out all the main characters killed someone and dumped them in the bog. So the Bog was finding revenge. Maybe. Don't know, because half of them are killed by accidents, while the Bog Man is killing innocent bystanders in the nearby town.<br /><br />The thing is a truly convoluted mess, and I'm not even sure what the point is...
