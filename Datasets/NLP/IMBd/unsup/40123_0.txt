I've got to say i wasn't too impressed with this to be honest. I love the original hellraisers and i just keep hoping that they make at least 1 more decent sequel but thats looking unlikely.<br /><br />Having said that i've seen worse films but its seems to have gone down the the traditional slasher film a bit too much. The real shame is that there's some good ideas in it. They just don't seem to have been pulled off.<br /><br />Don't go out of your way to watch this unless you're really into the series. It doesn't add anything, just offers a slightly different slant on the story.
