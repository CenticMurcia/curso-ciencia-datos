So, me and my friend went out to hire a video and we found this one. We read about it and it sounded really cool, they were bragging about how good the FX was and that it was really scary.<br /><br />OK so we hired it and started watching... First i thought that the beginning was some kind of lame intro that someone had made in like 2 hours of work and that the movie should begin soon. But when i realized that this was in fact the movie and that it really was this ugly i almost laughed until i started to cry.<br /><br />It looked like a bad intro for some game from 1993! I'm not kidding, this movie was uglier and the characters moved more unnatural than in any game release after Doom II. The story is about sleepy hollow and after the movie there were some additional footage from behind the scenes. I got really shocked when i saw that they called themselves experts and that they said something about how this movie should set the standards for the next coming 3d animated movies, NO WAY!<br /><br />There have been much better 3d animated movies released YEARS ago! Even Eric Schwarz 2d animations from 1990 is much MUCH better than this!<br /><br />So i warn you! don't hire this movie because it's a waste of time and a waste of money. The only good thing was that on the backside of the movie it said that it should be 1h30minutes... but it was like 50m only, and that was good, because i would not want to waste another 40m on that crap!
