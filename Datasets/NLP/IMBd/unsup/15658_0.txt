Well well, it's about time a good low budget comedy came out like this. Hollywood has been falling off lately. It's good to see films like this come out from those hungry filmmakers out there. They let the jokes speak for themselves, no special make-up, no effects, just good raw talent all the way around. And a good story. Reminds me of another Friday. You actually feel like you're going along for the ride with these guys. And it's good to see Todd Bridges in the mix, involved in a good comedy. His part isn't as big as you think, but it makes you give even more credit to the other actors who are left to entertain us. What a fun ride, check it out.
