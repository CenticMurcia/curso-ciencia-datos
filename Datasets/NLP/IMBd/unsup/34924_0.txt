I don't recall who survived in the end, all I can recall is not believing these were supposed to be a group of responsible adults running an installation and the truly grating noises the monsters made. Yes, those dear alien noises, it's the one thing that sticks out in my head (Holding ears and shuddering off the memory now.) whenever I think of that film after all these years and I saw it twenty plus years ago--The awful monster noises not the appalling characters that invarably pops up in my mind first. It's probably the second film I've ever saw where the special effects outdistanced the character portrayal and I didn't care at all.<br /><br />I didn't like any of the "heroes" in this film. It starts of with our two male twits beefing about who should get missy and be in charge while missy love interest stands about looking vapid and stews up the friction between these losers even more. And they were supposed to be adults doing a job...oh Gosh, the earth's doomed.
