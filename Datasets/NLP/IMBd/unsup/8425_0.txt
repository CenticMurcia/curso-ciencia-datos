I decided to watch this because I like sci-fi movies, but it stunk. It was good, however, for chuckling at. George Peppard played pretty much the same character as he did on the A-Team (including the cigar/cigarette in the mouth from time to time, minus the gloves and ascot)except he tries on a lame southern accent. The special effects were abhorrent, I can't believe this and Star Wars came out in the same year! The one thing that was somewhat impressive were the dumb looking tank vehicles because I couldn't believe they actually spent the money to make what appeared to be a functioning vehicle. Not that those things are that radical but the the tri-wheel system did spin and also functioned as paddles int the water. Otherwise, what was a decent concept is let down by poor production all around. Not to mention the ending, I only kept watching after a bit to see what happened in the end, and it was lame (it could've really benefited from a twist ending, like Planet of the Apes). Also, Albany N.Y. bore a strikingly similar appearance to Southern California.
