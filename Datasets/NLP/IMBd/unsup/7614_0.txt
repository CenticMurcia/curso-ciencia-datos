I'm not a big fan of the Lubitsch Touch. This, which I hadn't seen in 20 years, I think is my favorite.<br /><br />The recent Broadway revival of the Noel Coward play, which was supposedly very ooh-la-la and daring, was a bust. Interminable and misguided.<br /><br />One problem was that the female lead was made very cold. In the movie, Miriam Hopkins is just right: pretty, seductive, witty.<br /><br />Gary Cooper is sublime. He was a great comedian -- equally good in "Desire," the delightful movie with Dietrich that Lubitsch produced and supposedly had a big hand in directing. Too bad he changed gears so drastically and became the strong, silent Western hero he's known for today (if he's known at all, alas.)<br /><br />Fredric March was a very fine actor but not a comedian. He is the weakest link; but he works well in the ensemble.<br /><br />Edward Everett Horton is funny, as always.<br /><br />It really works, and is as racy today as it must have been when it came out.<br /><br />
