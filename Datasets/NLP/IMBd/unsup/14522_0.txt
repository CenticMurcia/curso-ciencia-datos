All that I have to say is it's the best movie of all time and worth watching!!!!!!!!!! It's heart-warming, sweet, romantic and a great coming of age story. Good for all ages...especially if you love music. Perfect for the "girls night", since we've all loved a singer in a band so time in our lives! Rex and Denise were exceptional in their roles and it really shows. Rex's smile doesn't hurt either!!!!!!!!! What a hottie! Even now! I must say I saw the movie when I was 15 and it was on late at night. I was born in 1977 so I missed it on TV. They should play it though every so often, I haven't seen it since that night. Now I own the VHS, DVD, and All 3 books of the story. For those of you who didn't know there is a part 2 and 3 to the story but ONLY in a book...WOULD LOVE FOR A 4TH BOOK!!!!!!!
