Where do i begin, well to tell you the truth i haven't gotta clue. Initially i thought it couldn't be that bad seeing as though Steve Seagal has made 15 movies in the last 4 years, but i was wrong "DEAD" wrong. The start of the film just was so uncoordinated while searching for the girl his fat enemy who mind you put up a huge fight by being chucks punching bag get's thrown out of a window only to hear Chucks reason for it. "I needed some air" who is Texas Ranger kidding. To cut the story short heaps of bad lines, the acting makes Batman and Robin look like a masterpiece this movie must have been mistaken for a new comedy movie cause it was joking. It was as painful as watching someone chainsaw my penis off while watching a new Steven Seagal movie.
