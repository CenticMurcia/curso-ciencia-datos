No comments about this mistake yet this year? We can't let THAT much time go by and not say something negative about this bomb. If you're REALLY off kilter, you'll accept this film. Adequate gore, if you're into that sorta stuff. Some very strange characters, including some odd attempts at humor. Acting - uneven. Writing - quite unrealistic at times. Sound and lighting - typically low-budget inferior. Plot - uncomplicated: cops trying unsuccessfully to determine multi-night killings on carnival-grounds-turned-drive-in. Watch this movie only if you're attracted to things that are not quite right, and if you have an over-abundance of time and/or money.
