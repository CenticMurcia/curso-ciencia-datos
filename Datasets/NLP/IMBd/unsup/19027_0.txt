If you've seen one Sidaris flick (even those directed by his son), I think you've seen 'em all. Bullets, babes, explosions. All in a day's work and the Dallas Connection is no different. The story is downright dumb, the production values are on the low side and the budgetary restrains keep the action scenes short and terminally unexciting. The only real value (like most Sidaris flicks) are the women on display. Supplied here by Playmate Wendy Hamilton and former Penthouse Pets Julie Strain, Samantha Phillips and Julie K. Smith (one woman who seriously makes me drool). Her cowgirl grind in the club and the hot tub scene easily take top honors.<br /><br />Take away the sad attempt at action and this is a glorified T&A flick for the guys. You know this, I know this. So final verdict, unless you're willing to withstand a hokey movie the likes of only the Sidaris name can make in pursuit of seeing some pretty ladies (or your a fan of Julie K. Smith), you're best to stay away. Don't say I didn't warn you otherwise.
