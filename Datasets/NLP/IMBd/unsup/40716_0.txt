This film is complete and utter garbage, I found myself watching it after seeing an above average review on a horror forum.<br /><br />Every single thing about murder game was bad, I cannot think of one thing that was remotely good about this film. The acting, the effects, the plot(lack of) and the actors(where do they find these people) and the location(whole thing looked like it had been filmed in someones garage). They could have at least upped the gore and thrown in a lot of gratuitous nudity which might have helped but I doubt it. I don't know who's been paid off but there a few above average reviews of this film around and it makes no sense, some even say how in touch the makers are with the real horror fan, a classic homage to traditional slashers, they must have watched a different film.<br /><br />Budget horror is great but rubbish like this will probably put people of funding it!
