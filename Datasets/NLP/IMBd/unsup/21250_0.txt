This is the one you remember from when you were growing up and watching Saturday morning "Bugs Bunny and Roadrunner" cartoons. I recently watched this cartoon a 15 years at least since I last saw it and laughed out loud at all the pranks that Bugs pulled out of his hat. I know I must have used some of these jokes when I was playing baseball as a kid.<br /><br />And the cameo at the end of America's perennial first lady was a hoot - and Bugs goes and lampoons her on the spot!<br /><br />Classic is the only word for this one.
