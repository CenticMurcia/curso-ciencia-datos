The moral of the story, and the main plot point between the two main leads, playing Adam & Eve - told very well, and acted out well. The rest of it? I don't know. Guess it is National Lampoon drivel.<br /><br />So watch the movie for the interplay going on and the well written story about waiting for the right one to have sex with first, and when you hold off, the complications that arise in the male partner. I have been there before myself. And I know what he is feeling. Except now I can handle it with more of a level of maturity. So that is why you should watch this. It is a realistic portrayal of that kind of happening, in many relationships today. Albeit less than a few decades ago, but it is still happening around us...<br /><br />I connected and cared for these two main characters, Adam & Eve, but the rest? Who cares.
