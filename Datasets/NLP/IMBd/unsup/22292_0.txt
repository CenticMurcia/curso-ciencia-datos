I give this movie 8 out of 10 solely because of the laugh-out-loud level. I agree with the above poster, this movie is a riot. It's so ridiculous and the facts and "evidence" presented here is enough to make you wonder if the producers deliberately made it so goofy. I caught this one a few times on late night TV, it used to get aired on TBS a lot. I love the inclusion of that charlatan Yuri Gellar (sp?) and the "footage" that shows the young men running up the hill, pointing excitedly at the "UFO" they caught on film. The "big" revelation at the end that UFO's come from another dimension and are controlled by a race called the Ummo is the icing on the cake. I know this movie is available on VHS but not DVD. Someone please release this one on DVD!
