I cannot believe that I went to the cinema to watch this load of of old pants. The lessons of the first film, which was actually rather good, seem to have been forgotten with great fight scenes, pumping music and a sense of humour curious only by their absence. No wonder Bridgette Wilson and Christopher Lambert decided not to appear.
