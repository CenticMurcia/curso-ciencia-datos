This movie was a very pleasant surprise and kept to what India is like for the "middle class" population. Of course poverty was seen, but not the more prevalent poverty one sees when first arriving to India. This is what shocks Westerners the most. Not just the heat, which is expected but you do not realize just how hot hot can be until you experience it, and you know it will be crowded and noisy and smelly, but until you step into the middle of it all it really does not hit just how poor this country is. But with outsourcing more and more Indians can achieve a better life for themselves and this movies shows a glimpse of this. A companion movie to watch is Thomas L. Friedman Reporting: The Other Side of Outsourcing. An excellent movie that shows just what happens when people, who are used to such poverty, now are in a position to have a little money and what happens when they get it and are not used to the consequences. But Outsourced was interesting to watch as it did a good job of separating the 2 cultures without totally insulting either one and we have some decent side stories going on as well to keep it all moving.
