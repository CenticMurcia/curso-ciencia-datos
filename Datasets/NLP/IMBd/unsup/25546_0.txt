Usually around this time in the South Park run, the episodes get a little stale. However, I felt that D-Yikes was, while nothing special in the South Park spectrum, a well done episode.<br /><br />Herbert Garrison (now Janet) has been the shows most diverse character. He started as a straight man with a talking puppet (Mr. Hat) who hated gays, but eventually found he was gay (and in this process Mr. Hat disappeared). Garrison stayed gay for several seasons, providing some great story points (Death Camp of Tolerance). In season 9, he was unfortunately made into a woman (or so he thought), and eventually forced to stay. The Garrison character stopped being very funny, and now is actually amusing again. Now she's a lesbian.<br /><br />Garrison, after being dumped again, meets a fellow female at Curves who brings her to the bar Les Bos (see the pun?), a lesbian bar. Garrison discovers "scissoring," in the most graphic sex scene on South Park since Dawkins made love to Garrison last season.<br /><br />Then the show turns into a 300 spoof. I have to admit my feelings on this are very mixed. 300 is a rather easy target, and the jokes they make are fairly predictable. However, it is still funny to see how they dramatize things. Several times a character does something meaningless (like bite a chip) and the whole sequence slows down to emphasize the action. Garrison making coffee is probably the most inspired use, making fun of how 300 constantly goes to slow-mo for its action scenes.<br /><br />The whole Persian thing was a bit forced, but then I have to admit I didn't get the Persian joke (where they came from or what group they were making fun of, if any). I won't speculate too long, but when Xerxes and Garrison scissor, it's one of the funnier and more graphic scenes I've seen.<br /><br />Very little is seen of the four boys, except when they hire Mexicans to help do their homework at write essays. The Mexicans think they mean Eses (I'm not sure how spell that, but the latino slang for friend) and is one of the funnier moments of the episode. Otherwise the episode isn't anything special.<br /><br />It rises above the lice episode simply because it once again reinvents Garrison for the better this time (the Mayor's reaction, "You're a lesbian now," is priceless). Garrison is one of the most conceited characters to walk South Park's screen, almost as bad as Cartman. Hopefully episode 7 will whet our appetites for what will come again in the future. We can only hope.
