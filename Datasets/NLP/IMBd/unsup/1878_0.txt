I thought that Lake Placid 2 and Manos: The hands of fate were the worst movies I had ever seen in my life. Then this movie comes along and makes the two look like academy award winners. This movie is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen in my life. It starts with really horrible filming where I cannot see a thing and then she puts a plant on the table. So not exciting. Then the dumbest part is where the man in the Richard Nixon mask is running around. Then that guy puts an iron on Sally's chest to do what? Is he trying to get the wrinkles out of her shirt? He barely touches her at all and then says the iron isn't hot. After that scene I couldn't take it anymore and turned it off. I went in the bathroom and washed my eyes out for ten hours. I would rather hold my grandmas hand while she's on the toilet than watch even a second of this movie again. It was that bad and I would highly recommend that people do not see it because it's a total waste of time.
