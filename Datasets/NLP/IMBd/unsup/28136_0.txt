I find myself disgusted at myself for watching this film. I literally feel as filthy as the people engaged in the acts portrayed in the film.<br /><br />However, sitting in judgment while watching the torture scenes I find myself drawn into their world because I too want to find the offspring of everyone involved and break every bone in their body and burn their skin and dismember their sexual organs.<br /><br />So obviously we can all be driven to cruelty and somehow feel justified in our feelings. We wonder how societies can turn and things like the Holocaust can happen, how the torture of terror suspects by our own current administration can take place while we all sit idly by.<br /><br />It reminds me of one thing, we are the only animals on this planet capable of torture. No other animal purposely imposes pain-most won't even kill their own species, yet we humans with our philosophies and religions find a way to be so pompous and arrogant to believe we are the master species of the planet. That we deserve some "afterlife" or blessing from a creator. If there is an intelligent creator-he/she/it would just set us all ablaze after seeing the things we do.<br /><br />After seeing this I know this for sure, we are the filth of this earth, we are an infestation that does not deserve to live because all of us can turn a blind eye to cruelty to save our own asses. We always seem to find a way to justify cruelty to not only our own kind, but every living thing on this planet.<br /><br />Wow, I feel like a real piece of crap tonight. Just for being human.<br /><br />Is that how this movie was supposed to make me feel? WTF? WTF? WTF? I am sure there is some excuse for that woman like she was raped by her daddy or tortured or whatever, but when bad things happen to you doesn't that make you want to be better than that? I am so mindf**ked by this movie I don't even know what to think.<br /><br />I am going to go vomit now.<br /><br />(I did have to add this)<br /><br />The film was masterfully done. The actors drew me in like I was there. I haven't literally "talked" to a screen in years. I did this time. Those actors doing the evil really made me hate them. I don't even know if I could look those actors in the eye without that feeling creeping over me if I ran into them in an airport-that is how engrossed I became in this story. The foster mother in this story plays the role incredibly. I will have nightmares about her face. Those kids were little bastards to a degree that is unbecoming an actor of their ages.<br /><br />The movie is disturbing and believable. Hardly anything left to the imagination. If I had to give it a name to reflect what it was about and the horror it portrayed I would say, "Nazi-American Family Auschwitz"<br /><br />I did not want to leave my "vomit" comment as my opinion of the film itself. The film is really well done, but you feel filthy for watching it.
