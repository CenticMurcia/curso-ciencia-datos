This is a truly awful film. Bad cinematography (I lost count of how many first-year film school rules it broke), bad writing, and an ending that came out of nowhere. The only reason I stayed until the end is that the friend I was with fell asleep.<br /><br />STAY AWAY! Rent Parting Glances or Beautiful Thing if you need to see a good gay movie.
