If you hate rats, you'll hate Of Unknown Origin. It gave me rat nightmares. I kept imagining rats swimming through pipes into a toilet and gnawing throuch my rectum and out my peehole. There's lots of rat damage in this film as they squirm through unexpected places and bite the hell out of things and cause general mayhem. I personally liked it.<br /><br />Peter Weller (Robocop, Naked Lunch) turns in a memorable performance as a corporate shirt who obsesses over rats in his home. To protect his family, he wilds out with steel traps, poison, a nasty looking homemade bludgeon and more. I would have had a lot of respect if he doused his entire house with gasoline and then tossed a cigarette in there and said "Yippy Ki-yay, motherf--ers!" That was really what I thought was gonna happen at one point but sadly it didn't.<br /><br />If you are a fan of rats (or LAWYERS who are the next best thing, hahaha, OK I'm shutting up now), I would highly recommend watching Of Unknown Origin. Even if you're not a rat enthusiast see it anyways so you can say you did. Recommended 7.5/10.
