of camera...<br /><br />From the first action i new this wouldn't be a good movie. I hoped that was a small mistake, but i was wrong...<br /><br />Movie story is about broadcasting & entertainment. One multimillionaire decides to put 10 convicts to death at one island, and all of them fight to death against each other. One will be a winner and he will get cash & freedom. Island is covered with cameras, and their reality is broadcasted with internet to the world.<br /><br />Directing is solid. At start it tracks convicts from their prison where they had "qualification", small fights, to death of course. But shooting of actions anywhere in movie is awful. I got sea sick, because camera is the one that rolls and pitch more than "fighter" themselves. So I didn't get impression of "sick action".<br /><br />Whole movie is made so it could be put in genre "sick action". It can be called action just because there are few fights, and sick not because there are poor filmed few tortures, and not because of sick idea of story, but rather because of sea sick that viewer gets, because of camera shooting.<br /><br />And there is American hero, so this movie is strongly proamerican. Some bodybuilder supposly works for American government some "dirty operations" and the government left him alone to tortures in Mexican prison, and all the time, he didn't betrayed his country. That is totally unreal. And also he is very very smart and fast, and strong. Now, i tell you... that is sick. Everyone has weakness even super-strong-ultra-fast-and-smart American hero.<br /><br />Mix that American hero with sea sick action recording camera and maybe you'll get idea of sicknes...<br /><br />Everything sick about this movie is idea of story and sea sick. All the way through, every next action or scene is predictable, so I rewinded almost half of movie.<br /><br />If you really have money & time to waste, go see this movie, so you can tell your friends tomorrow, that your worst film is "The Condemned"
