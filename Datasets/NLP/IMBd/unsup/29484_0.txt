Outside of Scorsese's GOODFELLAS, this is simply the best movie of the 1990's. Any serious film student who really wants to learn how to make a film needs to watch Scorsese films. He was originally given this novel in 1980 by a former TIME critic who told him "it's guilt and conscience - the definitive Scorsese." This movie is the exact kind of romantic, class driven drama that TITANIC wishes it was. If there is any actor alive who can possibly compare to the magnificent repression and passion combined in one that Laurence Olivier used to show us, it is Daniel Day-Lewis. Here he comes fully into his own, bringing the character of Newland Archer alive. This is also where Winona Ryder finally comes into her own as an actress. Anyone who loves movie about the classes, about romance, about guilt, or simply anyone who loves movies should be heading to a video store to rent this one right away.
