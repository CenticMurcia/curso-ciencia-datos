This movie comes off as a rehearsal for a much better film. All the elements are there ... actors, story and effects ... but everything seems like it could have used a couple of more rehearsals before they actually committed it to a permanent recording media. It just has a completely unfinished feel to it. <br /><br />Even the effects are a few levels below what I would expect in a science fiction or monster movie, nowadays, reminding me of many of the storyboard animatics you see in the Extras on the DVDs for better movies. I know this movie didn't have the budget of a "Jurassic Park" or even a "Godzilla" movie, but if you can hide your poor work with opticals properly, don't use it at all.<br /><br />I liked the entire concept of a megalodon attacking folks, but it just looked like a big Great White shark, or just like someone in the CGI department had forgotten to shrink the creature to normal size.<br /><br />I'm glad my video store had a deal so that I basically got this DVD for free ... I'd hate to have actually paid money to rent it.
