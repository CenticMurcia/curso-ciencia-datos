Along with Get Carter, perhaps the elder statesman of brit-gangster flicks, The Long Good Friday's offspring have a hard act to follow. Can only echo most of the comments here; peerless Bob Hoskins performance, with Helen Mirren showing a masterclass of understated support. The film is dated in some respects, but it's worn well, a timeless cult classic, with numerous actors - Pierce Brosnan among them - going on to make great careers. Other reviewers have commented on Guy Ritchie's efforts with Lock, Stock/Snatch failing to live up to this benchmark, but I'd take issue. Ritchie must have paid reasonable attention as I'd like to add a 'Trivia corner': To quote Razors (P.H. Moriarty) "...from little acorns" (referring to kids who extort car valeting money from Hoskins)...the actor went on to play gangster boss Harry in Lock, Stock...Harry also being the name of Hoskins character. Jack (Alan Ford), one of Hoskins' crew, went on to play boss Brick Top in Snatch Pierce Brosnan's 007 is now played by Daniel Craig, who was xxxx in Layer Cake, the latest brit-gangster flick to attempt to wrestle the title from TLGF...
