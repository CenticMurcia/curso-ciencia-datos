Robot Chicken is a show that thrives upon incongruities, beginning from its seemingly-nonsensical frame story: a mad scientist finds a dead chicken lying on a road during the middle of a thunderstorm and brings it back to life through robot parts, only to force it to watch endless TV clips. This introduction precedes every episode, and it is the short sketches that comprise the actual show.<br /><br />The show itself is sketch comedy, acted out through stop-motion: plastic toys, various props, toy vehicles, and intricately-decorated miniature sets. The sketches themselves are hit-and-miss; depending on your tastes, you may find an extremely amusing sketch followed by one that fails to amuse. The fortunate aspect of the show is that the sketches are so short and frantic (anywhere from five seconds to, rarely, several minutes in length) that dropped jokes are soon swept from memory. The odds that each episode will contain at least a couple of 'personal' gems is quite high.<br /><br />Robot Chicken is not for everyone: some of the humor is rather mature, occasionally toeing the line between edgy and tasteless. Still, the astute social commentary (or utter randomness) and merciless skewering of popular culture/celebrity make for a highly underrated and amusing show.
