A film which has Fredric March bitten in the calf by a toddler who subsequently runs askance like a rabid rabbit can't be but excellent. Not to mention Carole Lombard's dazzling performance (I can't remember having seen her mediocre anyway) : how fun and beauty reach a perfect match ! The colors, as translated on the DVD, are fragile and uncertain, which adds a certain poetry to that otherwise quirky comedy. As for the "meaning" ! Some of the front pages devoted to the supposedly terminally ill Hazel Flagg (Carole Lombard) might have inspired all the drivel that was supposed to be a tribute to unfortunate Di. The details of the film are also of the neatest sort. One striking example is the Heroines on horses show (another tribute to the "dying" Hazel Flagg- five minutes short, featuring Lady Godiva, Helen of Troy, Pocahontas and some others, and managing to be as irrelevant and funny as can be. Is the secret of these comedy, where beauty is a showcase of fun, lost for good ? The sublimely "dark and handsome" March, the deliciously "classically blonde" Lombard revel in ridicule, and that's a feat no modern comedian seems able to perform. Highly recommendable !
