One of the most hilariously dreadful films I have seen in a very long time. The acting is wooden beyond belief, but then - there is a very little for the actors (well, I call them actors ...) to work on. The dialogue is silly: when a conspirator tries to suck up to Sheba, he says "You and I have much more in common than you may realise; you are very beautiful". The plot is absurd, too. We get two royals riding huge distances in the desert (she is not even wearing a hat), with about half a dozen attendants each. Realistic or what? Sheba even gets to lead her own horse to water when they reach an oasis: I suppose the budget didn't stretch to servants and other such inessential items. Or maybe the research department fell down on the job. Be that as it may, I spilled my coffee laughing. But I can't pretend I tried to follow the storyline, as I kept missing bits when they spoke too softly while I was laughing. Berry in particular, needs to learn to enunciate and project her lines.
