It's a pretty heinous film that features a man in a wicker wheelchair, Leslie Neilson's scarred chest, plenty of very ugly Filipinos, horribly set up karate sequences, and people who look like they are waiting for others to finish their lines so they can begin.<br /><br />I think the plot is like this. Two guys, one being Leslie Neilson, are at odds since one wants out of this Project Control. Basically people are shooting up to become superstrong? Well Leslie Neilson gets mixed up with some Filipino gangs who don't like either one of the Americans. There is a side romance too. Makes little sense really.<br /><br />I'm sure Leslie would love for you to forget that he was in this one, but sadly like the movie says: "The only way out is DEATH."<br /><br />Watchability: 2 out of 10 MST3K quality: 7 out of 10
