Horrible, disaster! I've spend 5 euro for DVD and was very disappointed. Low budget movie with old jokes that won't work anymore. Maybe on younger generations that haven't seen much yet, this movie i suppose can be funny or inspiring for them. But once again, this is another debut movie of new actors. To get through they need to do much better job than that, unveil your talents, become a trademark. Without charisma people won't remember your name and as an performer you have no future. But if you want just to be on screen, than don't do movies, please. Somehow this pathetic comedy came on DVD and did it to Europe. I have always place for a good comedy in my movie collection, but please make me remember your acting, your jokes, your face and your name...
