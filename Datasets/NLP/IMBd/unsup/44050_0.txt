This movie was too boring to finish. I gave up hope for something to happen after about an hour, switching to something more fascinating (doing the laundry). Though I liked the figures and the setting I could not help wonder why I should be bothered with Valium on screen. Besides, the soundtrack fits in perfectly (not a compliment in this context). The only highlights: Vince Vaughn as a teacher and the adorable Tilda Swinton as a frustrated but at the same time optimistic mother and housewife. With only a few alterations this could have been an acceptable coming-of-age-story. But it ends up in neither being funny nor exciting nor challenging in any way. Finally, the thumb sucking wannabe-leitmotif just sucks.
