This is the one of the best Sci-Fi movies I have seen in recent history. The way everything is meticulously placed is incredible. From the lighting to the characters and the city itself. With an incredible jaw dropping reveal at the climax I cannot recommend this movie enough. <br /><br />The pacing is great and starts fast and ends fast. There are pauses in the action I believe Alex Proyas placed there to give the viewer a chance to catch his breath.<br /><br />Roger Ebert named this the best movie of 1998, it may not quite be that, but nonetheless, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />Check it out I am sure you will love it.
