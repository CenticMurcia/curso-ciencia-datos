I don't care for Harrison Ford, and I didn't care for this movie. The best thing about it is that the viewer is kept in the dark as to Ford's guilt or innocence of the murder of his former lover. Another plus is Raul Julia's fine performance as Ford's defense attorney.<br /><br />But these two elements cannot save this film. It lacks cohesiveness and lacks anything for us to really care about.<br /><br />4/10
