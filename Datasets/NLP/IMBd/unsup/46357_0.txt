Absolutely hated it, such a huge let down! We love the series and often die laughing watching it. We re-watch it over and over and spend far too much time surfing You-tube for clips of it. This movie is a disgrace to it and fans of the show and doesn't even feel like it's put on by the same people. It made us so angry with the nudity and plot lines that centered around that, which seemed to be the bulk of the movie. Strip clubs, bunch of T&A every other scene. We missed out on a good chunk of the movie because of all the fast forwarding we had to do to get through that junk and about 35 minutes in we just shut if off because it was just making us angry. What were they thinking by agreeing to this junk?
