STARSKY & HUTCH This couldn't have less to do with Starsky & Hutch. They could've named it H.R. Puffinstuff and I still would say it's more like Puffinstuff, in the sense that it makes no sense. Ben Stiller used any excuse he could to make a crime comedy in which he shoots a living, breathing animal. Starsky & Hutch just happened to be the part of the donkey Stiller pinned the tail on.<br /><br />Speaking of being useless, how bout Snoop Dogg. Like in AOL and Blockbuster commercials, ESPN Football 2004, Racing Stripes, this, being an award show host and everything else he does, this movie doesn't fit him at all. He has no talents, and yet he is casted to do roles suited for pedestrians and other various people with no talent.<br /><br />I've had a long standing grudge with Stiller ever since I was snubbed for the lead role in Heavyweights. The producers told me he made the final decision and said I was too good looking for the role. I agree with him, but it's called gaining weight for your role, and it's a commitment of acting Hilary Duff seems to be very good at.<br /><br />VERDICT *1/2 out of ****
