Sorry it wasn't like the book, but by not having read the book, I wasn't restricted by what to expect or compare. It had a little of everything (scenery, plot, dessert scene) to keep a guy sticking around past a zillion commercials on WE to find out what happens in the end. "Why did you move from California to - here?" is a question only found in a typical Canadian TV production like this. But hey, less crying than most Lifetime movies offer. Also, when you consider what is out there in the theaters these days at $10 dollars a head (plus, all the other "necessary" expenses - food, soda, etc.) this is inexpensive fare for the eyes and the brain. The popcorn at home was fine. The author should have sued anyway.
