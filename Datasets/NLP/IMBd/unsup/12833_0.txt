For those who are a fan of the 1997 anime/Manga Movie "Ghost In The Shell", they maybe shocked to know that the Stand Alone Complex series is NOT a sequel or alternate version of that storyline. Instead it is set in a alternate timeline. However it doesn't make this a must avoid anime spin off.<br /><br />The script and animation quality are the same standards as depicted in the 1997 anime/Manga movie. I personally find Stand Alone Complex has a more interesting and entertaining storyline than, that of the original movie. The main attractions in the series are the Tachikomas "Sential Tanks". I personally enjoyed the episodes, which featured these small "thinking" tanks, which possessed the personality of a small child! A true anime/manga classic in the making,superior to the original 1997 anime/manga movie.
