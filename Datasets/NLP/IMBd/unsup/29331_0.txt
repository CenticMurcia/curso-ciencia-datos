Man, don't even get me started...<br /><br />I wanted to make the title "Don't buy this DVD" but I noticed there's no such thing as a link to either a DVD or a VHS at Amazon or anywhere, so until that lil'icon there turns from grey to full color, you're pretty much safe.<br /><br />Should I start with the acting? Actually, I can't even say it's bad acting, cause there's no acting at all... Naw. This film doesn't even deserve a comment. It gives me a headache to even ponder what makes it so bad. The plot is so poor (if you've got at least half a brain), the acting so miserable and the cracks so stupid, it makes you think the writer (or writers) and director have spent the last few years in the loony bin and have a very different perception about what's funny or acceptable in a movie. And, before you ask, no: It's not the kind of it's-so-dumb-it's-kinda-funny-flick. It's bad, period. Real bad.<br /><br />The only reason you would choose to see this, I figure, is if your sister was dating Steven Seagal and you wanted to somehow prove to yourself there are even worse filmmakers.
