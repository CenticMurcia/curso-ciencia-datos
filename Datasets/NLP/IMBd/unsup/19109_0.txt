This turned out to be a very good movie. The story is intriguing, and I wonder if it must have been based on reality, somewhat. The only problem is there was the big film- "The Devil's Advocate" with Keanu Reeves and Al Pacino- (totally different plot though) so it may confuse the viewer, thinking these are similar films, and thus, not tuning in.<br /><br />That aside, Ken Olin is excellent in this film, as the defense attorney who must defend basketball star, Joe Campbell (portrayed by Holt McCallany). I have seen McCallany in one or two smaller films, and he was excellent in this. The case which Olin prepares so well, and wins turns out to be a possible mistake. What if the defendant really did rape these girls? What kind of person is he? What is he capable of?.<br /><br />Mariska Hargitay is also good as Olin's assistant. There is a small role for Deanna Milligan ("Intensity" 1997) and Gina Philips is Olin's daughter, who becomes involved with Joe Campbell (McCallany). While the ending wasn't overly suspenseful, this film addresses the many flaws in our legal system, and psychological issues which cannot be assessed by the courts.
