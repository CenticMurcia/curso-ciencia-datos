I have just seen 'Forever' at the Palm Springs Film Festival, and Pere Lachaise is not only a special place in Paris, but a monumental place on Earth. This film allows us to see both the direct and indirect connections that Life and Death provide us, should we choose to see them and respect them. We are Art, but most times the relics of our corporeal selves is better represented by our stories, all informed by our incredibly particular experiences. By balancing the extraordinarily noteworthy inhabitants of Pere Lachaise with the simply extraordinary (and those of us left behind who acknowledge and respect them) 'Forever' reminds us that the democracy of death has startling and profound connections to all who live - you are alive if you feel pain, joy, inspiration, and love. And perhaps Death's best attribute given back to the living is Love.
