I saw this film on DVD. Really creepy stuff. I couldn't help wondering why it was so creepy. First, the music is very eerie. And also the visual, with very strange colors, almost candy-like. The actor looks like a french Robert Downey junior. This film could have been made as an animation. It's so detailed with fantasy and fairy tales themes. It's worth taking a look at it. I've never seen a film quite like this before. The story is very bizarre, a tailor going on a mad rampage! The kid who plays in the film is very cute and a pretty good actor. The film reminded me of a lynch/ Gilliam atmosphere with strange characters.
