The european video version of this film sucks. It boosts pathetic dubbing, and claims to be an "uncensored version" featuring "scenes never showed before", but I doubt this is true. For the film: it's incredibly dumb, has a very ugly production value, bad acting and has such an intense pace that you feel it could end any moment. And if it did, you couldn't give a **** about it. If you must watch it, fast-forward it to the cool scene in which a woman is transformed from an elevator into a motorcycle...
