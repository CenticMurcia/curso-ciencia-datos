The performances by Billy Crudup and Claire Danes are nothing short of brilliant in 'Stage Beauty'. Why this film or their acting was ignored when this film came out is baffling. This is a better film than 'Shakespeare in Love', although not as clever; and it's astonishing to me why films so close in quality and subject matter were treated so differently by the public.<br /><br />All the performances in this movie are top notch really; with special mention being worthy for Rupert Everett - who steals every scene he is in. But the overall focus of this film is Billy Crudup, who never strikes a false note in a role which appears exhausting even to describe. His every nuance, every gesture, and every line is expertly delivered in this film; and he is adequately complemented by a wonderful supporting cast.
