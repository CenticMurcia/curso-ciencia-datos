This starts almost like an art film, but eventually it gives in to mass market urges that become more and more distracting, limiting and inappropriate. It has way too many quiet, somber tone-setting scenes that are obviously there to eat up time and delay narrative obligations, but after an hour they just kill the momentum. Finally, a completely risible, limp ending arrives, that will make you understand all the one-star ratings here. Funny thing about movies that seem to be withholding their point, they always end up not having one, and they go nowhere. As it ended, I thought; Hmmm. snow... melancholoy... hopelessness... is this a Danish production? And sure enough the end-credits are filled with dozens of Danish/Icelandic names.<br /><br />I was open to this films light touch and hoped it would be good. I was also open to a cast of second tier actors (James LeGros, Ron Perlman). But Perlman is over the top, and just becomes a shouting one-dimensional villain. That's not much to engage you. And when will film-makers finally learn; if you don't have an ending, you don't have a film... this ending is a travesty. The movie is derivative of just about every horror movie made in the past 30 years. The next time a ghost disappears over an edit, or when a light is turned on, I'm just going to pitch the DVD out the window.
