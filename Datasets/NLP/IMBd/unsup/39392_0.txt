One of the most black-hearted films I have seen, this is not one I would recommend to others. If it was trying to be the film equivalent satirical TV comedy such as Absolute Power or Bremner, Bird and Fortune - perhaps with a little of the great State of Play thrown in, then it failed miserably. Firstly, it's just not that funny. There are several laughs to be had, mostly because of Lucy Davis' excellent comic acting; there are not enough for it to be classed as a comedy. There is some moderately good satire on the tabloid press, but the film is just trying too hard to be edgy. The first way it tries to do this is by jumping from camera to camera(all of which are at an unsettling angle) and from normal film quality to CCTV-esquire film. This is continuous throughout the film and is instantly annoying. But it's main attempt to be edgy is through a nasty and quite ludicrous twist which destroys any previous good will toward the film. It appears to be self-consciously trying to shock. The characters are highly unsympathetic and one-dimensional. In their defence, the actors are generally good. But overall this is definitely a film to avoid.
