I saw this film and I was so blown away. As a gay man I haven't really been able to see the gay marriage debate beyond, "sure, we should get what they get." But this is a great documentary that totally changed how much I value gay marriage. Besides the message, the storytelling was extremely well done and, you couldn't have asked for a better bad guy in that incumbent that Carl was up against. But that was just one of many things that were well executed. Open minded interviews with BOTH sides of this issue make it crystal clear why gay marriage is crucial to the survival of the gay community- it appears to be far more than a label of equality or simply being fair with financial rights.
