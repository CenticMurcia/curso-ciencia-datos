Okay, some questions. Why are they sophisticated enough in the "control room" to have oxygen sensors (oxygen sensors?), but no provision for emergency escape in case of power failure? Why does the robot-wench at the end (who Richard Benjamin thinks is real) short out when he gives her water, yet the Yul Brenner robot-gunslinger character (among other robots)can pour whiskey down their mouths? Hmmm. Okay, and I'll buy the "pistols have sensors in them so the guests won't get killed" thing, but there are swords and maces in Medieval World. What, when a violent enemy swings a mace at your head, it has a "sensor" to stop it in mid-air just short of splattering your head? And the robot-gunslinger can hear Benjamin's breathing 100 yards away in the desert to locate him, but somehow can't locate his breathing four feet away in the castle--because the fire is distracting him? Come on. Do I have to go on? One more. If the robots don't have a normal body temperature, how good can sex be with them? Cold! Oh yeah. Watch the Black Knight's hand in the castle near the end. He is supposed to be "off," yet when we first see him, his thumb is turned up. The next time, his hand is hanging down.<br /><br />Great story concept, but good science fiction demands more plausibility. And what was supposed to be "authentic" is just every Hollywood clich√© about the West. I guess you could make some argument that this is some sort of "meta-thematic" cultural commentary about the authentic West vis-a-vis our conception of it as transmitted to us by Hollywood. But, honestly, the film just isn't that smart. And I'm not going to let it off the hook even if I agreed, since it ignores basic nuts and bolts.
