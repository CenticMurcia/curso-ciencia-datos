this show is terrible. its not funny at all, its too much boring talk. if there's going to be a show with nothing but talking in it they have to make the conversations interesting, this isn't. it bored me to tears.<br /><br />iv only watched a few episodes and i'll promise you that will be the only episodes i'll ever watch of this dud animation. if u want a good animation programme your best to stick to south park, simpsons, futurama or even family guy. i hope this show gets cancelled quick. i think the most annoying thing about this is the animation, it looks so rubbish and cheap. i don't know if this is the way the creators wanted it but it didn't grab me. avoid it......... 1/10........j.d seaton
