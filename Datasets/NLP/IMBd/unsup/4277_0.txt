If you understand it you'll love it!<br /><br />Not a film for those wanting to be spoon fed.<br /><br />At first look it's "Egads not that kind of stuff again!" But it's much more than Mememto, Butterfly Effect, Dead End, Sixth Sense or other great movie of (similar?) "paranormal" genre.<br /><br />This is truly original and is probably closer to only one of the above mentioned movies. But to say which one would spoil it. <br /><br />I really didn't want to write a review and certainly it's hard to get in ten lines, but the low reviews given previously may have been from those who did-not understand the movie.<br /><br />You "gotta" have brains to enjoy this movie!
