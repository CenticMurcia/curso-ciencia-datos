Sharp, well-produced variation on the frequently filmed "Enoch Arden" plot. Herein, Claudette Colbert (as Elizabeth MacDonald) is informed that husband Orson Welles (as John Andrew MacDonald) is a Great War causality. Ms. Colbert is devastated, and pregnant with his son, who grows up to be Richard Long (as John "Drew" Andrew). Colbert marries comforting boss George Brent (as Lawrence "Larry" Hamilton); and, they have a happy life. But, first husband Welles really didn't die -- he was only badly wounded. After two decades, Welles goes home -- but, he has a surgically altered face, and walks with a limp.<br /><br />Directed by Irving Pichel, Colbert and Welles are great fun to watch; with their fine performances, you can read some ambiguity into the film's ultimately flawed storyline (which has to do with recognition). Mr. Long is quite impressive, in his film debut; he had a long, successful, and far too under-appreciated television career. Eight-year-old Natalie Wood is cute as Welles' foster daughter "Margaret". <br /><br />If only it were more plausible...
