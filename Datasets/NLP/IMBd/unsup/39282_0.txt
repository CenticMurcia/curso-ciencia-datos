Please don't watch this movie as some1 is saying this is an excellent movie, Imran and Genelia rocks, Aamir Super Production, etc. As this movie is the worst movie ever, though the storyline is very very common two friends in love, but their ego comes between, than then they find someone i n their life to avoid their friendship, but as I told you naa a very common story, in end they again meet, so please guys its a humble request don't go for this flick its a complete waste of time and money. If you guys remember than 5 years ago there's a movie named Tujhe Meri Kasam, tjis movie is complete copy of that film, though in that movie songs are awesome, good comedy and excellent performance by all character's. That's first movie of Genelia and Ritiesh. Except Paresh, there is no other character in the movie whom we call actor. 'Pappu can't Dance' and 'Hass De Aditi' are good songs, but not as good that you can go to see this movie in Theaters, so please avoid, I am sure this movie worst movie of the year.
