This is another one of those small independent films that everyone says is great, but it really isnt. The story has been told before in several other better films. This film isnt even acted well, Gweyneth Paltrow is as annoying as ever in her slutty character. This film is just boring and a waste of time. Skip it. *1/2 out of ****.
