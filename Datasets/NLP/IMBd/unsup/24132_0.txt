I have been looking for a video of this movie since videotape/DVD became available. Loaded with stars and very funny. Miss Aulin was missed in other movies. Ringo is great as gardener. Coburn is a great surgeon. Who says it doesn't have a storyline. I also read the book and found the movie to be every bit as good.
