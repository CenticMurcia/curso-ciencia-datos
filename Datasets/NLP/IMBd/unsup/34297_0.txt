I give this movie a 2 out of 10 - but only for the cast.<br /><br />When I sat down to watch this movie, I expected there to be, at the very least, the real Boogeyman from the first movie making a comeback. But, to my dismay, no such luck.<br /><br />Instead, I was treated to a half-baked, poor excuse of a film that I will be glad to get out of my house.<br /><br />The acting was fair, the overall plot could have used some work, and the gore should have been toned way down. With only a passing reference to Tim, the main character in the first Boogeyman, this film should not be classified as a sequel because when a second (or third) film in a series is made, there should be something there to make a positive connection. I didn't even catch that the Tim in #2 was the same Tim from #1 until I read about it here on IMDb.<br /><br />If you like gore reminiscent of SAW or HOSTEL, feel free to peruse this title as well. But if you're looking for a continuation of the original, leave this DVD on the store shelf.
