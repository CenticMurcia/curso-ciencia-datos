This is - in my opinion - one of the worst pictures produced - EVER!<br /><br />The plot is terribly stupid, the whole purpose of the movie is that of a poor frame for childish "special effects". The whole thing is so terribly embarassing, that I think it is a "must-see". Almost every aspect of filmmaking (script, casting, photography, special effects, and.. and..) is so horribly bad! I really wonder why this one never got the turkey.
