I don't know what the other comments are talking about. I've seen lots of true crime movies, dramatic, suspenseful, and enthralling. This was none of the above. I kept waiting for something even halfway believable to happen. She sues him for child support and continues seeing him! Oh, come on. No twists, no turns, nothing dramatic. Why did I waste my time and can I keep anyone, anyone else from watching this movie. Yes, the acting isn't bad, although Teri Garr is wasted, but they might as well be acting in a paper bag, they can't fight their way out of this insipid, even if true, plot and the total lack of anything to keep your interest up, except the faint hope that there will be some of element of surprise sometime but alas, there never is.
