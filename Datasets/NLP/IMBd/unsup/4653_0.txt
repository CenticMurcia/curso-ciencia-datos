I watched this movie in the preview in my university. I must admit that when my friend told me what it was about I thought it would be one of those dull good-intentioned but poorly made movie. I was wrong.<br /><br />This movie is powerful and transmits a lot. Doesn't pretend to feel pity, and even though the beginning might be even considered dramatic, it made me laugh out loud several times.<br /><br />It's the first review I write, but I definitely thought I should drop a line to defend this beautiful story that talks about what can a person do for a loved one, about re-discovering yourself, about avoiding stupid dogmas... And at the end it leaves you with a broad smile and a sense of tenderness that not so commonly a movie inflicts you.<br /><br />If you like beautiful stories, this is your movie.
