Under the influence of fabulous Gamera movies, and as an answer to Hollywood crap, Toho proudly presented this Gojira 2000 Mireniamu.<br /><br />And they don't understand the point of monster story, as always.<br /><br />Visual effects are the best of the series. Some scenes maybe better than Gamara and Hollywood Godzilla, and of course, others are not. But you know, it is not the point.<br /><br />You know, the point is the screenplay. Some details of the screenplay like "Gojira detecting network" are relatively good, and of course, others like careless approach to dangerous monster and unconvincing escape are not (They tried to match against Emmerich's farce? Idiots!). No, not details. Plot.<br /><br />The plot of this movie is totally pointless. Screenwriters (They did that blasted Gojira VS Supesugojira and Gojira VS Mekagojira !) are lost their way in maze of details and forgot to build solid main story line. Especially, Oruga pointlessly appeared, pointlessly transformed twice or three times and was immediately killed by Gojira. Effects for this lame scene were not bad. What a waste, of talents and characters.<br /><br />
