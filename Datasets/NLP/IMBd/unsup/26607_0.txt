Personally witnessed the 5-parts variant of this anime and every part gave me groovy experience (we've got a 2-DVDs release - running time is 154 minutes - with 5 parts in total, which have a good "connection" between them). The story, the animation, the music, the Japanese actors' voices, the characters' development, the additional features of the DVDs, the comedy, and the drama were all to my liking. It is no "Ninja Scroll", but it is definitely not worse - quite different but also very atmospheric.<br /><br />The humour in this feature comes very unexpectedly (like those "bugs") but when it comes, it is so childishly spontaneous. And "when sorrows come, they come not single spies but in battalions" - the drama here rivals the best Shakespearean tragedies.<br /><br />Also a few occasional scenes are extremely stylish. For instance: 1) the scene in the first part where Belldandy uses her magic - great timing and great music; 2) the scene in the second part where Urd appears (jumping out of the TV-set) - the change in colour is brilliant; 3) the scene in the fourth part where the ancient tree is shown - wonderful animation and fantastic church organ music piece; ...well, this list can be continued.<br /><br />The only thing I did not realize is: why is it written on the official DVD release here that it is not recommended for people younger than 18 years old? Our release has no MA (meaning sex/bloody violence/hentai) material at all. It's a serial that can be easily enjoyed by the whole family without making anybody uncomfortable.<br /><br />The antipode of this serial is "Urotsukidoji". But that's another story.<br /><br />Guess it's quite clear that it is 10/10, great and easy-going. Thank you for attention.
