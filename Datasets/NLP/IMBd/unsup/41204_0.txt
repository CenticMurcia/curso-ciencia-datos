I saw the movie "G" last night 10/29/05 and I feel like we paid $7.50 too much. This movie should have been at the A$1.00 movie. It reminded me of an independent movie with bad actors and a thin watered down plot. Maybe the writers and producers just got out of film school...I don't know. This movie had a slow start and I thought that it was going to get a little interesting in the middle and then it had a weird ending. Everybody in the movie theater were complaining. Lots of things didn't make sense. It seemed like it had the potential to be good but it just wasn't happening. The characters seemed so unreal. The ending was something that I didn't understand- there were a lot of loose strings that needed to be tied together. I expected a lot better from Blair Underwood. He was the reason I really wanted to see the movie in the first place. We should have gone to see "SAW 2" like we originally intended in the beginning.
