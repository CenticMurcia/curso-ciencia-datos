MK-1 made by no-talent director Paul Worth..beep..Anderson was really not that crap but this....this.....this......is just unimaginable! Some memorable moments are<br /><br />Motaro, supposed to be one of the toughest enemies has a visibly fake plastic horn set glued to his head. Even a 2 year old would find that out.<br /><br />Another opponent, with 4 arms, supposed to be the third toughest, has a 2 second role and dies by a falling object! Johnny cage moves perfectly straight for 100 meters during a kick, touches the bad guy! Dies! What a way to start a movie!<br /><br />A wise old Red Indian guy says "Pretty cool huh? Its my animality". This guy is supposed to spiritual? He looks like a punk.<br /><br />Final end for Shaoh Khan? He becomes a box! Originality! The CGI looks like cut and paste from a 1985 modelling kit. And this guy is a caucasian bald guy instead of a mongol.<br /><br />There's no fighting, the opponents merely scratch each other.<br /><br />What are the makers trying to prove with this? Was this an intentional parody of the Mortal Kombat universe?
