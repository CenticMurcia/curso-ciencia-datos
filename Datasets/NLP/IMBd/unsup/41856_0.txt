I just got in from watching this movie with a friend of mine. Though, he laughed at maybe 3 jokes this movie tried to force feed us I'd have to say we were more amused and embarrassed by this movie if we had to explain why others heard us laugh. The dialog was wretched. It was Buffy-like speak and at the beginning it was way over done. I had to turn to my friend and ask him if we as gay men were expected to talk like this all the time. The acting was over the top by almost all the actors save for Caleb which was so understated that it made his passive character seem like a doormat. I think the only character that was remotely interesting was Tiffany (the dildo-wielding gal) since we could understand why she had to be over the top. There's nothing to expect from her as a character.<br /><br />The two lead guys are hot to watch but not much to write home about when it comes to their acting abilities. The blonde gal with the freaky hair at the end was excruciating. If I were her roommate I would have moved out a long time ago and changed Social Security numbers. The worst was that whole dinner scene with the parents. Talk about the need for acting classes and while we're at - directing classes or a whole new 4 year degree at another film school.<br /><br />As far as the nude scene by the two guys, while it was gratuitous I say why the hell not? Women are subjected to this 50 times more than men are in mainstream movies. It's time the USA caught up with the rest of the world when it comes to the nude male form in film. I keep thinking Jack Valenti sitting in his personal screening room sweating bullets at the mere thought of a man's penis flashed in his face. It is what is and while it didn't add anything to this film or speak highly of the director's creative acumen it at least is a step in the right direction for the male form in cinema.
