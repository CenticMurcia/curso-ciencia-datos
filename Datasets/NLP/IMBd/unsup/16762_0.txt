In this film with Clark Gable and Myrna Loy, Jean Harlow is not, for once, portrayed as a dumb blonde.<br /><br />Instead she shines as the very intelligent secretary for Clark Gable. And she never looked more beautiful. Her hair is not the platinum blonde of so many of her pictures but instead a darker blonde.<br /><br />In one of his first film roles James Stewart as the beleaguered boyfriend of Jean Harlow is wonderful, patient and kind.<br /><br />There really isn't too much of a story but it doesn't really matter.<br /><br />The cattiness of the crowd that Clark Gable and Myrna Loy run with is unbelievable -- you want to shout at the gossips to GET A LIFE.<br /><br />Every aspect, except the story, of this 1936 film are really very fine.<br /><br />It's hard to find but if you see it on the video store shelves be sure and rent it.<br /><br />
