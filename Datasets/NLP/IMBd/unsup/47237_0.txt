Like many, I had high expectations for this film. And like many other reviews I've read here on the IMDb, I agree that the cinematography was well done, it was ridiculous to the point of comedy and there were a few moments in the film that almost saved it but bottom line up front, it was a huge disappointment. This movie was probably about everything except the Black Dahlia murder or Elizabeth Short. If that's what holds your interest about this movie, read about it in the Crime Library instead, this movie should have been called Boring Love Triangle Story With Quirky And Shocker Parts That Almost Save It But Don't Oh Yeah And Lots Of Eye Candy. The End.
