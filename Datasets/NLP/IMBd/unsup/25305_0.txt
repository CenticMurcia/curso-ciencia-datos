Impressive how Juliette Binoche isn't aware of the film crew at the movie set!I'll explain: it's not,like,ignoring them: technicians nor the Director, the folks in the film making process. It's just the ability of "entering into the character's skin" and tottaly ignore that she is an actress at a shooting set!Feeling the anguishies and disappointments etc...! Only an artist with rare intelligence and such sensibility can do it! and Juliette Binoche is allthese things... In my opinion she is one of the best actress of the last two decades that came along in the international cinematographic arts.To asseverate my statement note the difference of interpretation in the movies directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski. Whilst Mme.Binoche shows through her "facial mask" the interior anguish that overcome her role. In this movie the difference is simply gigantic: how her physiognonic aspect change: all the frivolity,shallowness are sent out by her expressions! As to the movie, it is a soft comedy,tasty and easy to taste,as the french people can do so well! In a scale one to ten, I give it nine, so much for the masterly interpretation of Mme. Binoche as for Jean Ren√≥'s.
