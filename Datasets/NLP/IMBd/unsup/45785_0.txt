This movie is about Ghengis Khan, which stars John Wayne and Susan Hayward. I had heard that this movie was bad, but then I decided to sit down and watch it. What did I think of this movie? This movie is honestly one of the worst movies ever made that I have seen! This movie is filled with a lot of bad things for a start. For example, rather poor acting from John Wayne, Pedro Armendáriz, and Thomas Gomez, laughable dialogue, most of the dialogue in the movie was totally modern talk! Another really bad part was where they did the filming, you could tell that it was filmed out in the desert out in Utah, because since when did the Gobi Desert have small plants and cliffs and rugged terrain in it?!<br /><br />Before I really get going, I am going to say: What was John Wayne thinking?!<br /><br />After seeing this unbelievable atrocity, I thought that whoever was in charge of the casting department for this movie ought to have been fired, because casting John Wayne as Temujin, or should I say, Ghengis Khan, was perhaps the worst mistake that they made with this movie, because I can't picture Temujin with John Wayne's voice! And I like I said above, Pedro Armendáriz and Thomas Gomez's acting was also very poor. This movie has some of the worst acting in Hollywood history, the acting was atrocious.<br /><br />Also, it seems as if a large majority of the battle scenes in this movie were drawn out. It only goes to show that even John Wayne was not immune to a box office bomb. This is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen, I know that other movies such as Plan 9 From Outer Space are bad, but this makes Plan 9 From Outer Space look like a Best Picture Winner! <br /><br />John Wayne has made some clunkers, such as The Green Berets, McQ, and Brannigan, but this is probably his worst. It only goes to show that even John Wayne was not a completely perfect actor!<br /><br />I'm only giving this movie one star because I have to give it one star. If I could, I'd give it a very rare rating, perhaps one that there never could be! <br /><br />Negative one star out of ten.<br /><br />-1/10
