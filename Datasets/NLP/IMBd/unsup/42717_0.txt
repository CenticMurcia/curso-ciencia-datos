Don't bother renting this movie.<br /><br />National Geographic and Paramount start out filming the cutest little polar bear since Knut.<br /><br />They add silly narrative.<br /><br />Then things take a turn for the worse.<br /><br />They stick in some guff about global warming.<br /><br />Why didn't bloody National Geographic fly in some steaks for the polar bears? Don't they sell enough of their magazines? Doesn't bloody Paramount have some spare change to helicopter in some goodies for the cute little bears? Why did they let'em die?
