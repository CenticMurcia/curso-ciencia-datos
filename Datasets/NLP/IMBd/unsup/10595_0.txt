If you loved the first film and thought it was a great movie with the exception of the low budget and occasionally bad acting then you might not like this film very much. I want to start off by saying Belial looks terrible in this movie. Did they think it would be a good idea to change what he looks like completely?! In the last film (despite the low budget effects) Belial looked good in a cheesy way. Switching off of that subject I would like to say that this film did have a higher budget and it was good that Kevin Van Hentenryck returned to play as Duane in this movie and that the budget was a lot higher in this film and the production value is noticeably better. Another thing is the continuity with the previous film is just bad. If you saw the first film first you would see that Belial tried to kill Duane because of jealousy but in this film they just brush it off like nothing happened and they tried to say it was an accident. I also didn't like the story about a house of freaks that was going overboard with the whole freak thing It was nice but these other freaks were just ridiculous. How Can a human be born with a frog head?! Overall this film isn't a good sequel but it isn't that bad.
