Rubbish is actually an understatement. Its hard to even begin to describe how terrible this movie is. I understand the fact that some movies require you to suspend your belief, but this is just pushing it too far. The story makes absolutely no sense, the plots are too damn confusing and the acting is just horrifying.<br /><br />That said, it can be somewhat entertaining if you don't wear your thinking caps. Paresh Rawal and Johnny Lever do give you some giggles but the rest of them do no justice to their acting talents. Sharmila Tagore and Om Puri are some of the finest actors around in Bollywood and it is sad to see them do roles such as these.<br /><br />The music is crappy, the special effects are crappier and Chunkey Pandey is the crappiest of them all! Avoid watching this movie as it is just not worth it.
