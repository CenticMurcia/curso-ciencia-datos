More Hollywood junk created for the new car society of the 1950's. This film is the "Leave it to Beaver" of war films. It starts with an implausible autobiography that is more than slightly self serving to Audie Murphy and has the same elements of self delusion that haunted Murphy throughout his adult life, namely that he was a lunatic with a terrible temper. The film completely ignores any internal dialogue within Murphy and what must have been a self destructive streak, as he seemed to be a psychopath. It paints him as a good family man in a war which is implausible in the extreme. He gunned down 283 Germans? Yeah right, that was fabricated by the US military for propaganda purposes, nothing more. The characters are all good guys doing good things and never really showing any emotion. This film could be a stunning vehicle for demonstrating the idiocy of the American infantry in Europe in WWII, but it utterly fails to engage even that material. Save your time or else keep heavy things out reach while watching it because you will want to destroy the TV. What a waste for intelligent folks..
