I was looking through my satellite guide to find when this movie was on because I am a big fan of Uma Thurman and Juliette Lewis as well. At the end I was a little bit confused. Thurman and Lewis play these two best friends out of convenience or necessity, one or the other. They are typical bar trash in all reality. Being a bartender, I've seen women like this all of the time. They are trying not to pick up guys but get picked up. Uma desperately wants to have a man and goes home with one and is instantly crazy about him even though he treats her as what she was - a one night stand. This movie floats along somewhat aimlessly with no major issues really being resolved. What I liked about this is you as the viewer have to figure it out for yourself. In the end you get the feeling that she has decided to settle down and has a new found closeness with her mother, I think that's the direction it was going. It was definitely a movie you'd have to pay attention to and read between the lines. It seems like the plot is hazy and that you're suffering with Uma's character. Well that's life. The plot is sometimes very hazy and the point of a movie is that you suffer and rejoice with the characters. The acting was brilliant, Gena Rowlands - I neglected to mention - was great as Thurman's mother. The acting really does save this movie. Even though I defended it, I still feel the screenplay left something to be desired. My rating - 7/10.
