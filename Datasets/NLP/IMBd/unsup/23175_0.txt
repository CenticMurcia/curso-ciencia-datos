I did consulting work for ten weeks last year in Hyderabad and Mumbai on a contract with IBM for BellSouth. (Got trouble with your BellSouth DSL? Plan on talking to "Rocky" in India.) This film brought back such warm memories of a wonderful country and its wonderful people.<br /><br />From the opening scene in the Mumbai airport with its marble floors and dirty white walls... to the teeming crowds waiting outside (I had one white face meeting me at 4:00 a.m. after flying from Orlando to Detroit to Amsterdam to Mumbai to Hyderabad, amidst the hundreds of brown faces clamoring for your attention)... to the little three-wheeled jeeps careening through the streets... the marvelous shots of Victoria Station and the Gateway of India... to the merriment of Holi. Not to mention the call center agents!<br /><br />This film (and the howls of laughter from those in attendance, at the 13th Annual South Asian Film Festival, here in Orlando at http://www.enzian.org/ ) made me want to pack up and go back tomorrow.<br /><br />"I'd kNowingly Do It Again!"
