I gave it a 4. It made me laugh and I really like Pamela's work for PETA.<br /><br />With the exception of Courtney Love, Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson I didn't know much about the other people in this show. Who are they I thought when they started their hilarious and vulgar orations? My excuse is that I'm not an American and I don't follow the current American stand-up comedy scene.<br /><br />Here's my take, it was funny and very vulgar, not that I mind, I had lots of laughs and enjoyed the roast. But, just like eating food you know isn't good to your body, these kind of shows could deteriorate your mind. The show has no meaning except of upholding the myth of the celebrities by making fun of them in a predetermined way. The celebrities become some kind of one-dimensional characters and that's good for business, I guess. Otherwise they wouldn't have participated.<br /><br />It seems like that the good old roasting of celebrities back in the days of Dean Martin and Truman Capote had more substance than just talking about Tommy Lee's endowment and Pamela's tits. It was more clever in the old days and I miss that. But hey carry on with your roasting, it's a very American entertainment and thank god there are no beeps. I *beeping* hate that.
