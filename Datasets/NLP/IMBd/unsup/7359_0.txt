First of all, I love kinda movies like this one and I consider myself lucky of having watched it last weekend in my former girlfriend's flat because she has always been a b-movies freak and so."The last word" is for me a deep story about cranks, a worn femme-fatale and the dummies of Hollywood.The resentful and witty character of Doc, a close friend of the main character that Timothy Hutton hides more than shows, stands out in a so powerful way that at the end, you realize that you was taken in about him.The girl is beautiful and confused -Michelle Burke acts sensitive and finally splendid compounding her Sara/Caprice character.Althought Hutton triumphs in his mission revealing the ambiguous talented guy, corrupted gleefully by Hollywood, Joe Pantoliano -incredible actor- offers a new dimension sticking behind Hutton every time he appears in scene, stealing the whole film. He is the ultimate anti-hero and villain, slave of his own contradictions, master in dupe business, putting up with his proper suffering, rejected by the woman of his partner(probably Sara is also the woman of his dreams)in this game of personality mirrors which deserves a warm and cautious approaching as well as passionate comprehension.
