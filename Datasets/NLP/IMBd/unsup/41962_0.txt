while i didn't mind the original The Shaggy Dog(1959),i thought this sequel was not too good.i found it way too silly and absurd,and not realistic.by that,i'm not talking about the premise,a man transforms into a dog.that i can accept as being within the confines of the movie.what i found unrealistic was how most of the characters acted and or reacted.too say there was some overacting going on would be a massive understatement.i also didn't find the characters endearing.i did however find them annoying.and the acting in general was unimpressive.and i found the ending abrupt with no real resolution.i'd say this would be a good family movie,a family comprised of only 3 year olds.maybe they ran out of money or time.whatever.this film had none of the fun or charm of the original.for me,The Shaggy D.A.is a weak 3/10
