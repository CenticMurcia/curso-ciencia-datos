Movies don't get better than this. It is utterly uniquely American and will always be a great movie. The energy and verve of this film is palpable. I remember watching this about 35 years ago and it still stands up - from start to finish.<br /><br />You feel like a fly on the wall watching some inner secret organization called "The News." It is so good that although there are many talented supporting actors, Rosalind Russell is the pivotal character. With her all things stand. Cary Grant is brilliant as always but Ms. Russell is so good and so dominant (without being overbearing) that the movie is like a 1 woman show.<br /><br />The unfortunate thing is that it has nothing to do with today's so-called "media." I was a freelance photojournalist for a few years in NYC and I can tell you that things are very different from this movie. Don't idolize news reporters b/c this species has hit the latte' cafe' and they ain't turnin' back.<br /><br />Regardless, see it and you will know what real total unmitigated non-agenda plain old fashioned ENTERTAINMENT is all about. 10+/10.<br /><br />-Zafoid
