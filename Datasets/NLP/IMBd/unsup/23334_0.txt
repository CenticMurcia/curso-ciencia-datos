I don't care what anyone has said negatively about this movie but it was a very wholesome family movie. My two daughters and I watched it and thought parts of it were hilarious. It reminded me of one of my old time favorites, "Ferris Buellers Day Off." I don't understand how anyone can give it such a low rating. The movie never was boring and if you thought parts were far fetched, "it is only a movie. Not real life." People should lighten up and sit back and relax and enjoy a good film with their children more often.<br /><br />I thought everyone involved did a great job and I would watch it again. Maybe I am just an immature 42 year old but I was cracking up at parts, and for someone my age that is unusual for a kids film.
