Imagine a really bad idea for a TV show as dreamed up by Guy Caballero ("it's like "The Young and the Restless, but on wheels!") and you've got Train 48. The actors are okay (except for the ones playing Johnny and Brenda who ham it up way too much), but they can only do so much with the ludicrous material. The show might have worked better if the script had stuck to chit chat about current events. But by the time the second season rolled around there wasn't a character who hadn't been beaten up/stabbed/shot/deported/abused by her father/duped by a transsexual.....<br /><br />Anyway, I read that the idea for the show come from a similar program aired in Sydney, so blame Australia.
