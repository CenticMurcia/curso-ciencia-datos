A low budget, badly acted film............ everything about this film is poorly staged, wooden acting by C list actors and unbelievable settings, I'm still watching this as I write........... OMG so awful.<br /><br />What more can I say, the scenes do not fit together....<br /><br />The 'escape' scenes well, simply not believable.<br /><br />Best line ... He's dead (immediately pull sheet over head LOL)<br /><br />I'm still cringing as I write this, if second graders presented this as a home movie I would expect better acting (and sets :) )<br /><br />Please, let me write this comment without having to make up ten lines about a film that doesn't even deserve one!!!!!<br /><br />Even if you are desperate to watch a film, don't bother with this - paint a wall and watch it dry or sit in the garden and watch grass grow, so much more entertaining :))
