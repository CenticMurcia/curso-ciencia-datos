"Mortal Thoughts" is well acted and keeps your attention throughout. It's a modernized "Alfred Hitchcock type" movie complete with Brooklyn accents. It makes you wonder how the judicial system can ever figure out who's telling the truth and also how many guilty people are acquitted because of their acting abilities. Mystery buffs should be very satisfied.
