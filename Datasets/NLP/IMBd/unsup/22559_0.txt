This movie is being compared to Life is Beautiful as both movies are set in Nazi war camps, and the stars of both movies try to make life in the camp as optimistic as possible. In this film, Robin Williams plays a serious role as Jakob, a jewish resident in a war camp in nazi occupied Poland. He overhears a radio report that the Russians are moving in, speculating that WWII should be over soon. He tells a few fellow jewish residents that he heard this radio report, to help bring some hope and optimism in the cold,dreary,nazi camp where many people are dying from the hands of german soldiers, and from suicides. This report causes much excitement amongst the jews and the news travels faster than Jakob imagined. He notices how this news lifted the spirits of many of the jews so he continues to make up bogus reports and gives everyone the impression that he does in fact have a radio, which he does not.<br /><br />In the meantime, he is secretly taking care of a young girl in the camp and must try and keep the secret that he has no radio, from her as she is very much looking forward to getting out of the camp and seeing her parents again.<br /><br />I really liked this movie. It was nice to see Robin Williams play a serious role. I give this movie 8/10.
