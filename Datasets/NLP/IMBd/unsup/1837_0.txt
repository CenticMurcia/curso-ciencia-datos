Mixed with snow? But seriously though: This movie is bloody violent (pun intended)! So not for the faint hearted then! And maybe that's why a Mr. Quentin Tarantino loves this movie and hailed it as inspiration for his Kill Bill movie(s).<br /><br />This is also a story about revenge or avenge if you will. The title character is seeking some people ... why she does that? Well you have to watch the movie to see that. There's not much plot to speak of, so telling anything else will be spoiling the remaining story. Just bare in mind, that this is to be taken lightly. All the blood squirting on your screen for example! But it also has a sad undertone throughout. So it does have many emotions that it touches ... A good B-Movie then!
