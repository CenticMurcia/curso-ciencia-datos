Carole Landis was indeed one of the most Beautiful Actresses to grace the movie screen. Joan Blondell may have had the leading Lady roll in "Topper Returns", the final act in the "Topper" trilogy, but Carole was definitely the Star in this film. Were all the Movie moguls sleeping when this Girl tried desperately to become a Star? She had the talent, the Beauty, and the desire to become someone in the Movie industry. It was a sad departure when She took Her own life. ( or did she? ) I, like a few others are beginning to believe she may have been eliminated, with similarities as to that of the death of another famous actress, Marilyn Monroe. She had too much to live for. Maybe someday we will know the truth. She had a lot of talent that went unrecognized. Rest in peace Carole. There are many of us who still Love You, and miss You.
