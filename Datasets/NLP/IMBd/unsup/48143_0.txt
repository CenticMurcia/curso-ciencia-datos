When this movie came out in 1968, it made a bit of a stir. However, almost forty years later, it just looks incredibly dated and stupid BUT unintentionally funny as well! So for comedic value, you may want to give it a watch.<br /><br />Max Frost is a very narcissistic rock star with a MASSIVE following among the youth. So popular, in fact, that he is able to mobilize the kids of America to go on strike until the voting age is lowered and they get a say in government (yeah, man--right on!). Unfortunately, his plan works too well and all the squares in Washington are sent packing and the good old US of A is now run by Frost and his hippie friends, man! So naturally, they use this power to send all the squares (aka, adults) to concentration camps and the kids run amok! Things are not that groovy, though, as the youngest members of society are left to fend for themselves and, within them, dissatisfaction begins to build and then the movie ends.<br /><br />This is all meant to be some sort of allegory designed to warn us about "youth run wild". Instead of a serious message, though, it just seems overblown, ponderous and dopey,...as well as funny from time to time.
