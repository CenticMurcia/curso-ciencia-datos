After two made for TV movies that failed to launch a TV series back in 1979, Captain America finally made his motion picture debut in 1990, but thank God not to American movie screens. Only in Europe!<br /><br />I have this movie in my video collection just for the fact I love comic book superheroes and their movies and TV shows. Yet I despised this movie for numerous reasons. I will not tell you all of them, but the main reasons were:<br /><br />1. Red Skull was not German, but Italian! (He's working for Mussolini during World War 2, not Hitler) <br /><br />2. Almost all the good guys, including Cap's old lady love and the reporter played by Ned Beatty, gets killed off sometime in the film<br /><br />3.Red Skull is responsible all the way for such events as the JFK assassination, among others<br /><br />How stupid is that? Very stupid! Kids will get scared out of their pants looking at The Red Skull just like I was so sickened at Red Skull's annoying comment to Cap calling him "brother". Praise God Captain America managed to shut Red Skull's mouth after that and started to kick Red skull's worthless ass.<br /><br />Oh, how did Red Skull manage to get such cheap slut daughters in this movie to do his dirty work? There is no mention of him anywhere during the movie of him being married at some time. He must have been playing around with a lot of women before Captain America came back to life.<br /><br />Jack Kirby, god rest his soul, hated this movie as well. And I don't blame him. For Jack Kirby created Captain America and other heroes, too!<br /><br />If they ever make a new "Captain America" movie in the future, I pray that they do it better than this piece of crap. I've never been so disgusted in my life.<br /><br />Thumbs Way Down!
