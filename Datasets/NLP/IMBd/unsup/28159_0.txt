The fact that this is based on a true story make this movie all the more horrifying. Based upon the true crime novel, "Missy's Murder" by Karen Kingsbury, the movie surrounds the death of a high school girl whose body was found in a nearby river with a 100lb log on her body, and a mother's search for justice.<br /><br />This is probably one of my favorite TV movies. Patty Duke moved me as Jean Monroe, a mother who would do anything to find out who killed her only daughter. My favorite line of all, when Jean confronts Det. Staley (Loretta Swit) and says "I may be a little woman, but I have a big mouth." Having seen the real woman whom Patty portrayed, I have no doubt in my mind that the line was actually said.<br /><br />Ellen was probably one of the most vindictive manipulators I have ever seen. She finds a way to move into her dead friend's home with her young child (in her room no less!) and then starts wearing her clothes and trying to be her. The fact that she made her own child say that she knew who killed Jenny, was one of the most horrible things I have ever seen. <br /><br />SPOILER ALERT!!! By the time you find out that Ellen and Carla were the murders, you are thrilled that Jean smacks Ellen on the face, yet panged that Ellen and Carla led her on for so many years. <br /><br />IF you haven't read "Missy's Murder", you should really try to seek it out. I got mine off eBay after a bidding war.
