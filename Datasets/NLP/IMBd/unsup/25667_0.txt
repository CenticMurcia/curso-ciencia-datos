Unheard of until is was recommended to me, I found 'Coneheads' to be a really good watch. As others have said, it's not just a laugh-a-minute surprise, there's actually a clever little storyline, some thoroughly engaging characters - human or otherwise - and some quite decent special effects. Dan Ackroyd is the main comedy player but the other actors spar along with him wonderfully. Everyone looks like they're having a good time.<br /><br />The gags come in every way; visual, slapstick, puns, you name it. And there's a happy ending as well.<br /><br />It's 15 years old, now; so the nuclear family values it seems to celebrate have been rendered unfashionable by the latterday millennium cynics. More fool them.<br /><br />This is a feel-good movie of the first league. And it's definitely one of the funniest American movies I've ever seen.<br /><br />Trouble is; you come away with those bang-bang lyrics of 'Tainted Love' permanently lodged in your cone.
