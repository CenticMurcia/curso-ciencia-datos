Hunters Blood (1987) is a very entertaining fast paced movie about 5 men from the city who travel 2 hours to Arkansas on a weekend so they can go hunting in the forest, drink beer and just have fun!!!<br /><br />Things soon take a turn for the worse tho when they find out there's a horrible redneck family who live in the area where they set up camp. These inbred rednecks are cannibalistic and will stop at nothing to kill and torture our city boys!!<br /><br />It's a great movie, with plenty of action and some really gory images along the way, the cast are all fantastic too, my favourite is Mason who is played by Clu Gulager but i'm abit biased coz i loved him in Return of the living dead!!!<br /><br />I haven't actually seen "Deliverance" but hear it's very good, well it would have to be great to be better than this, so if you like these sort of movies then i highly recommend this one. 9/10.
