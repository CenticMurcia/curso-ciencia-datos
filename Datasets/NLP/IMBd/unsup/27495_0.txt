I loved this movie. Bette Midler is one of my favorite actresses but her portrayal of a washed up, burnt out, alcoholic, drug abusing 'Janis Joplin' was by far her best performance. She looked fantastic and while some of the 'concert' scenes were a bit long, overall the movie was very well done. The scene where she is walking up to the stage in Florida at the stadium and almost falls over gave me chills and her singing 'Stay With Me Baby' was the most moving and powerful performance I have ever seen. It literally brought tears to my eyes. The roller-coaster of emotions that you go through in this movie will stay with you long after the last credit has left the screen. Bette Midler at her best, when she collapses at the end you truly feel as if you have lost right along with her. The best 'music' movie I have ever seen.
