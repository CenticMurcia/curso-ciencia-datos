Who ever messed with these classics should have a stick of Acme Mfg. Co. Dyno-mite stuck up their er um, you know what I mean. They actually messed with the violent nature of this film by putting in politically correct unviolent scenes!! Bugs shoots a tin can full of "corks"? In the original he shoots Sam in the face! Corks?<br /><br />Don't waste your time!<br /><br />
