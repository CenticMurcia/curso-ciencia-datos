I loved this movie. It's without a doubt Will Smith's best. Martin Lawrence was very good, too. If you want to catch Lawrence at his best I suggest everyone see "Nothing Lose"(loved this film!). Anyway I think this was a brilliant film. Smith and Lawrence made a great team. This is definitely Bruckheimer's best
