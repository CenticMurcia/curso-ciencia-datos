yet turned out to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Whew! This movie was so dreadful...jeez...I mean, this film was crap. There was absolutely zero creativity! All this movie needed was a couple creative moments, and bam, this film woulda been okay. Male nudity, terrible acting, awful music...oy. The few highlights of this movie are mainly its ability to make me laugh. Terrible movies always have a place in my heart, especially horror movies. I really tried to give this one a chance. I'll watch it again I guess sometime. I bought it from my video store for 3 bucks, after I saw it a few years back. It's basically something i use to torture people whose favorite movies are "Good Will Hunting" and "Armageddon." Overall: D-
