Although its subject matter and characters are moving and dramatic, this Catalonian documentary seems a bit too planned to ring true, at least for me. A supposedly realistic account of the destiny of various Cubans among thousands- who sailed from Havana to Florida in the early 1990's to escape Fidel Castro's regime, I find rather curious how the filmmakers move at ease from Havana to Guantánamo or Florida, and are always in the right place, in the right time. With the overt attitude of new conquistadors I have witnessed in many Spaniards' behavior in Latin America (which is one of the reasons I did not find the female character of "Y tu mamá también" as naïve as people seem to believe, but a true reflection of this neo-colonialist attitude I have directly observed), it makes me suspicious of the true intentions of this film, which I find more related to Spain's sensationalist publications and television programs than to real interest in the human drama of the Cubans' present situation. Due to the potentially explosive situations that may arise from this state of affairs, the film does not lack interesting segments and testimonies. But I believe that any film made about and in Cuba today will have similar impact. As an alternative, watch the Swedish documentary "Surplus."
