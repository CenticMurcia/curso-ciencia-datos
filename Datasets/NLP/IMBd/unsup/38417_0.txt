Edward Arnold is a blind detective with a guide dog named Friday. Investigating a murder for a friend, he visits a house filled with Nazi spies and their unwitting hosts who include a 21-year-old Donna Reed. The spies are after some secrets hidden in a safe. Arnold foils their plan. In one physical conflict, he smashes the light so that he and his opponent are on an equal footing -- "In the dark. My kingdom." Friday the dog is cute and provides some moments of comedy, as do the two African-American servants, one of them Mantan Moreland. This dog is really something. He's smarter than some students I've had and far more physically adroit than I ever was.<br /><br />And yet it's a B picture from beginning to end. There were dozens of these inexpensive and mechanical films ground out by the studios in the war years. That Arnold is blind is no more than an attempt to introduce an element of novelty. Oh, and the dog. "Eyes in the Night" was supposed to be the beginning of a series, of which there were a number at the time -- "The Falcon," "Dick Tracy," "Joe Palooka." I think there may have been one more entry in the series before it mercifully expired.<br /><br />Ho hum.
