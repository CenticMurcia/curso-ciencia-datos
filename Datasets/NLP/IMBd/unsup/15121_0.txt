Considering how lame the British crime movies of the last ten years have been for the most part, its just surprising how good the country's entries in the genre used to be. They're tough and taut, lacking the operatic excess that characterized the American gangster epics (such as "The Godfather"), but more than making up for it with brutality. "The Long Good Friday" isn't a portrait of the history of a certain mob family, but a tight and cohesive story detailing a few days in the life of a head mobster. It works very well because of how basic the initial concept is. It ranks with both "Performance" and the original "Get Carter" as the country's best crime film.<br /><br />"The Long Good Friday" is effective for several reasons. First, the direction by John Mackenzie and the screenplay by Barrie Keeffe both compliment each other very well. The script is full of witty dialog, constantly intriguing and suspenseful situations, and an absolutely memorable lead protagonist. The characters here are all interesting and well developed. Mackenzie's direction knows what to do with this material - keep it moving at a quick pace.<br /><br />However, what makes the film for many viewers is the lead performance by Bob Hoskins. The character was already fascinating enough, but Hoskins' portrayal makes him downright memorable. Sneering, brutal, impulsive, yet fragile, Bob Hoskins infuses the character with swinging histrionics that'd put Edward G. Robinson to shame. "The Long Good Friday" isn't flawless (the music score is a bit irritating initially until you settle into the groove of the film's style), but is one of the best gangster films ever made. (8/10)
