Let us be clear. If you expect another Black, you will be disappointed. I enjoyed Saawariya for its simple tale of unrequited young love. The emphasis on "unrequited" and "young" sets this film apart. It's the type of film that takes time to understand, not of the instant gratification variety other than the opulent sets and slick cinematography. (Ravi K Chandran should already have a few lifetime achievement awards at his relatively young age.) You feel a bit of a void after it is over - my wife thought it was depressing at first - but once you discuss the characters' motivations and the ending, it all seems justified. The two new leads are very good, but not what I'd term instant stars or acting legends. The star of the movie is unequivocally RANI MUKHERJEE. She gives layers and nuances to the Gulabji character that were sorely missing in her recent Laaga Cinema Mein Boredom.
