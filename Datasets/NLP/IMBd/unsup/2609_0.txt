Answer the question in how this project ever became green-lighted and you to could be a big shot Hollywood producer! I only rented it because it was Chris Farley's last movie and I am a huge fan of his. Surprisingly enough he was still great in this flop but he was the only one. Unfortunately a lot of his lines were rehashed from previous performances but I liked him nonetheless as he always is a laugh-riot. His expressions including his reactions to pain are priceless and what a shame it is that he's no longer with us...he will always be missed! Matthew Perry is a horrible actor and his character was an exact replica of "Kids in the Hall" star Kevin McDonald...he had the accent down pat and the whole works but it just didn't work out for him. The Native American chick was hot but that's about it. Eugene Levy was heavily disguised and played an okay Frenchman but even he was disappointing...he can obviously do a lot better. Some of the characters were just stupid and I just tried to tune them out completely. Oh yea, what the heck was Bokeem Woodbine doing in here playing a servant. He should stick to action and urban films since that's what he's best at. What garbage this is...proves how untalented Christopher Guest really is!<br /><br />Final Exploration:<br /><br />Movies: Glad I didn't as it was one of the biggest flops in cinema history!<br /><br />DVD Purchase: I doubt it'll ever be released for it to begin with.<br /><br />Rental: Only for a final farewell salute to a comedy legend!
