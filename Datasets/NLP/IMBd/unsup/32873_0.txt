First of all, to everyone who said this was a great movie because of originality: I would like to direct you to The Ring, or to Ringu, which is what The Ring is a remake of. Either one is infinitely superior to this piece of dung. Word has it that production of this movie was rushed so that it could be released before The Ring came out. And boy does it show. One example of how ineffective this film is: I am scared to death of cockroaches, yet the scene containing cockroaches in this movie didn't scare me in the least. Most likely 'cause they were obviously computer generated. I stayed through the whole movie hoping the movie would improve. Then the lights went up and I was like, "That's it? That really sucked." I've never been more disappointed in a movie in all my life. Everyone involved in this waste of time, money and filmstrip should hang their head in shame. Do yourself a favor, skip this movie and see either The Ring or the original Japanese version, Ringu.
