An overlong, highly episodic excuse for some burlesque and indulgent violence masquerading part-time as a film of historical interest and validity. With Leonardo scowling, Diaz giggling and Day Lewis doing his best De Niro, this film takes itself far too seriously for the leaden-handed and juvenile treatment of a story which seems suspect the moment you think about it. Its a shame to see a director with such a great track-record try so hard to convince us that he's still 'got it'. Couldn't he have left this drekk to Jerry Bruckheimer?
