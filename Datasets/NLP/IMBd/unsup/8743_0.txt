The Short and the Short of It: <br /><br />-this film tries so hard to tell a story unconventionally, which it kinda does, but the story itself is extremely conventional.<br /><br />-half of the dialogue is spoken directly to the camera, or "the audience". It is meant to be charming and sweet and witty but in actuality becomes annoying, overused, and ineffective.<br /><br />-any time something comes along that can be considered a cliché, the "hero" specifically acknowledges this cliché and says something to the effect of "we're going to avoid this plot development, as it is a cliché". Well, "hero", you've actually magnified the problem, because if the "audience" didn't happen to catch it the first time, you went ahead and spelled it out for them immediately afterwards.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE......don't waste you time.
