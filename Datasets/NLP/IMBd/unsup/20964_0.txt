See this film. Its fantastic.<br /><br />Set in a Japanese POW camp in WW2, a group of Scots, Americans, English and Australians struggle to survive.<br /><br />Robert Carlyle is superb as the lively POW who longs to escape, Kiefer Sutherland is captivating as 'Yanker', the American who gets beaten up by a spade in one of the film's most powerful scenes.<br /><br />The show almost goes to the brilliant Ciaran McMenamin, the loner who tries to keep his morals and humanity in tact.<br /><br />The sountrack is hauntingly brilliant, rent this film.<br /><br />This is Oscar worthy in the league of 'The Thin Red Line'. Pity it didn't get a cinema release. Amazing film.<br /><br />9 out of 10
