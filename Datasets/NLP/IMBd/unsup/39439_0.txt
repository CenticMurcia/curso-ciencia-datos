TV crap before its time. I really hated watching this show, and movie. I could never watch more that half a show an be able to digest it. At least the A team was meant to be unbelievable and half acted intentionally. The acting is just horrible, along with the scripts. Not to rain on anyones praid, but the lead actress is always a b actress, and on the annoying side. At least police women was athletic and looked like she could run, to add realism to the show. There was to much personal baggage which dragged down the story's plot. I remember the guilty kid with the family story and she new the kid would phone, but when the add the personal bagged which takes away from the plot the creators lose the audience. A mortal sin in writing. Mid-life trouble and police work do not mix. One has to be spliced or intertwined the concept or the story drags. Make's the lead protagonist look unprofessional, and hurts what the character is about. The female lead in Hunter was hard as nails, and professional which gave realism to the show. There is no such inter play or humor with the lead actress with this movie.
