Kweer klucks koneheads on display. Having come from a liberal family from Mississippi, this film hits home. No, not everyone from Mississippi was an ignorant racial bigot, but Mississippi WAS the ground zero for these ignominious peons. Of all the films about southern racial prejudice (In the Heat of the Night, Ghosts of Mississippi etc.) this one best presents the magnitude of ignorant hatred that existed within the South and the corruption of the white authorities. I find it interesting that I remember the names of Cheney, Schwerner and Goodman, but I don't remember the names of the SOBs that killed them. This film was slighted at the Academy Awards. Frances McDormand's performance was superior to any of the actresses nominated for Best Supporting Actress. I think Mississippi Burning was better than the Best Picture winner Rain Man.
