Ruthless streetwise tough guy Tom Powers (a terrific and electrifying performance by James Cagney in his star-making breakthrough role) and his loyal partner Matt Doyle (well played by Edward Woods) rise to the top of the criminal heap selling bootleg alcohol for the smooth, hard-nosed Paddy Ryan (a fine portrayal by Robert Emmett O'Connor) during the Prohibition era. Ably directed with real style and fierce economy by William A. Wellman, with a gritty script by Harvey Thew, crisp black and white cinematography by Devereaux Jennings, a vivid and flavorsome evocation of the period, startling outbursts of raw violence (watch out for the infamous grapefruit scene!), a tight 84 minute running time, and an uncompromisingly dark and depressing ending, this extremely hard-edged film still packs one hell of a potent punch even today. Of course, the movie's success is largely because of Cagney's vibrant and mesmerizing acting: Cagney brings a certain irresistibly devilish charm to the role of Tom Powers which in turn makes the little nasty sociopath more of a strangely appealing anti-hero than a totally hateful full-blown villain. Whether he's shooting a racehorse or collapsing on a rain-soaked street after rubbing out a bunch of rival mobsters ("I ain't so tough"), Cagney is nothing short of amazing in the lead. Wellman's assured direction is equally impressive; note how almost all of the violence occurs off-screen, which actually enhances instead of lessons the shocking impact of said violence. Moreover, there are sturdy supporting contributions by Jean Harlow as sassy dame Gwen Allen, Donald Cook as Tom's disapproving straight-arrow brother Mike, Joan Blondell as Matt's sweet girlfriend Mamie, Mae Clarke as nagging moll Kitty, Beryl Mercer as Tom's loving mother, Leslie Fenton as cocky, flashy gangster "Nails" Nathan, and Murray Kinnell as Tom's untrustworthy mentor Putty Nose. Essential viewing.
