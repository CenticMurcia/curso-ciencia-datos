This is pure, innocent fun. If you're not too jaded by modern life, this film will tickle you. Cary Grant is in fine comic form, as are the rest of the cast. <br /><br />The thing that really got me, the first time I saw this film, was how gorgeous Shirley Temple was as a young woman. I was only used to seeing her as a little girl in her early movies, but wow, she grew up quite well. Very easy on the eyes. I felt the same way about her when I saw Fort Apache. Fact is, if I was 17 in 1947, they'd have to use fire hoses to keep me away from her. Oh, that little button nose....<br /><br />The cast comes together well and keeps your interest all the way through. One of those early comedies that doesn't require harsh language, nudity, or gross-out jokes to get its laughs.<br /><br />This is a movie that I can always enjoy every time it shows up on TV. Great performances by all. <br /><br />"Mellow greetings, Yookie-Dookie!" (You'll understand why that is funny if you see the movie.)
