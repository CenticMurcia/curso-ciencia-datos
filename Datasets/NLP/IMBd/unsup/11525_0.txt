Frankly, I'm an A&C fan of their horror genre, preferring to mix laughter with thrills when I watch those Universal films they made, like HOLD THAT GHOST and A&C MEET FRANKENSTEIN.<br /><br />But the boys pull a lot of pranks as new recruits, the kind of mind games that keep their fans happy, and for added measure there's The Andrew Sisters belting out some pop tunes with their usual enthusiasm and a love triangle involving Lee Bowman (dapper as ever), Jane Frazee (nice voice) and Alan Curtis (looking lean and handsome).<br /><br />And, as usual, reality takes a back seat to low down comedy as the boys fall into one impossible situation after another before we reach a happy ending with everyone confidently marching off to take care of World War II.<br /><br />This was a good start for A&C and a nostalgic look at how patriotic America once was about Uncle Sam.<br /><br />One of the musical highlights is The Andrews Sisters performing "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy of Company C".<br /><br />Summing up: If you're a fan of A&C, this is a must see!
