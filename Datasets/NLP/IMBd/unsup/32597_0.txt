Introduction/Characters<br /><br />I rented this film after enjoying Owen Wilson's comedy work in such films as Shanghai Noon and the Royal Tennenbaums. I was hoping to see a few sparks of what became his signature...interesting little bits of humorous, off-beat dialog. For that, I wasn't disappointed. As in SN, you can't help but like his character. Dignan despite the fact he is simply a petty thief. Through he little dialogs and mannerisms, he is almost able to convince you he doesn't mean to do others harm, but is really just seeking a place to be be recognized and to belong.<br /><br />Like his brother, Luke Wilson also shows a little bit of what would come to be his stereotypical role. He plays Anthony, the earnest and honest follower who would rather settle down and find love then get involved in illegal activities. In this role he manages to convince us he only gets involved out of a sense of loyalty, rather than to actually gain anything for himself.<br /><br />I was a bit let down by the Bob character, played by Robert Musgrave. He reminds me of a jelly fish, both in his character and in his acting: you see the vague outline of what he is trying to be, but in the end there is very little substance to hang on to. Bob apparently yearns for acceptance by his brother, but ends up looking like a man without a backbone.<br /><br />Story<br /><br />The loose plot revolves around the lives of three friends in their attempts to build lives for themselves. Anthony apparently is just looking for someone to love, Dignan is seeking a club to belong to and Bob desires a loving relationship with his brother. Together, they form a little "gang" with Dignan as the ring-leader.<br /><br />Overall, I was entertained by the various vignettes that make up the movie, but disappointed with the movie as a whole. The overall plot line, if you can call it that, does not really lace the movie together in a tight package. I felt like the conclusion was an afterthought rather than a planned event.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />I can't really recommend this movie. It is awkward and uneven throughout and you come away almost wondering "what was the point of this story?".
