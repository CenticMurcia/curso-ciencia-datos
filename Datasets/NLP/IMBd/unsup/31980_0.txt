After seeing the trailer for this, I was really excited to watch it. I got about 45 minutes into it when I realized that I had to go to work. I work at Blockbuster so I was telling everybody about this great movie coming out on Tuesday saying, "I'm only 45 minutes in but so far, it's really great!" Well, I finished it just now and I have to say, the ending wasn't all that great. I'm kind of upset because I really, REALLY liked the first hour but by the end, it was kind of mixed up and left me going, "I REALLY hope this isn't the end of the movie" and it was. Don't get me wrong, it's a "think about it after the movie is over" ending and I did but I really wish they would have ended it a bit better.<br /><br />Great Story - Great Beginning - Great Middle - Okay End
