Cheap (and I mean CHEAP; I don't know what they paid the actors, but the rest of the budget must have been around 50 dollars; it was shot on KODAK film stock!) softcore thriller is mostly talk, with minimal horror elements and a monotonous performance by Monique Parent. The director plays so much with the lighting that you would think the house where the action takes place is a disco. (*1/2)
