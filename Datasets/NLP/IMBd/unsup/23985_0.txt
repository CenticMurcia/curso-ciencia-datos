Considering that "Drive" is a low-budget and fairly unknown action flick from 1996, it has surprisingly amassed a small cult following in the years it's been on the home video after-market.<br /><br />Mark Dacascos, who was the main villain that was most recently seen duking it out with Jet Li in 2003's "Cradle 2 the Grave," has starred in a number of action movies throughout the '90s, but has yet to achieve any stardom.<br /><br />His character, Toby Wong, in this 1996 action thriller (that's straight out of Hong Kong, as is Dacascos' "Wong" character) apparently swims all the way to the United States, where he's forced to take an innocent bystander, Malik Brody (Kadeem Hardison), hostage. Toby must make it to Los Angeles to meet a courier and Malik is along for the ride.<br /><br />What Toby neglects to tell Malik in the haste of the moment when they first meet, is that he is an enhanced human, with a powerful bionic booster implant on his heart. This in turn opens up the door for many wild, frenetic action scenes, with Dacascos doing a number on the assorted villains hot on his trail.<br /><br />The movie hurtles from action sequence to action sequence, with deft direction from Steve Wang, who has yet to achieve mainstream success. This is by far the best show of Mark Dacascos and his martial arts action.<br /><br />10/10<br /><br />P.S.: Also, be on the lookout for a rather humorous supporting performance from Brittany Murphy as a bored, easily-excited teenager who is also brought along for the ride.
