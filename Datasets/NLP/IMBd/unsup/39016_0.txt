No plot, just melodrama, same stereotypes and same typecast actors in same crap no plot movie.<br /><br />Abhishek doesn't belong in a role opposite Ash, he is better placed behind a terminal at Wipro Infotech.<br /><br />On top of that who is that gay dude who comes as Vik to marry Ash and take her money. He is the son of Bhushan from Buiniyaad , yet another historical typecast fellow.<br /><br />The only thong missing was Alok Nath as a a overemotional uncle of Ash.<br /><br />...Aamir Khan
