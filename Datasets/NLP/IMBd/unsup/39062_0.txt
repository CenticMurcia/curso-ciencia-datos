Me and my friends rented this movie about a year ago, because we thought it was going to be a scary movie... We were wrong.. There was nothing scary about it at all.. The first 30 seconds where the "witch" where on her way home from the supermarket where fine, but once she came in to her house and we saw the boy trapped in some kind of jailcell, we where like, "what the hell is this?". Anyway.. The boy starts reading "scary" stories so that she wont kill him, and the first one is about a mummy coming back to life and starts killing people and kind of making them mummy's too.. The mummy looked a little gross, but that was the only "scary" thing about that story.. The second story was even worse... It was about a cat who killed people(!).. I think that says it all.. The third story.. well, I think it was about some weird monster with wings.. I'm not sure if it killed people or not, because I was still laughing about the killer-cat, so I wasn't really paying attention to the third story at all.. One thing that I do remember is that the monster looked very strange and fake.. The entire movie was silly, and the ending of the movie was very obvious.. The only good thing about this movie is Steve Buscimi, but not even he could save this silly b-horror movie.. I give it 2 stars out of 10.. At least you get a few good laughes..
