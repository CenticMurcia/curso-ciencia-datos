I loved National Lampoon's Van Wilder and Animal House so I thought "Oh, this must be an awesome movie!!" When me and my friend started it, we thought the beginning must be a lead in and the plot would start taking off soon. Unfortunately, this bullshit made up the entire movie. The acting in this movie was horrible-the guy couldn't act to save his life and is using his father's name to actually get parts in Hollywood. The girl's performance was okay, but she has basically screwed over her entire reputation because she chose to be in this movie. If you know what's right for you and don't want to waste $5 at Blockbusters, never ever rent and watch this movie.
