We can have the sense of freedom but are we actually free to do anything out of our own will? Maybe not everything. Like the title says 'The Phantom of Liberty', but who is liberated? The phantom? A phantom can be sensed but it has no existence. Bunuel is trying to send us a message through his film with a surrealistic touch that the idea of freedom that we think we have does not really exist. Bunuel's film goes against symmetry and he demonstrate it to us very well through this film. Everything is the opposite of what society wants us to be like. Bunuel creates these surrealistic films to raise eyebrows and for us to ask certain questions. The film was silly, shocking, entertaining and I had a great time watching it.
