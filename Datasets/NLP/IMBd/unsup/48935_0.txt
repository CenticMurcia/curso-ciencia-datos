I didn't know who directed the movie until the credits when the name Scorsese popped up, so I saw the movie without any expectations. I must say I wasn't very impressed. First off the infiltration of Costigan into Costello's gang happened way too fast and wasn't very convincing, just like the infiltration of Leo's character in Gangs of New York. Mark Wahlberg's character Dignam felt really fake, the kind of language he used was not very likely to be used by someone in his position, same goes for Baldwin's character capt. Ellerby. The love triangle drama was just pathetic, why would she date some ex con with drug problems when she's already moving in with Sullivan, a career cop who climbs the latter in the department like a sky rocket (i.e. very unlikely). They tried to portrait Costello as this big time mobster but the way he handled business felt more like a small time gangster, stealing pocket change from some corner shop.<br /><br />I haven't seen the original Infernal Affairs so I can't say weather or not this was worse, but I would really think so. The only part that surprised me positively was in the end when the other mull showed up and blew Costigans brains out, I didn't expect that one. That kind of woke me up, too bad it was just before the credits.
