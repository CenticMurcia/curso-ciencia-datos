I don't own the DVD (yet), but have seen this documentary on cable several times. It was quite interesting, but what drew my attention was the song played at the end called "Darkness Darkness." I have not been able to catch who sings the ballad or who wrote the song. By the time I can focus on the small print and see the song's name, the screen changes. Can anyone tell me who wrote the song, who sings it in this documentary, and if it is available? Thanks! :O)<br /><br />In addition, I would like to know what James Cameron sees in Bill Paxton. His acting in all his movies (if you call it acting) is truly awful. His narration in this documentary was just plain pathetic. His choice of words and his comments just did nothing for the documentary. All I kept saying to myself was "I wish he would shut up!" Mr. Cameron should have done the narration himself or at least chose someone else to do it...anyone other than Paxton. Other than that, this documentary was quite interesting to watch. The footage obtained was awesome. <br /><br />If anyone could help me with the music I've noted above, I would appreciate it. Thanks!! :o)
