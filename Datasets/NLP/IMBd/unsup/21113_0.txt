It certainly isn't love at first sight when two restaurant employees meet each other on a rainy night. She's an arrogant waitress who yells at customers and he's a shy and introvert cook who's reluctant to drive her home after work. But when they accidentally kill a crazed hitch hiker and hide her corpse, they discover murder is a mutual aphrodisiac and fall head-over-heels in love. However, their sex-life only properly functions when the blood of innocent women is shed and thus they start a vagina-stabbing killing spree across the city. Things get even more out of control when the shy cook turns into a unstoppable psychopath who goes out vag-stabbing all by himself. "Assault! Jack The Ripper" definitely is a mean-spirited and tremendously sleazy pinku classic, but in all honestly, I expected a little more spectacle considering its rough reputation. Due to budgetary restrictions, we sadly don't see how the women get stabbed in the crotch with the razor-sharp buttering knife, but the uncanny thrusting noises as well as the women's agonizing facial expressions leave very few to the imagination. The multiple sequences in which defenseless ladies are pursued, beaten, raped and eventually stabbed quite rank among the most misogynistic and relentless images ever shown on motion picture. I can't wait to see more movies from director Yasuharu Hasebe, as he seemed to specialize in ultra-violent pinku film, such as "Rape! The 13th Hour" and "Black Tight Killers". The two leads give away splendid performances and provide the film with steaming hot sex sequences, demented dialogs and blackly comical undertones. The odd and rather inappropriate disco-soundtrack is awesome and the cinematography is steady. The outrageous finale, in which the guy completely goes berserk and literally butchers a room full of young nurses, will be loved by all us depraved fans of extreme cinema.
