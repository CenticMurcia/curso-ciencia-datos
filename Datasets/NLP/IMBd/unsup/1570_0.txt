Interesting that when this show was made, it was two years before the Supreme Court Ruling June, 1963 Madyln Murray vs. whichever school district that eliminated prayer in public schools.<br /><br />(This is NOT intended to be an argument for or against the ruling).<br /><br />The United States has moved toward what this story is all about in the last 40 years.<br /><br />George Orwell would have loved Rod Serling.<br /><br />Watching this gave me the willies. <br /><br />How much has changed and it makes me wonder if the United States will move toward what Serling predicted.<br /><br />I think it will.
