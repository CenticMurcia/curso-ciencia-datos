Drivers Wanted is probably the funniest movie I have ever seen. It's light-hearted and feel-good, yet the humor is definitively and enjoyably "R-rated". How often do you get that combo? This movie follows the lives of some pizza delivery guys as they delve into what makes their job absolutely craptastic (and occasionally why it's not so bad, too). The premise and dialogue are so original, as the indie flare really makes this movie believable and not corny or forced. You have never seen a movie anything like this before, and unless you see Drivers Wanted, you never will. It's playing right now at the Regal in Henrietta, NY and you absolutely must see this movie if you are in the area.
