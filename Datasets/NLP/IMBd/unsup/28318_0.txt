i enjoyed the movie, i thought it was fun, entertaining and interesting. what bothers me about all these flamingly mean reviews is that these people seem to forget that this is a FIRST MOVIE FOR MOST OF THESE PEOPLE! David cross, his actors and crew did a great job and show a whole lot of potential even if they didn't get it ALL perfect first time around. I don't know ANYONE who ever got everything right on their first try. show me any of these vehement haters that did, and i will take their criticism. until then, enjoy this movie for what it is, a fun, low budget, horror movie! Keep an eye out for the sequel, and best of luck to all who worked on this film!
