I think this is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen. I kept watching waiting for a plot, my husband and I both missed a possible plot. So many things are left unanswered!! I feel like I just woke up from a bad dream and now I'll spend the rest of my evening confused and trying to figure it out. I don't even know if I can tell you what the movie was about I'm so confused but I'll tell you what I know. This guy is in this apartment building where no one acts normal at all. The neighbors are strange, and even the guy at the grocery store is strange. He pays high prices for small items at the grocery store....which is odd, who pays 90 bucks for a gallon of milk? He is trying to figure out what is going on around him and then comes this pretty lame explanation and a very strange ending to the movie. As you are still waiting for them to answer so many questions that have been brought up by the attempt at a plot.....the movie ends...we actually had to check the chapters left on the DVD to see if that was REALLY the end!!!<br /><br />I wouldn't waste my time with this film unless you like "fill in the blank" movies!
