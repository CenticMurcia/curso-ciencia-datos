We did not catch the start of this but were gripped to the end, mainly by the superb acting of the two principal women. They are both lawyers on the same side, the husband of one of them has been murdered in a supermarket robbery. The film shows the process of bringing the accused to justice. Much of the detail escapes me now, but I was captivated by the way in which the principals hammered out their working relationship, which was not without its problems. The acting was first-rate, controlled and very realistic - the scene in which the widowed woman reaches the end of her tether after maintaining steely control of herself for so long, and bursts into unstoppable tears, had my wife and I weeping in sympathy.<br /><br />It is rare that a story which starts as a million nondescript thrillers have started, goes on to involve its people in such a realistic and well-thought-out series of events. I am surprised that only one other reviewer seems to echo our sentiments.
