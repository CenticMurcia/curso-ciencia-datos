It may be confusing, and it may be a bit strange, but I recorded The Christmas Martian off TV years ago - it was an instant classic! I just love the funny effects used (such as a handheld floating device which resembles a match stick!).<br /><br />I can't completely explain why I like this film so much, but it's just so funny!<br /><br />Anyone who likes stupid films (films which were intended to be for children, but no-one can understand) should definitely see this!
