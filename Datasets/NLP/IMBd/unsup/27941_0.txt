"Darna Mana Hai" is about 7 friends on a road trip that get a flat tire at night and are stranded when they realize they have no jack. One has seen a light in the distance (in the jungle) and all except one go to find what it is, and it's an old ruin with a lighted lantern. They make a fire and settle down & to pass the time, they tell each other ghost stories, and most of the film is the visualization of those stories, although from time to time someone must wander away from the fire for some reason or another, and all seem to be meeting with unexpected demises. The stories themselves range from creepy and eerie to somewhat whimsical and silly at times, but all are fairly effective and keep the viewer's interest. No singing and dancing in this film, except with the opening and closing credits; this one is all about keeping the scary atmosphere. There is sort of a "pretty boy/pretty girl" cast, but at least they're not smoking joints or swilling beer around the campfire like in American films. Overall this is a pretty enjoyable and effective film, and I'd recommend it to anyone seeking something different to watch. 8 out of 10.
