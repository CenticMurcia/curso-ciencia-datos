This was an absolutely brilliant show, the character Azazeal had to be my favourite. Michael Fassbender is such a brilliant actor, and his good-looks kept me watching this show. However, after Azazeal leaves Malachi to fulfil his destiny on his own, i continued watching the show! I would definitely like another season to see what happens after the finale of the second season. I'm not at all religious, but the religious side of the story made the plot more interesting for me. I didn't particularly see Azazeal as truly evil, even though he was supposed to be. I mean, he was still like-able as a character despite the things he did.<br /><br />My least favourite character has to be Roxanne, she seemed like a dressed-up little tart only after one thing...sex! She was a waste of time and i'm glad she is killed off. This is one show that i'll definitely watch time and time again
