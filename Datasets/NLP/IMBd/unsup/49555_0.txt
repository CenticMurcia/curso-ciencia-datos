Now here we have a really bad pretentious dutch 'artistic'(come on !!!) 'movie' this boring P.O.S is soo revealing as to where it is going... This guy made another dutch classic called 'Philene is sorry' with the same actress , Kim van Kooten ' and that film was maybe worse , but this one comes in close.I Cannot believe that his films are being taken seriously.it is supposed to be a film about a guy filming his sister in video format while he is constantly talking frustrated text into the mic.commenting on his sisters behaviour before the lens. very corny is the transition between scenes in which he shows us some ' noise ' perfectly put into the montage...it is to give you the impression of spontaneousness .This as well is how this product (the film 'zusje') comes to an end.with Noise. Dutch critics , especially' at pretentious film festivals in the lowlands hail these kind of films as very interesting , creative and totally ' now '. It makes you shiver.
