The film started of quite good with the title song and had cameos of 14 actresses including Malaika Arora, Amrita Arora, Sophie Chaudhary, Neha Dhupia, Celina Jaitly, Ryiya Sen, Dia Mirza, Koena Mitra, Shamita Shetty, Minnisha Lamba and so on. When the baby arrived then got really funny although you didn't need any brains just sit back & laugh. The baby was so precious, wonderful, adorable, and lovable. First half was good it really made me laugh & cry but in the second half when Vidia Balan came then got quite boring for some reason maybe because she spoiled it even Shah Rukh Khan's special appearance couldn't save it.<br /><br />There is nothing new it's just the same old comedy and makes no difference whether you watch it or not. Inspired from Three men and a baby I can't remember when I saw it because it was a very forgettable film as well as this one. Music is OK the only good songs are the title song, Hey Baby by the Girl Band and Jaane Bhi De. 2007 is not a good year for Bollywood movies as 2006 e.g. Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, Don, Krrish, Dhoom 2. I've seen a lot of movies of 2007 and I only liked a few.
