This is a vile movie, one that I can't wait to take to the trade-in store. Good thing I got it cheap at the flea market. So how do I describe this (besides vile?) Science fiction porno? Certainly there were many things in this NOT left to the imagination and I definitely didn't need to see them. I guess this is sort of a no-budget Blade Runner in a cheap adult motel instead of a fantastic futuristic city. Because there are robots that look like people. There's this one chick that's a computer hacker and her 'pleasure model' girlfriend that has orgasms when she blinks, she says. There's a rogue cop who was killed in an accident and then "Robo-copped" together to be a killing machine, and he has sixteen tongues grafted onto his body to replace his burned skin, so as you can imagine he doesn't look very "GQ". There are tons of "adult movie" themes trotted out for your viewing displeasure, all quite disgusting. Good taste is never a factor in what's included in this movie, and while that generally is no deterrent for me, there are some places where I just have to draw the line. And this is supposedly from the folks that did "Shatter Dead" which I liked a lot? What in the hell were they thinking? Bleah.....2 out of 10 stars.
