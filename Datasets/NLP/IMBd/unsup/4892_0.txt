Ron Howard directed his "Happy Days" co-star Henry Winkler in this wacky story of two men turning a morgue into a brothel. Winkler plays discontented employee Chuck Lumley, whose life seems to be going nowhere. But when opportunistic Billy Blazejowski (Michael Keaton) takes a job in the morgue, things change for the crazier.<br /><br />It's especially neat that this movie turned Michael Keaton into a star (Howard would go on to direct him in "Gung Ho" and "The Paper"). The first time that I'd seen this movie's title and didn't know anything about the movie, I assumed that it was a horror movie. But it's not; it's a super-hilarious comedy. Michael Keaton has some truly wacky lines (namely his comment about the photograph, his license plate, and his question in police detention). Also starring are Shelley Long as Chuck's hubby Belinda Keaton, Richard Belzer (Henry Winkler's cousin) as one of the bad guys, Ron Howard's brother Clint as a client, and Kevin Costner in his film debut. There is also character actor Vincent Schiavelli, who died yesterday. I'm sure that he's now up in that great cinema in the sky, taking pride in his filmography - including "Night Shift". 10/10.
