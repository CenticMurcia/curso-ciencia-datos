Renting this video, I obviously didn't think it was going to be on my top-ten-list, but all the comments on the cover fooled me a little (as so many times before). Most of the budget for this movie must have been emphasized on buying clips from other movies, such as "Cliffhanger" and "Long Kiss Goodnight". After watching these movies (among others) the directors/scriptwriters probably used some of the best scenes and built a story around it... which would later result in a totally crap-movie, with Treat Williams trying to come up with one-liners all the time. It's very clear which are the clips from other films, since both the quality of the film and the actors change between scenes. However, my friend and I laughed our lungs out while watching. How can a film actually let be rented if on the cover it doesn't say that it's mostly a mixture of other films? Maybe we laughed o much because it was a shock.. that we weren't prepared, so maybe you won't laugh as much once you've read this.. but seriously, once you've seen this film you must look back and laugh at the crappy "bear-klls-human"-scene.
