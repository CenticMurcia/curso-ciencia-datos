Putting aside whether or not it was funny, or had a political message behind it, or whether it is more pertinent than ever in todays political climate and the upcoming 2008 elections... It is a classic tale of love, money, and the American struggle to get ahead at all costs.<br /><br />The clinch for me, was the fact that the protagonist's motives were NOT motivated by any lofty political idealism or love of humanity, but entirely financial... And the unsurprising, yet nonetheless stunning, twist at the end will surely put this movie in it's rightful place in Hollywood history.<br /><br />- http://nickysworld.net
