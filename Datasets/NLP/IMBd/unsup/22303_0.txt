I love Red Dwarf! The basic gist of the show is Dave Lister, the last human alive, trying to make his way back to Earth. (Honestly, it makes sense if you watch it.) He is the last surviving human and only remaining member of the crew of the Jupiter Mining Corporation Ship "Red Dwarf". Trapped 3 million years away from Earth, Dave has only three companions to keep him "sane": Arnold Rimmer, a hologram projection of a previous crew mate; Holly, the ships senile and generally rubbish computer; and Cat, a humanoid creature who evolved from Listers pet cat. All sounds very confusing, doesn't it? But believe me if you watch it, everything will make sense. In the third series, the crew are joined by an android, Kryten, who has a manic obsession with cleaning and helping, which leads to yet more hilarious consequences. Their escapades take them to all sorts of mysterious planets and cultures including those of the GELFs, Psirens and even a backwards version of Earth! But will they ever get back to Earth???
