Comically bad.<br /><br />I watched it for the "Louis Gosset Jr." scene but I didn't get to see it.<br /><br />Otherwise I would have given it a 3.<br /><br />The LGJ-Scene is like in Iron Eagle I and Toy Soldiers where there's some kid who's in waaaaaay over his head and the guys in charge are about to give up, but then LGJ says...<br /><br />"This kid is different! I believe in him! He can be trusted to take on terrorists OR fly a billion-dollar jet into enemy territory, you got to trust me!" and sure enough, he always sways their opinion.<br /><br />The 80's rocked.
