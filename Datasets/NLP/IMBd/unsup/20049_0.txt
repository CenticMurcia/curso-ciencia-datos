This is probably the best film of its type I have seen, I have watched the film twice and can not understand why it has not been released on general release, DVD or video. I understand it was a TV movie but it is a classic film and I would like to purchase the film so that others can watch with me. I have spoken to countless people about this film and everyone remembers the film. It is a sad, emotion filled film. The end scene brought tears to the eyes and I am surprised that it is not scheduled for viewing more than it is. I commend this film to all, in the hope that someday it may be released for sale to the general public.
