I am the son, yes the son of Tacey Robbins. I have to tell you that I thought it was a miracle that Al and Tacey pulled off this movie. They had $2000, and a bunch of contributers who wanted to see Al's movie career and Tacey's singing career blossom. It took months to shoot it, and in my opinion, it was the perfect "C" movie for the cheese/sleeze era. It had a super cheezy plot, and wonderful music to accompany it. Remember, it was supposed to be a spoof on Go-Go girls who drove men crazy. Well, even the songs were meant to be spoofs and the whole idea is to make it fun and "cult-serious". YES, the acting wasn't perfect, and of course the movie was not without potholes, but I am telling you, as far as the movies of the time, Tacey and Al did a great job putting it all together and making it "campy" and goofy like it was intended. If you take this movie serious, you are wasting your time watching it, or you are some moron who just graduated from the New York School of Movie Ratings and need to find a new job.
