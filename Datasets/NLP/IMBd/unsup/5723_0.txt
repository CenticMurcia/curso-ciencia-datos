I discovered this cartoon rather late in life, like at about 50. I had looked for it unsuccessfully based on a description a neighbor girl gave me when I was 23. She said it was the best cartoon in the universe and then did the "I Love to Singa" dance.<br /><br />Thank God for the internet! It was one of my first real search efforts and I found it! At the time, it was viewable on the Warners Brothers site but I am not sure that's still the case. I now have it on a video taped from a Tex Avery marathon years ago.<br /><br />There is nothing so sad in life that Owl Jolson can't make it a little better. Tex, if they have issued you a laptop in heaven, THANKS PAL! I love you!
