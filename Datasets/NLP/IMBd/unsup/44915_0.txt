... But not in a good way .<br /><br />I saw HAWK THE SLAYER many years ago and couldn`t remember much about it except for the bizarre funky soundtrack . After seeing it again tonight I have to confess it`s a very poor sword and sorcery film but aren`t they all unless Peter Jackson is the director ? In which case I shouldn`t be too cruel <br /><br />But there`s no getting away from the fact that this movie is a yawn inducing experience . There`s no character development because there`s no characters just a bunch of one dimensional cyphers like a giant who is ver big , a dwarf who is very greedy and a elf who ... well what does the elf do ? You see the cyphers are terribly underwritten so I`ll be kind when I say the actors do their best with non existent material though by a cruel irony we see Jack Palance ( An actor at his very best when saying nothing ) getting far too much in the way of ludicurous lines <br /><br />There is one aspect to the film that does deserve serious criticism and that`s the editing . Look at the fight scene where the elf is leaping around firing arrows at the bad guys . It looks like he`s jumping in the air four or five times while doing so . Only thing is that it is supposed to a single leap . Got the idea ? I could give several other examples of this inept editing <br /><br />As for the music , disco was popular when this movie was made in 1980 so I guess that`s why it was composed to go with this movie . Am I the only person who was glad that a rap band didn`t do the music for FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING ? Am I the only person glad that a nu metal band didn`t do the music for THE TWO TOWERS ? Am I the only person glad that Simon Cowell didn`t find a a pretty boy singer to do the music for RETURN OF THE KING ?<br /><br />" I`m sorry Hawk but looking all homo erotic while riding a horse through a forest against a disco soundtrack just doesn`t do it for me . What does Paula think ? "
