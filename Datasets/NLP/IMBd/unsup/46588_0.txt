I saw a really bad softcore porn/giallo flick last week and it's staying with me. Curse Of Ursula [1978]. It's just unbelievable and could only have come from Italy in the 1970's. It's about these 2 sisters who go and stay at a resort hotel. One sister is frustrated & oversexed and likes to strip in front of the other (to cheesy softcore porn music); the other is hysterical & repressed and obsessed with her dead daddy. You'll howl over the hilarious opening scene where one sis strips off all her clothes (including her sexy lingerie) in front of the other, while said other, with a fixed, disapproving scowl on her face, unpacks teddy bears, pictures of Daddy in wrought iron frames, and... a huge wooden dildo? They don't call it Eurotrash for nothing my friends. Now you would think the "horror" in this flick is represented by the gruesome sex murders but the real horror of this movie is embodied by "Stella Shining" a so-called "entertainer" who looks like a coke whore and who evidently only knows one unforgettably terrible song. I have been taunting my cats with it for days now, even emulating the singer's voice and gestures. There should be a camera running in this place.<br /><br />The scene where the sexy sister masturbates with her jewelry is supposed to be erotic but I was laughing.<br /><br />I can't be sure, but I think all the women in the movie were wearing matching merkins. They must've been on sale or something.<br /><br />The thing that makes giallo films great is surprising, if sometimes rather unbelievable, plot twists. No surprises from Ursula. You'll figure out who the killer is right away.<br /><br />This truly bad, stupid, softcore flick must be seen to be believed, but only when you are ready for extreme trash. You know who you are. Enjoy.
