I didn't expect much from an unpublicised Disney "sequwl" type movie, but I'm glad i took a chance. Having enjoyed Knightley's acting in several other films, and curious as to her performance in the lead, I settled down with the kids to watch it.<br /><br />What we found was charming, fast paced film full of the usual Disney comedy, twists and heroics. Keira's boyish enthusiasm from Bend It Like Beckham is evident here too as she runs about with the Merry Men. The other most impressive roles were the villains, whose over the top yet convincing performances add to that Disney feel.<br /><br />i'd recommend any kids to watch it, or even an adult in need of a bit of fun.
