I can't believe I wasted money to rent this. I'm a casual fan of Anna Ferris but I can't understand why she would do this movie. If you want to compare this to anything, it seems to be an attempt at creating a modern day "Reefer Madness" but it's not even close to enjoyable. Everything is going wrong for the main character, Mary, played by Anna Ferris. The typical formula when a movie goes in this direction is that some kind of epiphany or chance event propels the character towards a resolution of there problems. I watched the entire movie only to be sadly disappointed at how it resolved these problems. To be quite honest the message delivered is "smoke pot and your world will be destroyed by its affects". The movie at times severely exaggerates the effects of marijuana to include visual hallucinations that are more comparable to psychedelic drugs like LSD. Also, the main character exhibits a stronger than normal addiction to pot that makes it appear to be more of a physical addiction like crack or heroin, rather than psychological as is more commonly considered by the scientific community. For the uninformed movie watcher it would serve as a strong, yet grossly misleading, deterrent against pot use. For someone who is informed it's impossible to relate to the main character because of the exaggerated affects it portrays. I was even a little angry because I suspect that the movie's marketing is aimed specifically at "stoners" as evidenced by the box cover and the casting (Ferris and Danny Masterson who have appeared in films and shows that are popular in the pot culture). Simply stated, if you are a "stoner" you are going to hate this movie. If your not a "stoner" you will find it very unfunny.
