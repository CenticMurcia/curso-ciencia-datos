When I first watched this movie, I felt like it is just one of those movies that I would give a 6 score. But I found myself watching this movie again and again. As conversations or question of immortality arises, I found myself quoting or referencing the movie.<br /><br />Because the movie is so watchable after so many viewings, I think this is a classic movie. It is about two woman trying to steal a man and fighting over their differences and jealousy. These woman wants to pursue immortality while another man wants to choose mortality and live a full life. It is the question of superficiality and immortality that struck me deep. The other issue is the desire to find that fountain of youth at the same time. The issues are as old as time. How do you feel when someone comes to you and say "You are old!". That was one of the phrases when a young man complains to Meryl Streep. These are some of the things you will ponder.<br /><br />Bruce Willis really surprise me this one as he no longer plays the tough man image. While Goldie Hawn and Meryl Streep play great opposite roles as the two jealous fighting women who fight over differences and yet have to live together inspite of it. Yes, I have people I really detest and must live with them. Therefore, a lot of issues in this movie really hits me deep.
