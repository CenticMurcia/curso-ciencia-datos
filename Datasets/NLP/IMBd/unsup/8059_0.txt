In 1976 or 1977 my wife and I saw this movie in Paris. It was called Paris Nonstop at the time. It was not a Ferrari at all. It was a motorcycle and began, as I recall, by showing the motorcycle with the camera mounted off to the side. Same movie. Look at this one, by the way, and notice the "Ferrari" charging up a narrow street and approaching a truck on the right side. There is a woman on the sidewalk to the left with about 3 feet or so between the curb and the truck. The motorcycle does slow a bit, then tears through the narrow opening and acceleratesÂ—no chance it was a car of any description. Leaving that aside, as you watch whatever it was blowing red light after red light and blasting pigeons in every direction, you don't need to get huffy about how fast he might have been going. He was going way too fast for where he went. Note: No pigeons were (apparently) hurt in the making of this movie.
