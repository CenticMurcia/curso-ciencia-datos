This movie came out when I was 17 and I remember going to the Midnight Movie on Ridge Road in Griffith, IN. Everyone in the theater was also in high school or just out. It is what it is, a silly movie with great music. I was the designated driver and therefore was not drunk or high as my friends were. My other friend was also a DD and even though we didn't get the same "feeling" from it as our drunken friends, we did really enjoy the music and watching some people get sick and in a few cases pee on themselves. If you are looking for some intellectual Dumbo jumbo, move along. However, if you're looking for a cartoon with great music than go ahead and watch this. At 44, I don't consider myself part of the "older generation" but I guess at 17 I probably thought it was. I'm not old, your music today really does suck!
