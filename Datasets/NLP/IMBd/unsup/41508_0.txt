If you've seen the entire movie then you have a better constitution than everybody gives you credit for. The acting was, simply put, the worst I've ever seen and even the synchro was bad, well, for the ten minutes I really saw of it. Now, I could bore you with countless comment on how this movie blows but let's just simply ignore this one and move on with our life, it's better this way. And who the hell names a character Michael Dorn???
