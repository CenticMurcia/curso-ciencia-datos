Enough!! Get over yourself! You seem to harbor the delusion that television is obligated to YOU to be honest and forthcoming. You expect truth and respect from a medium that continually demonstrates it is incapable of either. A medium that places cameras everywhere, and makes it known to the participants; a medium that terms it's programming "reality TV" when NOBODY is real when they know they are being watched, appeals to the stupid among us. You seem to be well-educated, yet not bright enough to simply ignore network crap. You clearly have greater issues to deal with than to waste your time railing against the superficial perceptions of a "give the public what it wants" producer of a formula TV series.<br /><br />You fell in love with the series, and now you know better - move on. You were never part of the target audience; you simply thought you were. Learn to pick your battles - you can't win this one, because your opinion is irrelevant to them. As you must know by now, THEY DON'T CARE!!<br /><br />I wish you well in dealing with the circumstance you find yourself in, and know that my prayers are with you. You have a bright mind, and you are better served using it to deal with what is real around you. Network television deserves no attention from you - you're better than that.<br /><br />Focus yourself elsewhere; you're better than you think.
