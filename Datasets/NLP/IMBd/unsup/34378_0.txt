This is a b-movie to the smallest detail. Our hero is a former war hero and current race car driver(Can you be more macho?!). When he hears of his brother's troubles, he immediately comes to his aid(As any true man of action would!). And after being caught, beaten up and electrocuted you would think that he's done for. But think again!<br /><br />Not only does kill half an army, but he manages to turn ordinary students into a guerilla army.<br /><br />This movie has almost everything a b-movie requires: Dumb violence, heroes & bad guys and the obligatory sex scene between a our hero and a student.<br /><br />But it needs one liners! It takes itself too seriously, and that is a huge mistake. It makes the movie kind of pathetic when it could have been excellent entertainment.<br /><br />But hey! If you need to watch something without using your brain this is not a bad idea. Enjoy!
