This movie fails on many levels. The plot is non-sensical, the heroes aren't heroic, the humor is humorless, nothing is really explained. Maybe it's a Chinese thing, but the dead becoming zombies becoming vampires? Vampires that suck blood like a Hoover? Why can't wax zombies move their legs independently? The "Vampire Hunters" seem to be only "Vampire Finders" as they run away whenever confronted! Parts of the movie look like poor send ups of Michael Jackson's "Thriller" video. I am glad I am part of a movie club and didn't pay good money to rent this. Save yourself some time and aggravation and put this back on the shelf and move on.
