I got this in Canada, through Amazon.com...<br /><br />They say that "Automaton Transfusion" is the "Holy Grail of indie horror films". And that it was a miracle for being shot for $30,000. I guess those folks didn't see THIS movie miracle.<br /><br />I think Delivery was shot for around $4500?, somewhere in that range. I mean..they spent what producers spend in sodas and bubble gum in ONE day of shooting in a real film set.<br /><br />And the film looks great, in fact, better than most $60,000 and up micro budget films.<br /><br />Character development?, in a horror film?, who knew there were people that still used that.... Delivery takes its time, it makes you work for it, but if you know what you are getting into, you'll find something there, you'll find true smart film-making behind the silly situations and cheesy effects.<br /><br />An awesome performance by the lead, who is dead on perfect for the film. Lets see what these guys can do with an actual budget.<br /><br />Very good, very entertaining, very well done for the budget, huge congratulations!
