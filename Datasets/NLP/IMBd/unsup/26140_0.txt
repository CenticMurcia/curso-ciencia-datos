I used to be a big fan of horror movies, but got tired of the usual slasher movies produced today. What made Head Case so appealing to me is that not only is it realistic, but the premise of it is entirely possible and I admit, while sitting in the theater enjoying this independent thriller, I ran through a mental list of my own neighbors. It's gory, exciting, humorous at times....all in all, it's the best horror movie I have seen in years. I applaud Anthony Spadaccini for coming up with an original idea and also applaud the cast who did such a wonderful job portraying these characters. The movie will not disappoint, but it will leave you wondering exactly where the main character ended up and exactly what (and I'm not sure I really want to know) happened to the daughter.
