The main character may be a bit boring, but there are some terrific performances by Connery, DeNiro and i even like Garcia, (normally i can't stand the guy). Also great action sequences masterfully directed by DePalma, and some great setpieces. Watch for the dinner-table sequence with DeNiro holding his baseballbat: an instant classic.
