Did anyone else get the vibe, at the start of the movie, that the vampires were a commentary on the Jewish people? Or am I looking too much into a B- movie...? The first glimpse we get of the vampire community is a WW2 style vampire safe house, complete with said period's costumes, and the NSA's costumes are very Nazi-like. And there's the whole 'we fear them because they're a different 'ethnicity'' thing. This may have been a theme started in the movie, but of course, was forgotten as the film underwent several style-changes (by which I mean, it went off on a tangent to rip off some other movies) But yeah, as mentioned above, there were lots of scenes that paid homage to (see...ripped off) Brazil, Blade, The Matrix, Tarantino,..even Highlander. A mucky piece of work, with too many genre stereotypes, and what was with Woodbine's gruff, 'bad boy' voice?
