This is quite the movie. It's a total rip off of KING KONG only it's done Asian style like the old GODZILLA movies so you know it's gonna be super cheesy. Basically some dudes set out to capture this giant ape man and must take a dangerous mission through the jungle. They encounter lots of deadly wild animals along the way and a bunch of em get killed. There's actually a couple relatively good deaths. Eventually the main dude is on his own and finds a hot retarded chick who is good homies with the mighty Xing Xing Wang. Anyway despite monkey man helping homeboy out and the dude getting to hook up with the hot wild woman he and his "partners" end up doing what they set up to do and capture the monkey. Of course this pisses off Xing Xing Wang and tons of destruction follows. I don't usually bother with most PG rated movies but this one's pretty damn funny and it's got plenty of cheesy action. It's too bad we don't get to see the main chick naked. At least she's dressed pretty skimpy. So if you like GODZILLA style monster movies or have kids it's worth a look you'll definitely get some laughs out of it.
