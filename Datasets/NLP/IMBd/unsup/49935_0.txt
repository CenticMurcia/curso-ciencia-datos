Do not be fooled. This movie is terrible. It looks like a humorous situational comedy involving two men who need to change places to evade the police. It is not. The movie stumbles between a horrible crime who done it and cheep slapstick comedy. The movie's main fault lies in that no scene lasts for more than twenty seconds, and as a result does not allow for any jokes. This is a comedy with out jokes. If you take jokes away from a comedy your left with nothing, no plot, no characters, no entertainment. Nothing. Do not watch this movie under any circumstances. If someone tries tells you this is a good movie hit them with a pointed stick and say, NO! If you watch this understand what you're getting into and don't say I didn't warn you.
