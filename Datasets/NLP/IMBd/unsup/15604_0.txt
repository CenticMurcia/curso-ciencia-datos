W.S. Van Dyke seems to be having a blast directing this madcap comedy that brings together one of the most endearing couple of the cinema: Myrna Loy and William Powell.<br /><br />"I Love You Again" starts aboard a Trans Atlantic crossing where we meet Larry Wilson. He is a tight man with his money, as shown at the ship's bar where his penny pinching is embarrassing. After an accident lands him on the water, Larry suffers a blow to the head and he becomes amnesiac, reverting into a former self, a con artist. With the help of his new best friend, Doc Ryan, he realizes he's struck gold. He's rich!<br /><br />Little prepares Larry for what awaits him on arrival in New York. His wife, Kay, is at the pier! Nothing makes sense of Larry, and thus begins a game of catch up with his new persona. Along the way, Kay and Larry battle because she doesn't want any part of the stingy Larry. We watch Kay as suddenly falling for Larry as he seems a changed man. Love will win in the end!<br /><br />William Powell plays the double personality man Larry Wilson/George Carey, with his usual flair. Myrna Loy is shown at her best. She showed such a beauty and sophistication in the film that's hard to imagine anyone else playing Kay. Frank McHugh is excellent as Larry's would be partner-in-crime. Edmund Lowe and Donald Douglas are good as well.<br /><br />The movie is a lot of fun and will reward anyone watching it.
