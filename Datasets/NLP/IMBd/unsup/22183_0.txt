23rd April 1992, the first day of my long awaited holiday to Hong Kong. I'm alone, 1000's of miles from home, very tired after the long flight. What should I do, go to my nice huge hotel bed, heck no, Cinema here I come. Hard Boiled is the movie I choose to see, I enjoyed The Killer so why not. Two hours later I was wide awake! What a MAD film, I need more! The bed won the arguement this time, but I'm glad that this was the first movie I ever saw in a Hong Kong cinema, it was everything I expected and more. This is another MUST SEE movie.
