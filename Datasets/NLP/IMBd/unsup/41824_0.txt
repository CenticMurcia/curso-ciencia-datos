No budget "drama" about a bunch of uninteresting gay and straight Latino guys in NYC.<br /><br />This film just does about everything wrong. First of all--the title. When you give a film that title you're almost promising the audience this is either going to be high camp or a sex movie. It's neither. We're supposed to take this as a serious drama. Think about this--"Latin Boys Go To Hell" and "serious drama". It doesn't exactly mix. The plot is a predictable yawner about a gay guy after a straight guy. This plot has been done to death and is so old. Also, the straight guy isn't even remotely good-looking but the cute gay guy is in love with him. Also, except for some mild butt shots, there's no nudity or sex--although the poster has one of the hunky actors with his shirt off. The dialogue is lame, the pace of the film is too slow (even at 71 minutes) and most of the acting is abysmal.<br /><br />If you're going to do a film about gay Latinos have a little something more interesting to tell (and show). A definite 1.
