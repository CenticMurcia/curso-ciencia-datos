My favorite B-movie. If you're a referential person you'll be quoting lines from this movie into your golden years. "Head! Pants now!" I also love the cameos of Allan Arkin, Steven Wright, Phil Hartman and especially Charles Grodin. I can't tell you how many people don't realize Mike Myers plays the role of the Father in addition.
