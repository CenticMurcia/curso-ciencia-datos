Another feeble attempt from an idea-bankrupt Hollywood to cash in on past classics (Guess Who's Coming to Dinner) and recent successes (Meet the Parents). It puts nothing new on the table. All the jokes are predictable and stale, and the subject itself is somewhat offensive since it seems to (yet again, as in "Taxi" or "Hitch") justify racially-tinged humor at white guys without taking the same swipes at the other races dishing it out. In other words, it's just Hollywood making another safe bet. But irrespective of that, it's just not a funny movie. Bernie Mac is not a chuckle-inducing actor. His entire repertoire consists of making funny faces and acting aghast when confronted with a sitcom-like situation, which in the real world most of us would brush off as a problem barely worthy of consideration. And Ashton Kutcher is a total dud. He's also a one-note actor, like Bernie Mac in a way because his acting range also consists solely of gulps and looks of surprise in response to stupid, artificial situations. Bad movie. Only for dummies with no discriminating palettes.
