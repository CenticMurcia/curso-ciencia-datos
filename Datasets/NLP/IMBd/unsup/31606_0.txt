I FINALLY received the DVD of a movie I have loved through the years. While we can all regale each other with stories of Miss Ross' idiosyncrasies, one thing is patently clear: She WORKED this movie and this is the best singing I have EVER heard from her (or since, for that matter and I was a Die-hard Supermes fan!) It is also especially wonderful to see some wonderful African-American treasures like Richard Pryor, Billy Dee, Isabel Sanford, Scatman Scrothers, among others. (I wish I knew Lorraine's name as the quintessential madam who was positively flawless!!!!) The production values are superior and the sound recreated for the DVD was a MUST because the movie is based on music. Listening to Diana sing "The Man I Love" and hear Billy Dee say "You want my arm to fall off?!" is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />I haven't even had a chance to look at the special features or deleted scenes which I am sure will round out what I consider to be a classic African-American feature.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend!!!
