A bunch of REAL annoying college students are driving to Las Vegas. Their car breaks down on a deserted road and they search for help. They find a big old ranch house, in the middle of nowhere, with a VERY strange family who love killing...<br /><br />Sound familiar? Absolutely pointless rehash of "Texas..." minus the story, characterization and scares. This also has the gratuitous female nudity and the now requisite lesbian couple (notice we never see a gay male couple?). This is incredibly cheap with glaring continuity errors left and right--notice how one girl runs past the exact same tree twice in a row!!! The story is entirely predictable with some extremely stupid "twists" in it. Also these kids are killed off...for no reason whatsoever! Granted they're ALL annoying but I would at least like a reason! <br /><br />The acting, at first, was so bad I almost switched this off. Worst of all is Alan Ritchson--he plays such a totally obnoxious character (and badly) that I wondered why all these people hung out with him. As the movie progressed, Tom Nagel (as Adam) and Catherine Wreford (as Rachel) actually improved and ended up giving two not bad performances. Everybody else was hopeless.<br /><br />Stupid, sick, sadistic and utterly worthless horror movie. The only truly scary thing about this is that it was made. Skip it.
