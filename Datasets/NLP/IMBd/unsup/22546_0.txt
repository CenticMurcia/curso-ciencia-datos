I have to wonder if this was based on a comic (Manga?) because it seems lots of Japanese films are. This seems like that sort of material but since I don't read those I can't be sure. This takes place in an ugly future Japan where everyone lives underground in some giant building with 200 stories. The travel from one level to the next by a system of huge elevators, and on this particular day a young girl named Luchino and her drug-addled friend happen to board this particular elevator & are treated to a stop at level 99 for the pick up of a couple prisoners, both of whom are highly dangerous. Of course I don't have to provide a spoiler to tell you what happens after that, unless you've never seen a movie before. There also happens to be a little explosion, a little explosion caused by the cigarette that Luchino dropped when being pursued by surveillance for having an illegal substance, which doesn't particularly mix well with some fuel that got spilled. So now these folks are trapped in the elevator. There's a housewife with a baby carriage and a businessman and a guy with headphones & shades sitting on the floor, seemingly oblivious to all. There's also the elevator operator, a young lady in uniform who has been "trained to deal with adverse situations". Apparently she's never encountered a real one, though. Luchino brings to the table something else: she's psychic and can see into each and every one of these people and what she sees isn't pretty. Anyway, while they're all trapped in the elevator, Luchino does the usual Japanese school girl violence thing (that is, if you've watched a lot of Japanese movies) and it's not pretty either. Evemtually what is left of this little band of people is rescued, Luchino is arrested for various crimes, and this leads up to a twist ending that was quite surprising. I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes Japanese sci-fi & horror.
