So the basic premise is a stage illusionist gets girls on stage and basically mangles them, but hey presto there OK at the end. But then they die shortly afterwards with the same wounds that they got during the act. That's about it, oh and there's a 'twist' at the end. I cannot help but compare HGL with Ed Wood. The similarities are all too obvious for all to see. Question is are they trying to be badly made or are they just badly made? I've no idea but I get the feeling HGL knew what he was doing, and through that I feel cheated. It wouldn't have hurt to put a bit more effort in. The gore is there naturally (in fact the title probably refers to HGL rather than the illusionist), but most of it could be created in your own kitchen. There's a whole 'what is reality' thing going on which is never properly addressed, which it should have been if that was his point. I've seen an interview with HGL in which he came across very well, but I think it's more the case of him talking a good movie rather than delivering one. I love low budget movies but this one has no style and the narrative jars at every corner. Will I try another HGL movie? Yeah probably, I'm a sucker for pap and maybe one day I'll get it. A mildly diverting oddity.
