A group of people located at a work station in the artic are the first to bear witness to the end of the world. However the group is divided into so many different factions(the company man,the conservationist,the spiritualist etc.)that none of them are truly connected to whats actually happening. As things progress from bad to worse each succumbs to their own belief with wild and unpredictable results. You can draw your conclusions about this movie the same way you might structure you foundation of thoughts that make you the person you are but in the end nothing is certain.Therefor its all conjecture and subject to debate and question. Such is the basis for Last Winter. I believe that if we are to see the end it wont look anything like weve come to know or expect. The spirits of the tundra that some see in this movie are seen because that it is what their mind has resorted to in the end. Delusions. I do agree that Last Winter was somewhat flawed here and there but overall I was blown away. Its a crushingly oppressive movie that should make you feel uneasy. I wouldn't mind a directors cut not for more action but more subtext. The performances were good with the exception of Ron Perlman who just needed to tone it down a hair. Last Winter has amazing moments of sustained tension that made me want to cower in fear. The few action scenes are hard and fast and have more of an impact if they had been wall to wall from start to finish. I strongly recommend Last Winter for those who like their horror movies on the cerebral side.
