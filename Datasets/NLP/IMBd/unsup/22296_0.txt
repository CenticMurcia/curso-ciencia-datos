Anyone who has a problem with this revival is either A) a smeghead, or B) can't handle Red Dwarf without a laugh track.<br /><br />Ditching the laugh track forces the script into sharper writing. Overall, there are less jokes than the previous seasons, but the jokes are higher quality. This is as it should be. The "There Must Be A Laugh Every 11 Seconds Or Less" rule of television sitcoms is the bane of true comedy. It's amazing the original Red Dwarf ever circumvented it while conforming to it.<br /><br />Now Red Dwarf isn't restricted by such nonsense and is truly entertaining. If this is the last Red Dwarf we see, I will be absolutely sad.<br /><br />Hell, this comeback leaves me cheering for a Red Dwarf movie.
