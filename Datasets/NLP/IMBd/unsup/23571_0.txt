OK, mabe only second best behind a certain Speilberg movie, but the first real classic. The first big-bugget (for the time) special effects movie, the first dinosaur movie and one of my favorites, one of my most prized possesions is a FULLY RESTORED 135-MINUTE VERSION! for everyone who wants to see the restored version, keep watching TCM and keep a vcr handy with some blank tapes.
