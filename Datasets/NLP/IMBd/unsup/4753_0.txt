This movie was about my aunt's (Janice Miller) case. She recounted what happened for me and the movie followed the events very truthfully. I thought it was great for being on T.V. I thought they portrayed my uncle unfairly and spelled his last name wrong( it's gAUdio not gUAdio) but he is not central to the story. The actors had brilliant performances and you had to feel bad for the family of the child. Well that's about all I have to say on this movie. I still cannot believe this movie was actually about my aunt's case. It's nice to see that a relative finally gets recognition for their hard work.I only wish i could find a copy of this that i could buy.
