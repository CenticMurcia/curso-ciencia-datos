"Monkees: Daydream Believers" was a major disappointment. The beginning scene, presumably set in the late 90's or 2000, was weak and added no interest to the show. The best part of the movie was in the early scenes when they were casting the show. It went downhill from there. While it purported to portray the Monkees' story, the plot was weak or nonexistent. The movie didn't go anywhere. The Beatle segment was interesting, one of the few bright spots in an otherwise drab film. There was no real sense of place or time, no sense of the 60's, and it did not accurately portray the sheer hysteria that surrounded the group. I sat through it once because I lived in that era, but it is not worth a second showing.
