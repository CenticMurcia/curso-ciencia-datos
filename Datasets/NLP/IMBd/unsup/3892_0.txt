Feds is awesome and my absolute favorite comedy. Rebecca Demornay is so cool in this movie, she's pretty and kicks butt at the same time.<br /><br />Rebecca Demornay and Mary Gross are the only female cadets at the FBI academy, but they team up and show their male colleagues how it's done. The two characters work so well together, it's buddy comedy at it's best.<br /><br />The movie has got many funny parts, that make you laugh even if you have already seen them a thousand times. Like the scene when Demornay puts the cuffs on her uncooperative arrest-practice partner after sweeping him off his feet. Running gag of the movie is "the kick in the balls" which they also use in a hilarious scene to take out some amateurish muggers.<br /><br />But rather see it yourself, once you've watched you'll want to see it again.
