This movie was OK, not that funny, Josh Hutcherson did a TERRIBLE job, some of the jokes (including R.V. sewage line) were EXTREMELY unnecessary. Not very good direction. Really annoying singing. GOD it was just really kind of dumb. The ending was just plain dumb, "Dad, the R.V.'s rolling away!" Gosh.<br /><br />I know they weren't trying to make "Schindler's List" or anything, but still the worst family comedy since "The Shaggy Dog.' The ending reminded me of "The Pink Panther" which also had a terrible ending. One of the things that really annoyed me was the PG. Sometimes i thought it should of been PG-13 (but of course a very mild one.) Pink panther was definitely better. Similar jokes, worse plot, worse acting etc. 4/10. Rent this one.
