Bette Davis then only 30 years old, won an Oscar for best actress for this movie in 1939. Directed by William Wyler, Jezebel is one of Hollywoods best from its Golden Age. Jezebel was released in 1938 and also stars a young Henry Fonda who at times had to take leave from production because of the birth of his daughter Jane. The picture tells the story of a headstrong young Southern woman during the Antebellum period whose actions cost her the man she loves. Bette Davis plays the young woman whose name in the movie is actually Julie, but because of her conniving and the hurt that results from it her Aunt Belle, played by Fay Bainter tells her that she is acting like Jezebel from the bible. Fay Bainter would go on to win the Oscar for best supporting actress for her role in this movie. Fay Bainter by the way also was nominated this same year for best leading actress for her role in another movie titled "White Banners". I really enjoyed this film that went on to earn a nomination for best movie of 1938. Frank Capra's "You Can't Take it With You" eventually won that year. Jezebel is a great movie with a great cast.
