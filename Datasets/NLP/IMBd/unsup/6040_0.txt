We live in Kansas City and searched for nearly 2 weeks looking for this DVD. I will say that if you are a Kathy fan, you will enjoy this video. I can't wait for her next DVD to come out. Her frank sense of "Cruel Humor" can only be compared to the likes of Joan Rivers. She doesn't hold back when she gets started on celebrities. My only problem with the video is that it wasn't long enough. I would love to have had another hour. I guess that's why she has a show. The best is when she tears into Eminem. I won't give anything away, but you definitely have to see it. It is nice to see someone that can be so politically incorrect, and just having fun, when everyone else is so uptight. 10 out of 10!!!!!
