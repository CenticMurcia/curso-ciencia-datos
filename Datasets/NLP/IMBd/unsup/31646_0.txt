This title can best be described as a '' Pay it forward '' on the Philipines. Without the glitter and the glamor of a Hollywood flick, it tells the heartwarming story of a young boy from a poor family, trying to arrange the burial for his grandmother. Of course he teaches the so called adults around him that they have to break their lethargy around certain choices to get further in life.<br /><br />I had to get used to the simplistic way of filming. It felt a bit cheap, comparing to most of the similar films made in the U.S. But as the story evolved, I also started to like this simplicity because of the authentic view it gives us of poverty in the Philipines. It never felt artificial, as most of the American movies with similar themes usually do. Its characters are humans of flesh and blood, and although their acting is stiff and sometimes uncharismatic, they feel natural. <br /><br />But still, at the end I felt a bit hollow. This usually happens when I liked a movie but when there is some aspect that doesn't really fulfill my expectations. The ending is cheesy, predictable and far from original. It doesn't surpass the level of those cheap '' based on true stories ''- movies or anything inspired by the books of Danielle Steel. And to add more criticism; the soundtrack is incredible awful.<br /><br />My conclusion: At the end it's not that great, but that doesn't mean that I couldn't like this cute story. Especially the scene in which our little hero measures up the size of his grandmother is truly heartwarming. This is for the sensitive moviegoers, cynics shouldn't even bother to try it!
