In an age when sex scenes are deleted from movies by American studios trying for a dumbed-down R rating, it's refreshing to see foreign movies that do their own thing. Ma Mere is one such movie. <br /><br />The young guy's girlfriend is a real looker, especially in bed, where she looks like women actually look when they're having sex ... naked ... as opposed to American movies where the characters somehow manage to make love fully clothed.<br /><br />There's a little bit of twisted French dementia in this movie, as can be expected from the French; they have a bad case of ennui, apparently. But overall this is a good film. And check out that chick taking the 'leading role' with her boyfriend!
