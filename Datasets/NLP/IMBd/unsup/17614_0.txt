Saving Marriage gives an emotional and compelling look into the controversy surrounding same-sex marriage in Massachusetts. This film informs viewers of the struggle it took to achieve that feat, and the fight that know goes on to have it overturned.<br /><br />Saving Marriage weaves its way through both sides of this political issue in a way that's easy to follow. It also puts a face to this volatile issue, and it makes you confront your own prejudices. If you have an open mind and view this film objectively, you might find yourself changing your opinions towards gay marriage. It's extremely well done and I applaud the filmmakers efforts to tackle this issue head on.
