Going into this movie I felt that a documentary on America's debt crisis had a subject that most could relate to and had the makings of one of the great documentaries of our time. Unfortunately it fell well short of my expectations. One of the people interviewed presented what I would consider to be nothing more than conspiracy theories about the credit reporting industry and it was presented as fact. Also, the film got too wrapped up in the emotions of people whose lives were affected by personal debt and debt of loved ones, rather than tackling the inner-workings of the consumer lending industry, which I would have found much more stimulating. While I don't think that late fees should make up half (or more) of a consumer's credit card bill, I find it difficult empathizing with people that purchase something, then elect not to pay the bill. On a positive note, the film did bring to light the ties of large banks to some other businesses. While I have seen worse documentaries, the film did not do the subject matter justice. Perhaps they should have had someone on staff with more analytical skills and some insight as to the inner workings of the consumer lending industry.
