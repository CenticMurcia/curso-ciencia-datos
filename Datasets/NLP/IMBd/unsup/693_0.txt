Adapted from perhaps one of the greatest Dark story tellers of the past Edgar Allan Poe.<br /><br />This film was very enjoyable Oliver Reeds accent was very believable but I was really surprised at how a big name actor like Reed only had a very small part in the film.<br /><br />Mark Margolis (Of Equalizer fame) played a really good part - Very Dark!<br /><br />Rona De Ricci who played Maria She was in my opinion the real star of the film. It's surprising then, that she seems to have been in only two films. She is both a very talented actress and a strikingly beautiful woman.<br /><br />Lance Henrikson played His part extremely well as the very tortured inquisitor.<br /><br />The scene with the Rats - brilliant.<br /><br />Over all this film is one that I will remember.
