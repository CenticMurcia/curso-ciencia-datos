I was on the edge of my seat, close to tears, and that was after only catching the last half of this movie. I'm desperately trying to find a copy of this movie, to watch it from the beginning, and it's hard to find. The dialog was real, the cinematography dark and brilliant, and whether you believe this is a "chick flick," the characters and interplay involved touch on the very heart of the matter - from many aspects that many men will never understand - when it comes to the power of support that comes from friends - especially women - throughout various stages of their lives. That is not something that is developed or created...it just is. The writer has captured the spirit of these women, the truths they must face about the men who love them.
