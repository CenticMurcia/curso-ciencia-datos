In 1943, in Warsaw, the Jews Alek (Lambert Wilson) and Fryda (Julie Delpy), escape from the ghetto through the sewer tunnels. Alek leaves his wife Fryda in a church and looks for help. Stephania (Hanna Schygulla), a German Christian woman of about forty years old living alone, gives shelter and food for Alek. In the night, they have an affair, and Alek, wanting to keep the protection of Stephania, lies to her. He say that Fryda would be his little sister, and Stephania brings her from the church and lodges both of them at her home. Fryda becomes jealous with the situation and performs all sort of betrayal and cruelties against Stephania. Her final revenge leads the trio to a tragic end. This movie is a tragic drama about choices in life for surviving, supported by the outstanding performance of Julie Delpy, Lambert Wilson and Hanna Schygulla and the magnificent direction of Janusz Kijovwki. Stephania chooses for helping the Jews Alek and Fryda in an occupied Poland. Alek chooses for not telling the truth about Fryda to Stephania. Fryda chooses to double-cross Stephania and Alek. Stephania chooses to have a baby. Alek chooses Stephania. In the end, he chooses for risking his life for Fryda. Julie Delpy highlights with a character very mean, blinded by the feeling of revenge. My vote is seven.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): `Varsóvia  Ano 5703' (`Warsaw - Year 5703')
