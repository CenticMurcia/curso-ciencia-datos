I have watched this film may be more than 30 times in theater. There was a time when I used to watch this film everyday in the theater and the only reason was Shahrukh Khan. I can talk about story and other stuff but I really don't think thats important. Every single frame of the film is just Shahrukh Khan. 'Ram Jaane' was a very definite flop but for some people like me it was a mania. I remember I was traveling from Lucknow to Hapur and a rickshaw puller did a somersault and landed very badly on the ground. He just got up and started walking singing the title track. I really liked him because I was also in the same frame of mind for may be two months. I used to try somersaults, rectangular black glasses, jacket without shirts and above all drink directly from the bottle. I also used to get these exciting urges to slap a policeman but somehow I controlled. I wonder how I managed to control myself.<br /><br />There are lots of other interesting things i.e Background music, Shahrukh's dance, action sequences and of course Pankaj Kapoor. I and a friend of started smoking 'More' for good two months. Every time Shahrukh lit a cigarette we did. Every one in this world watch one film with total devotion for example my father who doesn't watch films watched 'Shree 420' fourteen times. For me it is 'Raam Jaane'. 'Khallas'. I really wish Shahrukh hadn't become so big. 10/10.
