This movie is fantastic. When I saw this movie, I figured it was just going to be a boring and long movie. I couldn't have been more wrong. Sure it was long, but The Insider kept your attention for every second of the film. Russell Crowe, once again, is magnificent. I just can't get over what a great actor he is. Every character Russell plays he makes seem so real and I couldn't help to think that Russell was robbed out of the award for Best Actor at the Academy Awards. His Oscar win for the role of Maximus in Gladiator (for which he deserved all the way) makes up for it though. He absolutely amazes me. Not only is he SO CUTE (well, not in The Insider because he played a 53-year-old, but he looks cute in most of his other performances) but he is also an amazing actor. Al Pacino also gave an excellent performance. He too makes his characters seem real in every movie he is in. The cast for this movie was phenomenal. This movie kept you on the edge of your seat. I absolutely loved this movie. It's definitely one of the best movies I have ever seen. For anyone who hasn't seen this movie, you have to go see it and I guarantee that you will thoroughly enjoy it. I give it a 10 out of 10.
