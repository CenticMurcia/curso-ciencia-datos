This TVM takes it upon itself to inform the world what a terrible thing racism is . I had to stop myself from bowing down in front of the TV screen in praise and I'm sure that millions of people who have watched this on late night television are eternally grateful for being told that racism is a terrible thing . Oh yes I'm being sarcastic <br /><br />The " true " story revolves around Tammy and Brian Schnitzer a Jewish couple who move into a town full of red necks . I said " true " story because I felt this TVM may take a few liberties as to how true things were . Okay it's a TVM which means the television company can't show or say things that would be offensive ( Notice graffiti doesn't contain the F word ) meaning three dimensional racist characters are going to be thin on the ground but the script makes them ridiculous caricatures and we're treated to ridiculous scenes where the racists go into a church and light a cigarette which leads to the black congregation to sing a song containing the lyric " Oh burn me down Lord " and the racists retreat at the fairly impressive chorus line and dancing . As I said ridiculous and this leads to more questions and answers <br /><br />Racists smoke ? I thought neo Nazis were anti drink and smoking , but it's never revealed if the racists are neo Nazis or plain ignorant racists <br /><br />Black people are good singers and dancers because they've got rhythm ? Inverse racism on the part of the producers is it not ? <br /><br />Why is a church exclusively full of black people . Ah well that's because in certain American states churches are segregated something the producers only hint at . No doubt they didn't want to cause offence or start a debate <br /><br />If you want a film featuring mans inhumanity to man try SCHINDLERS LIST or THE KILLING FIELDS
