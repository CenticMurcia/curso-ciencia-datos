One could see these people , especially as the main problem in the movie revealed itself, exposed down to their raw inner selves. I could relate so much to different aspects of each of the characters--either myself, my significant other(s), and people I have known through out my life. It was almost taken, in bits and pieces, out of my own life and my own values, thoughts, beliefs, etc., mixed into a different order and made into a movie. I expect others feel the same when watching it. I almost felt nakedly exposed during certain parts. It was great.<br /><br />It was riveting as it unfolded, tho not without a few light hearted moments, and not with out a subtle humour to it. The person of my family who likes action movies wasn't especially interested, but my 16 yr. old daughter ,who appreciates the interplay of relationships and people (as I do) even if going thru a breakdown, found it as fascinating as I did.<br /><br />Well worth watching, even more than once. Sort of an insightful primer on friendships, relationships, and marriage---not spelled out, but played out thru the dialog. Perhaps should be required watching for couples, and friends. Congrats to the author of this fine piece, as well as to the actors who brought it to life for us.
