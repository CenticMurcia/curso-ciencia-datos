One of the horrible movie I have ever watched. I saw this movie in Mumbai, my last ever picture in Mumbai. I paid Rs. 200/- to watch the movie and the movie wasn't worth 25/- even.<br /><br />Akshay hams too much in the movie so are Sunil, Paresh & all others. The only saving grace of the movie was Rimi Sen who was fresh out from Dhoom then. She certainly is improving film after film. She was good in Hungama. She plays the same kind of role. In Hungama there were two guys after her. In this movie, there are seven characters who are after her. I don't want to waste my time writing review of the movie coz there is no story altogether.<br /><br />A must skip.
