This film tempted me to leave within the first half hour during the screening at Sundance.<br /><br />It's rarely fun to follow characters who don't change. And much less fun to see them naked and frustrated while doing so. Don't get me wrong, we all love a little skin and angst in film, but this film lacked other elements to even that out.<br /><br />I got worn out by such a depressing cycle of events. During the Q & A, the Director said he wanted to explore the life of a man who remains unchanged.<br /><br />I say, explore it if you like. Just don't spend any more money filming it.
