"The Road to Wellville" was sort of silly, but quite neat. Focusing on a health spa in Michigan in the early 20th century. Dr. John Harvey Kellogg (Anthony Hopkins) is a little too obsessed with health, to the point where everything relates to sex. I really liked everything that they did to William Lightbody (Matthew Broderick), and when Eleanor Lightbody (Bridget Fonda) snapped at the people wearing animal skin. After watching this movie, anyone is likely to feel weird about being a health-freak (although there are some good lessons about health). Dana Carvey, John Cusack, and John Neville also have great roles. It all just goes to show why the people involved in "The Road to Wellville" are so well-regarded. Cool.
