This is a technically a very good film. The cinematography and the way the it contains stories within stories are excellent.<br /><br />However the actual stories within the movie and the general apocalyptic darkness mood is far from smart. Whether you hate or love the Serbs, it seems this film only further highlights their tendency as a people too shoot themselves in the foot be it in the world stage or as was the case in making this film.<br /><br />Can't think of too many other nations who would make a film that potrays themselves and their people as bunch of maniacs, murders, rapists, sadist and etc as this film has. It seems the Serbs have picked up where western media has left off. If I had not known better about them, having seen this film would have been enough to sway me in believeing that they deserved what they got from March to June 1999.<br /><br />This film is basically an excellent illustration of what sought of art results when an artist completely ignores his/her responsibility to his or her country and people in times of difficulty. I don't beleive that the content of the film can be justified in the name of 'art'. How about a positive film to come out of that country so the world can see some goodness in these people in contrast to what they have been made out to be.
