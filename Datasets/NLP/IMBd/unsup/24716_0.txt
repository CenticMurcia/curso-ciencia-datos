Well I think it's actually a pretty good show. Original concept, and I like the characters.<br /><br />One thing I do think though is that it dragged on too long, a lot of things did. InuYasha should have forgotten Kikyo early on into the series, Kikyo should have died early on and stayed dead, and there were too many filler episodes with the same battle sequences. Some of the characters just get tiresome as well.<br /><br />The whole Kikyo thing.. Blablabla, give me a break. I actually prefer Kikyo over Kagome but for one, she's way too old for InuYasha. He acts like he's 16ish whereas she's about 23. Another thing, well, would they just let her be? It's been fifty years, he has Kagome now. To what purpose she was brought back I have no clue. It might have been to cause some type of confusion in Kagome and InuYasha's romance, but it didn't work. Episode 48, where InuYasha chooses Kikyo, sort of changed my idea of the whole series. I was madly in love with it until then.. when I started to just find it all a bit tiresome.<br /><br />The search for the sacred jewel shards definitely goes on far longer than it should. But I guess they just had no ideas of what to do after? They should have just ended the series, instead of just cutting it off randomly and leaving so many people wondering what eventually happens. There are a lot of filler episodes that make you feel as though you've wasted half an hour. <br /><br />Some of the antics by the characters (eg, Kagome's "sit", Miroku's obsession with women, Naraku in general) also dragged on far too long.<br /><br />I agree with the people who say to only watch about half of them, they just get a bit annoying after a while. <br /><br />There are a lot of good things (that I won't name.. I don't feel like typing much more), those are just the bad ones. I appreciate this series very much and it will always hold a place in my heart (it was the first anime I really loved, that's why).<br /><br />I still love the show, and watch it a lot. Those are just what I've noticed in this while...
