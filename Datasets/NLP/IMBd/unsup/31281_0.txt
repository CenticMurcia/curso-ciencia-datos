That's about it - imagine running away from home, living in a tree-house and having great adventures. This film was fantastic fun. It may not be highbrow art, but it is a fun film for the kids!<br /><br />The other guy who commented on this film was obviously looking for something more adult and intelligent. I found that this film was well meaning and had good moral standing. <br /><br />It is a film to take you on a journey and allow you to see things that you otherwise would not. A good exploration of posh kids meeting with street kids, alien experiences like living alone and being self-sufficient. <br /><br />Very entertaining for a young mind hungry for stimulation. <br /><br />It is about friendships and trust, independence and coming of age. Fighting your own battles and finding yourself. <br /><br />I really liked this film when I saw it the first time in the 80's on television. I think I would enjoy it again, although I doubt I would watch it unless I chanced upon on television one night. I would consider watching it if I have kids, I would like them to see it.
