An excellent documentary containing tons of archival films of early inventions. People trying to fly with wings strapped to their arms, flying cars, failed parachute experiments, cooking utensils, and much much more. During a visit to Ripley's Odditorium I saw some footage such as is on this film, and I spent nearly a year trying to find it on DVD. This is by far the best, and possibly the only, documentary on such subjects. I was actually in awe of many of the inventions contained in this film, why aren't some of these things available today? Oh,,, how our vision of the future lets us down....<br /><br />This runs at about 76 minutes long, and it is non-stop entertainment. It also contains many physical experiments as well, such as a woman swinging through New York by gripping a rope with her teeth. Very dangerous acts, human cannonballs and men getting hit in the stomach with sledge-hammers. There is nothing like this film anywhere else, it is truly inspiring, bringing out the creative spirit in all of us.
