I just briefly checked the ratings here on IMDb on this movie before i rented it. I thought that it was kind of worth watching so i decided to give it a try. It didn't take very long before i realised that i should have stayed away from this movie. I would say this movie is one of the 10, if not 5, worst movies i have ever seen in my entire life! There is so much bad things i could mention about this movie... the acting, the script, the effects etc... I am sick of all relatives to the group that made this film, who comes here and votes 10 stars and say its a great masterpiece better then Twin Peaks with breaking music. If you can find this movie for sale for 1 cent, then maybe, just maybe i would recommend it for you if you are in need of a DVD-cover. Otherwise my best suggestion is for you to keep as far away from this movie as possible. Discrase that it even got released.
