Rightfully atrocious. "Orinoco-Prison Of Sex" (a.k.a. "Escape From Hell") was an Italian-Spanish women-as-slaves-on-a-South-American-island-who-revolt thing, brought stateside in 1985, christened with a new title and spiced with fresh footage of Linda Blair as a vengeful "ex-employee". Those looking for some hot nude scenes and/or violent confrontations between sexy women in loincloths are bound to be disappointed (the Italian footage is dark, muddy and unerotic, not to mention coy--it cuts away at the best parts). As for Blair, she's amusing packing heat, ordering her ex-captor around with a snarl, "Quit your blubbering!" But, alas, Linda is once again stuck in a turkey. NO STARS from ****
