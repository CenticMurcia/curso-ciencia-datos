The Secret of the Sword introduces She Ra to the viewing audience. She Ra is a pretty cool character, and this episode is pretty good.<br /><br />At birth Adam had a twin sister named Adora. However the Hoard invaded Eternia, led by an evil guy named Hordak, and took Adora away from her family and to the planet of Etheria. Hordak turns Adora into a member of his troops who is an important leader. Many years later, the sorceress informs He-Man that he is to go to the planet Etheria and give a special sword to someone. By this time, a rebellion is going on in Etheria.<br /><br />I must say that there are tons of similarities to Star Wars. Twins that are composed of one boy and one girl being separated at birth, spaceships attacking, and a rebellion going on. Yep, definitely very similar to Star Wars.<br /><br />I think that the idea of He-Man having a sister is interesting. However, this is the first time that it is ever mentioned. I think it works out though. I guess that the fact that only Man at Arms, The King and QUeen, and Skeletor were the only characters that knew about Adora makes the fact that it never came up work.<br /><br />The story of this episode is good. THere is a lot of build up and action along the way. It really takes a while for She-Ra to emerge using the sword.<br /><br />She-Ra is pretty cool. Strong, intelligent, and (for a character in a cartoon series) very hot. She has unique abilities in that she can turn her sword into anything she wants.<br /><br />New Villains are introduced in the Hoard and Hordak. Hordak is pretty evil and it is cool how he can turn into a jet. Hordak also has a great army composed of mechanical soldiers and a bunch of weird creatures. This includes Manteena, Leach, Catra, and some Scorpion Lady. Catra is cool and so is Mantena, but I think Hordaks warriors are not nearly as cool as Skeletors.<br /><br />I have one major complaint. I always thought that Skeletor was always an evil leader who only answered to himself. However in this episode it is revealed that he was once Hordak's padawan(star wars term). It just does not look like Skeletor belongs to the Hoard and it made more sense for him to not be involved with the Hoard. Skeletor answers to Skeletor, not the Hoard. So, kind of a lame way to connect Skeletor and Hordak. Should have left them separate.<br /><br />Having three sisters, I can relate to this episode and how He-Man is happy to see his sister. Kind of touches close to home for me.<br /><br />Great episode and introduction of She-Ra. Recommended cartoon.
