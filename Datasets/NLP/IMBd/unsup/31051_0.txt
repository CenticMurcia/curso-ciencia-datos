I'm suprised about the amount of positivity expressed towards this movie as it is quite poor. As a long standing SF fan I was looking forward to it, despite it's low budget and the fact that the director's subsequent movies have been less than satisfactory. <br /><br />The good points: The special effects are reasonable (although not great) and the set designs are excellent (quite reminiscent of Alien.) <br /><br />The bad points: Cliche after cliche hits you until you can't take it seriously. The handsome tough guy cop who smokes a cigarette out of the corner of his mouth. You'll hate this character unless you like one dimensional humourless carboard cut out stereotypes. <br /><br />The muscle bound convicts who bully everyone else. IS this a prison for body builders or something?<br /><br /> The geeky computer wiz kids and their quirky humour. How we laughed.<br /><br />The obvious 'good guy saves the day' ending. <br /><br />Malcolm Mcdowell. Why does he take movies like this? Such a fine actor is wasted here.<br /><br />The plot holes are too numerous to mention here but there are lots and lots - probably about 44.<br /><br />There really isn't anything to like about this film apart from the average visuals.<br /><br />I advise you to give this one a miss and pick up a very similar but far superiour movie called 'Outland' starring Sean Connery and directed by Peter Hyams. <br /><br />
