WOW - if there was a movie police........ this movie would be removed from the marked! And the character Norman is so annoying that you just wanna step into the film and shoot him over and over again! The only plus there is in that film is the scene where you see Virginie Ledoyen in her underwear.<br /><br />The film is at NO point scary, exiting or anything - it starts out "ok" (first 12 minutes) by leading up to something that could be a nice movie - but fails to deliver IN ANY way or form.<br /><br />Be warned..... Don't waste your time watching this movie! Not even Gary Oldman can lift this film to anything near worth watching! And the 53 votes for 10 - MUST be from someone related to the film! THERE IS NO WAY ANYONE COULD RATE THIS MOVIE A 10 !!! NO FRAGING WAY!
