With all due respect to the Wayne's World and Austin Powers series, this is by far Mike Myers best movie.<br /><br />I have never understood why this movie didn't make it big at the box office. I remember sitting in a theatre watching the trailer for this movie and the audiencewas in hysterics. I thought for sure that this was going to be a big hit. Unfortunately initial reviews were not good and the movie failed to take off. But thanks to DVD this movie has become a cult classic. <br /><br />Myers is brilliant in the dual roles of Charlie and Charlie's father. The movie also has a number of cameo's of gifted character actors who while only on the screen no more two minutes, deliver some classic comedic bits. <br /><br />I have introduced this movie to several of my friends and without exception all have loved it. For those who haven't seen it go out and rent it you will not be disappointed.
