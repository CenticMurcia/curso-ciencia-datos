I am a huge movie fan, and it is very hard for me to hate a movie. I even like movies that are so bad that they are actually good, such as Plan 9 From Outer Space.<br /><br />This movie doesn't even fit into that category. The director of this movie was obviously trying to be serious, and ends up making a complete joke of a film.<br /><br />The acting is the worst I have ever seen and there are so many plot holes I cannot even begin to describe them all.<br /><br />The effects are some of the most ridiculous I have ever seen. There is no shame in having a small budget. George Romero made Night of the Living Dead with only $60,000. But you should at least try!<br /><br />Do NOT waste your money buying or even renting this film!
