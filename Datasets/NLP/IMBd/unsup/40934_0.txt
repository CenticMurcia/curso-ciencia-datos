Wow, this one's bad. Real bad. I guess it's a horror/comedy hybrid, but it fails on both fronts. The writing here is just really weak. The script jumps all over the place. When I saw this on the shelf at the video store, I thought "what the heck?" I might be getting another cheesy classic a la Chucky or Leprechaun with this one, but it was nowhere close. I'm really not putting much stock in the Dimension Extreme branding anymore. They're churning out too many stinkers. The one bright (?) spot in this movie was the acting. I thought both the leads did a good job with the material they were given. I expect to see more from the actress who played the sister.
