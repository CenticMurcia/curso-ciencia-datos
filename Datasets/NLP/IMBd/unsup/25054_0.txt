What a complete surprise this movie was. It's funny... poignant... and VERY sexy.<br /><br />For his first film, Vince Rocca has delivered a great piece of entertainment... enough to make Kevin Smith jealous.<br /><br />He has a solid cast, especially Nikki Stanzione, who I'm shocked not to have seen before this film. And Nichole Rayburn just sizzles on the screen... add that to some snappy dialogue, and you are in for a treat.<br /><br />Also look for a great cameo from Ginger Lynn Allen... I really do think this woman has some great performances in her, no pun intended. I would love to see her in some larger roles.<br /><br />And, the soundtrack is fantastic! Honestly, I would buy a CD with these songs on it in an instant. So, anyone affiliated with Kisses and Caroms, please release the music on cd, or tell us how to track those songs down.
