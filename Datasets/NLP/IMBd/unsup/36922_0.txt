The one good thing about this show is that it's short. In Norway, we don't have commercials, so in between "Grey's Anatomy" and "King of Queens" one only has to be insulted for about 20 minutes.<br /><br />I loved Julia Louis Dreyfus in "Seinfield". Her character was zany and unique while her vulnerability was easy to relate to. Plus the writing was fabulous. Anyone who can relate to Christine in this new show, however, must be prepubescent.<br /><br />Basically, the show is clich√© and childish, consisting of "jokes" nearly as dated as "I love Lucy". It may have worked in the 60's with an actress (Lucille Ball) in a class of her own, but in the year 2006 "The New Adventures of Old Christine" is a pretty scary concept when one considers that it made it onto the most influential media format (TV) around the world. Who are these people that are deemed responsible for making television shows of such low caliber? This show could have been called "A New Sitcom with Old Jokes." I feel sorry for the actress.
