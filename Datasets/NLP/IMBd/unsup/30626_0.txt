I figured how to reset my account just to give this movie 10. This movie is inspirational, and it shows that you should never give up. However, it also portrays the conditions and day-to-day struggle that the poor have to undergo, making you question equality in todays society. <br /><br />The acting is exceptional, especially Will Smith, who allows the audience feel every emotion that goes through his body be it sadness and desperation or sheer relief and "happyness". It's nice to see him move towards movies that raise issues in today's society and provide inspiration to the average person, however I hope he still does some action films :D.<br /><br />I would recommend this film to someone who wants to experience something real in society, instead of clich√© violence and romance. Even with its serious nature, it is an entertaining film that keeps you hooked and hoping, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.<br /><br />10 out of 10. Good work Will Smith!
