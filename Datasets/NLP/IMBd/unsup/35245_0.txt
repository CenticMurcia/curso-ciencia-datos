Remember Paul Brickman?<br /><br />The director and writer of "Risky Business"? The director of "Men Don't Leave"? Remember?<br /><br />Well, here's one to forget.<br /><br />In spite of Friedkin as director, in spite of great special FX and in spite (or maybe because of) Chevy Chase as the star, "Deal of the Century" is more of a swindle. <br /><br />1983 wasn't a very good year for movies, and here's more proof if you needed it.<br /><br />If this really was the "Deal of the Century", let's all try to hold out until the year 2983, shall we?<br /><br />Two stars. One for the effects and another for Sigourney Weaver. She did better in "Ghostbusters".
