Duvall is nothing less than superb in this movie. I don't recall him playing a more believable character ever before. The one disappointment in the movie was the church scenes. I belong to a Christian church with "enthusiastic" members and Pastors. However, they don't stand around screaming the same one liners the entire time and I don't recall ever being in a church that did. They usually have a message for the day and it is different all the time. I am sure some more research could have been done to make the church scenes more realistic. I might have had more compassion for E.F.'s situation had he gained more of my respect by giving a great sermon.
