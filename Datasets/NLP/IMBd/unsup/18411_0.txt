I felt the script for the movie was lacking a sense of reality most of the time. There were to many lines that were total Clich√©'s. For example, when the small group was planning a protest the one girl suggested. "why done we form a human chain around the auditorium and confront the senator with Poetry". There were 5 of them, and the suggestion was Laughable, and no one laughed in the scene. There's a lot of lines like that but not funny, just out of context.<br /><br />The acting on the other hand was quite good. Even with the lines they were given.<br /><br />I have to say i'm not a great fan of constant close ups which this had tons of. I it was hard to tell what was going on around the characters since there were so many close ups.
