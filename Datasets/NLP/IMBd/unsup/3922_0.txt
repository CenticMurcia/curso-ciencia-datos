This movie despite all the strange violence, deviant sex, and the sadness of the main character.... i actually feel kinda warm and fuzzy after i watch it. James Duval character Dark is so lovable and so easy to identify with even if you aren't a lonely teenager. I think this movie contains great commentary on todays fast and twisted society. It is genius. Even though it has shocking and sometimes stomach turning scenes, it can still be funny and make you laugh. I think a good movie is about sending you through a wide range of emotions and this movie meets that criteria. My friends and myself have assembled our own cult following for this Gregg Araki trilogy (inculding Doom Generation and Totally F***ed Up). If you like this movie i suggest you watch the other two. For sure this movie isn't for everyone but if you watched it once and hated it for its graphic nature i suggest you watch it again a pay attention to the lessons and social commentary.
