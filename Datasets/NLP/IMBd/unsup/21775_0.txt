After their very wealthy father of the Whitman family dies three very wealthy brothers set off to India to find their wealthy self-indulgent mother who is undergoing some mental catharsis guilt trip by acting as a nun in a Quasi Christian temple in India. On this journey through India, these three brothers attempt to also attain some spirituality by undergoing ridiculous made up spiritual rituals. The film actually begins with this meaningless episode of Jack Whitman, played by Jason Schwartzman, staying in an upmarket French hotel and having a reunion with his girlfriend played by Natalie Portman. There is a very gratuitous naked scene of Natalie Portman (More for the benefit of the Coppola family she obliges) and that just about ends her contribution to the film except for two seconds at the end. Bill Murray and Angelica Huston also make cameo appearances. The contrast between the three brothers and the absolute poverty of India is brushed over by some stupid interaction in the saving of a child's life and the funeral of one that tragically dies. There is a simplistic attempt at symbolism in the act of unloading luggage.<br /><br />This very cheap self-indulgent film was a further extravagant means of introducing another member of the Coppola family into the film business in the Family Nepotism tradition.<br /><br />This film was written and produced by Roman Coppola and his cousin Jason Schwartzman along with Wes Anderson, who directs the film (he directed the Royal Tenenbaums). Owen Wilson and Adrian Brody play the other two brothers. The film is stupid and tells us nothing about the human condition other than extremely rich trendy men can make short films at the drop of a feather.
