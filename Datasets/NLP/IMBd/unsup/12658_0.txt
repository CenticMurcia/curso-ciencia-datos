Somewhere during Christmas week where its winter over here, i sat and decided to see this movie only to realise that it was a good choice. Its about some oil drilling corporation unit sent to some part of Iceland to drill oil.It concentrates on a white box like structure throughout. When one of the crew members hallucinates presumably due to the release of sour gas and dies in the cold the others realise that there's something wrong with a lot of weird things happenings with no explanation.This movie gives out an important message which is not clearly shown in fact it is hidden and left for you to figure out.<br /><br />The Last Winter is about how nature takes revenge on man for misusing it and taking it for granted.This movie tests your thinking level and how about you perceive things.If you don't understand it you wont find what message this movie is revealing to us and perhaps foolish;but if you see it in a different way and think accordingly(i mean just think a little bit more) you will find its a masterpiece.<br /><br />This is one of the best natural horror films.Truly,very gripping and engaging.This ones a must watch.Simply exceptional and outstanding. A new revolution created in Hollywood cinema.
