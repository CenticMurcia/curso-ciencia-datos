Seven friends buy a creepy old house in hopes of fixing it up and having some cool place to hang out. But, they have no idea the history of unpleasant and messy events that occurred in the house. So, in an "out-with-the-old" method of clearing a headstone from the yard, they wake the (late) former owner and her daughter from their eternal sleep. The former owner, Abigail then proceeds to barricade them all inside with no way out and re-paint the house... in blood. And, in the grand tradition of THE EVIL DEAD, they come back (from the dead) to party. Chilling and gory low-budgeter from TROMA is a crowning cut above almost anything else the independent cinema company has to offer. But, be warned, watch at your own risk.
