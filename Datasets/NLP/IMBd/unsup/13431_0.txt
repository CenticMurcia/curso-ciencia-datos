Tom Hanks really broke through in the movie. He showed that he truly was the best pick for that movie. He also showed that he is the best in the business. His movies from this point on just get better and better. The story line is cute and likable and has something that everyone can somewhat relate to. It proves the old saying "You can't help who you fall in love with." I thought that the acting was really well done not only by Hanks but by everyone. It was also well written. It was well cast. And over all a wonderful film. One to be enjoyed by all ages and in all times. The movie is one of the best movies that I've seen from it's time period and genre. Also one of my favorite Tom Hanks movies. If you have never seen this movie, don't walk, run to go rent it and watch by yourself or with a loved one. Its a movie that everyone can enjoy no matter their age. It's a fun movie that holds special moments for everyone. I love how it shows that each character is very well developed by the writers and the actors. It's an over all awesome movie. And by far one of the best movies ever to be made. It is different each time you see it too. You notice something about the movie that you never noticed before every time you watch it. I would highly recommend to any one if you haven't seen this movie to go out and see it. But more it's a great movie on things that are real, true and touch your heart. The movie is true to the heart and soul of it. Its beautifully made and acted.So young or old, male or female, go see the movie. It's truly one of the best you'll ever see.
