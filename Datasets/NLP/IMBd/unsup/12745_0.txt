This is truly one of the great films of our time. It's a fantasy, set in the glories of Western Ireland and involves the story of a little girl who is sent from the city to her grandparents in the isles. Once there, she learns of a mysterious lady who came into the family having once been a seal. The disappearance at sea of the girl's little brother leads the girl to the ancestral home on the island of Roan Inish. There, in time, and only after the family decides to move back to Roan Inish, the child is found, mysteriously cared for the seals. The movie is filled with glorious photography, splendid acting, and a story that should appeal to all sensitive people. John Sayles was responsible for the writing, directing, and editing. It is a tribute to his genius.
