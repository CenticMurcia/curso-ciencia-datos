My daughter and I loved Save the Last Dance 1 (one of our favorite movies). When we saw there was a second one, we were so excited. We watched the movie through it's entirety, but at the end of the movie we were both very disappointed in the movie. The movie itself was good - but just knowing that it was a continuation of Sara's life, is what upset us over the movie. None of the original cast was in the second one (no one can take Julia Stiles place in that movie) and just the fact that everything that Sara and Derek went through in the first one just to be together - "they" decided to take a break from each other and date other people. The second one was a big let down. If the second one would have been about someone else's life - it would have been a great movie - on it's own.
