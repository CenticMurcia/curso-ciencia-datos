I watched this movie today and decided to look it up on IMDb after to see what rating it was given. I was curious, because it was easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen. <br /><br />I was surprised that other people have given it such a good rating. I didn't think it was funny or clever.. the only interesting thing about it was how bad it really was. Molly Shannon's character is probably more hateable than the antagonist in the movie (her neighbor). She is annoying, irrational, unreasonable, radical... and worse, neglectful to the animals that she pretends to love so much. <br /><br />Shannon is supposed to come across as someone who would jump in front of a train for any animal, but instead, she is extremely selfish in everything she does. She does not think about the welfare of animals, instead she makes decisions that would allow her to feel better about herself. She is the one who is responsible for her first dog's death as she allowed him to escape, and then she has the nerve to put the blame on her neighbor. She forges cheques from her boss's bank account to animal rights groups. When she adopts the 15 dogs, she does not consider whether or not they would be comfortable and safe in such a confined living area. She breaks into her neighbors house and tries to stab him because she thinks that he reported her for keeping too many dogs in her house (which, by the way, he would have had every right to do). The list goes on and on.<br /><br />I am an animal lover and I did not like this movie at all. If you're desperate for an animal movie, I'm sure Marley and Me would be a better bet.
