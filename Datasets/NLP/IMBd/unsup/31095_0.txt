Awesome epic. Now available on DVD. Grew up watching this time and time again and now have the pleasure of re-watching it on DVD. Not a lot of features but who needs them. You have 7.5hrs of viewing pleasure. I have found an unnatural ability to quote every inch of this saga. I can only say it's left an impression on me. It was my first introduction to Hugo Weaving, way before the Matrix.<br /><br />The music is what I remember most about this story. Very emotive. You can't help but feel sad at each turn of fate. Very different kind of story to movies such as LOTR, no special effects, just good story.<br /><br />I recommend watching this if you love epics, Australia or a good sob story!
