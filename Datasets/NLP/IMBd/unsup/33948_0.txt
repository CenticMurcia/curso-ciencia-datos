One of the dullest, most poorly written film I have ever seen, give it a miss. <br /><br />I've never looked forward to the credits of a film with more excitement.<br /><br />That's all there is to say about this, but I will keep writing because I have to submit 10 lines of text for my review to be accepted. <br /><br />I wouldn't have bothered because the film doesn't merit it, but I want to try and stop anyone else wasting their evening watching it like I did, so I'll keep on until I make the 10 lines needed. Actually this review is already much more interesting than the film.
