It's a fact that all unknown movies aren't all bad. Normally you settle for these videos when the popular titles are gone. One night while in my local video rental outlet I settled for "Dead Boyz Can't Fly" because reviews touted it as the "Clockwork Orange for the 90's," one of my favorites, I thought it might be another "Warriors." What I saw was a movie that had no plot, no talent and apparently no budget. The whole movie looked like it was filmed in an abandoned government office building. It starts with a preachy Vietnam War Veteran, who you anticipate being the movie's hero. He crosses paths with "the gang," who wants nothing but trouble, fresh on a path of destruction and mayhem. Not only does our "hero" lose his final battle but no one else are matches against the Boys either. Luckily for the audience, the drugs finally kick in and the gangs' leader becomes a part of the pavement below, a crash symbolizing the awful story line. There were worst things I could have been doing instead of watching this movie like having a root canal or a cyst removed.
