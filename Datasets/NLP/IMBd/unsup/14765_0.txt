I LOVED this movie, all of those bad reviews you've just read are completely wrong. It is so sweet, and realistic when it comes to the terrible reality of the modern-day slaves: prostitutes. It was wonderful that they showed that "hookers" are really human, despite their less-than-normal job. The little boy, Frank, was adorable in everything he did, the actor who played him was wonderful. It was heart-warming to see just how much he cared for V, even though he knew what she did for a living. I would have my kids see this movie if I had kids; it has underlying morals, such as anti-prejudice and the like. This movie definitely deserves a ten!
