What a funny movie! Carrey's a comedic legend and in Ace he found the ideal showcase for his talent (which, sadly, he beat to death in the lackluster sequel). Ace is on a totally different planet and he couldn't care less for social conventions or politeness. He just likes his animals and bonking Monica from friends (fair enough, says you).<br /><br />I don't understand people who don't get it. COME ON, it's FUNNY! Anyway, your loss because this one kicks butt.
