Stripes was one one the best dumb movies I have ever seen. Police Academy, trying to be like Stipes, is just an embarrassment. Many memorable lines from Stripes like "I think you're ready for the Special Olympics," or "I thought I should join before I got drafted," or "All I know is that we finally get to kill someone" are hilarious. They are things that you wouldn't expect someone to say, but they make a movie out of it! Police Academy is way too predictable, you know where they are heading, but they stop just before they get there. I can't even remember any memorable lines from Police Academy except this really disturbing one. The shy cop says at the end of the movie "don't move dirtbag." It was disturbing because you expected her to become "tough" and she does, but in such an unamusing and forced way. Of course, Police Academy doesn't have the caliber of actors like Stripes does. If John Candy or Bill Murray did Police Academy, they could make it work. Instead Police Academy hired all these crappy no-name actors from nowhere that take the movie nowhere. I was surprised that there was so much hooting and hollering and laughing going on in the theater. I thought that perhaps everyone else was watching something else. I know it is a little too late, but if you haven't seen this dud, avoid at all costs!!
