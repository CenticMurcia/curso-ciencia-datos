I will start off by saying my ONLY beef was that we didn't get to see enough of this X5 - the absolute ONLY "suv" on the streets that you can take on the race track off the showroom floor and, in 4.4 V8 trim, have run with the M3's.<br /><br />That said, this film was great. Powerful, to the point, BEAUTIFULLY acted, mysterious in it's ending, and just downright superb. I will say no more - watch it, it's free.<br /><br />9/10, simply because they TOYED with my heart by giving us some great X5 action, just not enough of it. :)
