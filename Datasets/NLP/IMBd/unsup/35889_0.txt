This is such a bad movie that it doesn't even warrant a full review. It seems like all the bad indie films in the past 10 years have used the same formula: several opposing groups fighting each other over money. This film is no different than the rest, except for the fact that it may be worse.<br /><br />In one scene, the two lead actresses are being chased by a biker gang. But I guess the production couldn't afford actual Harleys so dirt bikes were used instead. A dirt bike gang wearing full leather and hitting the bars? Hahahaha! The scenes with the crooked sheriff were very cringe worthy, especially the part where he (rather fake) hits some guy with his (toy) Beretta.<br /><br />Don't waste your time watching this. It's amazing that the filmmakers actually got funding for this movie.
