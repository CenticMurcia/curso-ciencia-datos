This film really took me by surprise. What I was expecting was some amateurish first film effort which I hoped would have enough good ideas to make it worth a full viewing; what I got instead was a minor masterpiece of cinema. I cannot remember the last time I saw a British film with such story-telling verve. It's amazing to think that this is a first feature from writer\director Paul Andrew Williams, made on a nothing budget. I can't wait to see what he produces in the years to come.<br /><br />The unfolding of the story is masterfully done. The small details of character interaction are incredibly well observed. This is the future of British cinema, not endless rehashes of Jane Austen and insipid rom coms.
