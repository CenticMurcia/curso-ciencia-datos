Steve Buscemi and Thora Birch...it really doesn't get much better than this, unless Christopher Walken, Dennis Hopper, and Johnny Depp popped up somehow. Then that would be just overkill. Anyway, this is the best I've seen Buscemi in, and Thora Birch cranks up the angst and cynicism she utilized in American Beauty in her role as Enid. She and Scarlett Johansson remind me of Daria and Jane from the cartoon "Daria." "Ghost World" is one of those films that proves how much more effective a story can be without all the sugarcoating popular in Hollywood. The open, thought-provoking ending haunted me like that in Donnie Darko. My only qualm is that Enid could be realistically caustic to the point of being unlikable, but she is so REAL! This is what a teen movie SHOULD be...9/10.
