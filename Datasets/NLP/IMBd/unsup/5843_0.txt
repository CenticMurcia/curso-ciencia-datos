I am not familiar with this type of preaching. Robert Duvall really makes his preacher believable, both in his faults and in his strengths. Certainly one of the best new movies that I have seen in a long time. The story will seem slow to those who demand violence every 5 minutes, but slowness is really necessary to give the full picture of the "Apostle" as he develops as circumstances change. A really outstanding movie.
