I found this movie extremely disappointing; having been referred to it after IMMENSELY enjoying Noah Baumbach's "Kicking and Screaming" and, to a lesser extent, "Mr. Jealousy." This, however, was unadulterated crap. Essentially a handful of obnoxious pretentious snobs, the lot of them investing their meaningless little lives with melodrama, since they seem to have no real problems to speak of. The only even remotely likeable character is that of Chris Eigeman--and I'm probably simply confusing the actor with the character, as I like Eigeman quite a lot. The character of Charlie Black, on the other hand, made me want to hurt him violently nearly every time he spoke, the arrogant little turd. I confess that much of the dialogue of the movie I found incomprehensible--not in terminology, but the semantics behind it seemed to lack any real logic or sense...almost as if they were speaking a foreign language. Perhaps it's because I'm a 'lower-class Midwesterner' and not from the GLORIOUS city of New York...gah.<br /><br />So, if you want entertainment, and you're NOT an elitist New Yorker...look elsewhere.<br /><br />
