This army comedy, a favorite milieu with star comedians, is one of the better Three Stooges shorts I've watched. Its plot  starting in WWI and then moving on to the present (1935, in this case)  anticipates one of Laurel & Hardy's best feature-films, BLOCKHEADS (1938). The boys are layabouts during the war (they even manage to sleep through combat!) who fall foul of their sergeant; years later, we find them as tramps willing to do any work. They're eventually directed to an office building which, unbeknownst to them, is the city's army recruiting post: there they meet again their old sergeant, who's naturally keen to get even with them! During the film's surreal climax, where they're assigned to cannon-fire practice, The Stooges contrive to sink a visiting Admiral's ship and demolish a number of buildings in the vicinity  for which they're soon facing the firing squadonly the weapon turns out to be the cannon itself and the executor of the sentence is none other than their vindictive sergeant!
