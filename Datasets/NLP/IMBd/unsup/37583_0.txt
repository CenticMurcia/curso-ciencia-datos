Okay, again, Night Light Films tried to cash in on "Saw" with a serial killer... well that's not completely true. "Saw" mixed in with that one urban legend that's popularly set in South America.<br /><br />So yeah, like Jigsaw he does this "to help people". Thing is organ harvesters, if they rally exist, are in it for the money. It's just not convincing that this killer's motive is to help the people whose money he benefits from.<br /><br />Granted, this is one of those films where you can actually see where it went wrong for the most part, but of course there's other stuff they added in that's supposed to be poetic or symbolic or something and what it in fact ends up being is really annoying.
