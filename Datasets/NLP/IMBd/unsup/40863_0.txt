Wow...just wow. This movie was just terrible. I walked out half way through the movie, as did a few other people in the theater. Very few parts were remotely funny, and most of them were from the freaking trailer! The best parts came from Darrel Hammond as Jack Swallows, and even those weren't amazing. Nothing saved this movie. I should have learned after to Date Movie that these were the two worst writers from Scary Movie, but I didn't. I mean, for all the people in there, kids especially(which I don't understand why) how many got the inside jokes in the movie about Harold and Kumar? I'm not that many of the people in that theater had seen that movie. I really would expect more from such actors as Crispin Glover. I mean, I remember seeing him for the first time in Back to the Future when I was little, and now this? I mean, Wilird wasn't great but it was better then this. And seriously, Kal Penn, who has a pretty decent name in Hollywood already did this? I think hes hilarious, but not in this. This in an Epic waste of time and money. I wasted ten bucks on this piece of trash! Don't do the same! Be warned, this is an Epic Disaster!
