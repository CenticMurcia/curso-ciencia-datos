I was born and raised in Vancouver so when I heard about The Real World: Vancouver I was pleasantly surprised. Then I heard that it was to be a movie and not the regular show. The movie sounded like an alright, slightly creepy premise and I thought, hey I'll give it a try.<br /><br />Well the movie was just bland. There were no unexpected moments at all with the exception of a few twists at the end but even these seemed tacked-on to give the movie a clean ending.<br /><br />The acting was bad. I spent most of the movie trying to get past the acting to concentrate on what little story there was.<br /><br />After watching this movie I was left thinking that MTV had made a mistake in using Vancouver as the setting of this movie and that they would have been better off filming an actual Real World season there. It's a great city and it was completely and totally wasted by this movie.
