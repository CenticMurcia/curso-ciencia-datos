This movie is definitely a let down from the previous two. Both I and II were serious cops and robbers action movies into which Eddie Murphy added his style of comedy. The comedy added to the action but the movie was still about the good guys vs. bad guys. This movie tries to be all comedy and as a result falls flat, looking for the knockout joke with every scene. The cops look like idiots, the bad guys are caricatures. As a whole the movie is a let down.
