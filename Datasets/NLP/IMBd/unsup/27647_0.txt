This is by far the worst movie I've seen from France in the past 5 years. This supposed comedy is anything but funny. The lead character is a narcissist so wrapped up in his work & making appearances that he's unaware of the impact he has on those around him. Why anyone would associate with this creep, much less have an affair with him is beyond me. His character is so abhorrent that there is no empathy from the viewer to the events that take place. It also fails as any type of social critique or satire as it is decidedly unfunny and doesn't create any insight into its subject matter.
