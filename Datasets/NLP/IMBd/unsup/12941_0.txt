Now this film promos shouted classic from the top of the roof but sadly the film comes only half <br /><br />The film starts off well, Sharmila's death scene is well handled and the drama thickens The film keeps you involved but sadly we expected much more The pigeons part was not well integrated in the plot and also the second half gets predictable and we know the actual killer<br /><br />Even the Saif-Vidya romance track and the climax is half baked<br /><br />Direction by VVC is excellent in parts only Camera-work deserves 5/5<br /><br />Amongst actors Bachchan proves yet again he is an institution His body lang, dialogue delivery, expressions all are flawless even if he is just standing behind some lead actors he makes a maximum impact One of his best works Saif too does a great job,showing his growth as an actor Sanju is full of fun in his role and is brilliant in serious scenes His look and role is similar to THANEDAAR but he does a great job Vidya is mechanical Boman Irani excels in his part, Jimmy too excels in a negative role while Jackie is perfect
