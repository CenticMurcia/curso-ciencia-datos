This Charles Marquis Warren-directed western might be OK if the constant background music would let up for five minutes.<br /><br />Elvis Presley seemed like a nice man, but he could not act and this film's aimless storyline doesn't help as everyone in the movie wanders around for 98 minutes yelling about one thing or another. This was another movie that was supposed to represent Elvis' transition to that of 'serious actor' (the first was 'Flaming Star', 1960), but he just couldn't hack it. Ina Balin co-stars for better or worse while Victor French ('Mr. Edwards' on Little House on the Prairie) does his best to spark some vinegar into the proceedings.<br /><br />Plays like an episode of 'Gunsmoke'.
