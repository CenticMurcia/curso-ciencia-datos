WARNING: SPOILERS! Me and my 9th grade English class watched The Old Man and the Sea movie after reading the book. Overall, I think this movie was pretty bad. The movie was different from the book because there were new characters, Santiago's daughter, who wanted him to live with her and she didn't even try to have an accent. The other main characters were Earnest Hemingway, not played by him, and his wife. Having Hemingway in this story was an interesting idea, but all of the scenes with him are either parts from the book modified to have him in it, without really changing them, or really boring, which just makes it longer and makes it take more time to get to the interesting part, when he catches the marlin. Also, they left out the part where he caught the dolphin, so, in the movie, he was out there for days and he never ate. The new parts did not add to the story at all, except for taking up time. Seriously, I could hardly stay awake while watching it, and I have never fallen asleep in class. <br /><br />The movie did not help me imagine or understand the story any better because it didn't look like how I imagined it would look. It was also really fake looking, when he saw the giant marlin, it didn't look all that big, and also, it was just a movie on a green screen and it looked like the fishing line went through the marlin at one time. When the marlin was strapped to the side of the boat it was the same size as the boat and the book said it was a few feet longer than his boat and it looked like it was made of rubber. When it was dark it looked like he was in a boat in the middle of nowhere. The movie was also less interesting because it did not say what he was thinking, so you didn't feel as attached to him, and a lot of the stuff he thought was important or interesting. 3/10 stars.
