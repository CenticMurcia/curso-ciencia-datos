I have been trying to find this show in all the "Complete Directory to Prime Time and Network Shows," but failed to find it in there even though I had some of the stars right. I didn't realize it didn't count as a network show. I also tried TV Guide.com's Q & A, but since I couldn't remember the name, all I could do was give my best guest at the actors, and that I remember that the logo was a pink rose. I was thinking either Gary Sandy or David Haskell were in it. Well, they both were. I looked under just about every blonde actress including Lois Nettleton, whom I remembered from "Centenial." <br /><br />This show should be required viewing in grade school. I was 21 when it came on, and it made me realize how wrong were things that I was so indoctrinated with that I didn't even realize it.
