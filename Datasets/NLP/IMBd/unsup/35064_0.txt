My wife rented this movie based on the cover tease from Entertainment Weekly that said "Joltingly funny!" We watched 37 minutes, waiting for the laughs to start, before giving up. After reading the spoiler comments on this board, we definitely did the right thing. I guess "Chuck and Buck" is funny, if you're the type of person who laughs at the mentally retarded, or delights in seeing a sixth grade bully beat up a third grader, or maybe if you smoke a lot of pot. Also, if you want to see a Grade B actor doing a poor imitation of Tom Cruise at his worst. If you want to see a film about a disturbed man that really is funny, see "What About Bob." Don't waste your time on this.
