I had heard that Hell Night was an overlooked slasher flick - that is true, but it is nothing special or original. In fact it's rather boring. It's just about watchable but to be honest I almost fell asleep a few times and I was glad when it ended. The storyline reminded me a bit of Madman - so nothing too original - but that wouldn't matter if the film had been more interesting. Everything just takes too long to get going and too much time is spent on the boring characters. Linda Blair seems a bit bored all the way through and her acting is rather limp. There is little gore, at least little gore that you can see because it all happens in the dark. And that's another thing this film suffers from - lack of lighting. Sometimes darkness can add to the atmosphere, but in the case of Hell Night it just makes it more boring. There's a decent scene at the end, but really it isn't worth watching the film for. <br /><br />If you're after an entertaining horror flick it would be best to skip Hell Night and watch something like American Gothic or Scalps instead. There's much better material out there than this.
