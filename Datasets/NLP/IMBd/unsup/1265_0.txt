A unique view for a Holocast movie and a good introduction for children, many who probably have read the book at school ---- they probably will not mind watching it if Kirsten Dunst and Brittney Murphy are in it. Good location work, excellent acting and no glossing over what happened in the camps --- a bit scary for the younger set but a good introduction to films of a more mature theme such as Schindlers List et al.
