HellBent (2004) C-85 min. D: Paul Etheredge-Ouzts. Dylan Fergus, Bryan Kirkwood, Hank Harris, Andrew Levitas, Matt Phillips, Miguel Caballero, Kent James, Samuel A. Levine. Etheredge-Ouzts, who I met at the Philadelphia International Gay & Lesbian Film Festival, directs the first gay slasher movie ever, a fun and scary film that has nothing (other than the gay angle) original about it, but also doesn't pretend to be original. A serial killer in West Hollywood develops a taste for hunky gay men and sets his focus on a group of gay kids attending a Halloween festival. Ouzts seems to have a grasp on the genre and it shows, as the film is gory, scary, and features characters the viewers actually care about and can identify with. The humor also is a major plus, as there are several laughs spread throughout the film. If this is any indication, then there will definitely be more gay slasher films (HELLBENT 2 anyone?). RATING: 8 out of 10.
