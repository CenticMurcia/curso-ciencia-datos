perhaps they already thought Katt. But no everyone up in idiotsville thought this one would fly<br /><br />(spoiler? not sure but just a warning so I can let my mind wander without worrying about it)<br /><br />I watched this when it first came out and recorded it for the heck of it later. This is tv gone bizerk. I'd heard about it before it was filmed. Kitt had a sex change. It was beyond that. It's more like First Knight. Take the basic storyline, move it to another show/movie and wallah, idiotsville. Heck the car looks like **** (enter 4 letter word that rhymes with our favourite little voice). Who'd want it? Hell the car in Knight Rider 2000 looked better than this junk heap. And somehow this crystal is supposed to be a human of sorts? You've got to be kidding. Sure it would have been passible for Knight Rider 2000 to be made into a series, but 2010 can be burned into a molten rock. Wasn't this the idiot who's got an amazing heart valve? I'll be the first to knock him out. Being an original Knight Rider fan this was both upsetting and morose. I believe this came out of the Action Pack crap. (the same thing that brought us Hercules..) you can take that to the bank, if it's along side Hercules imagine....... 3/10
