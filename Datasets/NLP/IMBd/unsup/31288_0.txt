<br /><br />I'm 18 and a huge fan of Bronson, and alot of you probably know because of the reviews i write all the time on Bronson film. And this is a change of pace for Bronson, tough but acting. Well i think he acts great all the time personally. But critics didn't like him very much, but did that stop him been the biggest star in the world?, i don't think so. He was one of the biggest stars back in early 70's to the till late 80's. I mean all the big films he's done, not bad for a kid from the dumps of pennsylvania. I have the dvd of Violent city and he say's in it about been thrown in Jail for going on a train and having he's head shaven, he had a bad life and look what he did with it has he got older. Made himself a big, and i mean big, big star.<br /><br />Well in this film Bronson plays a cop who's trying to stop a serial killer who rapes woman, he rapes a woman on day and she kills him. And then Bronson comes to her saying he know what she did, he threatens her till she gives him the money the man had. But she didn't kill the man he's saying she killed. I can't say anymore because it'll spoil it. <br /><br />It's very smart for it's time and i recommend it to anyone who loves film made in france and anyone who don't because it's Bronson performance that win you over. <br /><br />Watch it, it's worth it.<br /><br />10/10
