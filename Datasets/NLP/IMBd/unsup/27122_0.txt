Anyone who has seen the utterly worthless original will rightfully wonder why a sequel was even filmed. But what's really inconceivable is that this so-called sequel is actually even worse that "Xtro". A shameless "Alien" rip-off, terribly acted and full of very derivative effects. Trust all the comments and don't waste your time with this film.
