...this thing would be well-nigh unwatchable. Honest to Isis, 95% of this movie is just as bad as you've heard. The plot makes virtually zero sense and half of it (the Shield) is both scientifically impossible AND utterly unnecessary. There are broad, hammy performances, jarring leaps, and inconsistencies by the carload. And has anyone got any idea how/why the Zeistians ever evolved their bizarre immortality code? If I ever make a list of the ten most jaw-droppingly stupid movies, this will definitely be there. BUT....<br /><br />I give it a three [and not a two or below] solely for the charm and humor of Sean Connery's performance as Ramirez. Unlike others who, having apparently decided to play their roles here for laughs, went totally overboard into eye-rolling panic or guffawing villainy --Connery plays every one of his scenes in this strange new century with delightful lightness and panache. Whether gracefully bowing out of a stage performance of HAMLET, paying off a snooty men's tailor with his pearl earring, experiencing his first airplane ride (a wonderful sequence!) or giving his life to save MacLeod & girl from a Nameless Evil Machine, Connery is the definition of the gallant cavalier, and saves what otherwise would be an unsavable film. I salute him.<br /><br />Watch it for him if you think you can stand the rest of it....
