This is one of the best films that i have ever watched. it has a very strong storyline, with scenes of action and plenty of drama throughout. A film that had such a wide variety of genre, action, drama, thriller, romance. although there is romantic reference, there is not too much of it, and only refers to it I feel to strengthen the plot itself. A must-see film!
