Since this film has begun to appear on cheap DVD compilations, I feel it my duty to warn the potential viewer of the following: 1. This film was clearly made as a pilot for a television show which I don't believe ever made it to the home entertainment center.<br /><br />2. This film has nothing to do with the King Arthur of legend.<br /><br />3. This film has nothing to do with any possible historical King Arthur.<br /><br />4. This film has nothing to do with either the Dark Ages, or the Middle Ages.<br /><br />5. The dialog is just one long recital of every "swashbuckler" clich√© in film history.<br /><br />6. The actors are very unprofessional and very hammy.<br /><br />7. The story is absurd and absurdly directed. No wonder the actors didn't perform well - given such weak material, who could? 8. The sets were cheaply tossed together, the camera work is shoddy, the editing poor, the costumes a laughable conglomeration of fashions from different time periods, and the action sequences unbelievable and confusingly filmed.<br /><br />Follow the example of TV execs who here made one of their better decisions: reject this film.
