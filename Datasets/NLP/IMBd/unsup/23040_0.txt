Black Friday is a film that's really hard to pin down. It's slow moving, has a lackluster budget, poor character development, repetitive dialogue and an uneven script. With all that said and done you'd think my work would be finished here. But not so...Here's what is really intriguing about this particular film. Enter Gary Daniels. A well known martial arts actor that plays the role of an attorney with a checkered past with the government. One evening, while on his way home, he finds his house surrounded by a chemical defense agency that claims his house is now in the hands of terrorists that plan to make the whole city ground zero. But enough about the plot. This film had me at somewhat of a loss, but I still liked it. Why, you may ask? First off, the opening of the film is intense. Great camera work, a perfect lighting scheme and a real nail biting situation with guns and ski masks. That's all I'll say. The music is original and quite unique. It makes each new situation in the film seem fresh and exciting no matter how much of a dead spot came before it. There are only 2 real fight scenes in the film, but the choreography is brilliant to say the least. Especially the last fight which clocks in at over five minutes. There are still areas of the film that will have you scratching your head, like, oh..The poor lighting in the indoor scenes, the distant camera shots that last over 3 minutes (The first one takes place less than 5 minutes into the film and lacks a close up of a certain female that didn't get enough screen time either.) the lack of any real character development and no real resolve once the film is over. However, Black Friday is still worth a peak, but only if you really like Gary Daniels, or if you like low budget action films that aren't afraid to experiment.
