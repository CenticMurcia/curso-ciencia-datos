In the first Sylvester/Porky pairing, they move into an abandoned house, which Sylvester discovers is inhabited by killer mice. Every time that he saves Porky from getting murdered, the clueless Porky thinks that Sylvester is the crazy one. Sylvester just never seems to have any luck! One thing that I wondered was whether or not the apparently evil rodents are supposed to be Hubie and Bertie (or their relatives); they looked pretty similar. If you've seen enough Looney Tunes cartoons, you may recall that Hubie and Bertie are those mice who play all sorts of nasty tricks on Claude the Cat to get him out of the house.<br /><br />Oh well. Whether they are or not, "Scaredy Cat" is still a great cartoon. "Claws for Alarm" had almost exactly the same plot.
