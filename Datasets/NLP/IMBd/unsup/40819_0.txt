I wanted to love Vacation, I truly did.Seeing as how everyone thought it was a magnificent movie, I wanted to think it was a magnificent movie as well, but instead it turned out that I thought Vacation is pure crap.Nothing was funny.I laughed at maybe one thing.Also, it couldn't keep my interest, and it was "REALLY" boring.I was pausing the movie continuously, because I wanted to get up and do something, for I was about to fall asleep.The acting was good, and the script is somewhat original, but there was a lot of unnecessary material as well, and overall I found this to be a pretty terrible movie.Don't waste your time on it.
