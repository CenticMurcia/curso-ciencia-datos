The terribly slow moving plot and embarrassingly difficult to watch scenes may have been easier to stomach had the acting not been so sub-par, but as it was, it was a struggle to watch the entirety of the film. Perhaps this film may have been humorous circa its production date, but taken out of the context of the eighties, the movie feels outdated, nonsensical, and even (dare I say it!) student-produced. If given the chance, I would never watch this film again, as it was easily one of the worst films I have ever seen.
