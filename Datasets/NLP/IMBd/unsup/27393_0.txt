This one favorite Betty Boop cartoon and also "Cinderella" is one of my favorite fairy stories; I also would like to point out that this short was maded 16 years ago before Disney's theatrical version.<br /><br />Like I said I love animation from Fleischer Studios (also from Disney,Hanna/Barbera,Rankin/Bass and Studio Ghilbi from Japan) and Betty Boop is one of my favorite cartoon characters beside Bugs Bunny,Twetty,Pepe le Pew of Looney Tunes and Disney's Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse. I love the ballroom scene, where Betty/Cinderella and The Prince dance (until midnight that is). And I also love the main title song :<br /><br />"I'm just a poor Cinderella Nobody loves me it seems And like a poor Cinderella I find my romance in dreams.<br /><br />For that's where I meet my Prince Charming When I'm with him, cares stay away I'm just a poor Cinderella But I'll be a princess someday!"
