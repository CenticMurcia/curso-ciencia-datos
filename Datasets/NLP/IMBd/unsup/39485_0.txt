This sagebrush story is out of the ordinary; and a memorable Roy Rogers vehicle. Trigger falls in love with a beautiful golden mare that has stolen treasure inside a specially made shoe by diamond smugglers. When Trigger watches the mare being abused by the villainous smugglers, he kills one of them. Roy takes the blame for his four-legged pal and ends up behind bars. Fans of Trigger will delight in this one. Also in the cast: Dale Evans, Pat Brady, Frank Fenton, Estelita Rodriguez, Chester Conklin and Riders of the Purple Sage. THE GOLDEN STALLION is directed by B-movie master William Witney. An action packed 67 minutes. Recommended for a nice twin-bill: BELLS of SAN ANGELO(1947).
