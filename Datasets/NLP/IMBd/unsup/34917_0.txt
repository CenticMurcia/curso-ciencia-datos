I didn't read all the reviews, here, but the ones I did read seem to praise this flop. I like the cop-type reality programs, but this one sucked!!! W.T.F? It was like when I saw "Evita", "The most talked about movie of the year!" Now, in "Evita" they start out singing. I'm sitting there going..."this movie should be okay once they stop singing." They never stopped! 3 hours of this drivel! Why weren't we warned it had dialect that was sung? Same with Cop Rock. I just didn't get it. Maybe it would have been enjoyable had they maced some dude in the face, then clubbed him in the jewels and the suspect were to sing, "...by golly, that smarts..." or something. I seriously almost got sick watching this garbage. Anyone who thought it was a good show should have their head examined. Absolute junk! Thirty minutes of my life I'll never get back.
