I have not read anyone else's comments on this, so this is my response to having seen a video, purchased cheap. I have for a long time felt a great sympathy (in the sense of fellow feeling) for lesbians, and if these three short dramas did not make all but the most rabid homophobes feel that they were perfectly normal human beings, with the normal human emotions, I don't know what would. The first segment was almost unbearably sad; the second had you willing the central figure to defy the attitudes of her equally lesbian friends and keep dating the woman who was expressing her individuality a different way, which was anathema to the others because it had "male" characteristics; the third portrayed a loving partnership's efforts to get one of them pregnant, and their joy when they finally managed it, extremely well. For me, the acting was uniformly excellent, and I commend everyone involved (some famous names).
