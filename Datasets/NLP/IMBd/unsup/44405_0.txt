This is utterly awful crap by Franco! How does he have guts to call this de Sade. Franco's idea of sadean characters is acting idiot, laughing loud, talking soft, smirking... Not a single blasphemy is heard and characters claim to be "searching for pleasure" (add drunken accent)?! If Franco was serious about understanding anything about de Sade, he wouldn't have to follow the material carefully nor show detailed endless debaucheries, just get few things right about morals and God, and lot's of people would have been happy...<br /><br />Even if we would review this movie as a romantic comedy or a big Victorian era cocktail party the acting, directing, writing, music, etc just drive movie lover into despair. As a de Sade adaptation this is even worse. Rating 1/10.
