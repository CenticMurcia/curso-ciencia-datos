Based on the bestselling novel by Grace Metalious, Peyton Place is a solid melodrama all about the secrets and scandals of a small New England town. John Michael Hayes did a fine job of adapting the book, tightening the plot and losing most of the cynicism, though it can be argued that the book's feminist slant was lost in the process as well. Mark Robson's direction is the model of craftsmanship; the film is slick entertainment that moves along smoothly and assuredly. And what a cast! Lana Turner justly earned an Academy Award nomination for her work her (sadly, her only nomination); obviously identifying with elements of the role, she delivers her most even keeled performance. She also has terrific chemistry with Diane Varsi, playing her daughter. Other great performances are provided by Hope Lange, Russ Tamblyn, Terry Moore, and Lloyd Nolan. Peyton Place is more than just an artifact of the 1950s; it's been highly influential, and if you don't believe me, just take a look at Dawson's Creek.
