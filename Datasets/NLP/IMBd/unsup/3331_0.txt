Writer/director Uwe Boll's war drama takes place in the Cu Chi jungles of Viet Nam circa 1968. There is no rule book, no play book for war...especially this one. Armed with handguns, flashlights and knives, Sergeant Vic Hollowborn(MIchael Pare) leads a combat unit into underground warfare with the goal to eradicate the Viet Cong resistance forces burrowed effectively in their narrow and dusty domain. Hand to hand battle not for pride...but survival. Interesting, but nothing real special. Pare is a believable bigoted leader. Others in the cast: Nate Parker, Wilson Bethel, Brandon Fobbs, Brad Schmidt, Jane Le and Scott Ly.
