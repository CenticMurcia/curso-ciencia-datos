Bruce Lee stars as Billy Lo, an action star (of the martial arts variety) who mobsters are trying to force to sign with them, however after taking a couple of beatings and an assassination attempt, Lo fakes his death, has reconstructive surgery and looks to teach the mobsters what the meaning of "No" is. Game Of Death is Bruce Lee's worst movie. This is an obvious truth. In terms of quality Game Of Death is sometimes even lower than Bruce Le or Bruce Li's movies. The sequence where Bruce Lee's face is pasted over the mirror (As others have mentioned) is truly as shoddy as it gets and overall the movie has a few alright action sequences in the beginning but it's all very sub-par stuff. That is until Bruce Lee takes on Danny Inasanto and Kareem Abdoul Jabbar and of course which boosts its rating into low mediocrity. Also of notice (Though it's all blatantly obvious even to those who have never seen a Bruce Lee movie) is the use of a stand in, in which the stand in wears sunglasses, bandage over his face, an old man's costume and of course a hilariously bad fake beard. All of this is laced with Bruce Lee footage from his earlier movies. Usually to a closeup of Lee stock footage then followed by the stunt double's back. In other words this is a very badly made movie but what makes it worth watching at least on a genre level is the climax which is awesome in its crispness and pace. In fact the only thing that leaves an impression on one after watching this, is how much better Lee's original version would've easily been had he lived to complete it because as we know Robert Clouse added 90% new footage and made it into what we got here. Still worth a look for die hard fans (Like me) who will watch anything with Bruce Lee. Because of the awesome climax Game Of Death earns mediocrity the same way an A+ on a test would bring a grade of a D+ up to a C-.<br /><br />* * out of 4-(Fair)
