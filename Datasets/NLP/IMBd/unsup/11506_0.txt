This episode is my favourite because it best demonstrates the potential the show had to offer.<br /><br />I remember watching the pilot and anxious for the following week when the following episode was on.<br /><br />John Rhys-Davies was one of the original reasons for me watching the show because I saw him in "James Bond 007" "The Living Daylights" and "Indiana Jones".<br /><br />I think it is one of the best pilots I have seen for a show.<br /><br />The pilot gives reasonable insight into the characters of the show before they set off "sliding" into parallel worlds.
