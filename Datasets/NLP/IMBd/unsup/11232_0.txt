I've never seen lots of Indian movies. Monsoon Wedding was my one and only, in fact. This was a great film to follow up with. It definately offers viewers a style of movie which isn't as familiar as typical Hollywood productions. While Monsoon Wedding was a great film, it was in a format I was comfortable with...while Asoka gave me something new. The muscial accompaniment had me, at first, shaking my head and thinking "what in the world"...but now I can't imagine the film without it. The score is compelling and I now own both the DVD and the soundtrack, lol. <br /><br />If you want something off the beaten track. Something purely ethnic and not just a Hollywood production with minority players: give Asoka a chance. No, it may not be historically correct, but that wasn't the purpose of this movie. It's for pure entertainment and enjoyment and it succeeds very well in bringing both to the screen.
