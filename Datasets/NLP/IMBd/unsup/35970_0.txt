This is a Burt Kennedy western? Is that Strother Martin acting like Jerry Lewis trying to play a rapist? Why does Ernest Borgnine's character seem to forget at least twice what he said or did in previous scenes? This is one of the most off-kilter western movies I've ever scene until the last 20 minutes which is superb but seems to come out of left-field from a completely different movie. Otherwise, this one plays like The Over The Hill Gang Meets I Spit On Your Grave. This one is either brilliant totally beyond my understanding, or a gory misfire. Until shown otherwise, I give it 4/10.
