Not very many movies come to my mind that covered as much geography as this one.<br /><br />Naturally, being a Hollywood product, there is not a whole lot of realism here, but there is a whole lot of entertainment, and a whole lot of talent.<br /><br />Louis Wollheim apparently never became a household name, but his performance in this film would indicate he should have.<br /><br />In one priceless scene, when, without inter-titles, the Bill Boyd character whispers the explanation of a word (often found in the Bible), Wollheim's expression almost makes the whole movie worthwhile.<br /><br />Lewis Milestone's direction is another plus. This was still early in his career, but his use of inventive angles and a moving camera showed brilliance.<br /><br />Ian Keith made a superb suave villain in one of his best roles.<br /><br />Being a silent film, "Two Arabian Knights" probably won't be shown even on Turner Classic Movies very often, but I urge film fans to grab any opportunity to watch it.
