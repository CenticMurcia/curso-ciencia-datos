This movie is a great revelation, a great treat . Several of the actors come from my home state of Maryland. If you are at all into musicals, you will be impressed,I have no doubt. Following the lives of several teens over the course of 2 months at a theater arts summer camp, the movie tracks , between very impressive musical numbers, the sex lives, personal battles, and identity crisis in a real manner without being preachy(which I hate) Watch for The Ladies Who Lunch number, also the Turkey Lurkey number, they are show stoppers.My boyfriend thought since it's a musical, it must be a kid movie, but it is quite the opposite, very entertaining. You will enjoy this movie, If you like theater or musicals.
