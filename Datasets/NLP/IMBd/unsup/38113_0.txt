WARNING: THIS MOVIE IS SO BAD THAT YOU SHOULDN'T OPERATE HEAVY MACHINERY WHILE WATCHING OR COULD CAUSE HEAVY RETARDATION AS A RESULT FROM WATCHING DUE TO THE TERRIBLNESS OF THIS MOVIE First of all I saw what ever this video or supposed movie and thought it was the worst film I've ever seen. Whoever made this ( i don't want to call it a movie because i don't think its even worthy of that) video recording of these so called actors did so because I believe they want to tell people that they are actors and have been in a movie.<br /><br />I was reading the other reviews and I cant believe some people actually had the nerve to give it an o.k. review. Someone said in one of the reviews that he worked in this film, please you should have paid me to watch this movie. Anyone thinking about seeing this movie, put it this way i was so mad about getting this movie i gave the DVD to my 3yr old little sister to draw on it and smash it up in her sand box. This video is not even worthy of a rating because its not even a movie. This video is like watching a group of kids play zombies and humans, A few play the zombies and a few play the humans. I should have told blockbuster that if i wanted to see a bunch of retards run around in costumes i would have gone to the trailer park thats about 4 miles away from my house. By the way if anyone who was in this movie can read this review, I hope you have luck finding a job, i know the reason why you probably made this video is because the economy is bad and you must be one on those people that got laid off from the peanut factory. If I knew all you have to do is run around with a camcorder, act retarded,and make a deceiving front cover for the DVD, then i guess i can start making movies too.<br /><br />TAKE MY ADVICE TO ANYONE WHO Hasn't SEEN THIS SO CALLED MOVIE YET. THE COVER OF THE DVD TRICKED ME IN TO THINKING THIS MIGHT BE A Legitimate MOVIE, THE COVER IS ONLY A TRICK.
