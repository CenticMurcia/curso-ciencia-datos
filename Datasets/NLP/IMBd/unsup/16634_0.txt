Setting aside the fact that Joan Cusack is a fantastically beautiful woman and always worth the price of admission, I am continually amazed that Steve Martin can ham it up and make it work. Rick Moranis is always the worried little guy and that's OK but Martin is at his best, clowning it up as a Mafia good guy, wearing some of the most outlandish outfits since Jack Nicholson in Prizzi's Honor. Don't get me wrong. There's nothing funny about the mafia or the mob. But, Martin creates his own persona with some great lines as funny as Marissa Tomei and Joe Pesci in My Cousin Vinnie. As a loveable sleazebag, Martin is great...and, of course, Joan Cusack is also great. Check this one out. It's fun.
