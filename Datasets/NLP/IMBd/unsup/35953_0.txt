Riddles of the Sphinx (2008) which I saw on the UK Sci-Fi Channel Today out of boredom more than anything, is clearly a homage (Rip-off) of Indiana Jones, Right down to the Main Character's job as a College Professor and his choice of clothes complete with Indiana Jones style Hat..<br /><br />The biggest problems with this is the dire acting and totally unconvincing performance by the lead actor<br /><br />The budget is VERY low as most of the 'action' in filmed in front of not-very anonymous Backscreen...as The Filming ALL took place in Canada and There are only 4 characters in the entire Film...So the 'Double Agent' is obvious from the get go...<br /><br />I'm a big fan of these types of Adventures, but this badly needed more money spent...and as a result my rating is low.<br /><br />*1/2 out of *****
