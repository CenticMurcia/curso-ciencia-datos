Ken Loach goes American and tells a story of illegal immigrant workers and how their 'rights' are trampled on. Whilst a good enough depiction of all-too unacknowledged systematized injustice, the moral high ground is unbalanced and self-congratulatory. As a simple documentary it might have been interesting - as entertainment it is a well-made film that fails to entertain.
