I have recently watched 'Kisna: The Warrior Poet' at the theater, and i must say these reviews i have read about are seriously garbage. Kisna is a beautiful love story, and is a great film altogether. Sure the acting staff wasn't as strong in the 'name power' of things, but WHO CARES....if u have actors that are not known, it doesn't matter as long as they do well. My advice to all of you that are reading this review after reading all others is to watch the movie, because i loved it, Antonia and Vivek are going places and after this movie you'll know it<br /><br />It's just plain beautiful, just them looking into each other's eyes is sexy, just the kind of feeling you need in a love story, follow Kisna as he goes in the paths of 'Dharma' and 'Karma'....Though if one thing has failed in this movie it was the late Amresh Puri, his last film was no big phenom acting wise, but Kisna is a film to remember, and hey i didn't even think about falling asleep during the 3 hours it was on, or the songs, it is unforgettable, if you got a girl......take her to see Kisna, i think she'll love you for it ;)!
