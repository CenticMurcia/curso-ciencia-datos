The credits sequence with "Weird Al" Yankovic is the only bit worth watching. Save yourself the Blockbuster night and just watch it on his DVD video collection and pass on this movie. A tired collection of fart jokes and name puns pass for wit in this alleged comedy. Dick Steele, Agent WD-40? Puh-leeze. The able cast is also hampered by terrible pacing and what looks like last-minute editing and over-dubbing to avoid a lawsuit by General Motors. (And you had wondered why General Mortars was the only non-pun name in the bunch.) I'm betting Andy Griffith doesn't have this one on his resume'. If you want to see a quality Bond/spy spoof, try the Derek Flynt movies with James Coburn or even the first Austin Powers flick. No matter how hard it begs, do not pull this movie's finger.
