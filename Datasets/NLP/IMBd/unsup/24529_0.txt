If you've read the comics, you'll be happy with this adaptation (and you'll be the part of the audience that gets the yellow spandex joke!) My friends that I saw this with, who were NOT familiar with the XMen beyond the promos, also enjoyed this very much.<br /><br />(Wolverine's original costume in the comics was made primarily of... yellow spandex).<br /><br />
