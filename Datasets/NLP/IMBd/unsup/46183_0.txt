This episode does contain everything a really bad Star Trek show needs. A plastic conflict, created merely for moral purpose, a sentimental, naive way of raising theological and philosophical questions and an easy one dimensional solution at last. Furthermore there's not the slightest moment of suspense or innovation to this one. It's plain boring... Questioning death penalty is a highly complex matter, as is comparing different law and moral systems. But the biggest impudence is that God thing. Couldn't they have thought of something more intelligent and original? <br /><br />The cast seems to have felt as uneasy with it during production as I did while watching. McFadden is unconcentrated and delivers one of her worst performances, showing that there is everything but a loving relationship between her and Wesley (or Will Wheaton). Picard's overly harsh treatment of Data quite set me up as well as the latter one's relapse to an earlier state of development. We may be in the 9th episode but Data already has learned a lot about humans, though surely not enough to prevent any conflict sufficient to know what is considered important. Picard's silly speech at the end finishes this one off and leaves the audience in despair (or should I say outrage?)...<br /><br />The Edo do have some lovely girls and the idea of a paradise-like society is as old as mankind itself but that's not enough to get away with. We see Picard's quarters for the first time (why does Dr. Crusher enter without permission?) and the opening shot, showing the Captain's face from a low angle while circling around him has something to it but all the rest is pure rubbish (should I exclude Worf's remarks on Klingon sexuality?). And honestly, has anyone ever believed, Wesley would die in the end (I for my part kept hoping, although I knew better)?<br /><br />I want to watch Star Trek to get inspiration and not a lecture on simple solutions.
