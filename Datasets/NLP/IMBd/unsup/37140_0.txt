Oh my God.<br /><br />What a pile of unexplained crap.<br /><br />This movie is one of those where I'm sure the creator knows the secrets and meanings behind everything...and he think he can get away with leaving the unexplained to people and that maintaining their interest...but he's wrong.<br /><br />Darkside Blues begins in a state of confusion and while you expect an answer, it ends in exactly the same point.<br /><br />It's like watching the middle of a movie. You get the meat...but you never know how it started or what ends up happening.<br /><br />Maybe the MANGA is better. I'd try that.<br /><br />Avoid this movie. It is a waste and just utterly useless.
