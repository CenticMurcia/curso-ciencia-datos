"Reaper" is a brilliant show, not one episode has seemed flat (some have been better than others, but none have been bad at all) and it truly does have an ensemble cast. Sam (Bret Harrison) is terrific, "Sock" (Tyler Labine) has perfect comedic timing and steals most of the scenes he's in, Andi (Missy Peregrym) is a fantastic actress (and not to mention has a dazzlingly bright smile), the Devil (Ray Wise) is by far the best TV/film devil I've seen. Ben (Rick Gonzales) is not as good as the others, but still very funny.<br /><br />The end of every episode is satisfying; I've found VERY few plot holes or flaws. The show is deep and complicated without being confusing, and every episode has several laugh-out-loud and edge-of-your-seat moments.<br /><br />The concept of "Reaper" is very original, the script is flawless, the acting is phenomenal, the special effects are gorgeous, and it's the highlight of my Tuesday night.
