This is Quentin Tarantino´s very poor attempt to make an Hollywood version of "Lady Snowblood". I was extremely disappointed wen i saw "Kill Bill Vol.1" and there are many reasons why.<br /><br />The Reasons Vol.1<br /><br />According to some sources, this movie was inspired by a great Japanese movie "Lady Snowblood". The story is´nt exactly the same, but close enough. Music and environment are very similar, but then "Lady Snowblood" have something that "Kill Bill" does´nt. Meiko Kaji, who plays the revenging women is about 300 times better actress then "Uma-i-should-be-a-waitress-Thurman".<br /><br />The Reasons Vol.2<br /><br />Quentin has become a "Hollywoodirector". Same as John Woo and other great directors, he forgot what he was doing in the beginning. The money is killing these guys and the great art that they have been doing for so many years.<br /><br />The Reasons Vol.3 (!!Spoilers!!)<br /><br />One big annoying flaw. How is it possible for a white girl to kill an Asian assassin, who has been trained since god know how many years?<br /><br />Well, i could write all knight, but i hope that you people understand one thing. This should be a samurai movie and the ONLY thing that make this movie worth watching is Lucy Liu. She´s just perfect!!<br /><br />Kill Bill<br /><br />Me...............3/10 IMDB users.....8.2/10<br /><br />Lady Snowblood<br /><br />Me...............9/10 IMDB users.....8.5/10
