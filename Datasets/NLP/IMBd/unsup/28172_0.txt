The Southpark movie is pretty good. It is layed out like a musical, and had many catchy (if not raunchy) songs. There is A LOT of blue language, so don't bring the kids. There were some really funny parts, (I.E. Bill Gates.) but on the whole it was like a long episode of the show without the censors.<br /><br />Also I found it ironic that the plot of the movie was based on how americans can take massive amounts of violence in movies as long as they don't say any naughty words. Which is proably why the rating committee wanted to give this movie an NC-17 rating because they slam on them so much. Anyway, very funny, very crude and very entertaning.
