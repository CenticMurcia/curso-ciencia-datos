Monty Clift really struggles with intellectualism in his role. Liz??? What a bad story line. As movie fans watch this horrible movie, they anticipate that the movie will end "please now and thank you". But the film does not end at any of many, many, monotonous, multiple chances at ending: it keeps going and going with subplot and subplot and scene change and scene change. Someone should have chopped a really big tree down on Monty. An ex-husband, like Mike Todd, could have assassinated Liz Taylor early on in the film.<br /><br />When viewers hope or pray to GOD that the film will finally end: ... a train whistle in the background of a dull scene "transports"(?) the attention of the movie watcher to yet another subplot.... and it is not Steve McQueen in the "Great Escape". "Wheee! Wheeee!" or "Ding! Ding!", a train whistles or a church bell dongs. The trapped, by now stupefied, movie watcher finds him or herself looking for a road map in the darkness of the theater. Gasping, they realize that the map is in the glove compartment of the car out in the parking lot. Bored, blitzed, bedazzled people, who paid money for this punishment, are trying to find a way out. It takes the American Civil War to stop this movie script!!! A car crash couldn't.<br /><br />"Please, no more"! "Bang, Bang, ... Bang, Bang", the producer of this Cliff-Taylor fiasco should have been shooting stars and doing this on screen with a re-write of the script. Lee Marvin could have played a widely grinning, ax handling timber-man in what would have been an Oscar(TM) winning role.
