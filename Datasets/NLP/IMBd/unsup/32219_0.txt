As far as Woody Allen goes, I would have to say that this is his most impressive film that I have seen. Allen wrote, directed and stars in the hilarious film, answering different questions asked about sex. It jumps from one strange bit to the next, including things such as, a doctor who has sex with a sheep, newly weds with bedroom problems, a transvestite caught in public, a game show satire called "What's My Perversion" (ironically featuring a younger Regis Philbin), and the funniest being a mad scientist whose breast implant experiment breaks loose and a giant silicone filled tit roams the countryside, eventually being caught in a huge bra. Classic stuff here, well worth checking out.
