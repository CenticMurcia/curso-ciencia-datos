While the acting is not Academy Award Winning and the film is not the scariest horror movie I have ever seen, it still delivers a lot of what a horror film should have. The setting, being at a spooky farm in the country along with the mysterious meteor from the sky that brings inexplicable destruction are a classic setting for a good horror film. Some of the effects may leave something to be desired but the dark cinematography and several of the films more shocking moments give it the creepy element that we are watching a very dreadful scenario unfold. <br /><br />I would say, that this is one of those films that work best when being viewed, home alone, late at night, with all the lights out, preferably on Halloween.
