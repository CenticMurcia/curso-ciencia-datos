I would have enjoyed this movie much more had I not had "Beautiful Thing" to compare it to. While entertaining at times and with some truly funny situations, it falls short in many respects. The acting seems to suffer as the hunk just isn't believable in some key scenes. And can anyone make a movie without using most or all of the stereotypes? The character who's comfortable being gay is not athletic and gets beat up. The character who doesn't want to be gay is athletic and snubs his gay lover. The girl next door is overweight, wears too much makeup and is dramatic, so of course she is the gay guy's best friend. C'mon, can't we be a little more realistic. I'm giving this movie high marks for being what it is, but it could have been so much more. I think I'll watch "Beautiful Thing" again.
