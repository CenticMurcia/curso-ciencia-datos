The only thing I could find about this movie that I liked was the performance of Lee Majors. He carried the part very well, but the entire movie had a lot of disappointing acts. They shot at each other and missed too many times. Marshal Ward was suppose to be such a good shot to make such misses at still targets. He had hit Harlan Tyler on a running horse at about 400 yards and before that he had killed another running rider early in the picture. He then missed Will Kane and Ben Irons sitting still at a closer distance, several times. The in-town action was much better than the outdoor scenes. The early scene with Will Kane sitting at a table without a gun talking tough to Irons and Tyler was too unbelievable, I'm sure they would have noticed he wasn't wearing a gun long before he got up out of the chair. However, at the end of the movie Will is wearing his gun in a vest holster. So confusing. Irons later admitted that he had never killed anyone, so why was he willing to kill Will Kane? Movies need to be more realistic especially westerns. This director, Jerry Jameson would be well advised to watch Lonesome Dove before he directs anymore Western movies.
