This is one of the worst films I've ever scene. And if this is the kind of film Britain is making then let the industry die.<br /><br />I was stunned at how bad this film is.<br /><br />The acting except for Marc Warren and Sienna Guillory is awful. Alec Newman stares madly into space a lot of the time. The supporting cast are so wooden that they can't possibly be professional actors.<br /><br />Guillory and Newman aren't helped by the fact their characters are selfish, boring and unlikeable.<br /><br />Marc Warren alone has an interesting character and his performance is all that makes it watchable. The film does at least pick up some energy when he is screen. When he's not the rest of the cast mope around in boredom.<br /><br />The script is dull. Characters sit in the bath or smoke joints while talking about living life to the full.<br /><br />The orgy scene is laughable with one character spouting pretentious rubbish about exploring the darker side while wearing a dog collar.<br /><br />I stuck with this, like I was watching a car crash to see how bad it would get. And when it thankfully finished I was left with a feeling of "So What?".<br /><br />Its a film that desperately wants to shock with it scenes of explicit sex and violence against children but to be honest is tedious and reminds me of the kind of thing Sixth formers would make to upset their parents.<br /><br />The fact this film was backed when so many others are struggling to find finance is another nail in the coffin of the British film Industry.<br /><br />Avoid.
