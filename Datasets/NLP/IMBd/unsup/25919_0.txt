I've watched all 4 episodes of "10 Items or Less" about 4 times each now. This is one of those rare shows that remains funny when watching it again and again. I had mentioned earlier that I was waiting for the show to come into it's own. Guess what? It's finding it's niche. It's sparking feedback and dialog from it's fans and when the show comes out on DVD (as it will undoubtedly will) I'm going to be at the local grocery store to buy it. :)<br /><br />Okay, from the very first time I saw the previews, I knew it was a rip off of THE OFFICE and that Leslie was a poor substitute for Michael Scott. "10 Items or Less" is a poor shadow of THE OFFICE, but I have to admit that I was laughing from the first scene, but it was the awkwardness of Leslie in his new situation as an owner/manager of Greens & Grain. The thing that impressed me was that outside of Robert Clendim, the cast are virtually unknown, including creator/actor John Lehr. But the quirkiness of the characters works well and in my opinion, fun to watch. <br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this show has to do A LOT to come close to being THE OFFICE, but it will be a fun show to watch as it comes into it's own.<br /><br />There have been only two episodes shown on TBS, and my DVR is set to record all of the future episodes.
