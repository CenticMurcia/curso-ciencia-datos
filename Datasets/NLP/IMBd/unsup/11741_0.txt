Forget Eddie Murphy's Beverly Hills Cop movies! Josef Fares sets a new standard in laughing at the police. Right from the start you start laughing and keep laughing until at least four fifth of the film. After that it starts to lose its magic, but it's still highly amusing. The strange thing is that you can see the jokes coming from miles away, but they work excellently nevertheless. With this movie Josef Fares definitely puts on the stage himself as a highly talented comedy director and proves that Jalla, Jalla! wasn't a lucky shot. 4 out of 5
