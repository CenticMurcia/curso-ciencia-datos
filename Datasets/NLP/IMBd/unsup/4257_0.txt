I was totally not expecting the whole sixth sense twist. I really thought he had lost his memory and that someone was trying to kill him. The end totally confused me. Why did Simon wake up again at the end? Was he about to relive past mistakes all over again? Apparently by the number of bottles of wine on his brothers desk he'd done it before. I keep wondering why he followed his brother up the stairs each time. Or for that matter, why he never bothered to answer the phone? I guess I'll have to watch it again with a more observant eye. It really bothers to me to watch a movie and not have all the answers. At least the sixth sense took the time to explain its self in the end.
