I really enjoyed this documentary as an aspiring filmmaker and a big fan of horror. Some of the films didn't seem very good at all but it is definitely encouraging to see a bunch of independent filmmakers doing what they love the most and actually getting their films out there. It makes me feel like I can do the same.<br /><br />I think that this movie is mostly meant for people who want to make movies because it really seems to be geared in that direction. All young horror filmmakers should see it and take to heart what is said in it. You might be surprised how much you learn from this little documentary. Now go watch it and enjoy.
