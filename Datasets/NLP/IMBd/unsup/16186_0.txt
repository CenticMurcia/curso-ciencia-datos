I understand that this film was intended to portray a deeper story of a man's understanding of life, but it was very poorly executed and in my opinion, failed miserably. I was hoping for a gripping and thrilling story yet I was bored to tears and found that I had to force myself to watch it in its entirety. The only captivating part of the movie was the balloon crash... the rest could have been summed up in a short film. Not to mention that the ending was a total cop-out. I was disappointed in this film, but gave it a 3 because I've seen worse. It could have been slightly better had it been shorter or if the story had been told at a faster pace.
