As a Pagan, I half expected the overt Christian themes of forgiveness and redemption to make me slightly uncomfortable, but such was not the case. The entire family applauded the end of the film, not wildly but slowly, with thought and deliberation. Quite frankly we were blown away! Kiefer Sutherland is one of my wife's favorite actors and was, frankly, the only reason I rented it. I am SO glad I did! I remember the moment, when they helped the injured Japanese, when I realized that "To End All Wars" was not so named as reference to the WWI slogan, but as subtle hint that the only way we, as a race, will ever outgrow war is when we all realize that we are truly killing our brothers and when we understand that the wars will cease. To kill the enemy you must hate him. If you can love your enemy you cannot kill him. More, if you can love you enemy more than yourself, he cannot kill you.
