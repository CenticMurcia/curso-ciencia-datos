I just watched this movie last night and thought it was awesome! The movie did spark some weird discussions with my significant other about upper deckers, but the point is that it generated conversation. It's rare to find a movie that makes you think about life, responsibility, and poop. Forget the dude that made the Sixth Sense -- this is the best movie ever made in Bucks County, and does far more service to its lovely citizens and scenery. Well done, especially considering this is director von Manahan's first full-length film. I, for one, can't wait to see what else he has in store.<br /><br />Oh, and Bill Tanner is a freakin' matin√©e idol.
