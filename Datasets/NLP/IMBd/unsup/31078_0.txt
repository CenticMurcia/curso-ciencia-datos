I came into the cinema already having seen the trailer not expecting much from the movie. The first 45 minutes were OK starting with a few funny lines and getting a taster of what was to come of the main character. However the movie became a bit of a shambles as soon as the first ghost came along and the movie never really engaged me from then on.<br /><br />I know that from the title i wasn't going to get a lot of realism but what i found hard to believe was the way Connor mead (main character) was able to have a life changing moment in one night ,from everything guys would want (most men would agree) to having everything a woman would want from a man, without the woman having to do anything which of course doesn't teach us anything.<br /><br />the ending was very weak for an already weak storyline with a seemingly impossible wedding being put back on again after Connor has a 2 minute pep talk to the bride ,in which she realises she is wrong for not wanting to marry the man who slept with her best friend still sitting in the same car on the way to the airport. to cap it all off we return to the ghosts chatting each other up and everyone lives happily ever after.<br /><br />If the producers actually had an idea of when to release the film they should have done it around Christmas because of the closeness to "A Christmas Carol" and people don't mind a corny film or a corny song because it's Christmas...instead it seems like everyone got it wrong with this one
