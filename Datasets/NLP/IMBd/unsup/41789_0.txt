Tonight instead of a single movie review I tackle a recently released DVD flipper disc of 2 rarely scene Mexican Horror movies, both directed by Ruben Galindo Jr.. The first movie is Cemetery of Terror lets take a look.<br /><br />Cemetery of Terror (aka Cementerio Del Terror) is about a Satan worshiping killer who is supposedly shot dead by some local cops only to be resurrected by a bunch of teenagers who steal his body from the morgue and use a book of black magic to revive him. The cops are warned by the killers doctor that he is more than a normal man but a satanic killing machine. These elements were very Halloween like in their approach with this in the beginning but then this idea seems to dissolve as we get to meet the teens that will resurrect him and finally to another group of young trick or treaters that end up facing off with this Satanic fiend.<br /><br />This is where the problems with this movie come into play. I really liked how this movie started as it looked like it was going to have shades of Halloween with the directors own little twist added however the movie, which starts off slow builds up for about a good 10 minute killing spree (nearly 50 minutes in, ZZZZZZZZZZ)then the movie veers off into weirdness as it turns from a satanic killer from the grave movie to an all out zombie film..thats right an all out zombie film. You see remember I said there are some trick or treaters well these kids end up taking on the killer and some of his undead friends culminating into a ho hum ending.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this movie but for every decent thing they did they did 2 more things wrong. The movie seemed to try out one too many ideas into one movie when they should have just stayed with the main point at hand. Despite 1 or 2 OK kills the movie really drug along in parts and the whacked out last 20 minutes had me scratching my head. All in all not a bad film but really not all that good either. My score for Cemetery of Terror: 4/10: Below Average, with alittle more thought about what kind of movie they wanted, Satanic Killer, Zombie, or Scooby Doo(mainly do to the kiddie sequences) flick this could have at least been mildly entertaining however, since the movie bounced all over the place I cannot recommend this as a have to see film, maybe a rental at best.<br /><br />Head over to Grave Robbers for the second film review of this flipper disk from BCI Eclipse
