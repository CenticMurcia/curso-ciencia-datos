Neighbours the show that has lost its way well where to begin, well we had so many good story lines from plane crashes to evil twin brothers but now the show has gone downhill. first off most of the new people on the street like Marco are simply boring where as Bridget is just annoying to the point where you wish the show was cancelled.hopefully the show will pick up again if they bring back evil Paul,Connor, Stu, and get rid of Marco, Didge, all the people who are involved in a storyline with Marco and Ringo as well for good measure.well that's all i have to say really i used to love this show but now it really has just begun to annoy me.<br /><br />p.s the actors who play ben and mickey are also terrible please cut them from the show
