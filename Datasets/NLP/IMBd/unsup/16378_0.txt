I had the privilege of seeing the restoration of the film "The General" in Munich in the 60's. Buster Keaton came to the the premier. He didn't go into the theater, but he was rewarded by the sound of the audience. Recently, I viewed a video tape of the movie, and was disappointed that it was not from the restored version which had excellent picture and sound quality. One should take care in choosing among available copies.
