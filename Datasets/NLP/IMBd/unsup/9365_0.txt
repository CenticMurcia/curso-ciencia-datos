Quite simply one of the best movies ever (of the genre).<br /><br />The special effects are great.<br /><br />The story is great.<br /><br />The acting is great.<br /><br />The characters are great (and very believable), which make you really care about what happens to them.<br /><br />Most movies at the grosser end of the horror genre (including Cronenbergs) usually have such poor characterisation that I simply don't care about what happens to them - this movie is very different.<br /><br />Probably Cronenbergs masterpiece.
