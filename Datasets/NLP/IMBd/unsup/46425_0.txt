I remember seeing this way back when I was 9 years old. My mother and her sister were going to go watch When A Man Loves A Woman while my father, my sister, and I were going to watch The Flintstones. I remember struggling to stay awake through this film. The story was so boring I just didn't care for it. The sets looked hideously bad. Everything looked terrible. Some of the objects in Bedrock had bright colors. Why? So the little kids could gawk at it. <br /><br />When this came out on video cassette, I never watched it again. Neither did my sister. I don't know why all these great actors got involved with this movie. Just cause you think that making a live-action movie based off of a cartoon doesn't mean it will make you a lot of money. I remember seeing a brief glimpse of The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas. I was shocked how they could make a sequel to one of the worst movie adaptations to a cartoon series ever! <br /><br />Overall, it's garbage! Watch the cartoon instead.<br /><br />I give this movie 1 star out of 10. I hate this movie!
