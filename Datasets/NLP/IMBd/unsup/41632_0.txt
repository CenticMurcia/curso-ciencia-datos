Jean-Claude Van Damme stars as Gibson Rickenbacher (!) a soldier seeking revenge for the murder of his loved ones in a post apoclypse setting, where "Flesh Pirates" rule with an iron fist. Poorly made actionflick, stumbles from one pointless scene to another without any real plot to fall back on, hits a nadir when Van Damme is crucified on the cross. However many people might not make it that far.
