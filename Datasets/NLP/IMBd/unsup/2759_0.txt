If you are in need of a clich√© ridden, stereotypical trawl through a fantasy England, then this is the film for you.<br /><br />Most of my time watching the film was wondering how the writers and producers managed to convince anyone to make this tripe. Denzel Washington produces, at most times, passable, mockney accent although there are times when he lapses into American.<br /><br />Apart from Denyel Washington, who I like a lot, the acting is wooden and comical. How anyone could describe this as gritty is beyond me. There is a word approximating to that which is far more valid.<br /><br />From the first scene to the last the script does not disappoint as it becomes ever more bizarre in what I can only assume is an attempt to trawl the lowest common denominators.<br /><br />If its a choice between watching paint dry and this, enjoy the paint.
