This film is a pointless exercise in wasting celluloid. A researcher finds an imprint on a typewriter ribbon and decides to investigate his discovery. Apparently, there are these areas known as "K-zones" which can cause the dead to rise and attack the living. It's hard for anyone to prove since no real zombies actually show their rotting faces during anytime in this painfully slow yawner. There is a little aftermath violence where we are witness to the slaughter of a research group, but that's about it in the gore department. Nothing gets resolved and the ending(?) features the strangest choice of sound effect I have ever seen in a horror film. As a die hard zombiphile, I rate this film as the worst zombie movie of all time. Perhaps the worst horror film of all time. Better yet, probably the worst film of all time. Please check out films directed by George Romero, Lucio Fulci, Lamberto Bava, or Jorge Grau for movies that actually have zombies in them.
