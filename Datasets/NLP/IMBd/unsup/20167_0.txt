After the death of the oil tycoon Howard 'Red' Stevens (James Garner), his greedy family is gathered in the office of his lawyer, partner and friend Mr. Theophillis 'Ted' Hamilton (Bill Cobbs) and his associated Miss Hastings (Lee Meriwether) for reading the will. For his reckless and selfish grandson Jason Stevens (Drew Fuller), who hated him, Red assigns twelve apparently simple tasks called "gifts"  of work, money, friends, learning, problems, family, laughter, dreams, giving, gratitude, a day and love  challenging the playboy Jason to a journey of discoveries. When he meets the leukemic girl Emily (Abigail Breslin) and her mother Alexia (Ali Hillis), Jason changes his perspective of life and money, superseding the expectations of Red, improving and becoming a better man and receiving the ultimate gift from his wise grandfather.<br /><br />What a wonderful surprise "The Ultimate Gift" is! This simple little movie has a magnificent story of discoveries, friendship, family values, redemption and love, supported by awesome performances highlighting the girl Abigail Breslin, whose witty dialogs make the viewer laugh and cry. Do not pay attention in the bad reviews in IMDb, and you will see a pleasant movie with a beautiful message. My vote is eight.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "O Presente" ("The Gift")
