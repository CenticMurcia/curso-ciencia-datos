When I saw the film with my lover he said, "Who knew he could preach!" when Duval performed his final sermon. It is an awe-inspiring performance. <br /><br />I am a pastor's kid and my father was good, Duval shows greatness. <br /><br />In the film Duval's character is deeply flawed but also deeply faithful. <br /><br />What makes this film great is a clear view of evil to redemption to punishment to resolution. <br /><br />In 97 there were only two truly moral flms. Very different films. Boogie Nights for family values and loyalty, and The Apostle about redemption. <br /><br />What and incredible year with two profound films in the same year.
