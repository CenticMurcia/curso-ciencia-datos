This awful film, has no story, originality, or interesting characters. The only part I liked of this film, was the date that watched it with me, my future wife. That was better than the time I saw Planes Trains, and automobiles when someones date was talking to me and her guy was getting angry. Well, I better not get too off topic, but there is not much to mention about this film except it total sucks, and is forgetable. Forgetable is the best discription for this stinker. 4/10
