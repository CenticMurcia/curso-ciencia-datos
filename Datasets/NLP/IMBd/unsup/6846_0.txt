Eric Roberts and Michael Madsen, wow! This is probably a really exciting, well made thriller...but it isn't at all!! It is one of the very worst movies I've ever seen!<br /><br />The plot seems interesting for two seconds there but then suddenly Roberts starts pulling a gun and stuff and the movie just keeps getting worse and worse. Roberts being the most pathetic and stupid looking "hero" ever running around like a complete idiot and trying to clean things up while the stupid president is being kidnapped by a wannabe psycho. It doesn't work at all man!!!<br /><br />The action scenes are so bad edited and directed that I didn't want to agree with what I saw, Roberts getting a iron-stick stuffed into his stomach and banged all over his body too many times don't seem realistic, neither does a jump from a chopper from 30 meters above ground, neither does a safety wire hanging from Roberts' belt on his "super-exciting and super tough" escape from the roof, neither does a over-and-over attempt from Roberts to look where psycho wannabe is standing on the other side of the bathing pool, neither does the extremely dum coffee-idea from Roberts making the terrorist female die from electricity, neither does the car exploding twice cause of bad editing, neither does Madsen's dum performance as the dum negotiater...it doesn't work at all!!<br /><br />"I know I loved her?" "So why did you kill her?!" This must sincerelly be the worst movie made 4-eva!! In the ending it seems like the makers of the movie thinks they've been making a Oscar-nomination motion picture, with Roberts walking out in the dusty s*it calling himself "the replacement". If you want a really good laugh, this movie is a very good ALTERNATE (title)!! STARS: 1/5 (if zero was possible, this would have been a sure winner of that number)
