I just saw this at the first annual Fantastic Fest Film Festival in Austin, Texas and I liked it so much I felt compelled to write a review of it.<br /><br />This is simply one of the best horror movies I have ever seen. I don't know much about film distribution, but it amazes and saddens me that this isn't in wide release ranking somewhere in the top 10 current films. Horror movies usually don't scare me, but this one genuinely did. It was also really funny, and the way the movie plays with character stereotypes had me guessing as to which character was going to get it next. There were moments when I was seriously shocked by the blatant violation of standard horror conventions. It takes real talent to play with clich√©s so effectively. Don't make the mistake of thinking this is a straight to video deal either, this is a well crafted and filmed movie. If you like genre films like Evil Dead, Tremors, or just like horror in general, you HAVE to check this one out, if you get a chance. Unfortunately, you may have to wait for DVD.
