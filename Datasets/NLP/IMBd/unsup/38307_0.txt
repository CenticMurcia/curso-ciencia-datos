Regardless if you like it or hate it I'm pretty sure this movie will leave an impression.<br /><br />This is the kind of movie that leave you befuddled, not knowing whether you should laugh or cry.<br /><br />Horror sequences are predictable yet utterly stupid. There are major gaps in the plot, one of them being: Going to Mexico to rob a bank. It's basic movie trivia that you commit a crime and then you go to Mexico to escape the long arm of the law.<br /><br />The dialog makes clumsy attempts at being clever, Tarantino-ish if you will. Unfortunately it all just falls flat.<br /><br />Action sequences are horrendous. Vampires and cops alike line up in order to die in a gruesome manner.<br /><br />I think this movie is a bit of a hit and miss. I got the sense that they tried to create something failed. If you watch it, try to think of it as a movie that doesn't try to be anything.<br /><br />In the end however this movie is probably best remained unseen.
