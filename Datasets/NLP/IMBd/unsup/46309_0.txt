Don't get me wrong, I found this WILDLY entertaining - as a comedy. Me and everyone that watched it with me laughed hysterically at this thing. The rhymes and lyrics are 3rd grade level and simplistic.<br /><br />At first, I thought R. Kelly deliberately made this as a joke, but it seems apparent that he's taking himself pretty seriously. It's great for a good laugh.<br /><br />That other comment above this one, I contend is written by someone involved in the sales of the video or a lobotomy patient. No sane human could possibly consider this a serious work with any redeeming value. Darn funny stuff though!!
