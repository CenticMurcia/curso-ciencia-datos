can't give it a zero, bad acting, no plot and too much subversive homosexuality,CANCEL THIS CRAP..........other shows on as are funny but I think that this is one of those where you have this friend on the inside and he gets your show on.There promos are not funny and the show is dumb and choppy. Too much junk like 12oz mouse with no plot, adult swim is good for some laughs but only when the show actually spends some money on production and writing. Tim and eric? who cares about you and jefferton, cross dressing isn't funny anymore, HINT HINT SNL. there's a message in this show, I hope there is no third season, Bill Cosby did better with a roller.
