Marlene Dietrich plays in a plot device which is not so unusual - an actress pretending to be more than one person in a film (Garbo did it in "Two Faced Woman", Katherine Hepburn in "Quality Street", etc.). But the inimitable Dietrich lends her own very special charms to the idea.<br /><br />Many amusing scenes - one of my favorites is where Marlene throws her gorgeous wedding dress into a river! Zounds!
