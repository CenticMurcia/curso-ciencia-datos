This movie is basically a copy of The Mexican. Total waste of time don't bother watching it<br /><br />Again this movie is just another rip off of some Hollywood movie so there is no point on explaining it. If you want to watch it go ahead it is about a guy who is a sniper for the mob who wants to quit but has to do one last job. To make sure he finishes it the mob kidnap his fianc√© so he decides to do it. (The reason he wants to stop is because he accidentally slaughtered a family)<br /><br />And the rest is self explanatory. Just another lame copy of a Hollywood movie but who am i to stop u<br /><br />I give this movie a 4/10 at least they tried to copy The Mexican
