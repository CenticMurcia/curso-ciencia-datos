This is a feeble and desperate attempt to tap into what is left of the underground comic book audience. Film makers have made other attempts like this and they always seem to go wrong. "Fritz the Cat", "Heavy Metal" ... they just don't seem to work. But this is hardly even an honest attempt. It is a dodge that claims to succeed if they just get your attention. They got mine, don't let them get yours.
