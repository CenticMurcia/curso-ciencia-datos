Small Swedish village is pretty much free of all crime. Police force doesn't have much else to do than to loiter around, hoping for something to happen. But one day they hear, that their work place is under cancellation threat, so they must boost up their arrest and crime rate to keep their beloved police station.<br /><br />They figure out, that if they don't have crime they might as well start doing crime themselves.<br /><br />Hardly never movies with this kind of settings are good but Kopps does fine exception from that rule. A funny film with good acting and great jokes. Especially the crimes and descriptions of "Russian mafia" shoot outs and such are hilarious and well done.<br /><br />My thumbs up.
