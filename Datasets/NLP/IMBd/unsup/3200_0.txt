I'm all for people trying out different things and a live scifi programme is certainly different! I'll be honest and say that I bought this because David Tennant was in it. And he was very good in the supporting role he had. Mark Gatiss was another highlight which surprised me. I'd only ever seen him in League of Gentlemen sketches. I look forward to seeing him take on other dramatic roles. Unfortunately, I found Jason Flemyng's central performance to be flat and unengaging. I fast forwarded through most of his scenes.<br /><br />For something that was filmed live, it lacked the excitement and adrenalin of a live performance. Perhaps the Experiment could have been improved on DVD with some judicious editing.
