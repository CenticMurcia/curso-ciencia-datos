my least favorite of all the Meyer films, and although I do like Napier, Supervixens and also Cherry, Harry, And Raquel are the 2 Meyer films I've seen that I really don't like much. And granted, a bad Meyer film still has a lot going for it. First off, the great cinematography and the boobs,.....however, too often there's a little too much of a cartoon-like vibe that doesn't mix well with the nasty violence. The bath-tub kill scene was a bit out of touch with the rest of the film. Some of the dialog/acting is just awful, too and the main male lead didn't work for me. I'd a rather Napier played him since Napier's role was mainly at the beginning and then the end as the crazed cop. The reason why Faster Pussycat remains Meyer's best-known film is because the females are the main characters. In Supervixens, they're almost an afterthought. <br /><br />A lot of the music is goofy, too, a common thing in Meyer films that often give it a cheap dated feel in 2007. But to contradict myself, in a lot of his films, the music is dated in a way that totally works.<br /><br />Rent Faster Pussycat, Vixen, Up!, Mudhoney, or BVD instead!!!!!
