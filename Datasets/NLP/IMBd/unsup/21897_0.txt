This film is a genuinely moving experience John hurt gives a performance more worthy of an academy award for best actor then any I can remember. I saw this film late one night. I left the TV on expecting to fall asleep. This movie caused me a sleepless night. John Merricks endearing qualities mixed with the fact it is shot entirely in black and white, a taboo for modern day cinema other then low budget films caused me to have real tears in my eyes. Even this film to me signified the way films should be. I forgot it was a film. A must see film which will teach more about tolerance and understanding to people then any documentary or educational lesson. A truly masterful effort by David lynch.
