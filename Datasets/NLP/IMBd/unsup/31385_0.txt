This movie was very hard to follow. The Irish brougues (sp?) did not help; maybe it was the fact that I know nothing of the Northern Irish Conflict, other than it's between the Catholics and Protestants. Being of Eastern European descent, I have no knowledge of it. Last few months, I thought I'd widen my horizons and see an occasional independent/fine arts/foreign film, but every movie I've seen I did not care for. Will try again with The Yards and eventually Mansfield Park, when it comes to video, but if I don't care for those I'll stick with the Hollywood-released films.
