The name of Neve Campbell made me buy this DVD without any further reference, because I try to see her movies since "Scream". Unfortunately, "When Will I Be Loved" is awful, one of the worse (or maybe the worst) movies of 2004. The story has no development of the characters, taking time to the viewer understand their motives. Mike Tyson, Lori Singer, Professor Hassan Al-Ibrahim Ben Rabinowitz, what are these people doing in the plot? I have not understood the erratic behavior of the amoral lead bisexual character of Vera Barrie in the middle of such mess: she is ambitious, but has a loser as boy-friend; she has a wealthy family that supplies her inclusive with an expensive loft, but prostitutes herself for money. Most of the scenes are too long or even unnecessary. The screenplay seems to be written by a moron or a stupid teenager so imbecile the dialogs and situations are. I love classic music, but the music score is really annoying. How can a producer put money in this crap? Is Neve Campbell losing money in casino or gambling to accept participating and exposing herself in such garbage? My vote is two.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): Fortunately this movie has not been released in Brazil. I saw an American DVD.
