I have to agree with all the rest of the Reviews. Matador has to be one of the best TV shows ever made. All the actors are the cream of the Danish acting world. The Director was the best in the business for bringing Danish Life to Life, so to speak. I am amazed it has not been shown on British TV as it is very comparable to that other magnificent British TV drama "When The Boat Comes in" I would be hard pushed to say which one was better. But Matador has a longer run and does manage to cover the German occupation of Denmark. Which will be an eye opener to the British public if shown on British TV. So I do hope somebody gets the courage to show this on UK TV. As it is just a great TV Drama about families and the stress of the new on old ideas and values. So it still has something for today's TV audience. I have never got tired of watching it. Its called Matador because that is the Danish name for the board game Monopoly.
