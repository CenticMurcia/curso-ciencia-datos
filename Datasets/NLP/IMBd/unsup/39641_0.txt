'Arms spread wide, I laugh at you thusly...hah, hah, hah!' This film was decently shot, likely on Super 16mm or 35mm. That is its one strong point. Things really go down hill from there. <br /><br />****SPOILER****<br /><br />Two friends are held hostage by a drooling, crazy dude who wants to kill them. They are saved by the sudden arrival of a cousin, who crashes a truck into the maniac. This event somehow ties into the friends being caught up in the middle of a demon recruiting action. And let's not forget the demon girl, who just wants to wait tables and be left alone. <br /><br />Wanted to be PULP FICTION meets BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER...but it was not. A bad script and awful dialogue could not be saved by fair acting. This movie was horrible in a way that only pseudo-art house German crap can be. Really.
