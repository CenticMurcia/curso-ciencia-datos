This is not a masterpiece but for people who are different, abnormal or rejects from society because of what they look like or how react, this movie can change a life for the better! It did for me. Since I watched this movie, I decided that I will try to reach for my dreams...That I will go even if people (who are mean) try to stop me or discourage me... Until I found "My Moment" like he says in the movie. This movie inspired me and today and I try to do the same around me.<br /><br />Another part of the movie made me realize that we (the not normal people), are braver than those who have it all because we have to face adversity ("Superman is not brave because he is invincible... you're not...")<br /><br />The music is excellent (most of it by Green Day), especially after his grand-father's death in the park. The emotions are so real and I tell people to watch the movie if they want to understand what I've been thru... and I'm sure that It will do the same to many more.<br /><br />Whenever I need a cheer, I watch the movie again!
