Thursday March 16, 700pm Metro Cinemas<br /><br />Joyeux Noël opens with a moving prologue of school children from France, Germany, Scotland and America reciting the memorized dogma of war. The story builds effectively as the War To End All Wars begins with tearful farewells and marching troops. Unlike most films dealing with the same material, here is a very balanced approach allowing for sympathetic portrayals of all sides. Cinematography, editing, art direction, costumes and visual narrative are all excellent but the film fails to deliver effectively at the pivotal moment and instead fizzles out into inappropriate attempts at ill-conceived humor. Tiny votive candles on holiday trees perfectly and inexplicably light the night of the country battlefield as opposing sides agree to a cease-fire on Christmas Eve 1914. Joyeux Noël concludes with an overstated condemnation of nationalism and organized religion. Set in the horror that eventually cost millions of lives, this story seems far too lighthearted and superficial.
