this movie just wasn't realistic at all. in fact, in the modern part toward the end, it was a little surreal. i really think it's borderline racist, even if it's only to be shocking. here are the main two points i disagree with this film on: - the confederate states of America were called a confederacy because their chief concern was with states' rights over the federal government. they were literally a group of states banded together for a common cause. while after winning the civil war they might have implemented censorship for the sake of keeping slaves quiet, they wouldn't have used such a statist policy for its own sake. it's the same deal with the outlawing of non-Christian religions. i realize that the focus on states' rights could have degraded over time, but directly after the war the south would have DEFINITELY recognized the northern states' rights to be free states.<br /><br />- the civil war was about libertarianism, not slavery. i'm not a holocaust denier. southern politicians just realized that their economies absolutely depended on slavery, and that there was no easy way out of it. while they were racist and perhaps apathetic when it was convenient, they were by no means the fascists that kevin willmott portrays them as, and many slaves were freed before the war was over.<br /><br />anyway, i just didn't want to let this go over like it was okay. i don't believe the old southerners were ever so willfully hateful.
