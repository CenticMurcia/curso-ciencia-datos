First of all, I would like to ask those of you who voted for this picture, why you voted so poorly. This is not a bad movie.<br /><br />I saw this movie recently and found myself liking into the first 30 minutes. Energetic music and exhausting aerobic dance scenes were quite enjoyable.<br /><br />Although it is a typically daggy 80's film, it stills captures your interest from beginning to end. While most of the actors are basically average (not-famous otherwise), there were standout performances by both Lee Curtis and Travolta.<br /><br />To add to the credibility of this film, the storyline is very engaging and does not lose its flow. Energetic, fun, absorbing. It has been under-estimated by many viewers, but at least there is one person out here that enjoyed it.<br /><br />**** out of *****
