The famous novel, which this film is based on, was a big best-seller when it was released. Hollywood, of course, was immediately there and realized, that this was something that you could make a movie out of. Despite good performances by the leading men, the film is much too long, and lacks the dramatic continuity of the book. The music, though, by Jerry Goldsmith and the cinematography by Fred J.Koenekamp are both excellent. A little more French influence on the making of this movie would probably have increased its authenticity.
