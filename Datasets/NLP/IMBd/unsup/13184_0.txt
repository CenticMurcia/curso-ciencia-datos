Truth be told I have always been a fan of Dakota Fanning's films (Asides The Cat In The Hat, bad film) so I was flicking through the T.V channels and saw this and at first I wasn't really bothered about watching it but as I was bogged down by an awful flu I thought "Why not" I really liked it! I didn't know who Kurt Russell was (I'm sorry I thought he was the wrestler Kurt Angle!) obviously Elisabeth Shue is a very good actress, Kris Kristofferson is a legend as always (Loved him in Hulk) and Oded Fehr was good although in it quite briefly (Much better acting than in the awful Resident Evil series) and Dakota Fanning was yet again outstanding.<br /><br />When it was introduced it said "Next up is Dreamer a tearjerker/melodrama" and thought "Oh no, I'm gonna cry!" It's not a sad film in a upsetting way it's a nice film. To be honest I don't see the interest in horse racing, horses to me should be free to run wild and racing them is quite harsh to me. I didn't cry (thank God I kept my masculinity) but I finished the film in a really good mood. I suppose if a film can do that then happy days.<br /><br />The only criticism is that Elisabeth Shue had a small role.<br /><br />Dreamer is about a stable owner Ben Crane (Russell) who has no horses. He has a wife Lilly (Shue) a daughter Cale (Fanning) and a dad who is referred to as Pop (Kristofferson). They have two Mexican workers (I forget their names). A prince (Oded Fehr) of some far away country (I think Dubai) races a horse (the main horse, Sonador or Dreamer) who gets injured badly. Ben buys and heals the horse and Cale later adopts the horse and races it (I'm saying no more!) It's a good family film which I oddly enjoyed (even though it's certainly not my style of film). I'd recommend it to anyone who likes animals (horses) or people who like stories about people who never give up (of which it's a great example) 8/10
