yeah its fun and the best Hitchcock i think.i hate that undertake is making it this is the one and only best no 1 i mean no one can change that good suspense and fun 1 for black and white While this wasn't Hitchcock's first feature film, he refers to it as the one that set the pace for his later films, the first to show his vision, style, and bravura. The most interesting thing about this film, other than its technical virtuosity and the horribly ineffective soundtrack, is the fact that it wasn't supposed to end the way it did. Hitchcock wanted The Lodger to be the killer, which would have made a more predictable film (granted in 1926 audiences weren't spoiled by the great of the genre and everything could have been "surprising" if the right amount of suspense and tension were provided). Instead, there were pressures to let matin√©e idol Ivor Novello out of the killer role, probably because people didn't want to picture Novello as a killer. Ironically, the fact Novello wouldn't end up as the killer made this film even better, a lot more interesting and compelling.
