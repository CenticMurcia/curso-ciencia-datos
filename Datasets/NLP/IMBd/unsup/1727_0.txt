This is a movie that does not seem to go anywhere and the ending doesn't make any sense but there are other parts of the movie that don't make sense either. The movie begins with a man running and then collapsing. We don't know who the man is, why he collapsed, or what happened to him because the movie then cuts away to the birth of a child. In a roundabout and murky way, viewers learn that he died and the following birth since perhaps is to symbolize his reincarnation.<br /><br />The infant then grows up and comes into the life of the widow of the man played by Nicole Kidman as a ten year old boy who claims that he is her former husband. He demonstrates this to her by an intimate knowledge of their married life together and the question is if he is not the reincarnation of him, then how did he gain such knowledge. Early in the movie there is a scene in which the boy sees another woman bury a box, and then go to a party given by Kidman and the boy follows the woman to the party. The clue raises the suspicion that the boy located the box and its contents revealed information relating to the previous marriage but on the other hand, if that was what happened it doesn't make sense, because if the boy was busy digging up the box, the woman would have been long gone by the time he finished, and he couldn't have followed her.<br /><br />Further, even if there was information in the box about the prior marriage, it would never have reached the detail that the boy later disclosed to the widow, and since the boy confronted the widow very shortly after the box was buried, he would not have had time to have read and memorized all the information contained therein.<br /><br />All the viewers know about the boy is what they see after he begins following the woman so viewers know nothing of his character or his prior life. He is virtually faceless.<br /><br />Viewers may have difficulty recognizing Kidman at first because she has a hair style completely different than that which makes her such a vivacious actress. But Ann Hecht also wears a red wig instead of her usual blond hair and I didn't know who she was until I read the credits at the end of the movie.
