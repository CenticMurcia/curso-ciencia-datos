Foricienta is a greaaaat story, not only for kids.. i'm 20 years old and i loooove it.. the story of flor is lovely she is a person full of love and compassion who, without even really wanting to, changes the life of Fede, and fills it with joy and fun and makes him alive again.. makes him love her.. at times hate her lol.. but fall absolutely in love with her... i used to think this was just some kids stuff.. and then a friend of mine forced me to watch it and i became an addict... i love the songs, the characters, the charming prince.. maybe you wont like it as much cause of all the things she say may not be so understandable in other languages, but it's a very enjoyable show what so ever.. flor is the best... the one bad thing is the end of the first season =( (i won't say what it was) but it's 100% worth watching..
