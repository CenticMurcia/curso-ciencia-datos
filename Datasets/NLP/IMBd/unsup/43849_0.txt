Spare yourself from this travesty. I don't think I've ever seen a movie this bad in my life, honestly. I don't know what else I can tell you, but please, just avoid it. All I can muster is rhetoric, it's REALLY JUST THAT BAD.<br /><br />Acting is awful (especially Brian Geraghty, who is always stone like for no apparent reason), in fact, even Slater (which was a bit of a surprise) seems to struggle to play the role convincingly (it's just too over the top retarded I suppose). Dialogue is bland, cheesy, and just all around makes me cringe with every line. I still can't believe I watched the whole thing. It's one of those movies that you want to turn off from the beginning.<br /><br />Predictable plot, sloppy and uninspired cinematography, etc. It's just all around poor. The way the characters flip-flop back and forth (about what to do with the money) when their lives are at stake is laughable.<br /><br />I will never write another review unless I see a movie poorer than this one. I would usually never write a review in the first place, but if I can spare someone 1.5 hours of their life then writing this will have been worth it. In fact, I am so disgusted by Brian Geraghty's performance that I will never watch another movie that he is ever again. They should have just cast a sock puppet in his place instead.<br /><br />AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!
