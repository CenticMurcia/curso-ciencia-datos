This movie is retro in everything. It is a lighthearted romantic comedy in the old mold, with two mismatched con-men, falling for the same girl, the dopey one eventually gets her, and his buddy gets the sister! While the plot is occassionally disjointed it never fails to keep moving along and is throughly charming along the way - helped greatly by the winning main characters. I was very surprised to see the mixed reviews, it is hard to work out what there is not to like in this thoroughly likable movie - occassionally clever, sometimes sappy, possibly a little predictable - but never unlikeable. As for the title, if you can't work it out, you don't have enough intelligence to be allowed out of the house by yourself. My vote 7/10 and a fun movie for some light-hearted entertainment. Definitely worth a watch.
