I must say I was surprised when I saw this movie. I never would have thought it'd end the way it did but its a lifetime movie so it had to. It seems that all lifetime movies end on a good note for the women but that just seems to be a bit unfair I mean half the time the guy did nothing at all. I am glad that it worked out in the end but i had missed the middle of the movie so I can't give it a perfect score but it was good all the same. The movie was a good way to view how justice can be served when its needed. I never thought the twist would be the way it was. The movie was a good movie and had a good plot. I wish I had seen the middle of the movie. I mean I never expected the one scene when the one girl went up to the office to have happened. I'm sorry to say I have to give it an 8 out of 10.
