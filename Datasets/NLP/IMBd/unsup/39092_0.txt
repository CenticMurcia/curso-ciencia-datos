This was the biggest steaming pile of offal I have seen in a very long time--and I've seen my fair share of bad movies. There was zero chemistry between the two leads and, although I am a big fan of Russell Crowe's, I could not for the life of me figure out what Colin and Midori, the main characters, saw in each other. I suppose the filmmakers believed that a series of contrived "dangerous situations" would be enough to establish an attraction between the protagonists (and I use this term loosely). Well it isn't. I believed in their romance about as much as I believed Midori's faked orgasm. The movie meanders and has no aim because the filmmakers have no idea what sort of story they want to tell. It's as if they rewrote the script before each shooting day, and a Magic 8 Ball was consulted to govern the tone of each scene. There are moments in this film that are perfectly set up for satire yet the scenes are played straight, effectively "dumbing down" the movie. It's a shame, really, since they had such a fine cast and crew to work with (with the exception of the overzealous boom operator who seems to have a predilection for seeing his/her handiwork on celluloid). There are some interesting scenic work, but you can see the same sort of scenery in a better movie of the same genre, Kiss or Kill.
