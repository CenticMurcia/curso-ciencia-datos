I've had a bad night.Firstly Brick and then Miami Vice.My daughter told me Vice was rubbish i usually follow her advice but i was a fan of the TV shows and Michael Mann is one of my favourite directors so i watched it.She was right this time,but not always,she did recommend Brick but thats another post. Question: who was the mole in the FBI?,where was the rest of the story,where's sonny's alligator Superfluous love scenes,villains that can't shoot eg:all those dead bad guys and one wounded cop when they do the exchange at the finale.Plus points:it looked glossy and Jamie Foxx nailed Tubbs . Why do the bad guys always fall for the pizza delivery trick?,do they not watch TV or movies
