Walter Matthau and John Stamos are good together. John really holds the movie, quite successfully I should add and excuse me for being surprised. Though some of his and others' lines are older than Matthau. The plot also isn't most original but manages to avoid the obvious pot holes. Small, nice, comfortable tv movie. Based on a play and directed by Matthau's son. Burnett is fine as Matthau's younger love interest. Teri Polo is bearable in a terrible blond. So- John and Matthau beat Teri and some used up lame lines.
