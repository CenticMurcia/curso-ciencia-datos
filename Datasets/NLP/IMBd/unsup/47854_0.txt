Here's the immediate problem I have with this movie: Ah-nold trying to be a spy. Sure, he can handle the tough-stuff, but I highly doubt he could sneak around that well. As for the rest, rehashing of James Bond stuff with a annoying Tom Arnold on back-up and a totally taste-less strip scene that makes the movie even longer. Bond movies get to the point in normally two hours. That's all that should be required.
