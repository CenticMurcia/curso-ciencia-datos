Classic gangster film showing how a young man (James Cagney) becomes a gangster and killer. This film made Cagney and deservedly so. It moves quickly (it's 82 minutes long), is never dull, has good acting and contains many classic sequences: Cagney smacking Mae Clarke in the face with a grapefruit; a massacre that you hear but don't see; Cagney stumbling through a rainstorm. The film also opens and ends with a silly statement condemning gangsters--it was probably put in to pacify censors--this film was considered extremely violent for 1931. Also the ending is horrifying, even by today's standards. A must see. Also a nice showcase for a very young Jean Harlow.
