A bunch of criminals kill a couple of cops. The police goes after them. The police have a progressive female boss who wants to put it all in media.<br /><br />This is supposed to say something about modern times and especially media times. If you thought "Natural Born Killers" was pathetic, don't watch "Breaking News". This criticism is not for real, it's obviously only a way of trying to be on Western level also than it comes to society satire. This script doesn't even reach comic book level. The directing and acting are even worse. There even isn't a descent amount of blood.<br /><br />Keep away!
