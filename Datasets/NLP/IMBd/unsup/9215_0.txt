This film is nonstop action, foul language, sex and drug use. And the action was not the kind of mindless blow stuff up that I like. And the sex was too kinky. Whips. Leather. And every other word was f this and f that. The lead character Puck seemed nice enough. But all the other kids in the movie were degenrates...every last one of them. It was disgusting. Call me old fahsioned. But what does any of it have to do with cooking?
