Found myself riveted to this HBO movie. Very often I do not watch movies and/or shows which are hyped and HBO hyped this movie big. But recently I caught it on HBO Signature channel and was just taken with the succinct and poignant nature of the three segments.<br /><br />Segment 1-(1961)- terrific and really enjoyed a great performance from Vanessa Redgrave. Elizabeth Perkins, as the insensitive wife of Abbey's nephew, is really a fine actress and does very well herself.<br /><br />Segment 2-(1972)- both Michelle Williams and Chloe Sevigny are excellent here. I guess because I started college in '72 I was somehow drawn to the periodic dress and reminiscent of the in-your-face, anti-establishment, make your point through vocal protest period.<br /><br />Segment 3-(2000)- Sharon Stone and Ellen DeGeneres play a lesbian couple wanting to have a baby. It struck me that, with the decline of the family entity today, the most important element for a child is a loving and nurturing family and who cares whether it's traditional(man/woman) or not.<br /><br />Once I sat back and watched I was taken in by the dialogue, the transition from scene to scene, and the way the movie got me to think about the bigger picture.
