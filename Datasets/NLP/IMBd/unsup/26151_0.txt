This movie is definitely one of the best Indian breakthrough films of 2005. The protagonist of the film, John Abraham, is actually a negative character. Playing the role of a hit-man, he has a long history of sins. He finally realizes the enormity of his wrongdoings after accidentally killing a small girl during a mission. Although his spiritual awakening does help him to some extent, his numerous murders do not let him live in peace. In a constant struggle to start life afresh, it is extremely interesting to see how his past deeds catch up to him. John gives a good performance. Priyanka is also great in her small role. The climactic monologue and visuals are beautiful. Cinematography is excellent. "Tinka Tinka" is a very beautiful song. "Tera Hi Karam" is a great track with an awesome, shocking, and eye-opening video displaying the theme of the movie. The theme is portrayed magnificently as the movie does a good job in showing how all the characters' karma dictates the degree of suffering they must endure in their life and/or death.
