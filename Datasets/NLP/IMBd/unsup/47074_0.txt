I think one of the most disappointing things in this film is the role of John McLaren.It's the same actor(Paul Hubschmid, who is sometimes billed as Paul Christian) from "The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms". For one thing, it's not even his voice in the dubbing! He seems emotionless 95% of the time. Other character development is only so-so.I did get a kick out of all the old machinery. The plot was OK but not original. The movie seemed to just plod along without much in the way of action. The cinematography was very good(from Italy's Mario Bava).I expected much more from this movie but the fact that I only paid $5.00 for it makes it a little better for me to tolerate. I wish this movie was as good as I anticipated.
