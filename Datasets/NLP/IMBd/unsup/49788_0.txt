OK, so i'm not the biggest horror fan in the world. I'll admit. usually i find the paper thin plots and laughable acting too much to bare. The only horror movies i can think of recently that have impressed me were 'The Devils Rejects' and '1408' - and this movie just completely reinstates my thoughts on why i generally avoid horrors. Lets see. First up they choose mans BEST friend as the 'monsters' - NO. Then they decide to stick with the ever familiar "5 teens lost 'somewhere' plot - NO. They used REAL, ORDINARY dogs - NO. Come on Wes, i mean Jesus...at least try and mean 'em up a little bit. Coming off the back as such repellent crap as 'Cursed' (A werewolf that flips people off? Kill me now) it's no wonder this was a tad on the dire side. What made it even more pathetic was some of the actions performed by the placid characters. Why on earth other people reviewing this film are saying they acted 'Real' in those situations is beyond me. Heres where we get into spoilerville...<br /><br />1) John is an excellent marksman, yet he manages to miss one dog randomly and hit a girls leg even though every other shot in the movie he makes is dead on. Not to mention the fact he has a sack load of arrows and a whole bunch of times he could have simply started picking the dogs off one by one. But no, that'd be too easy.<br /><br />2) The car in the garage that has been sat rusting for years works first time they try and then....surprise surprise. Not when they need it.<br /><br />3) The dogs can climb on board a planes wing, but not over a little fence.<br /><br />4) At one point, this guy (yeah...i didn't care enough to remember his name) has 20 baying dogs on him as he rushes to the car, yet, finds time to take his jacket off (an attack PROTECTION jacket) before he gets in the car? Why, oh why? <br /><br />5) You're on an island, full of killer dogs, driving a car you know they can easily jump on and in. Yet you leave the F'ing windows down? come on now.<br /><br />6) They drop the bow (retardedly) and pass by the same direction they dropped it on the way back to the house (NOT being pursued at this point). Do they think to check and grab it? Nah....too easy.<br /><br />7) The black guy dies first. *Sighs*<br /><br />8) They know the dogs can break into there house, as they had done before. Yet they still decide to stay downstairs and have a PARTY? *Sighs again* <br /><br />9) The ending.....oh lordy lord, the ending...they had serious options for a semi-entertaining ending. The guys could have gone nuts and turned on each other like fighting dogs then Michelles character. They could have both just turned on Michelle, they could have let them been saved and then showed the virus spreading to another place. No, they went the James Bond route. I was half expecting Odd Job to jump out and start swinging bowler hats at people.<br /><br />10) Just...ahhhhhh! How annoying are you people! <br /><br />So yeah.....If you like your horrors full of cute pets that are a little bit mean to people, actors that need a slap in the face for even attempting any realism, the stupidest scenarios you can imagine and one liners that would make Arnie the govenator cringe, this is your movie.<br /><br />There's worse movies out there (Strangers with candy anyone?) but as far as movies go this is pure drivel. I work at Blockbusters and got this rental for free. Do NOT part with any cash for this film. In fact, steal it, and burn it. Michelle....sort it out love. And Wes...If you don't make another Nightmare On Elm Street soon your reputation in the horror business is as good as (the living) dead.<br /><br />Avoid.
