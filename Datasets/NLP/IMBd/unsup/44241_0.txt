If it were not for the appearance of Sharon Stone's ample mammae, this movie wouldn't even be worth the cost of the match to burn it with. I would endeavor to guess that the main actors in this movie donated their time and talents gratis, because I cannot imagine anyone paying for the services of professional actors just to let their talents languish in the doldrums of obscurity, drivel and overall bad acting. There are so many gosh awful movies these days I believe that the moguls of Hollywood have merely capitulated and sold their souls to the gods of the "box office take". This movie could have been just as successful with simply, Sharon Stone, and the rest of the roles could have been filled with "B" actors. What a waste of "A" talent.
