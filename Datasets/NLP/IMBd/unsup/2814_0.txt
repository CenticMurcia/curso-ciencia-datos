Snoopy studies Magic and gets Charlie Brown to volunteer for his "disappearing man" act. The only problem is that it works too well. Charlie Brown really becomes invisible.<br /><br />Although I feel "A Charlie Brown Christmas" is the best Peanuts special, this one isn't too far off.<br /><br />Why? One word: football.<br /><br />This is the one special where Charlie Brown successfully kicks the football...and taunts/teases Lucy as he does it.<br /><br />Yeah, it's always interesting to see how ol' Chuck handles it when life throws him a curveball, but it's good to finally see things go his way for once.<br /><br />Some people may not be comfortable with the magical element.<br /><br />Even if people don't find it occultic, they may find it out of place in the series. I admit, the idea of including magic is a little strange, but there have been plenty of "out there" elements in Peanuts over the years. Need I remind anybody of the dreaded "kite-eating tree" that literally chewed the kites that flew into it and assaulted anyone who climbed it? While it's not the absolute best of the Peanuts films and specials, it just may well be the most satisfying.<br /><br />Here's to a DVD release in the near future.
