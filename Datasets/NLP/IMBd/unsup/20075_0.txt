High school students could make a better film than this. I just wanted to comment on the way the ICE queen died in the hot tub. First, if her flesh disintegrated, why not her skin and eyes? And the whole sequence was filmed like a Geico commercial, you know, where the guy is wrestling with the fake deer and it's MEANT to look fake? I thought we were beyond making movies this bad. And the release date here couldn't have been correct. They don't make cameras this bad anymore. Even a $200 digital camera would have looked better. I've seen better images on Americas Funniest Home video. Couldn't they even correct the color and contrast while they digitized it?<br /><br />Did we watch the whole movie? Heck no. We just skipped to the parts with the Ice Queen. If those weren't the worst parts of the movie, God help these untalented people.
