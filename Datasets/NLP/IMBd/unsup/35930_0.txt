Probably the worst movie I have ever seen next to SANTA CLAUS CONQUERS THE MARTIANS. Innovative but horribly done movie about an astronaut forced by thugs to seize an asteroid that is literally one huge diamond rock. What's bad about this movie is not the neat ideas of how the moon was built (a saloon on the moon?? Sweet.) it was how everything was done, especially the acting and special effects. No character had any substance at all and the acting was too routine to give any involvement. I won't say anything more about what's in this movie, but during a time when Neil Armstrong put his foot on the moon, the success of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY was still strong, and there was a cold war (see the opening cartoon for what I mean), MOON ZERO TWO was slapped together to cash in on all of it. Save your two hours of life for something worthwhile.
