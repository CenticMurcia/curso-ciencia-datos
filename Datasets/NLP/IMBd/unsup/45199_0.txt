As an actor Sidney does pull off some funny moments here and there, the problem is that he's not much of a director as he showed over and over again as he buried his career by turning into lazy director from fantastic actor. Cosby and he have some chemistry and there is an okay set up for a movie then just no movie.<br /><br />Flip Wilson shows up to do an unfunny version of his preacher man, not once but twice in the film. Richard Pryor is funny in a small part.<br /><br />Scenes just go on forever and as good as Sidney is at some of his own comedy Belefonte needs to be put in a Troama movie with comedy acting like this, and after the half way point it practically becomes Belefonte's movie as his overacted and underfunny mugging pushes Cosby and Poitier out of the way and the movie goes into the toilet. Bad rear projection would be antic chase scene lower the bar again as it wraps up with some sorta Butch and Sundance high fall non gag with dummies.<br /><br />Really lousy by the time it's over. 70's fashion and garishness top off the unpleasant time.
