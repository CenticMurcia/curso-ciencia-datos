Chico the rainmaker was a great show. I was six years old when it aired & my Dad would watch it with me on Sunday mornings.The show was a great way to learn to help others and to be a good friend and be their for each other no matter what got in the way. Everyone I ask says they never heard of it. I guess that makes us the chosen ones. I live in a small town in Eastern Canada where we don't have a lot of choices where to shop. I hope to find it someday to buy. It would be great to show my kids. If they're not too busy rolling around laughing at it! Thanks for bringing back a really cool memory of me and my Dad spending some "us" time together in the big lazy boy chair. Maybe PBS will dig it out and show it again for old times sake.
