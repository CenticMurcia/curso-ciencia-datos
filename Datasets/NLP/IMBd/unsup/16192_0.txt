Enduring Love was directed by Robert Michell, Joe Penhall wrote the screenplay,adapting Ian McEwan's novel.<br /><br />Daniel Craig,Rhys Ifans & Samantha Morton star in this rather strange drama. It starts off with a tragic accident, & one death. This part is very interesting, exciting & well done. This is the first 10 minutes of the film, then the remaining 90 minutes is all talking,(low key), It does get more dramatic towards the end. The script at times seems confusing, even though its mostly 2 or 3 people talking.<br /><br />The talk is interesting (its about love & life). The acting is the main reason to see this film. Daniel Craig made this 2 years before he became James Bond. Here he is not as pumped up as he was in Casino Royale. He is an excellent actor & definitely handles this role very well, so does Samantha Morton & as his girl friend. Miss Morton is very talented.<br /><br />The third character is Rhys Ifans, one of the newer actors & He will be a top draw performer very soon, (Think of a younger Christopher Walkin). Bill Nighy gives another delightful performance as he usually does.<br /><br />This is a hard film to review for me: as much as I liked the acting, sets, locations etc. I found the story on the dull side.. my 3 star rating (below) is at the bottom of the 3 star range.<br /><br />Its easy to see why this did not play in many theatres.(maximum of 50 in USA late 2004) Its R rating is mainly for the F word used throughout, BUT this is not a film for teens & younger.<br /><br />Ratings: *** (out of4) 80 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
