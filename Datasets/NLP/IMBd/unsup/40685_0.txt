Without giving any spoilers...if you can watch an anime about a retard with big breasts fighting in a tournament oriented series about feuding school districts, then this is the box set to buy! If Hanes or Fruit of the Loom needs a new spokesperson, then any female in this series will do...overdone panty shots every 30 seconds is a bit much. The animation is average, sound is average and the dub is pathetic. The series is barely watchable if you have absolutely nothing else to do, but the story is tired and has no direction. Even the intro and outro music is butt-awful....even for anime standards. <br /><br />Honestly, my favorite part of the series was when the middle break for advertising shows the returning segment....if you time it just right, you can make a fart sound just as her skirt lifts to show the logo on her butt cheek.<br /><br />Bottom line is, if you enjoyed this...you really need a girlfriend.
