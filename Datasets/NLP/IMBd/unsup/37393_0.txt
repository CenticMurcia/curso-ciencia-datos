My wife and I were trying really hard hard hard to see this piece of art to the very end, hoping that its endless boredom will end up, as it says "thriller" on its genre. No plot we did find, no interesting part, no good feeling of watching a movie but anger how wonderful stuff HBO showed up on Saturday prime time in the Czech Republic. Who pays for this "art"? The authors only stole some ideas from Da Vinci Code without making their final product interesting. Just non stop rehashing "Jesus this and Jesus that, and Mary Magdalene this and Mary Magdalene that", just good for priest seminary.<br /><br />I understand that not every day is a holiday, isn't it? But why on Saturday evening prime time, HBO, why!?
