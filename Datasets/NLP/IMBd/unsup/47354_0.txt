I was dumb enough to rent this movie just because it said that on the cover and I wish I had paid more attention and realized they didn't say where this quote came from. They obviously just put it on there and its completely false. There was nothing shocking, nothing exciting, and nothing entertaining in this movie. It was one of the absolute worst movies I have ever seen as there was no character development, bad acting, bad dialogue, and it moved very slowly. Do not support this movie. You will be very disappointed. For the record, I enjoy B-horror movies. This wasn't even good in that B movie, funny kind of way. Awful all around.
