The Matriarch (1995) is a pretty boring horror movie it has to be said!! Granny (Stella Stevens) gets a visit from a strange man who gives her this potion that he claims will give her eternal life, while this is going on Granny's Granddaughter Kelly (Shannon Whirry) is preparing dinner for all Granny's nasty, greedy, money seeking relatives.<br /><br />All these nasty relatives want Granny dead and want all her money and fortune, after the dinner, granny decides to drink the potion but it ends up killing her...... temporarily!!! She then returns as some zombie type creature, killing off all the horrible relatives one by one, it ends up with a good vs evil battle, with granny having a climatic battle with her nice innocent granddaughter Kelly.<br /><br />The Matriarch is quite a boring horror, there's blood and killings but not really any good gore and the film drags on, i give the movie 3/10 but thats only coz i like Stella Stevens and Shannon Whirry!
