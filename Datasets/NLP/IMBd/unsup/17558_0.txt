I remember as a child of 10 years watching this movie. It was the first movie that really made me cry. This movie is a true inspiration. This movie can make you really appreciate life. Joey was truly lucky to have his big brother John, as was John to have Joey. The way the two inspired each other is remarkable. I would really like to find this movie and see it again. If you like movies that make you laugh, cry, and and everything in between you will like this one. I am sure for the rest of my life and for anyone who saw the movie, hearing the name John Cappeletti will always remind me of "Something For Joey". This movie should be released on DVD if it already hasn't. Great Movie. Bring you tissue this movie is a real tear jerker.
