Why was this film made? It has two or maybe three jokes that might get a bored person to smile and... nothing. Even when I watch a bad film I can normally guess what the director was trying to do, even if he/she failed... but here.... nothing, it's just totally pointless. The film has one of the... no... it has THE most sickly, honeyed endings in the history of cinema, followed by a second ending, just as ridiculous as the first one. There is a pair of blue eyes from one of the two main actresses which are so beautiful, I think I would forget to breath if I saw them in real life, but even that isn't enough to save the film. What else can I say... there are four principle characters, two of which are totally implausible two others which don't quite manage to live up to the standards set by the first two. They have implausible relationships with each other... then have implausible relationships with other people and then they have an implausible ending which I won't spoil, as the film does that without any help from me.
