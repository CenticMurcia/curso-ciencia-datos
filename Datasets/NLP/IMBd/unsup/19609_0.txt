This movie is available on a 50 movie DVD collection called "Tales of Terror" but the only real terror here is trying to watch this wretched disaster of a movie. The movie was edited down from an earlier movie with lots of wildlife film and "Jungle exploitation" footage of topless native women thrown in with the usual patronizing narration. The special effects are pathetically awful, an undersea battle between an octopus and various other sea creatures is obviously done in a large aquarium! The battle with the titular monster was done by the double exposure of the hero and a large Manta Ray, you can plainly see the waves of "two" oceans superimposed on each other as well as the hero, Jose. All of this should have made for a hilarious, entertaining grade Z movie but unfortunately it's just boring and dull. This makes "Plan Nine from Outer Space" look like a slick Hollywood blockbuster, no exaggeration! Unbelievably BAD.
