I didn't want to fear her. I wanted to grab that pick-axe and smash her a good one in her stupid sass-talking gob.<br /><br />The only fun things about this episode were the Doctor's obsession with those edible ball-bearings, the way he first parks the Tardis, and Roses's "Council" conversation with the tarmac chap.<br /><br />But...ewwwwww, more scary scribbling beasties, squabbling neighbors, "spooky" window silhouettes, put-on Exorcist voices, ripped-off Poltergeist closets et al. Someone lacking in creativity was trying to revive Rod Serling's infinitely more talented corpse on this one but they wrote a retardisode instead.<br /><br />Moreover this was a terribly-crafted product placementy goodwill 'love' letter to the games of the 2012 Olympiad...literally.<br /><br />*PUKE*
