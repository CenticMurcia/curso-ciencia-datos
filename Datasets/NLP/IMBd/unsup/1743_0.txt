Final Fantasy VIII is quite unlike any other computer game. The narrative and careful attention to plot resembles that of a film, as opposed to that of some 'childish' video game. Unlike Final VII the protagonists are actually shaped like humans allowing the player to identify with the relationships that develop. With over 100 hours of gameplay through beautifully crafted levels this game fails to strike boredom, even after completion.<br /><br />A truly great game 10/10.
