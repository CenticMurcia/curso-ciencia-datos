Wow I just love the fact that people have seen this movie, I'm just very surprised. I am in the movie and I have only seen 20min's of it(basically just after I get killed off)<br /><br />I have to say that the acting may seem wooden tho I have to say I don't think my acting was wooden, bad yes but I had emotion! Anyway the movie was the first for the director and I am happy that he at least put himself out there and made the movie. Anyway thats my 2 cents.....<br /><br />Neil The Cameraman. Oh one thing that I have heard .....I heard some rumors that they were thinking of doing a sequel, if that is the case I would gladly jump on board.
