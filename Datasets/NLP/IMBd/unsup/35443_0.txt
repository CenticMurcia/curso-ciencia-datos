Although it's clear that "Mr. Vincent" was written for low-budget, Mr. Celestino's ability to get this film in-the-can for $20K is admirable, to say the least. It was gritty, wonderfully photographed, well acted and directed. <br /><br />Having said that, I'm still trying to understand the level of praise heaped upon this film. Although Celestino's focus on obsessive behavior was clear, it still remains a rather typical story with typical outcomes. Neither of the lead characters was particularly compelling or empathetic. In short, although a great personal accomplishment, "Mr. Vincent" remains a film without anything unique to say.<br /><br />
