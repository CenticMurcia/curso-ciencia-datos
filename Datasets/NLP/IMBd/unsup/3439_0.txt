All I have to say about this movies is that if Jason Lee was a somewhat bigger name in the industry, it he should have had top billing. I mean this movie is all about Jason Lee, he is great in this film. It also shows that he can play a different role then the characters he has played in Kevin Smith films. If you like Jason Lee watch this movie.
