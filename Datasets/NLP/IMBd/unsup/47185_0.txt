I saw this on DVD for £2 and i thought i would check it out and see if it is any good and............it's crap. Seriously this is not worth £2. It is a load of crap. They make so many mistakes. At the beginning this bike does a flip and on 1 shot he faces the wrong way but in the second shot the bike amazingly turns the right way. The acting is rubbish. Dennis Rodman can't act to save his life and neither can the others but i must admit that i found Dane Cook funny at times. The action is poor and ruined by special effects and the gadgets are just stupid. What ever you do don't watch this film. It is rubbish from start to finish.
