COMIC BOOK: THE MOVIE could have been so much more. It could have uncovered why people love comics to the point of worship, or why so many individuals feel the need to "collect." It could have pushed us into the deep end of the nostalgia pool. It could have been both a loving and cynical look at the world of comic books fandom. And most important of all, it could have been extremely funny.<br /><br />Well, it at least tried to be funny. But it fails miserably in that regard.<br /><br />Let me say, first and foremost, that this is no WAITING FOR GUFFMAN. It tries to be a mockumentary, but it looks like it's filmed on video and appearslike anyone could have done it. (Not that I'm knocking that completely; I like edgy films, I like films that could have been filmed in somebody's basement; my problem here is, the film is otherwise extremely slick. The poor filming quality with the slick editing just doesn't cut it for me. Though, I should state that the fake covers of the COMMANDER COURAGE comic book were extraordinarily well crafted.)<br /><br />I also have a problem with much of the acting. In the Christopher Guest mocks, you always get an idea that these are human beings. Crazed. Outlandish. Sometimes off the wall (i.e. Fred Willard in A MIGHTY WIND). But human nonetheless. Not so here. The people portraying the studio execs are very poor; they are like second-rate community theatre players in search of a laugh line. Some of their mannerisms are way over the top for the stage, let alone a "movie."<br /><br />I thought Mark Hamill had moments that worked as an actor; his passion and mania for COMMANDER COURAGE (his fave superhero) are sometimes touching. His rants about his love of this superhero are at times amusing. But again, where is the human being? I saw a stock character--the comic book fanatic--as opposed to a PERSON who happens to be a comic book fanatic. I enjoy Hamill in other films; but I guess when directing himself, he's not able to guide himself into a plausible character.<br /><br />My favorite actor was the gregarious cameraman, mainly because his impersonations were spot on and he alone provided some of the movie's only laughs. Kevin Smith is fine, as are the other celebrity guests. But they aren't in the film long enough to sustain it. It's Hamill's baby, and he's not charismatic enough or strong enough in this particular performance to carry it. At times you think you might catch a glimpse of a comic-loving Corky St. Clair, or someone like Corky, but that never occurs. Hamill's Donald Swann is annoying to many of the people onscreen, and soon enough, he becomes annoying to the audience watching the film. Not a good sign.<br /><br />The film also felt especially long. SHOAH lasts many hours and I was never bored; this film is only 107 minutes and it felt like an eternity.<br /><br />I guess if you are a comic book fan, you will find some enjoyment in the behind the scenes look at the San Diego Comic Con, where much of this takes place. But if you're not, good luck. Using the comic book grading scale for condition, I give COMIC BOOK: THE MOVIE a very generous rating of FAIR.<br /><br />
