This film was a nice surprise as i had heard of it on various websites but only mangaged to see this a few months ago, If u havent seen it, its a must as Jeffery Combs plays another crazy doctor, Sam Raimi makes an apperence, and Seth Green makes a good Crazy guy, all in all give it a try, u wont be disapointed
