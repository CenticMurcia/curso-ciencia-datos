Twin Falls Idaho is a haunting, deeply personal story about a relationship that probably turned off a lot of people solely because of its two main characters. It was reminescent of the Broadway musical, 'Side Show', which also dealt with the subject of conjoined twins. The Polish Brothers gently present their characters to the audience baring the essence of all relationships with a directness rarely seen. There is an intense emotional connection between the audience and the characters. And in the end, you cry for the characters, not because they are different, but because we are all so much alike.
