Have you ever seen authentic Hollywood drivel? Well, this is it! <br /><br />The story is infantile, characters performed by the actors all have an IQ of zero, and the producers must've been drunk when they made this. I would've understood this kind of garbage being made a decade ago, but in 2003!? And by Gary Oldman?<br /><br />Despite the comments that you can read on amazon.com (probably done by patriotic American boobs), this is one is a complete waste of time. It's unimaginable that this kind of stories still hold a grip over the public. Half the movie is a bunch of clich√© sentences and the other half is a meager attempt to portrait cops as heroes. I mean, how many times have they done it before?<br /><br />_Anything_ is better than this. <br /><br />An insult to any man's intelligence.
