This is one crazy house wife that you don't want to be a rude kid or adult because she will find you and hunt you down till you are dead.Man this was the best movie that I have seen that is based on true events that is horror that I know and love.This b****Y mom was finally on the louse and insane to kill people that are rude,dressed badly,and anyone that messes with her family,any jokes.And when she went to court was really when she became wild and made each eyewitness into trouble.She is using facts about them and her body to make them crack.And very funny when the judge was flirting with Suzanne Somers when she came in the Court.And lastly,great ending when she kill a woman for wearing <br /><br />white after Labor Day.And that jury woman taught she was innocent right from the beginning,can you believe this damn woman.And she kills when she was just set free and kill,very stupid thing to do and stupider was the jury setting her free.Now she will continue her work,make a part two Mr. Waters.
