Unfortunately, it seems that our friends from the LDS church are using the Corporate Giant Disney to try to proselytize upon others. This is their latest attempt to appeal to real Christianity by portraying their field missionaries as here to help, rather than bent on world conversion. (And I might add that they are not real Christians, compare the tenants) This film was steeped in touchy moments that act to enforce the mormon-fed ideal that they are all perfect people that lead perfect lives and are in the perfect faith. Propaganda is written all over this one. There are a few laughs and many moments that LDS members should find enchanting however the film held little in the sense of real substance. The fact that it will inevitably lead people to take interest in the mormon church is disturbing, considering the lack of enthusiasm presented by Disney towards the actual Christian faith. If you are LDS have at this movie, otherwise seriously consider yourself before being taken in by a propoganda film such as this.
