I rented this movie knowing that it was said to be horrible, but I just had to see it for myself. This movie is ridiculous! It's horribly acted, horribly written, and it just is plain bad! The movie takes place in France but 90% of the cast is Italian? There is no feeling of the classic "Phantom" story line. There is no mystery no feeling of actual connection between the Phantom and Christie. All of a sudden Christine loves the Phantom and immediately has sex with him, then she hates him, then she has sex with him again, then she hates him, then she loves him again! I can't believe that Dario could actually film his daughter in a sex scene, thats just plain messed up. And let me say that Asia is a horrible actress and no matter what people say I don't think she is attractive at all. The only reason I can think of that Asia got this part is because every other actress turned it down! Another part that was ridiculous is when the Phantom rips out Carlotta's breast and threatens it cut them off, whats up with that??? And the rat catcher and the little person was just a dumb side story. Bottom line BAD acting BAD story BAD movie!!! Seriously don't waste the $ to rent this movie, luckily I got it for free!
