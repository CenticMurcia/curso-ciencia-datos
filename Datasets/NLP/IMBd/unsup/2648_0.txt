Let me start by saying I am well read in the original Norse tale of "Beowulf" and "Grendel" and am a proud Swede. I have never been so excited to see a blockbuster action flick adapted from a book in my life. I went and stood in line to see it at the IMAX in 3-D. The theater was packed and the crowd was in great spirits.<br /><br />As soon as the movie started, you are like "Wow", is this really animation? I mean, you know its fake, but the close ups and detailing is really amazing. Hopkins was super classic as the drunken king too. Instantly the movie kicks into action when Grendel shows up. The movie then introduces Grendel's mother, looking hotter than in real life and does a great job of tempting everyone.<br /><br />My only problem with the movie is it gets a little boring in the middle. I understand the reasoning, but I think it could have been adapted better to keep the audience more interested.<br /><br />All in all, great movie and I can't wait for the DVD!
