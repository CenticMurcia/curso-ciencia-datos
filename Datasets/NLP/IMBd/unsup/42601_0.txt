I was greatly disappointed with this cartoon. To begin with, it WAS supposed to be for children, wasn't it? Because there is a whole lot in here which i was definitely shocked to see in a cartoon. The female character wears a very revealing outfit and there are a number of times where the characters are involved in 'adult situations.' The story had potential- there were a number of funny parts, especially at the beginning. But the rest of it dragged. The music, which i always consider very important, was not the least bit entertaining but such a bore that it was only the amusing visuals that kept me from fast-forwarding. But what really put me off,as mentioned before, was the adult content. it just doesn't seem right to have it in a children's cartoon. There wasn't any sweet romance in it but rather something else . . . which keeps me from recommending it as something for kids to watch.
