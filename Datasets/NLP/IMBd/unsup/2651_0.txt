I finally figured out how to enjoy this movie when I realized it was a cross between a cheesy bodice-ripper romance novel and an Eddie Izzard routine.<br /><br />I wish I had seen it in 3D, at least that would have added some amusement to an otherwise disappointing movie. Although, Angelina Jolie is always pleasant to look at when scantily clad. Wish I'd just stayed home and rented Gia.<br /><br />OH, and stilettos in 750 AD? Whatever.<br /><br />(Lustlimb is how one Beowulf's men refers to his penis when he's chatting up the local serving wench.)
