Even as at a tender age, I found the dialog in this movie pedestrian, mundane and even idiotic. I'll never forget the line Tyrone Power mouthed as the successful toreador who clawed his way to the top: "Now I don't have to ask the price of anything I want to buy" (or something to that effect). Well I have seen millionaires haggle to the last penny and that's how they became millionaires.<br /><br />Sometime towards the end, the makers of the movie inexplicably and without provocation, delivers a punch against Catholicism and feminism. How? By putting lines into the mouth of Tyrone's mother that only befits a bible thumping hack and bigot. Urged by one of the minor characters to pray to the La Virgen de la Macarena for her son's deliverance, the bullfighter's mother said something like: "I don't pray to her anymore. She is but a woman. I now pray to Him!" These lines delivered in an acting style typical of an actress in a zarzuela on a provincial tour.
