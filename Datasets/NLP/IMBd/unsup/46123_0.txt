There maybe spoilers in the following; if you get to see the film, you really won't care.<br /><br />It is no wonder Asia is no longer appearing in her dad's films. She has certainly proved herself an infinitely better director all round; true, it would be hard for anyone to ever match the dizzying heights of Suspiria but this stinks. Really, it does; its a floater in the phantom's sewer. Most of the characters look like typical Eurotrash, especially the long-haired Raul, who is impossible to take seriously and WHY, Dario? WHY? WHY take away the mask? The Phantom's mask! What next? Porn without the sex? James Bond without his tux? Oi! But that isn't the half of it; we are exposed to such treats as Sands sticking rats down his trousers (yes, you read that right) and does it not worry anyone else about the amount of nudity Pop requires of Asia? But the film's crowning achievement is surely the crazy idea of Rats... yes, RATS... raising the Phantom from a baby. Where did he learn to speak? To dress? How did he come to be so good in bed? Did he read the Rata Sutra? or is it the Karma Ratra? OK, enough of that. I remember reading at the time a industry insider (who remained nameless) saying that if the film did not do well, the Italian film industry was in big trouble. No wonder they're shooting all their films on digital these days.
