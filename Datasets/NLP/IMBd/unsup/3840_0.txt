Oh whoopie, look at this- I get 100th comment.<br /><br />Right... my original interaction with this movie was last May (2005) when I was given a CD of various Broadway songs... one of them being the revival (1998) version of the song "Cabaret," from "Cabaret" of course...<br /><br />So when a production of the show came to my city this last month, I was eager to see such. I adored the show, and a week later I had the soundtrack to the 1998 revival.<br /><br />Well you know, I couldn't exactly see the show every night, and my friend had told me how strangely different than the play the movie was, so of course I had to see it.<br /><br />This was a VERY WEIRD remake.<br /><br />I see that people have already picked up that "Married" was left out... but the thing is that it isn't just "Married" (at one point, we can also hear a record of "It Couldn't Please Me More" and "Sitting Pretty"), but the entire plot line between Fraulein Schneider and Herr Shulz was left out.<br /><br />In the play, these two are humongous characters, and very good characters might I add. These two are completely dropped. In the play, Max is hardly a character, but in the movie he's humongous.<br /><br />However, I am not saying that this was a BAD remake- but a very odd one; and so much different than the play! I could babble on and on about this, but I do have other things to get to.<br /><br />VERY inappropriate as well- the film has been rated PG, which surprises me, for "A Chorus Line" (which came out not much later) was rated PG-13, and this was much worse. In short, don't let your children come anywhere near it.<br /><br />Ooh gawed, hated Sally's hair.<br /><br />The styles of Sally Bowles were atrocious; whereas in the play they were a bit unappealing, but not as exaggerated as in this version.<br /><br />One thing I'm quite surprised I haven't commented on- I was very bummed by the amount of the Master of Ceremonies bits they took out... the Emcee was one of my very favorite characters in the play, and yet his part was so much smaller in the movie...<br /><br />However, this is not to say I am not impressed with this- as an original idea picked up from a very impressive play, I am quite fine with it. However, as a remake of a play, it is terrible.<br /><br />If you haven't seen the play, and you're ready for an extremely ironic, dark, somehow amusing, extremely disturbing movie, go ahead- watch Cabaret.<br /><br />If you've seen the play and want to see it again, don't expect it of this movie version.
