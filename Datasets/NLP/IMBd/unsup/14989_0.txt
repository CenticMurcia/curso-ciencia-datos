"Lost World" type plot of an expedition to a section of the Antarctic where there's a body of warm water. The team members run into inclement weather - not to mention a flying menace - that forces them to land. Where they land is a few thousand feet below sea level where time is stuck back in the Mesozoic era. Dinosaurs are a persistent problem, not to mention a severely traumatized survivor (Henry Brandon) of a previous expedition.<br /><br />Laying aside a lack of originality, and a budget too low to allow for more convincing special effects, "The Land Unknown" is still fairly good entertainment. It's got a good look (and one very good looking female co-star in Shirley Patterson, who gets to dress somewhat skimpily for a fair portion of the running time); the sets are well done. It's made with some skill; director Virgil Vogel was also at the helm of other fantastical films from the era such as "The Mole People" and "Terror in the Midnight Sun". He delivers some enjoyable thrills and keeps things moving steadily along, bringing the film in at a tight 'n' trim running time of 79 minutes.<br /><br />Future Tarzan performer Jock Mahoney adheres to the tradition of rugged and stoic heroes from other sci-fi films of the era, with able support from William Reynolds, Douglas Kennedy, and Phil Harvey. Brandon is a stand-out as the crazed Hunter who tries to run things his way but is still reachable and it's nice to see him regain some humanity by the conclusion of the film.<br /><br />"The Land Unknown" stands out from other Universal 50's sci-fi efforts for being shot in CinemaScope. This allows for a feeling of grandeur even if it's essentially B level material. Vogel certainly knows how to fill the wider-than-usual picture.<br /><br />It may not be destined to be one of the classics of the period, but it's still fun of its type.<br /><br />7/10
