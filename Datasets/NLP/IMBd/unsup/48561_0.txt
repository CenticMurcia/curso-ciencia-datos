I really stepped into this one expecting something from De Niro and McDormand (and a 6.3 here), but I was sadly disappointed.<br /><br />The (multiple) parallel story lines just irritated me. I considered them an affront to the viewer. I got tired of the heavy handed approach early on, I guess, but it still kept on coming.<br /><br />I didn't feel any depth to the characters whatsoever. I still struggled to stay on, but this was only to see a hammed speech by De Niro. The ending results left me guessing quite a bit, but not in a good way and this only irritated me further. I'll not reveal anything, but who funded this bowser? I'll give a point to McDormand and Forsythe, both of whom I like and did reasonably well despite the terrible script and swiss cheese story. De Niro does not live up to his capabilities, he seems to be on auto-pilot here. He hand picked James Franco to play Joey, but I was left wondering why.<br /><br />Blech. See something else. I want that 108 minutes back. - 2 of 10
