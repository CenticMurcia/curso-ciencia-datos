Unlike other early adult movies such as DEEP THROAT and BEHIND THE GREEN DOOR, this fine combination of explicit sex and shoot 'em up thrills gets little respect even from genre fans. This is largely due to the brutal nature of the film's numerous rape sequences, commendably NOT of the 'they may protest at first' variety. The story's well detailed in the other comment you'll find here, so I won't go into that. <br /><br />Most of the performers here made very few films (save for Levi Richards who made tons) and even beautiful blonde Barbara Bourbon, who turns in some effective acting as well as the proud, resilient farmer's wife fighting to protect her daughters from 'a fate worse than death', only made a handful of X-rated appearances, most memorably of course in Radley Metzger's timeless PRIVATE AFTERNOONS OF PAMELA MANN. Director "David Fleetwood" is actually sixties schlock producer Joe Robertson (THE CRAWLING HAND, THE SLIME PEOPLE, THE AGENT FOR H.A.R.M.), so the flick's inconspicuous professionalism in just about every aspect of production as well as narrative drive should come as no surprise. He went on to carve a niche for himself as 'female' (for the face value crowd) porn director "Adele Robbins" with movies like SWEET ALICE and INNOCENT SEDUCTION. <br /><br />You may think that this early rape 'n' revenge movie stands diametrically opposed to his later couples friendly numbers. Anyone taking the effort to sit down and watch the film in its entirety will come to realize however that the female characters (Bourbon's in particular) are well drawn, not whining victims at all, perfectly capable of righting the wrongs inflicted upon them. So give this classic its due and allow it to take its rightful place in the pantheon alongside its more renowned genre brethren.
