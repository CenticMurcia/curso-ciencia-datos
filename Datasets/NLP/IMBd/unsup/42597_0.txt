While there were some very good episodes during the last season of Star Trek, there were probably just as many disappointments--probably because they knew the series was on its last legs and no one in charge really seemed to care. While a score of 4 looks almost average, for Star Trek it is not and the episode was completely forgettable due to poor writing--and an abundance of plot holes.<br /><br />Kirk is beamed down to a planet to negotiate some sort of treaty or something but instead arrives in an exact duplicate. He's all alone until later a lady appears and says she, too, has no idea how she got there. At the same time, the crew of the Enterprise is worried since they lost contact with Kirk and the officials on the planet say they have no idea where he is but also obviously hinder the investigation.<br /><br />I'll jump ahead and explain the why, as you shouldn't have to watch this episode--it's that dumb. It seems that the planet is actually so overwhelmingly overpopulated because they have no natural disease that they wanted to kidnap Kirk and take germs from him and introduce them to the woman--making her sort of like a "Typhoid Mary" who will help reduce the population through illness instead of instituting reasonable birth control. Huh?! This makes no sense on so many levels. First, why the ruse? They could have gotten germs from almost anywhere--why spend a fortune duplicating the Enterprise down to every minute detail and kidnap the Captain?! Second, if the believe so strongly against birth control, maybe they should consider celibacy or pushing each other in front of buses! Third, if the planet is absolutely choked with people, why build the Enterprise--where will you put it? Fourth, why not start a war and kill of some people like we humans would have done?
