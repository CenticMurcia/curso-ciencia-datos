Adapting JG Ballard's novel might have seemed like a good idea to a director as provocative as David Cronenberg, but if any book screamed un-film-able, it's CRASH. It may be filthy, but it's also extremely boring, which is especially disheartening considering the fact that at least two of Cronenberg's earlier films --- THE BROOD and THE FLY --- are masterpieces of modern horror. CRASH features a typically dull James Spader getting entangled with a group of car crash fetishists and having sex with various people including Holly Hunter and a hobbling Roseanna Arquette. Ballard's book was devoid of narrative and Cronenberg makes the mistake of trying to instill one. He's not successful and unfortunately CRASH is crap.
