Besides its dialogue being simply stunning in piling up repartee after absurdist repartee,the very plot of the film feels more as a joke at the expenses of structuralist critique than a structuralist text per se.<br /><br />In short, it is multi-layered entertainment at its best, with a strong central characterization (Jobert) and great European locations.
