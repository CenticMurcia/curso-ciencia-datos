I truly expected something wonderful from this movie. An ensemble cast of talented and funny performers should have boded well. <br /><br />Words cannot describe how wrong I was. Who would believe that Whoopi is from the South with her dreads and non-accent? Who would believe that with all of their dysfunction that they could pull a funeral together in two days? Who would believe that Jada could be so awful in her role?<br /><br />Toni Braxton was surprisingly good, and of course if Ced had been given more time, he would have been the movie's saving grace. The plotline was barely there, the characters were all overwhelmingly dysfunctional, and it tied up so neatly, I was perturbed. It's not what you think it is going to be, so go with your expectations firmly nestled in your shoe.<br /><br />
