I really liked this film a lot. In particular, the cinematography was absolutely lovely--very artistic and it set the mood for romance between the leads.<br /><br />Harold is a very shy guy who has zero luck with girls. Much of this is due to the fact he is painfully shy and tends to stutter around women! However, he has created an alter-ego who has written a manuscript for a book on dating and details his many, many "conquests". He's sure the book will be published and allow him to quit his job as an apprentice tailor.<br /><br />A little later, a very sweet and unspoiled rich girl, by chance, meets Harold and they are both smitten. Their romance is really pretty sweet and, perhaps, DOES border on being a little syrupy--but I still liked it. However, through a misunderstanding concerning his book (he thinks it won't be published and cannot afford to marry), he breaks off his engagement to this lovely girl--only to have her accept the offer from a BIGAMIST! Well, Harold finds out later that his book WILL be published and that she is to web this scoundrel, so with no time to lose, he races to stop the wedding. Much of the last portion of the film is devoted to this incredibly long but funny mad dash to save her.<br /><br />About the only negatives, and they are minor, are that the chase at the end has been done before (though rarely as well) and the whole stuttering thing seems like a cheap way to get a laugh. Really--these aren't terrible complaints--it still is a nearly perfect film.
