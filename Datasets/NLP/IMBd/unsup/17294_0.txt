I originally caught "Buying the Cow" on Starz, and I found it to be funny and enjoyable. Don't expect to garner any answers to life's questions, but what do you expect from a "straight-to-video" movie. I laughed-out-loud at alot of the jokes in this movie, and definately would suggest this movie to my friends.<br /><br />I think the saving grace for this movie, is the fact that both guys and girls can find humor in the situations and commentary that you see in this film. If your girlfriend drags you to the video store, and insists that you rent a romantic comedy, you can't go wrong with "Buying the Cow" (more emphasis on the comedy than on the romance... but she won't know that)<br /><br />(SPOILERS!!!)<br /><br />Perhaps the funniest scenes deal w/ Mike Hanson (Ryan Reynolds) as he deals w/ his newly-discovered homosexual tendancies. I had to cringe (in a good way) when he almost gets shot as a would-be pedophile.
