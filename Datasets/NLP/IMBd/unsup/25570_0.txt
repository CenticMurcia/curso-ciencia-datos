first of all i'd like to say disregard all negative comments about this film. i'm not saying go by just what i say, but at least give it a chance and rent it. yeah it's not the greatest film but it is nevertheless dominant in its amusing nature. it features dave chapelle who is just about the funniest dominator in history. he builds on his conceptual nature in other films such as blue streak in which he was the always dominating tulley and in, who could ever forget, half baked. danny devito is great in his supporting role and norm macdonald is funny as always. a great film if you like insane comedy that isn't necessarily complex and extremely thought out.
