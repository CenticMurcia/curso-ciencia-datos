I did not know what to expect with Knowing and avoided reading reviews etc so I went in with an open mind. It starts off well enough, the time capsule idea is well done and the revelation of the dates and times of disasters is great. The movie has quite intense moments, something I don't experience too often, and the three disaster scenes, the aircraft, the subway trains and the solar flair are brilliantly carried off. About half way through the time I was beginning to have doubts about what sort of movie this was. I was half thinking it was of the DaVinciCode genre but humanoid aliens acting in a sinister manner who later turn out to be child abductors to an alien planet - well really! I know you should not question too closely when it can spoil your enjoyment of the experience, but with Knowing the end was really too much of a let down. I enjoyed it all the same for the sheer unexpectedness of the plot, the reasonably good acting by Cage and the effects.
