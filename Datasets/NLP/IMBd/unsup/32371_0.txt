I knew nothing about this film before I rented it. I wish that there had been someone to take me by the hand; to warn me off. So now I'm here now for the rest of you. Don't rent this film. Slight redemption comes in the form of the two female leads, Lena Headey & Penelope Cruz. They are both simply exquisite -- but beauty does not a film make.
