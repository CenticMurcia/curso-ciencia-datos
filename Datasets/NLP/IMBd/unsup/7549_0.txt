This is definitely a third rate movie. According to some reviewers, this is the best of the Shaft films so far. If that was the best of Shaft, I sure would not waste my time with another Shaft film..<br /><br />Richard Roundtree does a fair job of acting, but the rest of the cast do not show much talent.
