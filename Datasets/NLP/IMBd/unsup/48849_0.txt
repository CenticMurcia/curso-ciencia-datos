It took me about 20 viewings to actually sit through this stinker. It's that bad! What's worse, it seems like every time it was on, it was on the part I had already seen - the inhumanity.<br /><br />Note to the Hank's kid: you're not Tom, so think about a different career.<br /><br />This Colin Hanks kid has no chemistry or charisma. He's charmless, a real dope. <br /><br />The movie isn't funny, badly paced, boring, a real stiff. I've seen wittier lines in porno. This one is an affront to real movie fans. Anyone that says different should be lobotomized. And there's the real truth, Jack.
