I fully agree with lukasbrunner's review below.<br /><br />Such a great story, such a mountain.really deserved something better.<br /><br />As for historical accuracy? Rainer and Angerer were neither "bad Nazis", nor hostile to Hinterstoisser and Kurz: Actually they had decided to join forces before they started the climb.<br /><br />The Nazis never pushed those guys into attempting the North face, nor supported them: If they had government support ,they wouldn't have to stay in tents, and travel to Switzerlandby bicycle! <br /><br />Actually,Hinterstoisser and Kurz's commanding officer tried to stop them, but they chose to pretend they had never received the cable forbidding them to climb. <br /><br />If you want to see what really happened, and who these people really were, watch Joe Simpson's "Touching the Void"
