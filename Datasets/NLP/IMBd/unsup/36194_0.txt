I want my 88 minutes back.<br /><br />A B movie with B list "talent" and a screenplay that deserved lighter fluid and a match. A selection of bad horror movie hacks pieced together by contrived twists. You don't see the ending coming in the same way that you don't anticipate the pain of dental surgery until after the novocaine wears off.<br /><br />After Bill Shatner's dot com fiasco he should have retired. He could do great self-deprecating roles. Instead he is not even reading the script before doing the movie.
