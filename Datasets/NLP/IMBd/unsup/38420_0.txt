This documentary is as true as the Bloody Mary Urban Legend; I am ashamed that PBS can produce something so vile, repugnant and sexist (and wrong; one of the 'abused mothers' - Sadia Loeliger - is actually a recognized abuser).<br /><br />The 'feminist' who produced and endorsed this give women and mothers a bad name, and I wonder if they still can look at themselves in the mirror.<br /><br />It says that many children are denied the love of their mothers; HELLOOOO! The children are denied FATHERS!!! It's so obvious an Italian (me) notices it! Don't bother with this work of fiction; it'll only make your blood boil.<br /><br />Breaking The Silence: Children's Stories: 1/10 (but deserves even less)
