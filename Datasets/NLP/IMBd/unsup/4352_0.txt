One of the greatest movie ever made. This movie was written directly for the screen by Neil Simon, and his mastery of creating a hilarious but also surreal story perfectly works in this uproarious comedy. The luggage sequence, being dumped down in the middle of the central park, breaking off the tooth scene, to name a few. Two main characters, namely George and Gwen Kellerman, are played best by always-wonderful Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis. This movie could have been just a stressful and noisy film without their lovable chemistry. I heard Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn are now remaking this movie, I don't know what kind of success the new version will get, but I am sure, by all means, they can't even get close to the quality of this original one(the original was in the early 70s, and its now 90s!!). So, whether seeing the new one or not, see this one first!!
