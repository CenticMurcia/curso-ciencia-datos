Dodge City was one of the first westerns in color. Made in 1939, it had a lot of "staying power" I remember it being re-released in the middle fifties, with many people thinking they were seeing a new western. The beginning shows the train arriving in Dodge, racing a stagecoach. Progress is coming, but a couple of years later, it becomes a lawless town. Errol Flynn and his friends will fight to clean up the city. The saloon brawl is the best part of the film and was many times used as stock footage. I saw Dodge City several times, each time enjoying it in a different way. I used to consider it an exciting western, action packed, very violent. Nowadays it has aged, But Dodge City is part of the history of the western movies, and like that it should be looked upon.
