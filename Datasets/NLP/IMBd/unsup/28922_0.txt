Parts of it were a little eerie but the action left a lot to be desired, the fight scene at the end and the car crash were a little awful and a bit laughable.<br /><br />I liked the flashes of the future in black and white though.And the explosion at the start looked pretty good, I think thats why it's disappointing, because the first five minuets were more entertaining than the rest of it put together.<br /><br />Personally I think my media class could have made something better, but it wasn't terrible, the mothers dislike of the nanny was believable.<br /><br />Okayish. It might have worked better as a spoof comedy.
