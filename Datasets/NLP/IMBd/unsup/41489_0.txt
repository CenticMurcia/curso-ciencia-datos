The problem that I had with this movie is that the doctor laughed like a little girl. It was just as the title suggested and it made the movie more of a bad comedy than a horror movie. I couldn't stand the way he giggled. It was so cheesy but what did I expect? Then he makes all of these doctor jokes such as: "Is there a doctor in the house?" I think that I have heard jokes like this before and they were snowman jokes in Jack Frost. Freddy Kruger also makes jokes like that so they were nothing new. This is a bad movie that was meant to be a horror movie but just turned into a comedy. It isn't even that great of a comedy. If I were flipping by and saw this again, I would just keep on going. Giggle. Giggle. Giggle.
