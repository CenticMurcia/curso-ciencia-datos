This is one of the best movies I have ever seen! The non stop action coupled with the insane awesomeness of Shannon Lee makes this an instant kung-fu classic. I especially love Robert Vitelli and the super-amazing kick butt fighting he does. This movie has it all: guns, mystery, action and SHANNON LEE!! It starts out with Vitelli as some homeless punk, but then he gets sucked into a secret assassin school and it turns out that he is some kind of genius. He doesn't like the assassin school (which is run by Star Trek's Michael Dorn!) so he tries to get kicked out and then tries to escape. The plot twists and turns but the action never lets up! See this one twice.
