I just watched this one again. Damn it's good. A lot of people seem to have problems with possible plot errors, but I really wish they would look past those and see a great movie. When I saw this one in theaters I was so excited that my heart was racing. This movie really has just about everything. And the Garth Brooks song at the end is a nice finishing touch.
