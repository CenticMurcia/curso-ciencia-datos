1997. Was the year when first Starship Troopers came out... Man, when I watch it now, it is strong as it was then... Good story, good CGI, good acting... That film was entirely good.<br /><br />Then 2004. came out second Starship Troopers... and I thought to myself " This is some lame try to make more money on the fame of first movie." And I wasn't wrong. Now 2008. and third installment comes. And its even worse.<br /><br />I don't know why did I watch this movie for 1 hour and 30 minutes. Maybe because I was so bored and tired to get up from my comfortable sofa and change DVD. It starts, as you all know, like previous ones, with some news, etc. And the action! But believe me, the action you don't want to see. Casper Van Dien is horrible, text lines, acting. The other actors sucked as well, the whole plot sucks!<br /><br />Maybe this review is to harsh, but I am angry when someone tries to make more money on fame of the previous installment. And this movie is all about it.<br /><br />I just can't remember the last movie where van Dien didn't sucked. The movie like first Starship Troopers where he did a decent job. After that movie, he went to record such amount of stupid ones. Including this one.<br /><br />My opinion: Avoid it! Avoid second Starship Trooper and the third. Its all just lame try to make more money. To lame...
