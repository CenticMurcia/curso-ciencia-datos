I'm always in for a movie classic like this. Dustin Hoffmann one of the greatest actors ever (even if "Rain Man" was his last truly great film) shines in this biopic about controversial comedian Lenny Bruce. I don't really know why they shot it in black and white but after a while it didn't bother me anymore. If you liked "Man On The Moon" go and see "Lenny".
