"Nickle & Dime" is a lame little subpar comedy about an unscrupulous heir tracer (Howell) and his unwanted sidekick and CPA (Shawn) and their escapades with a couple of babes, some crooks, etc. A poorly written and assembled piece of work barely worth the time which has little to offer save a few laughs and a few poignant moments.
