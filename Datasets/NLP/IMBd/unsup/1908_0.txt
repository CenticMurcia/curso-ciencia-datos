O.C. and Stiggs is one of my favorite movies. It is hilarious and awful at the same time -- exactly what every good comedy should be! Although it is hailed as one of Altman's worst films, I think it has a certain charm. It captures a feeling of the freedom of adolescence as well as the bizarre humor of true friendship. I can relate to much of their antics. The movie is at times downright meanspirited, but it is a MOVIE for Pete's sake, plus, it is nowhere near as raunchy as the National Lampoon articles it is based on.<br /><br />In true Altman form, the dialogue is subtle and overlapping, and you may have to watch it a few times to get the best jokes. Bear with it! If you've got an off-kilter sense of humor you'll truly enjoy it!!
