Written by people who must have failed all of their high school science classes, directed by someone who must have never seen a computer actually function, this film is jam packed with the most tired clich√©s of filmdom. The acting is abominable--and by actors who are very talented. Shot almost entirely in television style close ups, this film is an insult to intelligence. It all starts with an awful script--it really seems like someone just recorded a bunch of twelve year olds playing "rocket ship" together--"whoah, someone diverted our energy! where's it gone?"(actual line!)--transcribed it, and decided to spend one hundred million dollars on it.<br /><br />No reason to write a spoiler, you've seen it all before a hundred times, mostly on television.<br /><br />Basically, if Ed Wood was given a gigantic budget, this is what he would've made.<br /><br />It just goes to show that in the words of Miles Davis, "you can't polish a turd."
