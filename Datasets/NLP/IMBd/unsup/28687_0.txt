This movie is just as good as it gets. I saw it once more last night on late TV and couldn´t stop watching even though I´ve seen it 2 or 3 times already. You just can´t get tired of it and there´s not a lot of movies you can say that about. Jack Nicholson and all the cast are excellent. I give it a 10.
