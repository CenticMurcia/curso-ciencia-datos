Director Al Adamson's 1970 sci-fi/horror/cosmic/vampire exercise in hallucinogenic film-making.<br /><br />Could there possibly be life on this distant barren planet? How would this world be able to evolve a race of mutant cave-dwelling vampires? Who are these strange lizard-beings and malnutrition-ed buffaloes? Can our hero astronauts survive their own bad acting? Is Dr. Rynning really only 64 years old when he looks like he's 105? <br /><br />These are the burning questions which will keep you on the edge of your seat when you watch 'Blood of the Horror-' ... I mean, 'Horrors of the Atomic-' ... I mean, 'Vampires of the Cave-Dwelling-' ... oh, forget it!
