Like many (I assume), this was the first Indian film I'd ever really seen. And like many, I presume, the first time a song/dance number came up, I was surprised, and even started laughing. I thought it was a joke. But toward the end of the movie, as it got darker, more violent, more depressing, I realised the importance of the musical bits. They do add quite a lot to the movie, and actually drove me to download many of them, they're so catchy.<br /><br />In the end, while the film quality is lacking at times, the acting, music and flamboyantly dramatic direction make this an incredible film, and a favourite of mine. That, and the women are hot Hot HOT. High-five, India.<br /><br />If you liked Shah Rukh Khan in this movie, and are in the mood for a good old fashioned Bollywood comedy, check out Dilwale Duhania Le Jayenge. It's alternately in Hindhi and English, which makes it confusing for a bit, but it's fairly enjoyable.<br /><br />Overall, Grade A work.
