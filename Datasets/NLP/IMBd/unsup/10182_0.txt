This is a very down to earth film story written by William Faulkner concerning a cotton farmer named Jackson Fentry, (Robert Duvall) who lives in the South and he is a poor person but also works as a watchman over a saw mill during the Winter. One day Jackson goes outside and hears the sound of a person in distress and discovers a woman, Sarah Eubanks, (Olga Belin) who is pregnant and he decides to help her and he takes good care of her. As the picture moves on the story becomes quite interesting and you will never be able to figure out just how this great film ends. The pace of this film is very slow and the actor Robert Duvall creates a great Southern accent and speaks his lines with a real Southern drawl along with a great actress, Olga Belin. Enjoy.
