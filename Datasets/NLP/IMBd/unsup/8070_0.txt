The streets of Paris on a quiet Sunday morning. The shrill scream of a Ferrari going through the gears. A camera strapped to the hood. Blasting through red lights at breakneck speed and using pedestrians as apex cones. The best 7 minutes of real tv I have ever seen. Worth every penny for those car nuts and race fans. This film was "out of print" two years ago. I have been looking for this film since I first saw it in 1989.
