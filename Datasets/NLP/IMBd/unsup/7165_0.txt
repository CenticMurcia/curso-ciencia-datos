It was about the only thing that acted well in this piece of tripe. I'd like congratulate the director, Hayley Cloake, the lead actress, Izabella Miko and the lead actor, Austin Nichols on the amateurish attempt to adapt Poe.<br /><br />To classify this as a B-movie would be an insult to B-movies. I would be more forgiving if this was the Hayley Cloake's first attempt at directing, however, it is not. She has no sense of setting the mood or tone of The Fall of the House of Usher. It's as if she never read the short story that her movie was supposed to be based. She could've at least viewed the Corman's version. I don't mind when writers/directors stray from the source material, just as long they take it in an original direction. Changing the narrator's sex did not succeed in doing so. Initially, I thought it would be an interesting twist. However, there was no tension in this "Thriller", which is a main ingredient in Thriller genre. As a matter of fact, there was no thrill. Even the soundtrack was boring and dull. <br /><br />Izabella Miko seems satisfied prancing around in her underwear without any regard to what is actually unfolding before her eyes. Frankly, if I wanted to see scantily-clad women walking around, I would watch a Victoria's Secret fashion show. That would at least be visually stimulating and provide some entertainment. Miko is in dire need of acting classes. Someone needs to tell her that having a pretty face isn't all you need to make it in Hollywood. That may have worked for Jessica Alba, but look at how she is oft-ridiculed for her "acting".<br /><br />I've only seen Nichols in JFC and I thought his performance in that, was decent. Unfortunately, I think, he only does well playing a retard. I have seen better acting in an Uwe Boll production or even YOUTUBE. Make an effort! You ARE playing RODERICK USHER! <br /><br />Titling it, "The House of Usher" is appropriate since there is no Fall. In a lame twist ending, the Usher line actually continues with coming of Jill's twin children. <br /><br />I wanted to like this film and I tried to ignore its flaws, but when there are so many, it's difficult to avoid them.
