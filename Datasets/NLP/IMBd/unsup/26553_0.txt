If anyone ever asks why Douglas Fairbanks was such a big star, tell them to view this film. His personality "leaps" off the screen and the film is as exciting as it was in 1924. True, some of the "special effects" are a little corny by today's standards, but the film holds up, nevertheless.<br /><br />And to all those who appreciate the male form, Douglas Fairbanks physique is unbelievable!
