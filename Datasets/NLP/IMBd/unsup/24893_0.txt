I watched this show when I was 19. I enjoyed it since it seemed to grasp how every marriage that I knew from friends and family. Granted not all marriages are carbon copies of the ones on the show, but at least it hits on ones that are familiar. I found that the awkward moments with Mickey (Mike Binder) and his wife (Sonya Walger) looked like bad acting seemed to emphasize that awkward feelings they were having. Little nuances like this made it a little better for me. And the support characters are real to me. Especially since I have been on both sides (being the single guy and the married guy *sort of) The complaints seem real and the responses genuine as far as I could tell. I have since watched it and still find the humor. I was more curious about how long the show would last since they covered the main question of infidelity? The second season I am sure covered another topic, but I don't really remember. I do hope they put out the second season just so I can complete my thoughts on the show. All in all I did enjoy it when I was single and when I got into a serious relationship.
