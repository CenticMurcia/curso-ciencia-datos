This is quite possibly the most pathetic excuse for a film i have ever seen. And to think that some commenter's have the audacity to compare this to a George Romero flick.<br /><br />The first thing you notice is the acting (or lack of it). It is some of the worst i have ever had the misfortune to watch, and i just didn't know what to say. Lets take an example: a girl sees her dad go ape sh_t and then eat her mother. What does she do? She stands up, watches with absolutely no expression of shock on her face, and slowly walks out of the room. WHAT is movie making coming to? Is it not possible to make somebody show a spec of emotion in their acting? Pathetic.<br /><br />It is not possible to follow this film and take it seriously. The lack of any acting skill coupled with the inconsistent transitions from scene to scene and down-right unrealistic actions makes it unwatchable. I have seen bad films in my time and i rarely EVER turn one off but this made me tap out before the half way line.<br /><br />The film takes a plunge into the pit of crap with its consistency. Again, there just isn't any. There are basically two sets of survivors from the off. They somehow avoid the whole city turning into zombies by sleeping in an alleyway and a car park respectively. Only one group encounters a single zombie before they make their way, and they miraculously act like they all know each other perfectly the next morning. The dialogue, the acting, the events, the consistency, EVERYTHING i can think of about this film is bad except the camera work which is borderline respectable.<br /><br />At times it comes across as a decent flick with good angles and some good cues of music but these things are all made useless because there is no pacing. Its like one minute you will see the survivors talking by a car, then it will cut to a desert setting with them talking about how the infection started, then cut back to the same people somewhere else by the same car they left. Another example is when the survivor groups meet up. We don't see it at all. We hear a gunshot when a survivor of the army meets group B and group A run towards the camera after hearing it and claiming "we're saved". End shot, next scene somewhere completely different.<br /><br />I am just lost for words at how to explain this film. Its like it was made without a director and the people responsible just filmed a load of crap they thought might work and then threw it together in movie maker.<br /><br />Do not watch this film, ever. You will only waste the time in your life up until turning it off.
