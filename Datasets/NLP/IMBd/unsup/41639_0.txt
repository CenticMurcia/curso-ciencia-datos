As a rule whenever I run into a movie that has music created entirely using a synthesizer my brain flashes on the word "CHEAP". Add to that the tired post-apocalyptic settings, and a cast you never heard of (except for Van Damme, of course), and you've got a reason to leave this one in the bargain bin. It didn't help that this was the last film from the nearly dead, and already bankrupt, Cannon Films. Sadly, they went out with a whimper instead of a bang. Wander through the credits and there are signs everywhere that money was tight. There are several people listed for multiple positions in the production team, and Van Damme is even took a turn as a Film Editor.<br /><br />The movie itself is trite, and the plot is very basic: Main characters go from here to there in a world where civilization has crumbled, surviving attacks from savage gangs. Said travel includes flashbacks for The Hero to an earlier time when he suffered heavily at the hands of the same savage gang. Strictly formula.<br /><br />The character development is extremely basic, and could have been handled better. Watching this movie one gets the impression that the idea was just to cash in on the Van Damme mystique and spend as little as possible doing it. So, this one is heavy on fighting, albeit poorly done, and light on everything else.<br /><br />Calling this movie "Cyborg" was a lie as that particular character has a minimal part in the movie. So if you're looking for an action flick involving a Cyborg battling humans, don't stop here. As a matter of fact, don't stop here at all. There's nothing to see.
