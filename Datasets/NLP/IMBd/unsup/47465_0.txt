GSN killed potential long-term viewership of this show by filling the early episodes with butt cheek pencil breakers, nipple enhancement sellers and geriatric strippers. These early episodes also had the panel making forced, out of context, sexual comments. Granted, GSN appears to have learned a little bit from its early mistakes and the later episodes have guests with broader appeal and somewhat toned-down, sophomoric sexual commentary. Still, the all-gay, totally unknown, panel remains a stupid on-going gimmick (Suzanne is a comedienne? when is she ever funny or witty?) and the ridiculously easy clues given to the panel makes viewers wonder if GSN has no budget for winners. This show might have garnered more good will from long time game show fans at the beginning, but GSN teased them by airing a few weeks of the original "IGS" at 3:30 am est and then pulled it to substitute this new, hugely flawed version, which was rerun from its 11:30 pm est time slot. I would give it a chance to evolve and grow up if the original show were replaced at the late night time slot.
