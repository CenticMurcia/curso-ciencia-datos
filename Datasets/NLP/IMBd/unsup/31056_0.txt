I wasn't expecting much from this movie since I think the whole 'Christmas Carol' theme has been beaten to death already, but hoped at least for a few laughs. I think the only thing that made me chuckle at all was the very end of the movie when Michael Douglas' character is hitting on the other 'ghosts'.<br /><br />I'm not a big fan of Matthew McConaughey, usually I'm just indifferent to him. But I found him and his character extremely annoying in this movie. He was very unlikeable, and I couldn't find myself rooting for him at all. He didn't even look attractive - most of the time looking like he hadn't slept in days, and looked just plain horrible during the flash back to a time he had long hair. It really made me question why so many women wanted to sleep with him.<br /><br />I like Jennifer Garner, but this was definitely not one of her better movies. I think a lot of it had to do with the writing of the role. When she first sees Conner (Matthew McConaughey)at his brother's wedding rehearsal, she comes across as a nagging wife to him before the audience even knows they have a history. It was just a tad bit overdone. And as many others have mentioned, there was just no believable chemistry between them.<br /><br />I was sick of the whole story before the first ghost even showed up. The sexual wisecracks sounded like bad pick up lines, and the attempts at special effects were lame at best.<br /><br />I found myself wanting to scream realizing that two more ghosts still needed to make an appearance if it was to follow the 'Christmas Carol' theme. Luckily it looked like they edited the heck out of it and both were really short sequences.<br /><br />I would have turned the movie off if I wasn't watching it with someone who did chuckle a few times. She was rather surprised that I disliked it so much since I usually like romantic comedies, but I would rather watch "Made of Honor" than to ever watch this one again.
