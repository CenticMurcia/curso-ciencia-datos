This has got to be the worst anime I have ever seen, and I've been watching all the anime I could get my hands on for the better part of a decade. The animation was smooth, but poorly drawn and unimaginative. The narrative of the story had no logical progression, it was just a bunch of cliched action movie scenes played in a random order.<br /><br />There are no real characterisations, yet parts of the movie hinge on the depth of the characters.<br /><br />The funny part is that I hired this because it was based on a game I'd played years earlier that had a great story and great characters! Whahappen?<br /><br />Neither the English or Japanese dub matches the characters mouths - always a sign of something thrown together too quickly.<br /><br />I reiterate, THIS IS THE WORST ANIMATED FEATURE OF ANY DESCRIPTION THAT I HAVE EVER SEEN. I want that hour of my life back.
