I could attempt to review like a certain Nutball! of Movies!! And use the same exact "review"!!! Cutting...and pasting!!! said exclamation heavy!!! review on every single Looney Tunes Short!!! But that's not my style!!!... OK sorry about that but it just really peeves me. Anyways on to the review proper.<br /><br />Bugs is trying to play a classical piece for the audience, but is constantly troubled by a mouse in the piano. This cartoon is funny when taken on it's own, but very similar to "Cat Concerto" a Tom & Jerry short made around the same time with the same storyline. While this short is great, that one is utter brilliance. And this one sadly pales in comparison. This animated short can be seen on Disc 4 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2 and also features an optional commentary by Daniel Goldmark.<br /><br />My Grade: B+
