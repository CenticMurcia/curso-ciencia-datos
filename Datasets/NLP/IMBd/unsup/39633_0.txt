This movie is promoted as "splatter action" and compared to "From Dusk till Dawn", but unfortunately it lacks both action and humour. Terrible actors and not to successful attempts on funny splatter gags made this a boring one and a half hour. I had to fast forward the last 15 minutes. It wasn't even unintentionally funny. Rent Peter Jacksons "Braindead" and "Bad taste" instead.
