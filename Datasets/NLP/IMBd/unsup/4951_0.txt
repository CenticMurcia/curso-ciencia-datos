I loved watching this as a kid. It was in two parts on Sunday nights on "The Wonderful World Of Disney" or whatever name the show was using at the time. And our country (New Zealand) only had B&W.<br /><br />As a young lad, I was particularly impressed by Yvette Mimieux. Drop dead gorgeous.<br /><br />Seeing it again a few years later, it didn't feel the same but the movie is still good light entertainment.<br /><br />I guess all shows seem a lot better when you're young. Nevertheless, its better than some other stuff out there that I've revisited, hence the 7 rating.<br /><br />If I see it out on DVD on a cheap label I plan to buy it.
