Very interesting,I think. The story line is very good,the characters are just as good as they were in the series,and it answers a lot of questions that you might have been asking. It shows extra stuff about the pilots,which I liked,and I liked how they made the 'evil' person a little girl. And a BIG plus for Endless Waltz is that Relena didn't scream to Heero when he obviously couldn't hear her. I liked how they had an equal amount of stuff on all the pilots and it didn't mainly focus on Heero Yuy. The Gundams looked a lot better in Endless Waltz than in the original series,and the characters actually had a different change of clothes...But,who am I to nag how they do their job? I couldn't make an Anime cartoon,for sure,and I have to give them all the credit I can. All and all,it was a fabulous movie to watch and it was quite enjoyable.....
