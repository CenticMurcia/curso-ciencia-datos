What a beautiful story. Just incredible. I saw it when I was a little girl. It kept going through my mind. I had to watch it today. For me it's the story of God shipwrecked into our lives for the sake of LOVE. It's also the story of the church trying to tie down God (Gulliver) and He loves us enough to let us for a little while, but He knows our nature is to war and He has to stop it. So He sends His Prince to show His Glory and when His prince dies and everyone's heart is crushed and they realize the error of their ways, He lets His prince live again with Glory and romances the longing of our heart with LOVE. Precious. LOVE CONQUERS ALL!
