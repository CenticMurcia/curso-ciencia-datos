Not THAT boring, but not an Emmy winner either. It's basically the kind of film you'd expect to see on Cinemax at about 1 AM. I've never seen either of the main actresses in this film in anything else, which is somewhat disappointing. They're both EXTREMELY hot, and Kim Yates is quite a good actress as well.
