The Scary Movie series really should've stopped at 2. After that, the movies just went downhill. Now, I must admit that I did laugh a few times during 3, however this latest instalment has no redeeming value whatsoever. There is no plot (even by spoof standards) and the jokes are painfully unfunny and downright cringe-worthy. I can't believe the people who voted this a 10. They must've seen a completely different movie. And can someone PLEASE explain the 5.2 rating on IMDb to me? This movie is bottom 100 material for sure! All the jokes were in the trailer (and even they weren't that funny). I'm only hoping that 5 will be a step up from this - which should be easy because this was about as funny as watching a person snore for 90 minutes.<br /><br />My advice: watch 1, 2 and 3 back-to-back and forget this ever existed.
