-THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS SPOILERS REGARDING FILM PLOT/CHARACTERS. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED-<br /><br />...Inuyasha 3, Swords of an Honorable Ruler!!! -applause- It's true folks, from all the Inuyasha films, this film is the best of all the installments, (includes the 1st, 2nd, and the 4th) This is because the story didn't resolve around Kagome being a damsel in distress or drama in the never ending love triangle of Kagome/Kikyo/Inuyasha. No, we are finally given a story that reveals just what is special of the swords Inuyasha and Sesshomaru possess and a third sword which belonged to the siblings father that is the trouble in the story.. <br /><br />The film focuses on the 'mysterious sword' later to be revealed as Sounga, the demon possessed soul looking to conquer the lands. What's amazing about this film is the fact sounga is a demon possessed sword that can control the dead as well as fight so well that even Inuyasha and Sesshomaru aren't able to defeat without working together. but there the question is: will the siblings put their own grudges aside and fight side-by-side with the swords given to them by their father, (whom we get to see in the film briefly in the intro and conclusion), without killing each other? <br /><br />It really is an amazing film for the story line and actual character development in the film. Sesshomaru's character throughout the show has always been dark and secret, yet in the film we see more to what his father meant to him and just what kind of a person he is. Another plus side to the film is the action build-up where our heroes, along with sesshoumaru and his crew of Rin, Jaken and Ah-Uhn, along with the sword maker Totosai -i think i spelled his name right- fight the army of the dead, literally, controlled by Sounga and the man known as Takemaru. (a samurai who battled against Inuyasha and Sesshomaru's dad and lost) <br /><br />As great as this film is, it only gets 9/10 only because of one character who remains consistently annoying throughout the film in my opinion.<br /><br />KAGOME just can't seem to remember the hero's name, since she's constantly shouting/screaming/saying/whispering his name at least 100 times in just one sentence. Like, i'm glad she's no damsel in this film and actually does some ass-kicking with a headstrong attitude. But it's not needed to have someone shout the hero's name, especially when the hero is either fighting, saving someone, trying to get something done, does his own thing, or is busy. <br /><br />The old gang, Miroku, Sango, and Shippo are great too, with the role of supporting our hero. Miroku and Sango even have their moment which is really sweet to watch. So all-in-all, watch the film cause it's great from start to finish with fantastic action and a few romantic moments. A must for any Inuyasha fan.
