<br /><br />I think I laughed once at this film, watched it when I was ten or eleven, because it has a scene where one dog humps another.<br /><br />Other than that, I'd rather stab my eyes out with a biro than be forced to sit through it again. Go watch Monty Python instead, hell, even Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is better than this.
