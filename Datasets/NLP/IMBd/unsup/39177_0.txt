i think that a religious sermon wouldn't be scared... i guess this has something similar to all king movies with more than one tale... it's cinematography is very good, and acting is not bad.<br /><br />it's just that it comes across lame and very cheesy... nothing to be seen here...<br /><br />i give my points from technical aspects...<br /><br />otherwise a miss... i've seen a lot worse too, but this is not a winner.<br /><br />the rest of the lines i'll recommend some horror-movies: the brood the uninvited the entity changeling ...<br /><br />those kinda movies have some depth
