DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! It is a big waste of time. My friends and I, aspiring filmmakers ourselves, rented this thinking it sounded good, and since it was an indie film with a distribution deal, it might make for a learning experience. I wish we could have gotten our money back. First off, they used a 16mm camera that had to have been at least thirty years old, thus making the quality of the picture suck. Second, the writing was terrible, I could feel my IQ dropping. Third, these guys couldn't act their way out of a wet paper bag. Fourth, whatever money they had was blown on the menus for the DVD, and their behind-the-scenes footage was better quality than the film itself. And no, I'm not being too hard on these guys. They had something of a budget, not much maybe only a few hundred dollars, but that's more than the people I work with have ever had and our stuff is a thousand times better. I've seen better stuff come from a high school drama club. These guys shouldn't be aloud to make anymore movies.
