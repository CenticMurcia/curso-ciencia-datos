When I saw this on Cable I presumed it was from the 1960s. The animation is a bit fuzzy, and the colors and the effects really look like 1960s animation. Surprised to discover that this animated movie was from 1994! Dom DeLuise does an excellent job as the main character of Stanley, the friendly troll. The other characters are done well, and a Troll in Central Park is a nice movie, but it is very boring for children who are older than 5 or 6. There are some standard plot elements and moments of discovery.The animation for the little girl is also very good. She is amazingly sweet and innocent If anything, ATICP is too sweet and it lacks any snap or sizzle. This film is like a big gob of melted marshmallows.
