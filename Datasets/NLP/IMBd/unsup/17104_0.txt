As I am a huge fan of the original I couldn't help but judge this sequel on it and so I probably don't see it as 'fresh' as other views but even so I still found it weak viewing. From start to finish, events were rushed and meaning was scraped over with unnecessary gore  and pore gore at that. The scenes were badly cut, the score was diabolical and the script was just pathetic. There simply was no deep meaning in this film, it seems they spent so much time perfecting the CGI effects, stunts and constant similarities to the first film that they forgot the plot  the actual purpose of the crow. My advice to anyone considering seeing this movie is don't. If you still insist on watching the film and are a fan of the original, expect to be disappointed.
