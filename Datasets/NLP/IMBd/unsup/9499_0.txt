Filled with emotional issues and controversy. Past the sex, violence and other humanized circumstances that create the premise for the story, it is simply about two people... one a bad guy and gangster with emotional problems and the other a preppy college girl with a sheltered college girl... who become a part of each other's lives through what is sadomasochistic and emotionally motivated. From the beginning, the juxtaposition of opposites is obvious and the 'tough' bad guy's obsession for this girl displays the fragile emotional nuances of the human condition that can change people for better or for worst. But yet this story is hardened by the reality and living conditions imposed by the gangster, creating an uncomfortable but emotionally needy relationship between the two characters.<br /><br />A melancholy and emotional psychological thriller. I would deem this worthy of watching. The premise and situation is adult oriented but if you don't mind watching non-gratuitous sex and violence, I recommend watching this poignant gangster type movie. movie.
