Though, I did not have the pleasure of watch this movie with the sound on because it was 3am, I was able to follow along with the subtitles.<br /><br />I only watched about 3/4 of this movie but that was enough to blow me away!!!<br /><br />Not only was the idea in this movie unique, but it had lots of great action. Not really that gory though. The best part was that it was pretty hilarious. There is pretty much swearing in this movie, but it's mostly not directed at people.<br /><br />This is a great movie...You should really go see it!!!
