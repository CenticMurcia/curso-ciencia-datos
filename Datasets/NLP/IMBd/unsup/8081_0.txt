This movie was filmed at my high school my junior year!!! I remember it was so much fun filming! I am even in the class room scene...I am the girl that looks up at the clock when the bell rings...hehehe! The female leads were all really mean to us (they called us "Well-Fare Peasants") but, hey what can I say that was like 10 years ago, we were all a litter meaner in high school! I even had to make out with my boyfriend at the time on the front lawn of the school....good times!!! I will always be able to watch this movie and remember high school! PS: Two teachers were fired for doing the same thing "Coach Nash" did a few years later...talk about "art imitating life" this was "Life imitating Art!"
