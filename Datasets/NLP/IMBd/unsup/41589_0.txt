This movie could have been pretty funny and unique but two things really bothered me. Why oh why did they cast a woman for the character Perry? It's so obvious! And the second thing that bothers me even more is that at least 10 (!) times the micro is visible, which is not very professional and yet not hard to avoid... But still, there are some good laughs if you're not expecting an intelligent movie.
