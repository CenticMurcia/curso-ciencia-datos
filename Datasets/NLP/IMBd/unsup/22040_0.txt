I have to admit it. I feared this movie would be WB fare because of the actors involved and the many young audience members at the film festival where I saw it who seemed, shall we say, infatuated by certain actors in the film. The girl next to me said "Oh I love him" or similar comments every time the character Priestly came on. Because at film festivals cast and crew and their families and friends often turn up, I was tempted to ask her if she knew the actor, such were her expressed feelings of seeming familiarity with him. My husband, actually, had wanted to see this film which could be, at first glance, dismissed as a "chick flick". However, I was pleasantly surprised at the snappy dialog, good plot, fun characters, and genuine emotion that this film registered. I also loved the feelings of camaraderie among the main characters in the film. It is a heart warming film and I highly recommend it.
