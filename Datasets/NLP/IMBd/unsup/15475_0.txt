I watched this movie when I was young (around 6) and rented it numerous times when going to the video store. Now, about 14 years later I still love it and am looking forward to it coming out on DVD so I can own it. Not sure whether it was the tomboy aspect, or the fact that she had a wolf for a best friend, but it was a definite childhood favorite.
