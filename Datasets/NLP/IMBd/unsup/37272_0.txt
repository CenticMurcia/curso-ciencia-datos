With an inane plot, moronic script, half-assed directing, and, worst of all, inept acting -- in a word, CHEEZY -- you have to question why a movie like this even exists. The quick answer is sexploitation, of course, but then why not just pile on the sex, instead of complicating it with (a) a noir cliche like the crusading public servant falling into moral dissolution, (b) the enigmatic Christoid character from another plane of reality, whose name, Sam Silver, is a takeoff on the director's name? This dud was in the theater for one week before it disappeared, and when I went I was the only person in the audience! To see this was slumming and it was a guilty pleasure like junk food. The only reason I remember it is because of the unexplained pretentiousness of inserting an ill-fitting note of profundity in the person of Sam Silver, and especially, the presence of Elena Sahagun, a very beautiful and underappreciated actress. It was worth the price of admission just to see her prancing in sexy white lingerie. Please, someone, give her a major role in a well-directed quality film and let her shine. She deserves much better!
