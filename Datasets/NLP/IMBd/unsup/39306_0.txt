I saw the first one when I was about five I loved it. I would sometimes even watch it in the middle of the summer. Then the second one came out eight years later and I loved that one too. And then two weeks ago the Santa Claus three came out and wow was I disappointed. I saw the trailers on TV and in other movie theaters and I was so excited to see it and was really disappointed. The storyline was not followed and was often caught off guard. The trailers were set out for the whole movie to be about Tim Allen to figure out a way to become Santa Claus again. Ummm....wrong. He isn't Santa for a grand total of approximately 20 minutes, and then all the sudden he is Santa again. Don't get me wrong, this movie is great for little kids but not for fans of the first two Santa Claus movies. <br /><br />**Spoiler** Bernard does not appear as the head elf anymore like he did in the first two. Curtis takes his place<br /><br />Scotts son Charlie is only in the very beginning and in the very end and has only ten lines. But you do get to see a lot of Scott's niece Lucy, and Laura and Neil. <br /><br />Oh yea say hello to the in-laws!
