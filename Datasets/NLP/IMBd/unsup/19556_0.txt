OK i know most people think Disney can't make a good sequel which is generally true (no affiance 2 Disney) but this one is really good the singing is superb and so are the songs!!!!!!! the acting is pretty good this one has some of the same plot but its hard to tell en-less u really Analise the movie i like the effect mikes used for this movie. Sharpay's plan was pretty good! over all i would give the movie 4 stars **** the dancing was great new and creative!!! but a third movie *COULD* be a huge mistake but with Kenny Ortega as the directer there's a small chances for it to be a mistake!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />4 STARES ****
