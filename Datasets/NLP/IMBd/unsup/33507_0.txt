BABY BOY(2001)<br /><br />Developed and published by Columbia Pictures<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />>Die-hard fans of Tyrese, Snoop Dogg, and Ving Rhames will be pleased with this movie.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />>Most people will get the message about a half-hour into the film.<br /><br />>With the exception of Ving Rhames(just barely), all the characters in this movie suck and you really don't give a damn about neither of them.<br /><br />>People who aren't fond of foul language will probably not like this movie.<br /><br />Plot summary: Jody(Tyrese) is a 20-something slacker who still lives at home with his mother but is also the father of two children from different mothers, drives his girlfriend's car like he owns it, and basically is living off them both without a actual job. Recently, his mother got a boyfriend whom she lets move in with them, and from then on, the plot goes downhill and gets lost in a plethora of senseless foul language, shameless and gratuitous sex, and drugs.<br /><br />Review: Baby Boy starts off as interesting, but after a half-hour into the film, it feels like John Singleton just stands up and shouts "The hell with it!" Basically, the movie's message was about the main character to get off his lazy a** and take care of his responsibilites. None of these characters in this movie would be someone I'd like to know, and I don't who was worse in this movie -- the black males or the black females. On the plus side, Tyrese proves that he can act. Too bad he does it in the wrong film. In closing, I think it would have been better if Singleton did a sequel to Boyz N the Hood that takes places 10 years after the original with Cuba Gooding, Jr.(Note: Cuba's brother, Omar, is in this film), Nia Long, and Laurence Fishburne returning rather than making this movie.<br /><br />My final 2 cents: Boyz N the Hood it ain't, Baby Boy has got to the worst film ever made by John Singleton.<br /><br />My rating: 1 out of 10
