and people have been dogging me for even bothering to rent and watching this one before doing so. I'm guessing Part 1 was the better half then? Anyways, the film apparently picks up where the last one left off so it's no surprise that as the film kicks off, we notice that the invisible man is already invisible and he's going out revenging and wreaking havoc. Only this time, it's not Kevin Bacon but Christian Slater as the one scorned and trying to get even. Michael Griffin (Slater) crashes a private party and before he's done rummaging through, he murders one of the distinguished guests who turns out to be a military doctor. Before Michael pops the guy, he requests for something called a "buffer" to which the doctor tells him to track down a Dr. Maggie Dalton who is the only one who knows how to create and administer the buffers. So Michael begins to track her down, meanwhile the cops arrive on the scene and begin investigating. Det. Lisa Martinez (played by Sarah Deakins) and Det. Frank Turner (played by Peter Facinelli) are the first to arrive on the scene but to their utmost shock the FEDS arrive soon after and take over the bizarre murder case. Before they know it, the detectives are being assigned to go watch over doctor Dalton but little do they know that they're being set up. When Martinez is murdered in the line of duty, Turner takes it upon himself to protect their assignment as well as get to the bottom of the x-file-like case that contributed to the demise of his beloved partner. Jessica Harmon, William MacDonald and David McIlwraith co-star. When you see this film, you'll understand why it went straight to DVD.
