After watching Saathiya (Shaad's first direction), I had high expectations from this movie. But he proved that it was Mani Ratnam's magic (Alayai Payuthe, Saathiya's original tamil version) which helped in the success of Saathiya.<br /><br />If you are a die hard fan of Abhishek and Rani, then probably you can see the movie, but as a package, the movie falls flat. The cons are not properly developed and senior B adds to downhill of the movie. Actually I am getting sick of Sr B watching him in every other movie (though eagerly waiting for Verma's Sarkar). Aishwarya item song actually takes you to the heights of boredom.<br /><br />I must say Abhishek and Rani are superb and they make a good on screen pair (after Yuva). Only if Shaad Ali had worked little hard on the movie, we could have had 'Catch me If You Can' of bollywood.
