What the heck happened to Godzilla? Where is his atomic breath and his none Jurassic Park like personality? Where's Mothra and Gidora and his son, Minilla? Where is everything? This is not the way Godzilla was meant to be.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is dire. Matthew Broderick as the man character Nick Stutapolis or what ever the heck his name is, is perhaps the worst acting I have ever seen on film. Nothing in the movie is familiar with the Godzilla we all know and love from Japan. Godzilla is portrayed in this film as just another one of them Jurassic Park dinosaurs instead of a kick ass dinosaur that shoots atomic breath.<br /><br />I hate this movie. It is so bland and boring, and not the way an American movie remake should be. Pass on this film, people, it will make you want to beat your head off a couple of rocks and then stick your head in a microwave while you sit on a grill, because this movie is utter crap!
