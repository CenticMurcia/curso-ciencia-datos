Ghosthouse is apparently the second sequel to a film called 'La Casa', which I've never heard of. It's probably just another example of the confusing Italian horror tradition of sticking numbers after random titles so people will go and see the film. Anyway, basically what we have here is yet another haunted house flick. It's basically about a bunch of people that move into a house and find it's haunted, and then they all die in grisly ways - the usual! The film was of interest to me only for the fact that it's directed by the great Umberto Lenzi, although it came more towards the end of his career and as anyone who knows anything about Lenzi will tell you - his later films weren't his best! The film is mostly rubbish and quite boring, although there is a fair bit of gore. It's slightly creepy - and somewhat reminiscent of Lucio Fulci's masterpiece 'The Beyond'. The noise that the ghost makes (sounding something like a kid doing an impression of a frog) is creepy at first, but it's also massively overused and soon becomes old - though it may well have been an inspiration to the noise that the ghost in 'The Grudge' makes. I can guarantee that you wont give a damn what happens by the time it reaches the conclusion, and I wont recommend this film as it is the very definition of a waste of time!
