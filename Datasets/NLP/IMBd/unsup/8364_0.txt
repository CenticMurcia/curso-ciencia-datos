Any movie that features Don Knotts as a brilliant detective and Tim Conway as his faithful assistant certainly has courage going for it.<br /><br />But "Private Eyes" is better than you might expect; the setting (Biltmore Castle) is beautiful, the supporting cast (Fox in particular) is hilarious and a lot, if not all, of the gags are priceless. <br /><br />Then again, what would you expect from Knotts' above-it-all air of pseudo-intelligence and Conway's endless pratfalls and an overcoat full of pigeons (don't ask)? They're two of the old-school comedians who know what's funny and never try to go further than the jokes will go. <br /><br />"Private Eyes" works because Knotts and Conway are, more or less, just being themselves. Definitely a film worth seeking out.<br /><br />You'll laugh. Trust me.<br /><br />Seven stars. And don't drink the ink.
