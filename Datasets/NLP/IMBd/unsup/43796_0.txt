There is an excellent reason that you've never heard of this movie before. Don't for a minute let the IMDb rating fool you -- it seems clear that Manzarak's friends are the only ones to have actually voted for this. Pay more attention to the fact that, as I write this, seven people have paid enough attention to actually vote for the movie.<br /><br />"Love Her Madly" has the feel of one of those porn movies made by a director with pretensions to making a more "serious" film -- it's every bit as dull, silly, poorly written, and badly acted as the non-porn sequences in something that Jack Horner might have made in "Boogie Nights." And "Love Her Madly" doesn't even have the porn sequences.<br /><br />The script is especially mortifying, written by someone not half as clever as he thinks he is. The acting and cinematography are strictly soap opera stuff -- to amplify that a bit, strictly Latin American soap opera stuff. One should anticipate cringing in embarrassment on a regular basis on behalf of everyone involved in the making of this. That's not what I call my brand of entertainment, but your mileage may vary.<br /><br />Perhaps unsurprisingly, a former member of The Doors knows a beautiful girl when he sees one, and there are periodic sequences involving the simply stunning Jennifer Lothrop undulating scantily clad (for artistic reasons, of course). Let it suffice to say that this is strictly, and I do mean strictly, for those who can't get enough of Lothrop on FX Network's "DVD on TV" program, and the movie will test the endurance of even these fanatics should the sound actually be left on. <br /><br />Others may find themselves resisting the urge to blow their brains out after about ten minutes of this. A must-avoid film.
