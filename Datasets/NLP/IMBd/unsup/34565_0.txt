I'm starting to wonder whether some of the comments below are genuine... I'm a big fan of South Park, but this is pitifully bad. The one joke that made me smile ("show me a sign.. any sign!") is lifted word for word from a far superior Steve Martin movie. As for the rest... it's painfully unfunny.<br /><br />The only other thing this movie has going for it is cameos by a number of real-life porn stars; but when there's not so much as a bare breast on display, what on earth is the point ? Stick to adult movies if it's bare flesh you want to see, and rent one of the early Zucker bros. movies if you want to see a genuinely funny comedy.<br /><br />A total waste of time in my opinion.
