At first I did not know there was going be a Cinderella 3; but after I watched it, I thought Cinderella 3 (as well as 2) are great sequels for everyone: kids and adults...like me.<br /><br />It has great animation and music and also I thought the voice casting was very good; Tress McNeille was great as Anastasia and Jennifer Hale as Cinderella. I love it when the mice,the birds and the Fairy Godmother throw a party for Cinderella and The Prince, since it's the anniversary of when Cinderella put on the glass slipper, and married The Prince. Another scene I love is when the two mice (Jaq & Gus) tell Cinderella what has happened by role-playing, it's very cute.
