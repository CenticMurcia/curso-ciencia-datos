as a high school student subjected to watch this film by an extremely intelligent teacher, im ashamed that he would choose this to show to us. it is so boring, so poorly acted, and so poorly filmed admist many a blue-screen and black and white images that don't fit in at all. now i know i sound like a teenager, but i usually like this stuff. this was horrible though. churchill annoyed me to no end and lithgow as f.d.r. was just annoying. stalin, hes a funny man.<br /><br />"uncle joe" "i think ill leave now"<br /><br />are you kidding?<br /><br />1/10
