This movie isn't complicated, in fact it really doesn't have a plot other than the illegal cross country car race, but it's fast-paced and entertaining throughout. I've always been a Burt Reynolds fan, but Dom Deluise and Dean Martin in particular are hilarious. Roger Moore's parody of his James Bond persona is also amusing and it's great seeing 2 of the 3 Rat Pack members(Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr.) share so many scenes. Also starring is the gorgeous Farrah Fawcett and even Jackie Chan has a role. Some of the best scenes are those involving Dom Deluise's alter ego Captain Chaos often referred to as "him" This movie wasn't made to win Oscars, it was just intended to entertain and it does.
