Amusing movie. No doubt. At the first time I see somebody shout Italians. Anyway Italian starts be boring in the crime movies.<br /><br />Movie is very balanced. Love be twin him and her is so real. Like you are inside. All actors are real. Usually actor are fake, more dump than fake. but in this movie I can't see any fakes. Producer know the job. Have a sense.<br /><br />The quote I like: If they go in Europe, that doesn't mean that they are good fellows!<br /><br />My ten points. <br /><br />Best.
