'Dis', meaning fog, supposedly refers to the director's cerebral condition at any stage of the production process. This cannot possibly be called a piece of work as the intra-skull fog is miraculously transmitted directly to the screen. If there is any content at all in this thing, apparently deserving the label film because there is movement on screen, it is garbage. No kidding, garbage takes actually up the screen in a pivotal scene, a love scene actually. Don't get me wrong, it doesn't mean that this is a peak, because there are no peaks, no pace. In line with the title this is an endless piece of uninteresting sceneries, desperately seeking excitement in so-called exotic places. You have to be prepared for it, because you will be bored and at best bewildered if you're not watching it for the purpose of entertaining yourself by the ridiculously crappy lines (or lack of them), direction, photography, cinematography, edition, idea. The masterpiece is that this low-budget film got any funding at all. My vote must be 1, but with this remark: The bottom end of the scale is way too kind in this case, but by all means: this is absolutely fascinating.
