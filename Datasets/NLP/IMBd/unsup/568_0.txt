But this movie is freaking amazing. it has guts gore and LAUGHS. the reason why i laugh during any horror movie is because how creative horror movies are with killings. this one was like super creative and awesome i love this movie every one who likes comedy needs to see this movie its awesome. Also all the actors are freaking cool and nice job pick hot chicks I'm just saying. One last thing "Horny the Clown" awesome name by the way.
