Apparently, most people who have reviewed "The Touch of Satan" here only saw the "MST3K" version, as the original version is too crappy to watch. I now add my name to that number. As with most of the movies featured on that show, it's a litany of incompetent dialog, poor direction, and a barely comprehensible plot. No wonder Mike, Servo and Crow had such a hilarious time with it! The lousy excuse for a plot has a young man - named Jodie! - hooking up with a farm girl who (surprise, surprise) turns out to be the Devil. But most of the movie consists of scenes in which one person talks and then the other person takes WAY too long to answer. There's that and inexplicable usages of "Amazing Grace" (that one British Parliament member outlawed the slave trade for THIS?!). Oh, and the girl's grandmother looks like, to quote Crow, an overcooked turkey.<br /><br />In conclusion, the movie on its own is a total zero, but the "MST3K" version is 10/10.
