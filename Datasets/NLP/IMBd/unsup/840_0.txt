A holiday Romance tries to overwhelm us with sentimentality. Like most sentimental films, they sometimes annoyingly tug at your hart strings. <br /><br />However, "sappy" would not do this movie justice as an overall consensus of the film. The movie will hold your interest, and certainly does contain more than one dimension to the story-line, and most importantly to the characters. Besides the romance that is brewing between McRaney and Judd, the film also conveys the importance of music in our lives, and does a proper job in expressing its virtues. More importantly the film makers for "A Holiday Romance" point out how instrumental a single individual can become in our lives, especially to children.<br /><br />Also, an extremely nice inclusion, is the much loved Andy Griffith as McRaneys Father.<br /><br />By-the-way, Naomi Judd looks absolutely great in this film, you would never guess that she is two years McRaney's senior.
