Charlie Sheen stars as a scientist who discovers that there really is "life out there." The only problem is that it's not out thereÂ—it's here, and they're covering up his discovery in hopes of remaining incognito.<br /><br />This movie plays like a cheap sci-fi movie of the 30's. The only difference is that there are better special effects in the 90's. It wasn't a bad film, but I find that it WAS worth waiting 13 years to see it. I have seen some thrillers before and I didn't find myself holding my breath, sitting on the edge of my seat, or anything like that. I'm a fan of Charlie Sheen and I think Teri Polo is cute, but that's about as far as this movie goes.<br /><br />3 out of 10 stars (and that's a gift).
