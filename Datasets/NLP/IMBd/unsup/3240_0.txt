Mighty Peking Man was done in the seventies after the last Godzilla film of the original Godzilla series (Terror of Mechagodzilla, 1975) and this totally takes up the slack. It's even at least as entertaining as the last Godzilla films easy. It's a rip-off of King Kong and Godzilla but never tries to be anything more than it is, and that's what makes it honest and fun.<br /><br />The miniatures is this film are fantastic, especially near the end where the giant is walking around the city and elevated roadways. The action even starts early, no waiting an hour for the monster's first appearance. This is one of my personal fave giant monster films, definitely gonna buy it on DVD! This even had a recent successful midnight run here in New York City. Don't miss it!
