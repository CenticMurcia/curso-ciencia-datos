this is the funniest mob movie ever made. robert de niro and billy crystal are sensational together! they should star in another movie together. how can we forget the scene in the bar where de niro tries to explain why he cant get a "hard on", or jelly and billy crystals little conversation in the washroom. this is a great movie, and i recommend it to anyone who wants a good laugh!
