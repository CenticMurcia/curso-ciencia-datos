I will not spoil anything and just say the truth : This is an outstanding Vietnam war movies, and that for the following reasons : - Great acting, very "real", makes you feel you are right there in Vietnam with the soldiers - Great directing, especially in the tunnels, which feel very claustrophobic.<br /><br />In conclusion, a great war movie. Very personal as opposed to enormous with thousands of soldiers. <br /><br />I think BOLL just had really bad scripts and did what he could with them. With tunnel rats it was his own ideas that really came out and he did a great job.<br /><br />Please watch and then rate. Don't just think "Oh a stupid German director" and miss a great movie.
