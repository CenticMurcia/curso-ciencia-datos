This movie presents itself as a sweet family comedy with futuristic premise. This drivel encompasses every clich√© in the family comedy repertoire, the writers did not even bother to recycle the lines!<br /><br />Despite Adam Sandler's best efforts to make it palatable, the overused jokes, the stereotyped characters that could have been easily replaced by cardboard cutouts, and the cheap humour do more then murder the movie, they bury it 60 feet under as well.<br /><br />This movie, in my humble opinion, should be watched in the same manner the lead character views his life, with the finger firmly on the Fast Forward button. It is a shame to waste one's time on watching this, it could be better spent on shoveling manure, the end impression is the same.
