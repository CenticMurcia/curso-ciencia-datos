Okay, no Oscar bait here. The only question is whether this exploitation flick is bad enough to be good. In my book, there're not enough campy moments to qualify for Ed Wood territory. The trouble is middle-age actors Compson and Oakman are simply too accomplished and get too much screen time to bring down the material to subterranean levels. The young couple qualify with some truly sappy moments and bad acting, but unfortunately those are overcome by their two elders. For the voyeur crowd, which includes myself, the girls' underwear conflabs are more like sorority get-togethers than a bunch of hookers exchanging tricks of the trade. Too bad. AhhÂ…nevertheless, there is that one brief shining moment when this really shapely little number comes out of nowhere to peel down to pasties and fringed g-string that makes the whole 70 minutes worthwhile. I love the bad lighting that made the scene look like an out-take from a stag film. I suppose the producers figured they needed to deliver more than chatty escorts and naughty innuendo to the balcony crowd. Anyway, I'm sorry to say that this cheapie just isn't distinguished enough to enter that rarefied circle of demonic druggies, promiscuous teens, and wayward women, otherwise known as 30's camp classics.
