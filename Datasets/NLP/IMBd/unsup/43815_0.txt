I'm baffled by the number of people who actually liked this movie. How anyone can watch this crud is beyond me. Aside from the blatant attempt to cash in on the popularity of Arthurian legend (this story has nothing whatsoever to do with King Arthur, despite the use of some recognizable names), this movie is just plain terrible. There's nothing worse than a bad movie that passes for a good one. The campy "B-movies" of the '70s and '80s were bad and everyone involved with them knew it. First Knight could fall into that category, but it doesn't. It's just bad. The look of the film rivals some of the best after-school specials of the time period. When I came across it on TV, I thought it was an episode of J.A.G. until I saw Sean Connery. The script reminded me of coffee commercials and the acting aspired to such. What was up with that swinging sand bag and sword "gauntlet" thing? It looked like it should have been the thrilling climax to "Revenge of the Nerds VII: Nerds in Camelot." Avoid this stinker like the black plague.
