Although I love this movie and the way it was filmed and the fact that finally someone told the truth about Tucker, I am still a little saddened. Being a Michigander with a fierce pride in my home state, I find it more than a little disturbing that Mr. Ford-Coppola, a Michigan native himself, would take no opportunity whatsoever to use the beautiful and rustic scenery of Michigan in this film. Almost the entire film takes place in either Michigan or Chicago, and yet it was fully filmed in California. Shame, shame, shame.<br /><br />I know some would say that it doesn't matter where a film is shot. But think about how you would feel if something important happened in your neck of the woods and filmmakers couldn't even be bothered to get certain details correct. It is frustrating, because I find this happening all the time with respect to Michigan and its cities.
