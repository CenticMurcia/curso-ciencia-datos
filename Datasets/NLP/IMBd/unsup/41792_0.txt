This movie will only appeal to five year old's. It is so lame, and completely dated by now, that it can only be seen as a historical document. The sound effects are so over used, you will scream 'shut up!' at it. Serious needs to go to comedy school for a couple of years, for he needs to learn that a lizard that makes a dinosaur noise isn't funny, and that being literally kicked out of somewhere and accompanied by a voice saying "and stay out!" isn't funny. There have been a lot of great Australian films, and this isn't one of them. I kind of feel a bit sorry for Yahoo Serious, I mean, anyone will a name like that has to have issues in the 'being funny' department. 3/10.
