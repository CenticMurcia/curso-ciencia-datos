Well well well, if it isn't the movie with the most laughable name ever? The name "American Cyborg Steel Warrior" makes you think of an non-serious hardcore action science fiction comedy, with cliché after cliché after cliché after another cliché. It isn't. The baddest thing about this movie is that it tries to be serious. HA! A movie cant be serious if it have that name this one has.<br /><br />This movie is full of clichés from movies like Mad Max, Terminator, Cyborg and Universal Soldier. And that, if anything, makes this movie laughable. If it have clichés from b-movies starring Jean Claude Van Damme... I mean, those movies ARE clichés, and if you then have clichés from them clichés... well, you understand.<br /><br />If the budget would've been bigger (or at least better used), the clichés fewer and the name another, then this movie could've been OK. Since that's not the case, it isn't.
