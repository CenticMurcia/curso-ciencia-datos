I first heard Noel Coward's play as a radio drama on our local listener-supported radio station, and I immediately started searching for anything I could find out about it. When I found the movie, I was overjoyed.<br /><br />This movie provides a sympathetic portrait of a lifestyle that is the true orientation for many people. However, most of these people cannot come out of the closet in our society. It is very refreshing to watch a movie about a triad that does not end in disaster.<br /><br />I have identified as polyamorous all my life--even before the word was coined in 1990. It is hard having an "outlaw" relationship orientation, because most people who hear of it misunderstand it. (It's not about lots of sex, for instance. My favorite time in my life was when I was the second male in a triad, a very rich and satisfying life.) <br /><br />Anyone reading this who is in the closet and wants serious information about the polyamorous lifestyle can Google the word "polyamory" for more links than you'll be able to read in a year. However, I recommend the following as the best places to start: <br /><br />Two organizations that have provided guidance and information for years to this movement are the World Polyamory Association and Loving More Magazine.<br /><br />For a historical review of how this lifestyle has fared in a mostly hostile climate throughout history, read: Three in Love: Menages a Trois from Ancient to Modern Times by Barbara M. Foster, Michael Foster, Letha Hadady. The three authors of this book are a triad that has been together for almost three decades.
