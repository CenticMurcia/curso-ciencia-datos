Oh, what can I say about this movie. I only watched half an hour, and it was the worst I've ever seen. The movie has been re-sold because of Leslie Nielsen's success with Naked Gun, but this movie is very bad. - I feel sorry of Leslie Nielsen, but this movie deserves 1/10, the budget must have been very small.
