PWT! Poor White Trash! the must ridiculous movie i have ever watched. It was so unbelievably pathetic, inadequate, and so lame! the story line was stupid, the characters were DUFF! Geoffrey Rush did not to well. The ONLY thing i liked in this movie was his quote: "So much for a Ph.D in engineering!" but that could not save such horribly boring ridiculous stupid lame material. And how did the patients come out of their "cells" to attack Vaancut or whatever his name is. And how did they manage to stab 3 (three) 18.9 mm long pencils THROUGH his neck in ONE drive? And then again, the pencils aren't long enough to get all the way through still being able to have a grip on it! By the way, how come there were tv monitors everywehere? Nothing had been changed in it! Why didn't they use the guns? Why didn't they stick together? Don't watch! Bad stuff for kids! (I'm one..) 13 years old. I love Kubrick and Spielberg!
