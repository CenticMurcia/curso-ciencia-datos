For a lot of movies I don't gauge my appreciation by emotional impact. For many genres you do not want emotional impact--science fiction, action, adventure, etc. But when I see a drama and the story or events are so gripping that I get involved with the characters and cry for them and with them, then that is a really good movie.<br /><br />And if a movie can make me share a character's despondency and weep for a while, then that it is a GREAT movie. It is art.<br /><br />//Spoiler Grave of the Fireflies has made me weep for humanity. A child should never have to yell at an adult, "where the hell can I get food?" and get nothing but stares blank and empty. The image of this, followed by the malnourished girl smiling at her last taste of watermelon before driftng off into death sleep... Overpowering.
