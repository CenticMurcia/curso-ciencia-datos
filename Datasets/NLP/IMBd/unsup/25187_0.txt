I just wanna say this was an excellent movie to finish the series of the hockey mask killer, i can tell it was excellent because i am the greatest fan of Friday the 13th!!!. I was really anxious when i was going to watch is buy the first time, it really surprised me with things the others movie didn't have like Jason going body by body.<br /><br />The part i really enjoyed was when Jason got into the police station and defeated all the cops, then when he got into the restaurant and everybody was shooting him. Ja JA JA!! But no bullet can stop him.<br /><br />I really liked it, now i can wait for the new movie of Friday the 13th: "I hope it to come this year". I also i am the biggest fun of nightmare on elm street and if this new movie is a sequel between Jason and Freddy much better!!!!
