I saw this wonderful movie in the early 70's with my best friend Sally at the age of 20. We cried so hard! Through it we discovered John Denver's music and it influenced us deeply in terms of appreciating nature, love and life. Sadly, several years later, a close friend of ours, Kathy, then lived the story, so similar it is haunting, she died in 1979. Her daughter is now pregnant (due late 3/2K6) and so wishing her mother was with us to enjoy and experience her grandchild. I think of this movie quite often, the characters, the story, the lessons, the beauty. It affected me deeply and probably always will. I was touched to read so many others with such similar reactions. Hearing John Denver music always reminds me of it. There is a line in his song, "Home Again" in which he sings "Your mother called last Friday, "Sunshine" made her cry" that I am pretty sure refers to the movie. I have no idea if the movie would hold up to my profound memories of it but I would love to see it, own a copy. I just emailed nannysue33@hotmail.com and am waiting for an answer to see if the movie can be obtained. Has anyone found it? I would love information! I don't think they make them quite like this anymore.
