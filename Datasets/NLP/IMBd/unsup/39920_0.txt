Me goodness!! That was by far the crappiest piece of junk I have ever tortured my senses with. Here's the plot: ----------<br /><br />Here's the story: ---------<br /><br />A careless "the-devil-may-care" french street bum keeps running around aimlessly through mostly train stations or airports, constantly being asked for his passport... then running again... and so on...<br /><br />There's the occasional blurred flurry of faces bothering the viewer's every nerve fiber... and again, the running...<br /><br />Just multiply the above for an hour or so and voil√†! French crap (suzette) at its best!<br /><br />PS: If a certain sheep-look-a-like (goes by the name of Catinca) tries to convince you to watch this flick, just slowly walk away...
