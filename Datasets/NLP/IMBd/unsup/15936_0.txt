I thoroughly enjoyed this movie from beginning to tragic end. I recently took a trip to France and had the privilege to go to Versailles. I watched the movie not really knowing anything of the history of Marie Antoinette. When the movie ended I rushed to the computer to check historic facts and was amazed that the movie was so factual with the exclusion of the Tyrone Power part.<br /><br />I have to say I love old movies and especially historic period pieces. This was not a let down in any way, with the exception of a little over the top acting by Norma Shearer on some of the dramatic areas. The costumes, hairdo's, sets, casting and everything left me feeling like I had just seen a masterpiece.<br /><br />I so enjoyed the movie that my plans for tomorrow have come to a screeching halt, as now I plan on going to see the 2006 Marie Antoinette.
