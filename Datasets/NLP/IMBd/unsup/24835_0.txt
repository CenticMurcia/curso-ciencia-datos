Dazzle is an enchanting balance of light-heartedness and innocent humor.<br /><br />Surprisingly, the movie is cleverly woven. Nice touches include Tom as an author of children's books about faeries as well as Shakespeare's fairy play within the play, Midsummer Night's Dream.<br /><br />The gnomes Oddkin and Bodkin impart amusement, keep the comedy cheerful, and provide balance for the mildly menacing antagonist, the Collector. <br /><br />Melissa is disarmingly charming. Tom and Crystal share a believable chemistry. Ms. Martinet adds a touch of complication as both the skeptic science teacher, rival love interest, and, ironically, the school play director. Tom's publisher and son help with unobtrusive story exposition.<br /><br />The movie is warm without being maudlin.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
