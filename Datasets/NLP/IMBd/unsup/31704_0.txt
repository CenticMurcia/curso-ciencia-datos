The motel scene(shot in Wichita, Kansas on South Broadway) was filmed across the street from where I lived. In one shot you can see my house and the bar next door. Being a curious person, I wandered over early in the morning to see the "movie stars" up close. Was I surprised! Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr did not look too good in the early morning light with no make-up and in their bathrobes. In fact I had to be told who they were. I loved the movie, by the way. I did enjoy watching all of the people and how they worked with other. And Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr looked a lot better after a couple of cups of coffee and some make-up. I recommend this movie to anyone.
