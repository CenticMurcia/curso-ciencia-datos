"The Adventures of the Young Indiana Jones" have every bit as much of the fun and excitement as the Indiana Jones movies.<br /><br />Unless I am mistaken, I do believe that this episode, when aired on TV, began and ended with a segment featuring a very old Indiana Jones. On the DVD, this segment is missing.<br /><br />In the final scene, the very old Indiana Jones is looking at an exhibit on the October Revolt, commenting that the exhibit was incorrect.<br /><br />A museum employee, assuming that the old Indiana Jones is just an old fool who doesn't know what he's talking about, asked him what made him so sure that the picture was taken in July, vice October.<br /><br />He replied "See that blurred smudge? That was me!"
