Leslie Howard who has been brilliant in nearly al his films (esp The Petrified Forest, Of Human Bondage, Pygmallion, Teh Scarlette Pimprenel and of course GWTW) realy gave a stiff, false performance in this 1939 movie that he himself co-produced with David o' Selznick of the Gone With The Wind (1939) -- I'm thinking that both their creative juices were at a major low --- this movie was so insincere and contrived and lacks any universal appeal that makes movies "classics". Sterotypes Galore -- and poor, souless dialogue for a supposed deep romance/drama -- poor Ingrid Bergman -- she doesn't have much to work with -- but thank god she stuck around -- bc this swedish beauty could not only act -- she could steal your heart! Anastasia and For Whom The Bell Tolls are proof of what a great range she had! So don't judge Selznick, Howard or Bergman by this piece of crap!
