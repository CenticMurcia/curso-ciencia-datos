Man, this is everything I want while watching a Spaghetti Western, great characters, a solid story, superb action sequences, and best of all a fantastic score that is the just the icing on the cake. Corbucci basically redid "The Mercenary" (which itself was a good film, IMO one of the finer Italian westerns out there) which is all fine and dandy with me, back with Franco Nero as a Swede and Jack Palance as a one-handed pot smoking maniac with a falcon. Can't get much better than that. Palance chews and spits out the scenery, watchable throughout and always entertaining. I was sad he wasn't in the majority of the film. Nero/Milian have great chemistry and just look natural up on the screen, going back and forth with one another. The film never lags either, it goes by quickly and probably could have been three hours and I wouldn't have noticed. Franco Nero looks so natural killing various Mexican-Italian (Iexican?) soldiers with a chaingun. The score just puts a smile on my face anytime I hear it, catchy stuff. Morricone is always reliable. I think Corbucci was vastly underrated because he happened to make movies in the same vicinity as Leone who seemed more likely to pick and choose from various American westerns (even though he's been orally serviced by too many people, I still do like his stuff) whereas Sergio Deuce pounded out some westerns that I think truly compete with the best of Mr. Leone. All and all, I was satisfied at the end and had a cheesy smile on my face throughout the running time which cannot be achieved easily as my facade is rarely penetrated by anything that isn't of the highest quality. This is the full package as far as the Italian westerns go.
