Unfortunately this film made me reflect on a good friend who was married just like Harry Hamlin(Cameron Thomas),"Strange Hearts",'01, and had a nice family, good job and made a nice career for himself and family. However, just like Cameron Thomas, he was not able to stay faithful to his wife and family and ran after every woman he could find. This is a dreadful illness and leads to many other problems which this film portrays. Lisa Rinna,(Joanna Thomas),"Good Advice",'01, finally found out about her husband and went through a living hell. Cameron promised his wife Lisa, he would try to straighten out, but wound up looking at Porno on the Internet and just simply could not do anything else but fill his brain with SEX. If you have a friend or family member like this, get them HELP!
