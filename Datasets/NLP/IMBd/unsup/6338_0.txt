Limbos a great picture. And I must say the special edition DVD is well worth a purchase. The movie, while being fairly lofty in content, is nonetheless very accessible given the the audiences predisposition to honest engagement and unbiased scrutiny. I say this because it is well known on the circuit that this is Mr Ikimi's first picture. Therefore a less sympathetic viewer may approach it with certain preconceptions. <br /><br />How good could it be? As I say, well worth a purchase. A moody feature with a serious message. Not meant for the pretentious art-house regulars but, as I said earlier, an honest viewer. If you fancy a bit of a mind massage and the odd giddy heart fluctuation, try this one on for size. Respectfully made and diligently executed Limbo will not leave you disappointed. At a disciplined 93 mins approx, Limbo hits hard and true. With the chilling score by the acclaimed maestro Anthony Daniels constantly urging one through Limbo's relentless mind trip, you will be left asking yourself; 'Where has Thomas Ikimi been all my Life'?<br /><br />The Final Soldier.
