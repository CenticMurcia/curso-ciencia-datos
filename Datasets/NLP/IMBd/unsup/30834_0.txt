I've seen the other shows like this, SNL, MadTV, etc, but this was the best while it lasted. I check YouTube weekly to see if anyone has upload an new clips from it. My favorite feature was Tommy Blaze doing the news, and my favorite skit was the Sesame Street muppet political skit. I think Bert had received the nomination and Ernie was begging him for a job in his administration, but Bert had since distanced himself from the cookie and milk addict and was trying to brush him off. It was truly hilarious.<br /><br />I don't know why the producers don't put the shows on a DVD. I'd pay 20 bucks for it, and I'm cheap.
