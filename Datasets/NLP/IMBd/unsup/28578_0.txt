Sometimes this gave me and my friend Andrea a real scare (it 's VERY suspenseful), it's always pitch black outside and you never know when someone might pop out at you! There are many puzzles and they're pretty tough but so I found the built in hints VERY useful! I fully recommend the Pandora Directive, but don't think that it's something quick and easy! It has 6 CD's for a good reason... It's long! :)
