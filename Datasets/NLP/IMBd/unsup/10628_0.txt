This is one of my favorite films. <br /><br />Terribly sincere, talks about relationships and silence, about how doubts and questions not answered can turn love in death or slow suicide and about how everything comes to pain. <br /><br />But is not a sad story at the end. The role of young Martín (Hache), perfect and tender Juan Diego Botto, as the real survivor of the script, turning sour into sweetness, and insecurity into strenght, even though he's lost in hesitations, is a message of faith in life.<br /><br />The dialogs are intelligent and sharp, the actors, gorgeous. And I fell in love with Martín (Hache) for the rest of my life.<br /><br />Thank you, Adolfo Aristarain for such a great, sensitive, risky and intelligent movie and thank you, Federico Lupi, Cecilia Roth, Eusebio Poncela and, specially, Juan Diego Botto for your incredible work.
