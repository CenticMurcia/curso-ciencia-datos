It is nice to see films like this are being made, and are getting to the public in some way or another. This film has won several awards and nominations from Film festivals around the world. The independent film is a story of two youths who meet up traveling west for very different reasons. Through their encounters with different walks of life on the highways and train trails of America they form a bond. This film is as true to life as we're willing to admit and makes the story one where anybody can relate and take something from. Paddy Conner who plays Albert is amazing and funny. He keeps the film, which can be very serious at times, light hearted and you'll find yourself chuckling through out the entire film. Maurice Compte, who plays Freddy gives a strong performance as a troubled teen, with the weight of the world on his shoulders. Every character in this film, no matter how brief of a role, has a depth that Hollywood films wish they could emulate. All in all this is a great film that you will love to watch and absorb. I recommend this film to everyone, no matter what your taste in film this has it all, humor, sadness, stunts, lovable characters, hated characters, and even a dog...can't go wrong with that combination can you? Look for it...it'll be worth it.
