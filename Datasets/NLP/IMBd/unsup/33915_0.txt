I laughed once during this movie, when Dr. Meecham (Howard Duff) - heading to the basement of the mansion as the powerful storm strikes - says "It's like the last 10 days of Hitler!" Perhaps, although I think the last 10 days in Hitler's bunker were probably more interesting. "A Wedding" isn't a bad movie. In a strictly voyeuristic sort of way it's even mildly interesting. The title explains everything. The whole movie is about the wedding of Dino and Muffin (Desi Arnaz, Jr. & Amy Stryker) and the reception that follows at the groom's home. The two families don't mix well, and the movie basically portrays their interactions. There's no real consistent plot to the story; just the account of the two families mixing. There's the senile bishop who conducts the wedding, the death of the family matriarch, an unexpected pregnancy and an unexpected love at first sight moment, but there really wasn't any one central point here. Neither was there anyone who stood out to me as being the real star of the movie. This was definitely an ensemble cast, with Carol Burnett as the bride's mother being probably the best known, and a variety of other actors and actresses who, in years to come, would become better known (Pam Dawber, Mia Farrow, and Dennis Franz leap to mind.) There's a very small role for the famous Lillian Gish as the matriarch who dies near the start of the movie (although her body stays front and centre through the movie.) In general, the performances were all pretty decent. The movie is too long, with a running time of a bit over 2 hours, and while the first hour seemed pretty well paced, the whole concept got a bit tired after that. 4/10
