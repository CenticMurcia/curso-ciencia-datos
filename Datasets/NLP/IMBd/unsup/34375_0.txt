Can you say bad acting, ludicrous plot and silly special effects? I couldn't believe the miss-timed explosions and outrageous filming where the good guys can't miss and the bad guys couldn't hit the side of a huge barn in the final battle scene. Anyway if you want a film to avoid, this one is it. Laughable to the max!<br /><br />1 out of 10. And I'm being generous.
