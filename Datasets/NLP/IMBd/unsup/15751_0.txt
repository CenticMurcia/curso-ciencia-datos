Geez, I LOVE this movie. It's got just about everything a great (sort of) B-movie needs: Killer dolls, caged women rock bands, a psycho dwarf with an eyepatch, an assassin/clown/ordained priest, and, of course, a crazed billionaire with a shrunken head. Like the tagline says, 'Revenge, lust, and Dolls', all in an hour and a half.
