I had the honor of watching this series about 2 years ago. I rented all 3 yes 3 DVDs from blockbuster and was not disappointed. The visuals are amazing, the characters well drawn and designed, the technology is well thought out as well. Its a simple story about human nature and how far someone will go to return home and to stand up for what they believe in.<br /><br />This series is why I love anime, Of all the anime series out there this and berserk are my favorite. initially I was struck by just how beautiful the whole thing looked and I like the idea that a kid can be a main character and not make the show seem fruity or childish like so many "made for America anime" some of that is o.k. but I really like more serious stuff:)
