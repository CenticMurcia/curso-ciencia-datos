Very melodramatic soap opera about a lonely small town gal named Lulu (called "old lady four eyes" by a couple of local boys) who longs for romance, so takes her savings and sails for a two-week vacation in Havana. She soon meets a drunken Adolphe Menjou who has ended up in her stateroom by mistake - romance ensues. Now here's the rub - it is quite awhile after she has been seeing this man (and they have fallen in love) that she finds out he has given her a fake name - and is married! A baby, plus many more twists and turns to follow.<br /><br />Well, this is a well-done film, with absorbing plot - plus Barbara Stanwyck gives a real star performance here as Lulu - acting up a storm, she's just great and really helps make this film a good one. Now, there's some things in this film that seem a little nonsensical or odd to me - Lulu is first seen as a sort of librarian/spinster type - but quickly changes into a smartly dressed, attractive lady when she leaves on her trip, and never changes back (the original plot element abandoned). The wife, described as an "invalid" who Menjou is forced to stay with and care for, is first introduced using a cane (just barely) - but she is at all times seen as completely strong and capable (hardly an invalid). And the biggest thing of all is that I really question some of the decisions and sacrifices Lulu is willing to go through all for the sake of this one man - mainly the fact that she seems so ready, willing, and able to leave her child and abandon her role as the child's mother so extremely easily! All in all, though, I found this to be a fine film, well worth seeing.
