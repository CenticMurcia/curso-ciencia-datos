I rented this film because of Angus MacFadyen, who did such a great job in "Cradle Will Rock." I am also very impressed with his work here. "Cranes" is a story about the many complicated facets of coming out, keeping secrets, sharing life with others, and being true to yourself. It has a richly thoughtful plot, and some of the sweetest love scenes I've seen. It's definitely a must see for gay/queer/rainbow folk, and those who want to understand a little more about coming out.
