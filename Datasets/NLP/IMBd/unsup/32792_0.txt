This film is a self-conscious, derivative mistake with both writer (O'Connor) and director (Nettheim) displaying self-indulgence without the quality usually associated with such behaviour.<br /><br />This was a movie desperately uttering the dialogue of countless pop culture movies seen from Kevin Smith, Justin Kerrigan, and even Quentin Tarrantino to a lesser degree. Why clone? And why do it so badly? I think Anthony O'Connor needs to try and create characters that are fleshed out and interesting - not just saying 'clever' things. The dialogue was, in a word, try-hard. The only thing that came out of anyone's mouth were the writer's words. He needs to develop. To do more with the characters, instead of showing his smugness. He needs to show us he can create interesting characters. Ones that express *authentic* feelings about themes in the film: getting over love, friendship, alienation, obsession... with some true insights - not shallow punchlines in the guise of enlightenment. An immature effort all round. Good for showing amongst the makers' friends as a laugh - not in a cinema, please!
