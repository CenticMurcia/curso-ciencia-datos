Honestly now...I read the comments before i watched this feature film, and I must say that I am glad I paid little to no interest in some of the posts i saw prior to my actual viewing. One must wonder what some of the so called "critics" use as the fundamentals for judging when they view different genres of movies.I mean come on now...it's a MARTIAL ARTS MOVIE...what we want to see is martial arts action...if you want a great plot then go and watch a psychological thriller or a drama. However, this is not to say that the plot of the feature film was at all empty, as I would say that the plot was far more fulfilling that our glamorized "Onk Bak". The action in this feature was definitely entertaining, and the special power aspect gave rising to that of "Kung fu Hustle" while still retaining a realistic point of view.<br /><br />To summarize it all I would say that any martial arts fan or action lover will definitely agree that "Dynamite Warrior" surpasses the expectations beyond that of satisfactory. I rate it a solid 7/10 after all was considered, as it managed to give me a feeling of euphoria after my viewing....something which rarely happens. Do enjoy.
