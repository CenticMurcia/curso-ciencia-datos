There is even less that is original in this film than in Gus Van Sant's remake of Psycho. "Far From Heaven's" story, cinematography, set design, costumes, actors' appearances and music are virtually identical to Douglas Sirk's "All That Heaven Allows". Does Todd Haynes have no voice of his own? The film crosses the line from homage to plagiarism. The only innovations here are to make the gardener black rather than white and the husband gay rather than dead. Sirk's concerns with female sexual desire and inter-class romance, have given way in Haynes' remake to the over-discussed issues of racism and homosexuality (yawn). I give it a 1/10 for Haynes' lack of imagination.
