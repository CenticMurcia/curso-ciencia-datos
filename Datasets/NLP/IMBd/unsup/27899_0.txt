Adam Sandler comedy is very much an acquired taste, however if you like films such as Road Trip, Deuce Bigalo (by Sandlers Production Company Happy Maddison) or Tom Green or Jackass humour I would highly recommend his films. Also if you have liked any of Sandler's other films then Happy Gilmore is a must see. Although not as mainstream as Big Daddy or The Wedding Singer, Happy Gilmore is the funniest of his films to date. There are so many good lines in this film that it continues to be amusing watch after watch and for the first few viewing had me almost in tears at some points. I have now seen this film too many times to even count and could probably recite the whole script along to the film, however it is still funny every time I see it. Truly the funniest film I have ever seen. 10 out of 10.<br /><br />(N.B. if you liked this film then be sure to see Billy Maddison as well)
