I thought that this film was absolutely fantastic. It was very impressive to see Lindsey play the part of two different characters. She had done this in the parent trap movie but never before has she pulled off such a great performance. I went to this movie hearing all of the negative comments but left the film thinking the critics had surely missed the point of this great thriller.The use of symbolism in the film such as with the blue rose was nothing short of artistic brilliance.The ending was also superb as we find out that it was the piano teacher. I had a great time watching this movie and I sincerely hope that viewers do not miss out on this one.
