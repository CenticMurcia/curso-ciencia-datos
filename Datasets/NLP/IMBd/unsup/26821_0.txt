This documentary is a hoax that does not reveal itself as such.<br /><br />To say that it is well done is an understatement.<br /><br />It flows and has credibility throughout and could be compared to the Sting.<br /><br />If you are a New Zealander and see this without knowing it is a hoax then you will be bitterly disappointed to find out later.
