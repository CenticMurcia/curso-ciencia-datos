Bunuel is amazing the idea that all of this could be real is awesome. This movie is what i would call out there. he comes up with the most twisted ideas and yet if you think about it isn't so twisted it makes perfect sense. Everything you see in this film, could possibly happen or is happening somewhere somehow. This film is brilliantly made and has great stories and the transition from one story to the next is fantastic. This film will really make you think about the idea of freedom and what you would do if you had all that freedom. At one point or another we have thought of something so bazaar and placed it realistically in our minds, we keep it in our minds of coarse, but not Bunuel, he has mixed up reality and come out with an alternate reality.
