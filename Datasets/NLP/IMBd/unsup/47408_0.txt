I watched "High Kicks" as part of the 10-movie DVD set called "Women Who Kick Butt". No doubt if that's the first film of the set you watch you'll be disappointed, but if you watch it (like me) after such atrocities as "Death Run To Istanbul" or "Flight To Danger" it seems comparatively better. The female lead takes her role very seriously and gives a convincing emotional and physical performance (she was stunt-doubled in some scenes by Michelle "Mouse" Krasnoo). The acting of the men sucks, but at least they seem to know what they're doing when it comes to martial arts. And although the film was cheaply shot on video, the camera-work is decent. Of course there are a lot of things that could be improved. The script is short on logic (how do they always manage to find the villains so easily?), the fight choreography is sometimes clumsy, and there should have been more action - the climactic fight, for example, should have been longer than 1 minute!
