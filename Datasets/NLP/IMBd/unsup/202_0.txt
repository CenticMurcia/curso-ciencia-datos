It took me a long while to rent out this film due to the fact that I suspected it to be a "in it for the money" release. Basically, the film studios knew they had a good license here and wanted to milk it for all its worth, regardless of quality. A good example of this kind of capitalistic thinking would be the Highlander or Robocop movies. But, when after reading the credits in back of the case I realized it had been written by the same author of the first film (Ringu). This was enough justification for me to shell out my hard earned Â£3.75 and take a risk on it.<br /><br />I had expected (in true Ring formula) , dark claustrophobic sets, classy underplayed acting, a slow forbidding plot line, intermingled with sudden jarring frights to keep you on your toes, that eventually build up to terrifying climatic end. What I didn't expect to watch was a tragic love story of the person we had all feared in the first two film encounters (sadako). Don't get me wrong, this is still a creepy film and throughout there is always a sense of dread and fatality especially with the romantic plot line. While watching I had a fear that it was just going to be a Japanese "Carrie" clone. But although there are similarities this is still very much a unique film. As a prequel should , it answers questions and fills in gaps that lead the audience perfectly into Ringu with a greater understanding of the characters and events that are to take place (George Lucas should take notes).<br /><br />All in all a very well directed film with a talented cast and a great story.
