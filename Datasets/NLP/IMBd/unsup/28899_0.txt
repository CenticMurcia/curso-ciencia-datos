There are so many things to recommend about the film "Penny Serenade". This is a heart tugging yet not sappy story of a couple who realize they need a child to keep them together and their only option is adoption. The Cary Grant character starts off wanting nothing to do with children and ends up having his adopted child being his raison d'etre. There are many familiar yet well executed themes: adopted children can be just as loved as birth children; you don't have to have lots of money to be a good parent. Another thing that is very impressive about the film is a unique film technique for its time. The plot is revealed through flashbacks which happen while the Irene Dunne character is playing phonographs: the record spins and dissolves into the scene from the past. I found this transition technique quite effective and ahead of its time. The other thing that stands out is the casting of the young actresses that play their daughter. All 3 are adorable, but not in an annoying, mock precocious, Shirley-Temple way. Finally, this film is billed as a change of pace from the Dunne-Grant comedies like "The Awful Truth" but the awesome truth is that this film has hilarious moments. Grant is is fine comic form, especially in the early morning feeding scene. You can find the DVD "Penny Serenade" in the bargain bin at many stores which in a way is an insult but a great opportunity for you to add this great film to your DVD collection for pennies.
