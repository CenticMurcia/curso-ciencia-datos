A horror movie about killer frogs?? I had to check this out. Well, it was a waste of rental-film money. It committed two unforgivable horror-flick sins: 1 - it wasn't scary; 2 - it was downright boring. <br /><br />Why was I not surprised the frogs weren't scary? Why did I think because Ray Milland was in it, it might be good? (Boy, it's sad to see a man of his "Lost Weekend" stature wind up in films like this in the '60s and '70s.)<br /><br />It was interesting to see such a young Sam Ellliott, who I am used to viewing as a bearded, weathered--faced cowboy over the years. Elliott was in his '20s and had mainly done just TV work prior to this movie. He sure has come a long way from "Frogs!"<br /><br />The worst part of this movie was the first 20 minutes in which absolutely nothing happened. Hello?? Nice to way to grab your audience, eh? Actually, this whole movie is just way too bland. <br /><br />I've always thought frog legs were a delicacy and I like frogs in general but this movie is terrible. I am embarrassed for Milland, who I have always admired as an actor.
