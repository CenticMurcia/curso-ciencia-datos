If anyones ever compared this film to SLC punk, Id have to agree.<br /><br />If I ignored the manipulative horrible ending, Id recommend it for Kids under 20 yrs old.<br /><br />Through the first half I found myself droning along with a bunch of perfect skin, conditioned hair Sh*ts fresh out of a teen hunk magazine, supposedly living in a punk squat. (though I enjoyed seeing John Savage from 'Hair' ...ect)<br /><br />The second half I guess there were a couple giggles.<br /><br />Do show it to your 14 Yr old Kid who's getting into politics.<br /><br />If Your Kid is getting into punk, show him 'Dogs In Space' instead. (this is coming from a 26 yr old)<br /><br />I wont give away the ending, but it could make you sick in the way that makes you wish you hadn't wasted your time.
