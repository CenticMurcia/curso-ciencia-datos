I'll admit, like many on this message board, I was duped. I looked past Bob Saget and saw Samuel L. Jackson, Whoopi Goldberg, Christine Applegate, and Mo'Nique. I know, I know--how stupid of me for not picking up on the "Full House" alumni that are also in the credits. When you burn you learn.<br /><br />This could have just as easily been written by a quarantined group of pre-pubescent boys under the influence of whippets. You'd have to jack hammer the gutter to find traces of what they pass off as humor. It was crass, gross, juvenile, and seemed a hell of a lot longer than the run time would have you believe. Potty humor, fart jokes, genitalia, and a sprinkling of the "F" word are the crux of all intended laughs in this schlock. And don't get me started on the editing--had this been an AV project at your local high school, it would have been laughed out of the most remedial of classes.<br /><br />I had been wondering what happened to Saget. He should go back to wherever he was hiding and stay there until he passes 8th grade.
