Mifune's last song is a typical Danish dogma film. I am amazed that the film is announced as a comedy too. But where are here the comics? In think in our owns brain. It's a beautiful film which shows the conversion of everybody in the film to a real, not hypocritical, life. And when Kresten is laying down his head in the center of the open circle in the fields, he encounters the light which his disabled brother has used as a symbol that "light" is coming from heaven.And this light of live had disabled hitherto everybody until that moment.
