Can anyone tell me where I might find The Dave Thomas Comedy Show (1990) in either VHS or DVD to purchase? I thought the show was excellent and particularly enjoyed the skit with "The Frightened Brothers" which I believe included Martin Short, Chevy Chase, and Dan Akroyd. I saw this show on television over 10 years ago. I thought it was one of the funniest television shows I have ever seen. Dave Thomas was undoubtedly one of the most creative comedy writers out there. I would have enjoyed watching another one of his shows. I am pleased to have found this web site for matching actors/actresses with movies and television. Two national retail chains suggested that I contact IMDb for further research. Thank you for providing such thorough research. I hope to hear back from someone soon. Thank you.
