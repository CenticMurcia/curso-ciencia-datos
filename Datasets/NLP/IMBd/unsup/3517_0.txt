Malcolm Lee hit the nail right on the head with this movie. The casting was perfect, everyone did a beautiful job with this movie. Taye Diggs was able to show more of his dynamic acting abilities. Nia Long who played as Jordan Armstrong acted the part as though she lived it every second. Nia is definitely a work of art. Morris Chestnut really impressed me. He is a very talented actor, and after this movie he should be offered a wide variety of acting roles. So, go out and treat yourself to a well produced movie, you'll definitely leave out feeling happy and satisfied that you did.
