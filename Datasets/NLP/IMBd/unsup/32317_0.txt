I notice that this series & some others that are linked to it -- Bosom Buddies (Peter Scolari) Mary Frann, describe the series has having 3 or 4 episodes, when we know that the show ran 8 seasons. It is hard to figure out who Bob's wife was in the later show ("Newhart") because of this. Mary Frann was in a wide variety of shows, and her entries all seem screwed up -- the same with Peter Scolari, credited with three episodes in "Newhart." William Sanderson -- "Larry" -- a regular (and famous) member of the case -- three episodes??<br /><br />Are you letting a computer do some of the editing?<br /><br />Enquiring minds want to know, <br /><br />Rick Z.
