All ironies aside of old entertainment has-beens making a film about being old entertainment has-beens, allot of Molloy's comedic magic pre-2002 seems to have gone walk-about in this epic tale of the original 90's boy band getting together to once again make it big.<br /><br />The premise could have worked if the irreverence of Crackerjack had been carried through, but it seemed more like a cynical money-spinner with few genuine laughs (some great concepts) and a somewhat rushed story line - a little strange that in the first half hour Robbins convinced a bunch of people he apparently hadn't seen for years to drop whatever they were doing in their own lives and join his quest to live in the past.<br /><br />If you're a fanboy of Molloy/Robbins, then there may be some value in this flick, but for pure entertainment value Boytown falls short. I in fact walked out of this after 40 minutes to catch a second screening of Children of Men in the cinema besides, the only thing keeping me from feeling ripped off.
