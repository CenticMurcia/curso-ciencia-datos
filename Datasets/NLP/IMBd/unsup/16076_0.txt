This was painful to watch as a Godzilla fan. There are five main reasons. 1) It was 'mushy'. (Godzilla is in all of us!- the stupid little girl) 2) The one fighting sequence lasted way too long. 3) The plot was not really that good. 4) The special effects looked like animation. 5) The character setup sucked. They either came or went quickly or stayed around to the point of exhaustion. I guess there's six. 6) the fight was commentated...*shudder*. Better alternatives include: every other Godzilla movie. nobody even died in this movie. I recommend watching a completely different movie. I think I'm going to retch just thinking about this crappy movie. Please may the studios who did this stop and go out of business.
