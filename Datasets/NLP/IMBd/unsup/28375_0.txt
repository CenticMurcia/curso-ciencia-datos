A small town girl Hazel Flagg (Carole Lombard) has become deadly ill of radium poisoning.Or that what she thinks until her doctor, Enoch Downer (Charles Winninger) notices he has given a wrong diagnosis.A reporter called Wallace Cook (Fredric March) starts writing about the "doomed" woman and wants to take her to New York with him.She doesn't want to go spoiling it all by telling the truth but instead packs her bags and her doctor and it's off to New York.Some falling in love happens along the way.David O. Selznick as the producer and William A. Wellman as the director.James H. Street behind the story and Ben Hecht behind the screenplay.Oscar Levant behind the original music Nothing Sacred (1937) is a fine example of a good old time comedy.This is very screwball.The lovely Carole Lombard shines in the lead.In real life she died way too early but she did make herself a screen legend during her time on Earth.Fredric March makes a great male lead opposite Carole.Just watch their funny fist fight in the movie.And this is a romantic comedy! Charles Winninger is hilarious as the boozing doctor.Walter Connolly is brilliant playing the editor named Oliver Stone.Jerry Lewis and Dean Martin starred the remake of the movie in 1954.The title that time was Living It Up and it was also awfully funny.70 years hasn't done any harm to this movie.It's more like a fine wine and gets better with age.Not that I'm an expert of wines.
