This movie was skewered by the critics as unfunny and unoriginal. I love this movie. It is not laugh out loud but it has it's moments. We see flashes of Mike Myer's brilliance in it. To see Myers play his father with that pompous ethnocentric Scottish lilt is worth the dvd alone. The funniest scene is when the father relates his conspiracy theory.<br /><br />The best lines in this movie are when Myer's and his cop buddy discuss Mrs. X (which should have been the title of the movie; it would have played out better). Tony says "Charlie, does Harriet even know the lines of "Only You"? Charlie replies, I don't know we haven't reached the all too critical only you phase of our relationship, so I'm afraid I can't be much help." You have to appreciate context to appreciate the deadpan delivery of these lines. Nancy Travis is sooo cute. She has the Sandra Bullock effect. Travis makes you think, h'm she could actually be my girlfriend. It is that fresh genuineness that very, very few actresses have. Anthony Lapaglia's interactions with Alan Arkin are hilarious.<br /><br />I have to give a thumb way up for this movie. Give it a chance, it will grow on you.<br /><br />A 7/10 movie.
