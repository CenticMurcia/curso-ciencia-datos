I usually do not go for westerns, but this one looked rather good on the trailers so I gave it a try. It exceeded expectations and was a good movie to me. I thought it could have cut a few scenes here and there, but all in all it was very entertaining. Though I highly doubt all the things that happened in the movie happened in real life as claimed by the makers of the film, I think the guy this movie is based on was probably a good story teller. This one has a cowboy whose specialty is long distance races going to the Middle East to race there because they do not like the claim that he is the best long distance racer there is. Which is fair enough considering it does not look like there is all that much desert terrain in the United States. This race is very dangerous and it makes you thirsty just to watch it. Of course there are many trials and obstacles along the way including his fellow racers who hate the idea of a Mustang horse competing in the race. Though you know a Mustang has to be a rather fast and strong horse because they named a rather good car after it. All in all a very good action movie that the entire family can enjoy.
