none of the stories were very interesting, none of them drew me in or made me care about anyone in them. it was very implausible and unrealistic. very choppy. and nothing was resolved at all. very predictable. i loved 'grace of my heart' but this one was very disappointing. john taylor looks great though, god bless him...
