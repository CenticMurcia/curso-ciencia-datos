I remembered that show from when I was a small kid. After each episodes, some friends and I played ninja outside in the woods near their house.<br /><br />I remembered key scenes like when The Master plays dead on the hotel room floor and I remembered Max's van.<br /><br />I recently got the series on DVD from Ebay. What a ride! It was as I remembered. A great show full of adventures. Typical of many shows from the 80's it involved the heroes dropping on some trouble or someone in danger in a random town...<br /><br />If you have the 80's nostalgia or are a ninja movie fan, I recommend seeing this show.
