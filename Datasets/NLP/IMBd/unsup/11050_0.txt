Loving Evangeline:<br /><br />I have seen this film a number of times and I think it's a good one, unlike one comment that did not like it at all and wished others not wasted their time on it, I also think that beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. <br /><br />People should make their own minds up if they like or don't like something, in this case a film. If someone says, don't watch the film because....! It is their opinion and their dislike not yours. make up in your own mind if you like or don't like. Critics most always try to get you to change your mind and sway towards the negative aspects about a movie. Reminds me of the news we see on TV, most always it's about bad things 90% through out the news cast. What about the good news !<br /><br />I like it! what about you..<br /><br />Dave THP
