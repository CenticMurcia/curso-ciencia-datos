People who find this film boring, clearly "don't get it!" It's not an action, sci-fi, mystery, or horror film. It's not "pop" film making to achieve "box office success". It's a piece about the "art" of filmaking, about style, and use of color and lighting. It's also about elements of personality and relationships that we don't find easy to look at or admit to. It's a brilliant film by one of our most brilliant filmakers!
