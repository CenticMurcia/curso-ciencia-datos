Caught this on PPV, and was bored out of my skull from the first 10 minutes! I suppose Streep and Thurman were trying to "pay it forward" by helping a budding film maker. But calling Ben Younger a film maker is like calling Dick Cheney a crack shot!<br /><br />Where do I begin? The cat is let out of the bag WAY too soon. The paintings are too expert. Dave says what Pie Guy does isn't funny, but they stay buds. Dave ditches his girl hoping to scoring with Rafi. Rafi's gay friends reek of ugly stereotypes. Dave throws a fit because Rafi expects him to act like a grown-up. Dave is over Rafi the second he hits the dance floor. Rafi gets cheesed when she learns Dave is dating. Pie Guy finally gets his, but we don't see him get it. Just as Dave decides to get serious, Rafi dumps him.<br /><br />Bryan Greenberg: do humanity a favor and go back to your day job! I SO wanted Uma to go into "Kill Bill" mode, and shred this no-talent twit to ribbons!<br /><br />About the whole "stick with your own kind" thing: maybe 50 years ago, but nobody cares today, certainly not your therapist. Lisa is not only a bigot of the worst sort (Dave bristled at taking his black girlfriend home, knowing Mother would not approve), but she's totally unprofessional.<br /><br />If Younger can get a budget and A-list cast for his pedestrian, misogynistic "comedy," then there's hope for those with actual talent!
