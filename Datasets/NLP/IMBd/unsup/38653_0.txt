It's been a really long time since I've wanted to stop a movie mid-way through and bring it to the store to demand my money back. This movie made me want to do that. The repetition of random lines from scene to scene was probably supposed to be poignant, but it didn't even make sense. This movie is a disjointed mess. Obviously whoever made this movie has some friends in high places because I have no idea who would think making this movie was a good idea. And how in the heck did they get so many decent actors in this movie? Also, the preview was totally misleading and made it seem as though the movie was actually going to be interesting and not a snail-paced confusion. Maybe you have to be a smoker to understand this movie? It's only redemption was the Cate Blanchette vignette.
