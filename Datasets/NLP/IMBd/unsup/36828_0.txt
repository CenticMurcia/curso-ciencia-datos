This movie was absolutely horrible. The plot could have been half-way decent, and the movie tolerable if they had simply developed the characters better and hired people who could act. I was excited at the prospects of an independent movie focusing on the life of Indian Americans. It was a subject not often shown and had the potential to be very interesting. However, too many plot lines that were not fully developed and poor acting made 102 minutes seem like 4 hours. At the end I hated all of the characters and was happy that they had made their own lives so miserable. Do not watch this movie. Steer clear from it in the video store!
