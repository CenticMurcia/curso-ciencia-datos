Writer/director Moussa Sene Absa shows how modern day(1994) Senegal reacts to having French and American culture thrust upon the native Wolof people, specifically in Popenguine. Absa does a great job of showing the struggle by focusing on two groups of teenagers each with their own idea of cool, and own take on these new cultures entering Senegal. While the groups each try to impress a group of girls with different techniques the townspeople struggle with the change they see in their youth. I think Absa dose a wonderful job showing the infiltration of French culture by using Mr. Benoit, a French school teacher who forbids the children from speaking their native language in his classroom. <br /><br />Ca Twiste has an interesting story, and sometimes surprisingly good acting from untrained actors and actresses, but suffers from a slew of continuity problems. Lighting changes several times during some scenes, and costume can also be seen changing in a few cases. For someone who has a good grasp of subtitles and foreign movies, Ca Twiste was actually a pretty easy watch. There where some spots where the speaker was speaking so fast that the subtitles remained on screen for only a fraction of a second, not nearly long enough to read through.
