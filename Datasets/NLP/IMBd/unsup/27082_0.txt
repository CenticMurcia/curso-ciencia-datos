This flick will pass the time, and Kurt Russle is always interesting to watch, but JEEEZ is this one clich√©d. Every standard suspense element is there:<br /><br />1: Several scenes where you think the killer is coming, big scary music, then it turns out to be someone else. Ooooh, I'm soooo scared!<br /><br />(spoilers ahead, I guess)<br /><br />2: the good guys girlfriend ends up s the final target. gee, never woulda' thought of THAT....<br /><br />3: Oh heck, why waste time listing them all. I have already taken more time with this review than the production team took making the movie.<br /><br />The score is absolutely hilarious. It goes from nothing, to Hitchcock-on-steroids about fifty times. Might as well have a narrator shouting "here comes something scary! hear comes something scary!"<br /><br />Russel and Garcia manage to come off OK despite the hackneyed script. However, Mariel Hemmingway makes a fool of herself with her overacting in the end. Well, at least she shows her tits in the requisite, early shower scene (gotta' get that "R" rating, after all.) Big woop.<br /><br />I can't say I'm surprised that Phillip Borsos only directed two more films after this one.<br /><br />Don't go out of your way to watch this, though as I said, it WILL pass the time. I've seen MUCH worse.
