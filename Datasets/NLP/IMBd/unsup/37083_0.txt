I thought a lot of this movie was unbelievable. I realize the main character had problems, but really... who goes skinny dipping just after meeting their fianc√©'s parents for the first time. The movie didn't leave me feeling anything but disappointed. The plot had a lot of potential but didn't reach that potential. I did like the way the characters were introduced and at first I had no trouble getting into them, but again, as the movie progressed, I couldn't understand what the characters were trying to do. In general, I like movies where characters don't act rationally, but with this movie I couldn't create any explanation for some events and the main character isn't completely insane so I should have been able to follow some type of reason. I don't recommend this movie to anyone.
