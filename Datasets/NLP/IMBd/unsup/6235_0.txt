Romero is easily one of the best films made in the 1980's. The film is astounding. It is in fact very depressing, but shows the cruel and unusual ways of the San Salvadorian government in the 1970's. The film is violent and sometimes disturbing. I showed this film to my freshman classes at school, and they were somewhat disturbed. The main reason this film is so good, is Raul Julia's performance. His role as Oscar Romero really gave light to the film, and also impressed many of my students. His assassination scene is handled very well. Great Film. You must see this wonderful adaptation of you are to get the truth of what happened in Oscar Romero's life. <br /><br />Rated PG-13 for Strong Violence, Language, and some Sexual References.
