This movie is the most terrible, dark, and frightening children's movie ever. I watched it when I was young, and it traumatized me! I recently watched it again (I'm now 15) and I can still see why I was so afraid. It is so creepy and dark. It's like Nightmare Before Christmas minus the humor. The villain is beyond scary, and the the little limping man who follows Snow White is extremely creepy. Maliss can turn into a dragon, which makes a frightening screech, and brings bad memories flooding back. Every time you think there's going to be a moment of happiness, someone gets turned into stone, or a dragon picks Snow White up and carries her away. Even at the end, the sky is still dark, and you see odd creatures made of stone surrounding them. The highlight of the movie is Thunderella's song. It's the only cute thing in the movie, even though it is all about her unsuccessful attempts at controlling the weather. If you get anything out of this comment, DO NOT let your children watch this.
