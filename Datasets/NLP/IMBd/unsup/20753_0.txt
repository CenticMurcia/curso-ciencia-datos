When I rented this film, I did so on a whim, also because I knew a lot about the production from talking to many of the people who worked both on and off camera. I didn't expect much. In fact, I expected it to be bad.<br /><br />I was happily mistaken.<br /><br />This is one of the best modern tragedies I've seen in a long time. The fact that it wasn't a totally happy ending and that the main character paid for his crimes, even after trying to make everything right was poignant and well said.<br /><br />I'd hire Tim Folsolme to direct any day.<br /><br />The production value was very good and editing imaginative. The fact that they pulled this entire producion off with about 20 shooting days really testifies to the talent of the director, cast and crew.<br /><br />Bravo to picture me rolling productions and the best wishes to Tim Folsome - I can't wait to see your next movie.
