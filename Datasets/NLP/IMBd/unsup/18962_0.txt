(Hopefully there are no spoilers, but I'm not sure and may let something slip)<br /><br />After watching this film several times, I cannot imagine why it was not presented in theaters. It is an engrossing film set in an era that shames America and her reputation as a free nation. It is set during the cold war when the government was seeing reds under everyones bed.<br /><br />Jeff Goldblum is wonderful as Herb. The whole cast is very good. This film points out how while the government was out hunting Communist, they were behaving exactly like the Communist they were so worried about and feared.<br /><br />Everyone should view this film. It could happen again. Freedom of speech should not be taken lightly.
