The other reviewers have said it all. One of them said that he gets choked up every time he watches it. So do I. In fact I got choked up reading his comments. When I was in 7th grade, (so many years ago) I saw Sid Caesar in a movie called "Tars and Spars" In it he did a sketch called "Wings over Bermerschnitzen" I stayed for a second show and came back the next night and memorized it. Now 57 years later I can still do it. Needless to say every Saturday I was glued to the TV watching "Your Show of Shows" Even though I was at an age when I should have been out chasing around. So when I see a truly outstanding movie based on these people, I am doubly touched. <br /><br />I have heard that Dick Benjamin is an extremely kind and gentle person. That must be true as Benjy tells Alan, "nobody's that good an actor without the courage in himself" Well to Dick Benjamin I say, "Nobody's that good a director without the heart in himself"<br /><br />As you watch this movie, IF YOU HAVE A HEART IT WILL BE TOUCHED!!!!!!
