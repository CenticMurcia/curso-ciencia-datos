I may be going against the grain here, but I found Almost Heroes to be one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Granted, it's not a thinking mans comedy, but it's Chris Farley funny and that's what makes it a great movie. Full of silly humor and hijinks, this movie is laugh out loud funny the whole way through. Personally, I thrive on stupid humor and this movie is a plethora of it. If you are into movies such as Eyes Wide Shut or The Piano, I might shy from this film. However, if you can't get enough of Chris Farley and love movies such as Tommy Boy or Dirty Work, this movie is for you.
