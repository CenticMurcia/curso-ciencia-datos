Is this vintage Bette Davis film w/ Barry Sullivan available on VHS or DVD? Also in the cast was Jane Cowl. I hope it hasn't been destroyed somehow or someone has film rights. Please advise on current status of this good film. "Another Man's Poison" is a film done within a year of this one. The subject of divorce is well documented in this Davis classic "Payment on Demand". I know this film has not aired on any TV networks. I am wondering when it was last aired since its initial release. I know Davis fans are wondering what became of this 1951 film. "A Catered Affair" is another Davis film that has not received a lot of air time but I know this has been re- released since its debut. I procured "Mr. Skeffington" recently in DVD which was a treat having the director comment on making this film w/ Bette<br /><br />Respectfully, WCM
