This thriller has Tarantino`s forged signature written all over it . It starts with a funky monologue which instantly revives memories of Tim Roth in a certain film . Add to this a shock revelation of a couple of villains who aren`t who they appear to be , some novelty violence involving a jealous wife and a coffee grinder , a running joke about a suit being ruined and the bizarre site of a member of the clergy tooled up . I was expecting someone to come out with a line about " I`m stuck in the middle with you " and the homage would have been complete . <br /><br />The other thing that struck me was this could only have been a HBO production . I didn`t know this at the time but later finding out it was made sense . Have you ever noticed watching an episode of OZ there always seems to be a sudden upsurge of profane dialogue in the slower episodes ? It`s almost as if the producers of the show have got round a table with the writers and said " Okay we`re pretty low on shankings and gang rapes this week so can you make sure the F word appears at least three times in every sentence just to indicate it`s an adult show " . Well in STILETTO DANCE when people aren`t getting blown away or getting limbs chopped off the characters often seem to revert to ridiculous amounts of swearing . I can`t really emphasise how false the dialogue sounds in these scenes , especially the bit where the police captain is explaining the plot to the two good guys in the car park .<br /><br />One final comment . I know Eric Roberts career is now a bit of a joke starring in cable and straight to video films such as this , but he really does deserve much better and I look forward to seeing him play a memorable screen villain in a blockbuster someday
