So ignorant it could be true if it wasn't so stupid. Pumping baby beasts, sick and a waste of time and brain power. Actors were needing a payday so the producers must have felt sorry for them. Film had no plot just gorry action that was at a D level. Executive Producers must not have anything else to do than this. Where did they get the creatures from, the Bruce Willis movie about the future cab driver that used to be a soldier but now helps the savior of the world? To be a horror film of Wes Cravens this is awful. Where did his style go? His artist touch? Man I don't know how many things I can write bad about this film just to get 10 lines . Well ONE MORE TIME, this film is awful, gross and substandard.
