Kyle (Jack Wagner) is a police officer who doesn't seem to have any partner but his crime-fighting dog, Hunter. The adorable canine loves doughnuts as much as the next man in blue but truly is talented at sniffing out trouble. One night, Kyle and Hunter are tracking an outlaw when the dog runs ahead of his partner. With an evil glint in his eye, the bad guy shoots the poor dog and mortally wounds him. Although Kyle takes him to his usual vet (Daphne Zuniga), Hunter doesn't make it, making both owner and doc weep profusely. However, a short time later, Kyle is surprised and delighted to find that the "ghost" of hunter is haunting his digs and trying to communicate with him. Trotting off to a medium, Kyle participates in a seance that virtually drives the dog's spirit into the seer's adult male son. From that moment, the young man acts like a dog but speaks English and tries to offer advice on how to catch the villain who shot him. Can they find the evil one? This movie is just ridiculous. The idea of a ghost dog is not bad but to have him inhabit the body of a human and parade around like a character from the Jungle Book is simply stupid. Wagner, however, is a looker and so is Zuniga so there's that. Also, when the dog himself is on the screen or his friends, animal lovers will be happy as well. The sets, costumes and production values are fine but nothing makes up for the preposterous premise. That said, if you love animals and or cool looking guys, you might want to get this one for an evening's diversion. But, it is almost a certainty that you will never watch the blasted thing again.
