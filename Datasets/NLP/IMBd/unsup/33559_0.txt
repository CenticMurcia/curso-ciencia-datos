Have to give this flick 1*, despite it being fascinating in terms of the presentation of Ms. Frey, and the wholly-vacuous lack of any qualities which would evoke empathy from any character.<br /><br />Obviously presented from Amber Frey's perspective, and given her basic intellect, one can only imagine how many uncredited editors and ghostwriters, I failed to see anything of depth anywhere in this presentation.<br /><br />You have a young unmarried, "roundheel" mother, from somewhere in the, say, lower quartile of the lower middle class. This remains evident even when all the occurrences depicted here were unfolding, <br /><br />Story now skewed in her behalf, it's also boring as well. Later information indicated the man whom she purported to believe was her daughter's father, and had been paying a moderate amount in support, wasn't the real dad. While going through all of the emotional stress stemming from her Peterson affair, she then becomes pregnant from a male friend who is supposedly there for support. He indicates he's in no way ready either for fatherhood or marriage. Amber then rejects the possibility of an abortion, portraying herself as a caring, nurturing person, but is now ready to deliver a second illegitimate child (after the first, whose father was improperly identified for years).<br /><br />And we're asked to believe this woman, with limited intellect and apparently a poor manager of birth control issues, is somebody to be admired? Come on!<br /><br />Apparently she is now married to a corrections officer, operating a Fresno spa facility. The proceeds from this story - again, skewed markedly in her behalf - undoubtedly provided a nice piece of change for her business and bank account. <br /><br />The real tragedy here is that despite the young woman and her unborn child who were viciously murdered, we're subjected to being asked to sympathize with this vacuous, promiscuous, uninteresting woman, who in the end profited far more from this whole gruesome chain of events than anyone else involved - and far more than she would ever have realized, otherwise, from her limited qualities and talents.
