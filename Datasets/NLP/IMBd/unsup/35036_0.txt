This movie seemed like it was written by someone who had seen too many "spring break" movies of the 80's, yet they wanted to do something "serious" -- no gratuitous sex/nudity, etc.<br /><br />Honestly, the only reason I watched this movie was because Mark Harmon was in it - for like 3 scenes. I always wonder why celebrities would appear in such bad movies. Hard to believe that Mark Harmon is THAT hard up for work. Maybe this was a favor to someone?
