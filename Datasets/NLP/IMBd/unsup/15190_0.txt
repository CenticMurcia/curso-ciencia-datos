Eric Roth (The Horse Whisperer, Suspect) has written great scripts. The Insider kept me watching, and grabbed my attention. Very well written and with a great cast "Lowell Bergman" Al Pacino (The Godfather, Looking for Richard) is a great character. I remember something about the incident. Russell Crowe (Gladiator, Proof of Life) is a very good actor. The man he plays "Jeffrey Wigand " is very smart, has a lot of knowledge about the cigarette industry, and who was willing to come forward to tell that the cigarette industry was in privy that cigarettes are addicting. Well, not to put the character down, but I believe that everybody knows that. The entire world knows that... Why don't they do something about it, you've guessed it money! Why they decide to destroy the life of Wigand is beyond me because the whole world knows to be true what he was going to say anyway. But they destroyed him, and the movie is about how he was followed, stalked, terrorized. and so on. When I was young I also believed in changing the status quo, but after having gone through severe trials because I am outspoken I have learned to keep my mouth shut. Is it good, that I have learned that? Not sure! But for some reason sometimes even describing the obvious in the world is an impossible thing to do. Why? I don't know. This is an excellent movie which I recommend. My favorite scene: Is a conversation where Lowell Bergman states: "You'd better look into it, because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious." Favorite Quotes: Jeffrey Wigand: "I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials." Lowell Bergman: "To a network, probably, we're all commodities. To me? You are not a commodity. What you are is important." I recommend this movie. It is excellent.<br /><br />
