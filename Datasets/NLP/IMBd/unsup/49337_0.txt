Yes, it was you, you are closed minded (And I realize the topic name makes no sense)<br /><br />IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A "NORMAL" MOVIE LEAVE THIS ONE ALONE! Also, it's no good for pornography (you'll just feel dirtier) If you didn't understand it or thought it was pornographic, you're probably a "normal" person(and/or haven't seen a good porno), and thats okay. The meaning is explained pretty well by some of the other posts if you need help. <br /><br />BUT I JUST WANT TO SAY...the people who REALLY GET the movie probably wont be affected by it in the way that the writer intended. Because they would already have so many of their own ideas about American culture. And they would probably say, "Yeah? So?" <br /><br />Does this make sense? <br /><br />My Boring story I watched this on Cinnemax and I thought it was the newer movie by the same title, which a friend had recommended to me. If you've seen this movie, you could imagine my surprise. At first I thought my friend had some issues. I soon realized of course, that it was a different movie. Ha ha hmm<br /><br />I gave it a 2 because I got through the whole thing. Its more captivating than Matrix 3
