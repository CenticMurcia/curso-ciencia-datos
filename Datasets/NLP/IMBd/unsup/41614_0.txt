Ronald Reagan's third film as Secret Service Agent Brass Bancroft finds him going undercover into prison to ferret out a gang of counterfeiters. The original assignment just had him trying to get close to the distributor of the bogus dough to find out where the plates are. Little does he dream that the stuff is being printed in the prison print shop along with the prison newspaper. <br /><br />This is kind of like White Heat where Edmond O'Brien goes to prison to get close to James Cagney to get information on some real crimes Cagney and his gang were pulling. But believe me, Smashing the Money Ring will never be confused with White Heat. Reagan's going undercover, but they don't even bother to give him a phony name.<br /><br />It was an interesting if far-fetched idea for a story, but this was a B film that got that kind of treatment. Part of the plot called for Reagan to be shot after a prison break by the big boss. It was at fairly close range, but it turns out Ron was only wounded and after being dumped into a lake with the getaway car, he swims away and the next minute you see him without a scratch.<br /><br />I have to wonder if Reagan's mind didn't hearken back to those days at Warner Brothers when in 1981 he was really shot. Doctors instead of scriptwriters saved the life of the 40th President of the United States. <br /><br />Ron was ably assisted by a cast that included Margot Stevenson, Eddie Foy, Jr., and Joe Downing as the crook Reagan was supposed to get cozy with. Interestingly enough Eddie Foy, Jr. as the sidekick got to romance Margot Stevenson. With Ron it was strictly business in this film. Maybe that had something to do with Eddie's brother Bryan Foy being in charge of Warner Brothers B picture unit.<br /><br />Counterfeiting while in stir, who'd a thunk it, the brothers Warner that's who.
