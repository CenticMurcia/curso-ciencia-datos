As a great fan of Dwight Yoakam's music as well as his acting performance in "Sling Blade", I was extremley disappointed with "South of Heaven, West of Hell". What a stinker! Terrible writing with very uninspired and flat performances by several otherwise talented actors. I swear Billy Bob Thornton must have been reading straight from cue cards throughout his minor five minute robotic appearance. It's almost as if he and several of the others must have owed Dwight a favor and that's why they agreed to take part in this project. Otherwise I can't understand why they would want to have anything to do with such a boring and pointless film.
