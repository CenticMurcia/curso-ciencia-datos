This is one of the worst films ever done by the already talentless Dr. Boll. Now if this had some tongue-in-cheek humor or was meant to be a joke, well that would be one thing. Instead you are tortured w/ 90+ minutes of clich√© ridden, over the top "action," absurd dialog, and one of the most pathetic endings ever put on film. Hopefully now that all of this tax breaks in Germany have been taken away from him, we won't have to put up w/any more of his drivel. However although he has no idea how to make a film, he sure does know how to get them made. How that is possible, I have no idea. This is as bad if not worse than anything he has ever done because it's supposed to be serious which makes it all the more laughable and embarrassing. Please do not waste your time w/this even though you can watch it free online if you have a Netflix membership, please don't let that fool you. This is bad in every part of the word especially the god-awful "ACTING" & the 3rd grade script which is about as nonexistent & filled w/nothingness as it can possibly be. Skip, Skip, Skip, at all costs please.
