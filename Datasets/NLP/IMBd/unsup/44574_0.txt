I saw the whole movie. Am Greek and this is a very recent film. I thought it could be good. After the first 15 minutes the film was like this : Every time the main character(a man) meets a woman , the woman attacks to him sexually and... The film was repeating itself, every scene was the same ... One of the actresses is very famous in Greek, and i like her in the "hot" scenes .. but come on... is this art ? Am really sorry that the director - whose film Loufa and Parallagy I can watch 100 times per day- made this movie. No story .. if in the same scenes the actors were more nude.. it would be porn. I am very open-minded... it reminded me of another movie Lucia y el Sexo, especially the scene in the water (blue sea and sex) but i cant really understand what was the purpose of this movie. Am really sorry for my bad critic, am not an expert. This is my personal opinion.
