OK... First of all the Jaws series doesnt need a plot. Who said all movies are supposed to make you think. I love all the Jaws movies. Given, the special effects in Jaws three were poorly done, thats the beauty of it all. Its an old movie. Just enjoy it!!! It has more of a plot and storyline than Jwas 2 did. And do you really want to question a killer shark. That was the only movie I had to close my eyes during, IT had more to do with my great fear of sharks and anything resembling them, but still. I thought the part where you are looking from inside his mouth was Exqusite. How many other older horror movies were good to you peoples standards??? (Directed at DAN GRANT and other people who hate this movie, for other reasons than not liking sharks) Why wouldnt Carl Gottleib want his name on this movie?!?! I would die to have made a jaws movie. Well maybe I will make JAWS 5... I mean how can there be like tons of the other horror movies and this one be bad. Can anyone really tell the difference between all the Screams and I know what you did last summer??? I dont think so. Well I better wrap this up i dont know how many words I have and I dont want to break 250... but might have so bye...
