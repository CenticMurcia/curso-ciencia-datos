It may soon be over but I have some good memories of Days during the years. Belle helping her friend Chloe from her shell was one of the quality moments of DOOL. The silly charm of studio exteriors, arteficial dialogue, Marlena's possession and wonderful Salem Stalker were and are a quality camp. I enjoyed Celeste's premonitions and I liked genetically manipulated Gemini twins - I especially loved psychotic Rex! I can't understand the lure and redemption of Ej - Why to make him a hero? Because he is not fat or balding or geeky-looking? Because he is filth? - but there has been lot of good stuff after overrated 1980s.
