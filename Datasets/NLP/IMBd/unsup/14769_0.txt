I can't believe someone wrote that this was a good movie for kids!!?? I'm sure having an ex-hooker for a mom would be ideal for any young boy. I can see it now...he and and his friends are sitting around playing Nintendo and drinking Kool-Aid and one of his chums says<br /><br />"Hey, you remember the time your new Mom showed us her breasts for money?That was great!"<br /><br />"Yep! That's my Mom she really enjoys exposing herself to preteens for money....anyone want some Cheetos?<br /><br />As if he didn't have problems enough with dealing with a dead mother?? Now a hooker stepmother??<br /><br /> Alternate ending: Ed Harris was eventually fired for having a wife that exposes herself to schoolkids and had to pimp out Griffith to make the rent.
