Phantasm is one of the most creative horror films from the late 70's/80's.From the imagination of Don Coscarelli,it doesn't play like a slasher film,it's a lot more clever.The setting of the horror is a Funeral home/Cemetery.A smart move,people fear funeral homes/graveyards because they associate them with death.I'd say it a cemetery is a smart place to set a horror film,because we fear it to begin with.The plot is about a boy named Mike,who lives with his brother Jody,they have a friend named Reggie who is an ice cream driver.Mike/Jody/Reggie are the main characters of the film.Their friend is killed in the cemetery.They bury him in the cemetery.Mike hides in the bushes,and sees the funeral home director known as The Tall Man,take the casket.He suspects something is wrong.Mike doesn't hesitate to investigate the cemetery.He sneaks into the mausoleum,where a flying sphere nearly kills him.The Tall Man attacks him,and he cuts off The Tall Man's fingers.Yet the finger still moves,he locks it in a box,and shows it to Jody.Jody decides that they have to investigate.They encounter dwarf slaves,they look like Jawas on film,but I'll forgive Don,because of the low budget.These Dwarf slaves are actually the corpses of the dead of the town.They bring Reggie in on it,and decide they have to find and kill The Tall Man.<br /><br />Phantasm is a great horror movie.It is fun,and a lot more clever than others.Don Coscarelli is a gifted film maker,he makes great horror films on low budgets.I checked Phantasm out because of his recent Bubba Ho-Tep which was great,and because a teacher at school who I talk to about horror films loved it.I'm glad I did see Phantasm,it was a great horror movie.
