Possible Spoilers!!!!<br /><br />Wow. What else can I say?<br /><br />This is the ultimate movie experience. It has everything! Excellent direction, gorgeous cinematography, great story, a score that always suits the mood and as for Audrey Tautou...<br /><br />This is without doubt the single greatest performance by an actress ever committed to celluloid. In the title role she not only plays Amelie Poulian, she embodies her.<br /><br />The tagline, "She'll change your life" is true. After watching AMELIE you will feel compelled to help a blind man cross the road or more importantly, you'll feel sure that there is a love out there for you. This is REAL magic.
