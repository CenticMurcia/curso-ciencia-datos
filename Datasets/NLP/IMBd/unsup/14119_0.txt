A largely over-looked sci-fi movie dating from 1970, it surely deserved a lot more attention than it received.<br /><br />Embodying many recurrently popular themes, its over-riding message is one of technology running out of control. There's a strong whiff of 'Dr Strangelove' cold-war paranoia, with 'Forbidden Planet' 'Terminator 2' 'War Games' and 'I, Robot' all carrying the message - don't trust your machines too much.<br /><br />Colossus is an America super-computer in the pre-microchip days. It's BIG. And it's put in charge of the whole NATO strategic defence program. Unfortunately; the Commies have had the same idea, and when activated; both computers meet in the electronic ethers, and it's love at first byte. They jointly conclude that their mutual tasks are best served by cooperation and begin telling each other all their national secrets. The governments don't much care for their frankness and sever the links. The computers don't like the actions of their gooseberry taskmasters very much either.<br /><br />They decide that there's going to be a few changes, and threaten nuclear reprisal if they don't get their way.<br /><br />What follows is a battle of wits between the human creators and their electronic creations, with the computers coming out on top.<br /><br />Perhaps it's the rather nihilistic denouement that rendered this movie unpopular. Most people like an ending that is at least hopeful if not actually happy. And this movie doesn't offer one. It also lacked a 'big name' movie-star to help secure its recognition. It's more like a made-for-TV presentation. Whatever the case, it deserves better recognition. It's a whole lot more believable than, say, 'Logan's Run'. Perhaps if nubile Jenny Agutter had been recruited for this movie it might have likewise stirred as many loins as memories.<br /><br />As things are, it must stand upon its scientific, social and political merits. And whilst science might have moved on in the 40 years, the social and political issues remain the same. For those reasons alone it's still worth a watch.<br /><br />Happily, it's recent release on DVD will make that easier.
