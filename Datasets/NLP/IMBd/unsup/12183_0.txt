I expected this movie to be good, and I was not disappointed. It's just the sort of movie we need in these times, with our apathetic, capitalist till death youth. It shows the ideals of revolutionaries of our times in a simple manner that people who aren't interested in politics and matters of the world can understand as well, whether they agree with them or not, and it also shows ways of dealing with these problems even if you're just a "small, insignificant" individual. Yes boys and girls, protests and revolutionary sabotage didn't stop in the seventies! I also love the way the three protagonists beat the stupid morals that almost broke them apart, and the open ending makes up for the slight unrealistic aspects that are also present at the finale. In short, this movie has everything - good acting, a gripping story and ideas that aren't new, but that people of today obviously need to be reminded of!
