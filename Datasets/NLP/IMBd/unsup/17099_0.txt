This is one cool goth movie. It's better done than the first one, because the first one had to be sown together a la Frankenstein when the lead actor really did die. God bless his soul. It's also better because it recycles footage from the first two. This movie is one great leftist movie about recycling, the memories of a schoolbus, and anti-death penalty. The end is hilarious. Let me just say that someone had a fetiche for female facial hair in this movie. It's also cruel to a step beyond the first two--Brandon Lee grieved, Vincent Perez went masochist, but William Atherton smiles like a killer clown. You can disagree with me and say the whole budget went to an illogically cool explosion and a trip to vegas for everyone, or ignore the crow's original bad acting--he's got a smirk on his face when he walks back in his cell, and take a trip downtown with the crow, way downtown.
