Apart from being low-brow from the start, this film is not even merely interesting. It's just a waste of time and money. What bothers me the most is the fact that the makers seem to have picked a the girl's country of origin at random - since they weren't going to check any facts out before shooting.<br /><br />I'm surprised they even got the car plates right. But it's downhill from there. The Volvo is clearly American, European cars arrange headlights differently. There are no catholic schools for girls in Stockholm, at least not of importance, since catholicism is a less important religion than Islam in Sweden.<br /><br />The differences between Sweden and the US are not that great. I mean, she messes up the dinner because she can't use the microwave? Give me a break.<br /><br />This film is not worth the 90-or-so minutes. Just fast forward through it and you'll do fine.
