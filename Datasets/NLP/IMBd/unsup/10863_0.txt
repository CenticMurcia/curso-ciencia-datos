A scene in this movie brings back fond memories of my childhood. The indoor amusement park/mall, known as Old Chicago, was an amazing place to me back in the mid 70's. First of it's kind and SADLY short lived as it went bankrupt and was demolished 6 years after it's closing. I remember always seeing the commercials on TV advertising the place and we begged our mom and dad to take us there. I had been there a few times with my parents and never thought I would/could see it again until I learned a scene in this movie was filmed inside of it. It made me feel good when I watched the scene and remembered the interior of the place exactly. If anyone that reads this has any souvenirs, t-shirts or other memorabilia, please let me know.
