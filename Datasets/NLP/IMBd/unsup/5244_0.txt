Wing Commander is a senseless, unfunny, yet satirical look at naval war movies and all of movie-making in general. Make no mistake though, this movie is an excellent tool for young budding directors how NOT to make a movie. Every pitfall and trap you would want to know is displayed here in its sheer and gratuitous ugliness. Everything from bad research, lousy camera work, incompetent handling of bad actors, and the worst of all crimes, HACKING successful movies to cover for your own lack of experience. By all means watch and learn.<br /><br />By the way, to any of you people who keep bringing up this inane and silly argument that Wing Commander is a "popcorn" film, please take your own advice. There's about as much entertainment you can derive from Wing Commander as watching someone run their head into a wall. Call it brainless? Indeed it is.
