Last 10 minutes of the movie were completely unnecessary... It was like watching a surgery, a nasty surgery... n btw I'm sure a person could die from that much blood loss, or at the very least pass out.<br /><br />I don't particularly like scary movies, and this is a perfect example of why, because they're stupid, but I wanted to see this because I do like the original Freaks. The success in that movie was they left the gore to the imagination, and otherwise told a story-- that's something today's movie have no concept of. Everything is all shock appeal, and the success of a horror movie is merited to the one that makes you want to vomit the most.<br /><br />The other comments were right, there is zero character development. Characters get hurt, and die gory deaths, and you really don't care, there is no effort in the screenplay to pull the movie watcher into the film; they just want to gross you out. I forced myself to not be grossed out by the last 10 minutes because I didn't want to give the makers the satisfaction of achieving that from me for this stupid movie, which had the potential to be a lot more.
