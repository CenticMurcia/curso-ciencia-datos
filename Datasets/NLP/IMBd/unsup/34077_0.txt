I find this season surprisingly disappointing, Athrun just practically went back to being an idiot like he was at the beginning of Seed, fighting for what he "blindly" believes in. Kira, I can understand he wants to live peacefully but man, honestly he looks like a depressed old man to me -__-. Destiny just practically copied everything from Seed, except doing them backwards, rather than the ZAFT steals EA's mobile suits at the beginning of the season, this time is the opposite...and ZAFT have shitty mobile suits this season, the only fights that are worth seeing is when Kira kicks ass with Gundam Freedom, and later on both Kira and Athrun kick ass with their Infinite Justice and Strike Freedom. Probably the only thing worth seeing. The new characters are soooo annoying, if u ppl thought Yzak was bad, then man he is a cool character, and him and Dearka should have had a bigger role in this season. Shin is just unacceptable, a BRAT!!!<br /><br />OK, i might sound like a complete ass for dissing this so much, but if ur looking for a good plot then don't bother with this season, if u end it at Seed, then it makes hell of a better ending than continuing like this.<br /><br />I personally loved Gundam Seed, although I was cheering for Fllay to die lol. but Destiny is just utterly disappointing.
