If you've ever seen the movie "Beetlejuise", and remember what the yuppies did to the house....<br /><br />This is what Hollywood & NBC did to this classic.<br /><br />A jive-talking elf? a techno heatmiser/snowmiser song, HM/SM turned into pimps complete with trashy girls, Santacorp ala trump......<br /><br />All this to what was originally a kids movie???? NBC, the producer, AND the writers should all be sued - for violating the Geneva convention in regards to torture. And that is what this movie was "Re-imagined" into my friends - PURE TORTURE! Many people that saw it wound up turning it off by the 30 minute mark. :( I personally would suggest action be taken against NBC - by it a petition, boycott, or flooding their mailroom with angry letters.
