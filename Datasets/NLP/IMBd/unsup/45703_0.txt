I understand how much competition holds back the development of youths, I'm a teacher. But good intentions do not encourage learning and hope does not create understanding. Participation, motivation and being truthful with children does(and lots and lots of planning). The kids that watch this take the lesson that you can fall behind, not read, not participate and a miracle will happen. You will be able to pull reason, information and remember content from when you were drawing in class, on the day of the test from your heart, your courage and a magic hidden talent you possess deep inside you. What fools all the teachers who stay up until 1am(and up at 5am) planning for cooperative groups that encompasses multiple learning abilities in children to draw their interest in American literature and encourage them to work hard, have fun and be confident young people. You want a good sports movie moms - watch Little Big League, that's cute, and honest about the importance of fundamentals.
