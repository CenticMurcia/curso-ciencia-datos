I just happened to come across it on AZN cable, it caught my attention because it was going on for 1 minute without any singing or dancing behind trees.<br /><br />There's not much to talk about the actors, I think they are all excellent and Juhi Chawla is simply beautiful in her role.<br /><br />I'm was thinking about the ending which no one seem to mention about. I was thinking perhaps Chandrika and Ishaan cut a deal, his confession in exchange for the other 2 guys. I think the whole confession was made up. Chandrika wasn't the one that tripped Ishaan at the bank, Ishaan didn't push Naagya's wife, Jaggu's wife didn't have an affair with Ishaan. I think when Chandrika said '3 lives in exchange for 2', it is meant to be subtle hint that a deal was cut. This would be a brilliant ending, rather than the confession being the truth.
