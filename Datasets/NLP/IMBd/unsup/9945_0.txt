As a classic storytale it has it all. A great plot, characters you fall in love with, evil bad guys etc But the film has aged well as a drama also, I reckon now way later... The cast is excellent. Top quality actors all over the place. And Olivia Hussey in this role, breaks my heart every time. I'd say this is one of those classic films that you can watch as a kid, with your parents and their parents and you will all enjoy it (for the same or different reasons) It is a crying shame if it's not available on DVD. My VHS copy is falling apart, but I'm lucky since Swedish National Television airs Ivanhoe every Christmas....
