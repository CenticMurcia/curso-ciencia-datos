When i saw this movie i was in tears. I have a cousin who is autistic she is not as bad as Charlie the character though and she can be a handful and quite annoying at stages and i never ever saw it from the other point of view. That my other cousin well her older sister had to do the same things that Thomas had to do when she was young and when i look back upon it now she never complained she was alway the quite one and she was always there for her sister. So i now find it so upsetting to just figure it out now what she had to deal with on top of her parents divorcing and what so many other people out there who have autistic people in there families have to manage with and they don't seem to make a fuss about it. So it does make me more grateful for life. And after watching this movie it does make me see what my cousin is going through. Which reminds me they are coming up for Christmas so it will be a lot of laughs i cant wait to see them both.
