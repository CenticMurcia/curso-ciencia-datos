So, the killer is crushed by a train and Block is left holding his arm? Almost laughable. Were they over budget and rushed for time? They should have examined more the relationship between Block and the killer who he arrested years before for 2 rapes as stated in the later part of the movie.<br /><br />Good acting by Alison Eastwood. The New Orleans skyline looked spectacular.<br /><br />I am a huge Eastwood fan, but this ranks toward the bottom. Very predictable, and seemed to drag in some parts. Why the Wes Block character anyway? I kept waiting for them to refer to him as "Callahan" the whole time.
