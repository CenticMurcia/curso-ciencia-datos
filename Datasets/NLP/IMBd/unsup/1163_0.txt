When we watched this movie we did not know what to expect, other than it was an indie movie filmed locally in PA. When we were finished we were literally blown away by the quality of the script, acting, filming, score, etc.<br /><br />This coming of age story has many light moments in it that make you laugh out loud (especially some of the out-takes), serious moments that make you reflect on life's choices and the path you take (is it the path you choose or is it chosen for you by the results of what is out of your hands?)and sadness for what is the past and what might have been.<br /><br />We thought this movie was outstanding, professional and deserves to be recognized as such.<br /><br />Should be submitted to the film fest circuit!
