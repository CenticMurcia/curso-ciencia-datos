I actually thought that the movie looked good from the ads on tv but I was WRONG, IT WAS TERRIBLE. I'm sorry for anyone who liked it but it was definitely overrated. Except for Mark Paul Gosselaar and Lochlyn Monroe the rest of the cast did not do a good job of acting. Actually, Tom Everett Scott's role should have been casted to someone else because he stunk up the whole movie. The story line itself was a stupid subject but with the right actors it might have turned out right, like There's Something About Mary. However, because of bad casting, the movie was nothing like There's Something About Mary. It wasn't very funny or interesting. Even the beginning credits and opening scene almost made me get up and leave. I thought it was the dumbest and most boring way to open up a movie. It was a cute idea, but it wasn't done right.
