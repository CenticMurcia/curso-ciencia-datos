Oh, man - are we done with these kind of stories? I hope so. I am so tired of seeing the ragtag uncoordinated unorganized undersized, blah blah blah kids beat the super- organized, arrogant talented rich kids (or something similar.) This has been done so many times with so many of the same clich√©s, it make you want to puke.<br /><br />As for the "family" tag, tell me why you always have to have profanity thrown in as if a "G" rating is the worst thing possible? (It isn't. I wonder if Hollywood will ever learn that?)<br /><br />Rejects beating the established stars. That's what you have here....again. It's like a bunch of players who were cut from the NFL suddenly getting together and beating the New England Patriots! Come on!<br /><br />Oh, yes, the coach is always led by a nerdy guy, too. At least it was good casting. Who better for nerd looks than Rick Moranis and who better for the obnoxious bad-guy coach than Ed O'Neil? Since movie-makers are always PC, they have to throw in a girl, too, who "kicks butt." Did I forget the fat kid who always farts, the smart kids who carry around computers, look geeky and have their noses running all the time, kids who always get hit in the groin, etc. etc. Enough, already! It's the same baloney, over and over, every movie!<br /><br />It's movies like this that give "kids' sports movies" a bad name.
