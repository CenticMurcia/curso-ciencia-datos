It was a late night and I was scanning through the channels when I stopped on Sci/Fi. Lake Placid 2 was on and it looked kind of interesting, so I started watching it. About two hours later, a piece of myself died inside. This movie is one of the biggest pieces of fecal matter that I have ever watched in my entire life! It's just awful! Okay, the premise of the story is that there's some lake called Lake Placid, aw there's the title tie in, and there is a giant crocodile that likes to gobble anybody up who decide to visit it's lovely little home. <br /><br />So, some kids decide that they want to camp out right on the bank of the lake, like the dumb f**ks that they are. A couple get gobbled up and there's panic on the lake. Then comes a man who puts Steve Irwin to shame, let's call him "The Crocodile Catcher" and he has a black slave.<br /><br />When he first comes into the movie you will see that he has a CGI puddle jumper airplane. Was the budget so small, that they couldn't afford a f**king puddle jumper? But that doesn't matter. They find the crocodile some spoilers happen, some people die, some people show their boobs, people die, animals die, people die, some crappy dialog his spoken that makes me embarrassed to be alive, some people die, some people die, some people die, then the movie is over, your soul is reaped, and you wish that you had a time machine so that you could go back in time and stop yourself from watching this movie.<br /><br />What I don't understand is that somebody actually thought this would be profitable. The first movie sucked, so why make a sequel? Everything that happens in the movie is so clich√©d that you just sit there saying "Oh, I really didn't expect that to happen, I lied."<br /><br />Don't buy it, don't rent it, don't think about. It's a bunch of crap!
