I came to Across 11th Street by a very strange route - I heard the title song by Bobby Womack on the soundtrack to Jackie Brown. When I looked up the film in Halliwell's Film Guide it came highly recommended as one of the finest examples of its genre. I wasn't disappointed.<br /><br />If anything, political correctness and sensitivities to some extent reduce the ability of modern TV and film to examine racial attitudes - but this film meets them head on. It doesn't condone the criminals but it does try to explain their circumstances and it's study of racism within the NYPD is brutal in comparison with NYPD Blue.<br /><br />The violence is truly brutal - as it should be.
