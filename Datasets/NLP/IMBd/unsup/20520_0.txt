This is truly one of those remakes that never should have been made. Queen L.'s role is totally unbelievable (I mean do you see her doing back-flips on a mountainbike across NYC?!). The original is copied in a very bad way and the translation from Marseille, FR to NYC could have been way better.<br /><br />In the original, the key role is a believable guy who. You'd think they picked him right off the street and put him on the set (which they did). The tuning of her taxi is really bad and again an unbelievably bad copy of the original in which the leading actor had enough street cred to do these kind of things. <br /><br />As stated in the title, the only good thing about this movie is seeing Gisele Bundchen driving a BMW 760.
