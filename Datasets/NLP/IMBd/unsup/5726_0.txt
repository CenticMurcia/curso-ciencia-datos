I saw this cartoon for the first time when I was under the age of ten, didn't know it was a "movie spoof" (which is mentioned in other sources)until I became an adult. It is one of my favorite cartoon shorts of all time (and I'm over 50, though not as old as this 'toon!) The "tune" sung by "Owl Jolson" gets stuck in your head once your mind wanders that way! I haven't seen the cartoon in several years, but I find myself remembering it fondly! Love it! Love it! Love it! I was also surprised to find that one of the voices is done by a former child star who was part of the "Our Gang/Li'l Rascals" films. If you are a "baby boomer" like me and haven't seen this classic cartoon, you are truly missing a gem...another "obscure" music-related cartoon favorite: "Russian Rhapsody" (with "Gremlins from the Kremlin")
