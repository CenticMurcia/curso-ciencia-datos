This is one of my favorite movies of all times. And the best version of Scott's tale as of yet. A+ for the professional and highly convincing cast, the costumes, the beautiful scenery, and the 'rich' plot. A good drama, a great epic, and a romance in times of chivalry and honor (i.e., in extinct times!).<br /><br />
