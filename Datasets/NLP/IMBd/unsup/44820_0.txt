I expected this movie to be somewhat in the same league as Bram Stoker's Dracula, but I was sorely disappointed. This movie was a complete bore, even in the climax. I expected there to be much mummy action in this movie, but there was hardly any. The movie basically revolves around mummy curses rather than an actual mummy. The acting in this movie is above standard for the most part, but it just can't help this sleeper of a movie.
