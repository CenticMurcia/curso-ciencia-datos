There's no doubt that The Waterboy will be a hit. It wasn't with me though. It's not that I don't like Sandler. It's just that I found him annoying in Billy Madison and a little annoying in Happy Gilmore. This movie shows Sandlers' truly annoying side.<br /><br />If you're going to see The Waterboy because of the physical hits don't bother. I didn't see ONE hit in the movie that they didn't show on TV. I would recommend the movie to kids under 12 (Or adults who are waterpeople).
