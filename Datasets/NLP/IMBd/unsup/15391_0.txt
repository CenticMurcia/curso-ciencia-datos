This just seems like something special. Grainy Black & White documentary-style presentation financed by The Standard Oil Company. A fictionalized story of a young boy(Joseph Boudreaux)and his pet raccoon playing in the alligator invested Louisiana bayous. Its a happy, peaceful life sustained by fishing and trapping. The young boy's father(Lionel Le Blanc)sells the rights to an oil company to drill for oil just behind their cabin home. The drillers make friends with the Cajuns, while off- camera the rig strikes a pocket of gas. Mission accomplished and the drillers leave the bayou environment as clean as they found it and the Cajun family is richer for it.<br /><br />Of course, the story is purely fiction and does not deal with the state of Louisiana as a whole... one has to wonder if the project is not oil company propaganda. Beautiful cinematography shot by Richard Leacock. LOUISIANA STORY is directed, written, and produced by Robert J. Flaherty. Running time is 78 minutes and worthy of your time.
