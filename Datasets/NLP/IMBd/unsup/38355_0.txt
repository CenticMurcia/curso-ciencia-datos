This was the worst adaptation of any S.E. Hinton novels. The Outsiders was fantastic, Rumble Fish was great and so was Tex. This didn't keep to the book at all really. There's so much more to this story. It seemed like Estevez just wanted to camera hog and write a movie for him to show off. But, in actuality that wasn't the character at all. There was so much more depth to Bryon and Marks friendship/brotherhood that was not even touched on. Same with the relationship with pretty much every other character. And what was with that ending? Completely false. It does not stay true to the book at all. Don't bother with this, read the book. And let's hope for a remake.
