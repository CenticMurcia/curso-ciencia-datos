No pecan pie?? No pecan pie?!? This movie, although a long forgotten classic to the trendy, so called "movie buffs" out there, blissfully unveils the solid foundations of a perfect romance comedy. though made in 1972, the subtle and sometimes blatant humor, and the addition of an ex bachelor suffering from a regretful commitment, truly creates a more real relationship dilemma that seems to be missing in more modern chick flicks.<br /><br />The Heartbreak Kid truly is a lost gem; forged with superb casting, many memorable scenes, and a handful of classic dialogues and mannerisms that will certainly become engraved in memory with intricate ease.
