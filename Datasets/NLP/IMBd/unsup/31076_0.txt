I went to see this movie because I am a fan of Matthew McConaughey. And though I want to see him in a more serious role than those he has been playing lately, this film was actually good.<br /><br />Jennifer Garner was a good match for Matthew. They had good chemistry together. And it was a nice change from all of the usual movies to see some actors you haven't seen in a while, like Michael Douglas. He was a perfect choice for that role.<br /><br />The concept of this movie is very funny and it is a refreshing change from the usual, lame, romantic stories. It was fun to see the flashbacks, not to mention the way they traveled through each one. This is an adult movie I would have to say. There are a lot of sexual jokes and situations. But this is what makes the movie funny and amusing.<br /><br />By the end of this movie you'll know you made a good choice to go see it. Even though it's an average romantic comedy, it stands better than a lot of others because it uses a different concept. This is what happens when you have good actors in a movie together. They make a simple idea look perfect. Go see this one!
