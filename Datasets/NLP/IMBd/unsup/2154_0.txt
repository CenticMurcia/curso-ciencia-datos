That is about the best thing I can say about this little Roger Corman flick about female prison escapees looking for diamonds in the swamp. And trust me that is about all there is to the plot, except one of them is a undercover policewoman and they come across a couple going to examine oil wells or something. Of course, it starts out with these two plots separate, but you know they are headed for a wacky collision in the swamp. And speaking of swamp, man there are a lot of shots of swamp in this one. This movie is not very long, but it still seems long as the scenes just all feel the same. I am wondering how the heck anyone can know the exact place something is buried out there when they haven't been there for three years. Still though you get to see gals in shorts and an alligator attack scene...wow, talk about action. Though after the one girl was killed by an alligator her boyfriend didn't seem all that upset. Well with a film of this kind you basically know what is going to happen so nothing to thrilling to be seen except for those shorts.
