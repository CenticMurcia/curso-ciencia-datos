Excellent film, Dark side we all have mixed with the Wes Block's warm heart at times was well placed to go with the Film's tone. I would highly recommend this to anyone into murder Mystery's. Eastwood is able to bring this character to life, his character Wes Block is a man on a mission, and he won't stop until he's got his man. To me the twists in this story can't be seen ahead of time, with just hints of foreshadowing, one is now taken along for the ride... <br /><br />Some may feel this film is dated, I would have to agree, it's like taking a journey back in time 25 years to New Orleans, Bourbon street during Halloween which was perfectly weaved into the story, simply brilliant,if you're looking for some high action "Make my day" shoot em up type of film this would not be the one for you. However if you have patience and a bit of a dark side I believe this film will satisfy your murder mystery cravings. 9/10<br /><br />Rated R for sexual content & violence
