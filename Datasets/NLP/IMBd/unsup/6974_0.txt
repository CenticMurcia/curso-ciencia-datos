This is one of my favorite foreign films ever. Like "Brazil" it takes place in a "futuristic" society which looks like it takes place in the 40's. After a nuclear war a small band of people in a town survive by trading, scrounging, and eating each other. This has some absolutely wonderful performances by an excellent cast. This is a dark black comedy, which at times is whimsical, and at other times, somewhat gruesome, and sometimes both at the same time. An outsider comes to town and finds employment doing "odd jobs" for a butcher. He falls in love with the butcher's shy daughter. Little does he know that plans are being made for him that probably don't fit in with his intentions. This movie has so many little things that it must be watched more than once to catch them all. There is a sequence featuring a bicycle pump, knitting needles, a man and a woman in bed making love in a bed with squeaky springs, that is just incredibly entertaining. Another highlight is a depressed and suicidal woman who makes several unsuccessful attempts at doing herself in. And that's entertaining? Yeah, it is, you have to SEE it. This is a totally bizarre film, equal parts light and dark, with very likeable characters and somewhat of a good nature to it despite its subject matter. Highly recommended, and if you see this and DO like it, you will want to see "City of Lost Children" and "Amelie", which are both by the same people, also containing some of the same actors. 10 out of 10!
