I saw this movie in Russia, Moscow in 75-76 when I was 8 years old. It was showing in a specialized cinema for children "Orlenok". The movie was on screen for about a week and I went to it every day - i.e. 7 times or so.<br /><br />You DON'T have to be Norwegian to understand subtleties of this movie (maybe you just need to be a kid, even though grown up :)<br /><br />This piece was superbly translated into Russian and I remember some of them till now. I can't say how much I love this movie. It was such a pity that I couldn't see it for so many years. I was in Norway once, but it was in spring and I missed your X-mas show :)<br /><br />Can you picture my excitement, when I suddenly found Fl√•klypa Grand Prix on IMDB.com? I feel like if I found a childhood friend that I lost long ago.<br /><br />
