Things I hate about sequels include discovering previously unknown (and unheard of) brothers of the main villain killed in the previous film. I also dislike films that dismiss the previous one as a dream. Guess what, this did both of them! Or at least more inventively, the survivors of the first film had flogged the story of the first film and then admit to the new members of the cast that 'it actually happened and to us and that's why were in trouble because we decided to shortcut through the same bit of desert and got stuck'. Oh dear. Of further interest is the blind girl amongst the characters, being blind obviously improves your survival chances manyfold. At the start, one of the survivors of part 1 is telling his psychiatrist why he can't go back to the desert and then promptly disappears for the rest of the film. Smart man ...
