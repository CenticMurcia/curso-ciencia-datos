The day I watched this movie was the dullest day in my life. I was sick, I was alone at home, the PC was being fixed, and there was ABSOLUTELY nothing else on the TV. Otherwise, there is no way I'm watching this movie. Now, thinking back, I wonder why I watched the whole crap... It's more than just stupid. It is stupidity and beyond. And... Sandra Bernhard appears to be the name, is so ugly, it's unbelievable. And I ask you? Who funded this peace of garbage? Who was dump enough? They didn't even tried... They use motorbike helmets with some plaster on them for the space suits!!! I can go on and on about how much this movie sucks, about the clich√©s, about the stupid bloopers, but... what's the point? The point is that if you haven't, than you should NEVER watch this film, unless you're a complete and total idiot. It's not even funny in it's stupidity... damn...
