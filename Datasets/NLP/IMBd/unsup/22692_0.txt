I am so glad DAVE started playing these as i had only seen the US version and clips on youtube until then.<br /><br />It is one of the most hilarious shows on TV and far superior to the US version; don't get me wrong, i do like the American one but got bored of the same performers each time, it became real repetitive. The skill of the improvisation is amazing in the British version especially in the dreaded hoe-down.<br /><br />What i like most about this version is the versatility of the performers, you had Brits, Americans, Canadians, Australians and maybe more that i can't even think of. Each of the performers had their own individual talents; Josie Lawrence and Mike McShane naturals at 'song styles' whilst Ryan Stiles and Colin Mochrie worked great together in 'scene to music' or 'sound effects'.<br /><br />My favourtite player is Tony Slattery as he always has me in stitches but everyone is brilliant including Josie, Mike, Ryan, Colin, Steve Frost, Paul Merton, Jim Sweeney, Niall Ashdown and many more.<br /><br />My other favourite player is Greg Proops, he has such wit and the banter between him and Clive Anderson is very funny. I love Clive as the host, he his so sharp witted (unlike Drew Carey who makes me want to switch off the TV every time he speaks) There is a huge selection of games too,some of my favourites being 'film and theatre styles', 'Party quirks', 'bartender' and 'superhereos'. There are some dodgy ones though (i'm not keen on 'moving people' or 'helping hands' much) but the games and players are always different so you never get bored.<br /><br />I hope it keeps playing on the DAVE channel so others who missed it first time round can see it now.
