After reading the reviews of this film on this site, I became interested and subsequently spent nearly two hours of my life watching it. These are hours I will never get back.<br /><br />I would bet that gay men would find this movie very interesting but if you are not a gay man, I'd recommend you spend your time watching something else. I kept waiting for something to happen that would grab my attention. Seeing naked or nearly naked men, particularly within the context of homosexuality, does not offend me, it just does not interest me. Also, for me, the men they were portraying (as it is based on a true story) were too stupid to be sympathetic.<br /><br />Not a bad film, just not very interesting.<br /><br />
