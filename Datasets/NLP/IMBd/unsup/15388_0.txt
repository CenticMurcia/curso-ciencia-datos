An artist with a wife and two female lovers. First, he's straight or too heterosexual if you ask me. Of course, Shera Danese who plays his wife is the real-life wife of COlumbo himself, Peter Falk. I like Fionnula Flanagan who has a supporting role. Yes, it's the same formula for Columbo. I am always amused by his embarrassment and his ignorance even in this episode. He always seems out of place and fascinated by the situation. Artists have been prime suspects before. He always has a wealthy, prominent, and celebrity prime suspects but he is always at the top of his game and he always catches his man or woman. I just love having him back but this is one of my personal favorites to watch again and again.
