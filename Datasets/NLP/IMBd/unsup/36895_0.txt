i had wanted to see this film for MANY YEARS! well Mainly cause John Carradine was in it. & it was a movie that i was curious to see? & no need to say who's 1st film it was! :) well one of his 1st films i mean. & i was QUITE bored watching it. the acting was as BAD as it got! & i<br /><br />actually almost bought this piece of crap of a film on DVD a few years ago. & NOW I'm glad i did NOT! so anyone who hasn't seen this film, watch it only for curiosity, NOT cause people have said it's good. & the 2nd reason i forgot to mention was the #1 reason i watched it off Cable was it's an Early film that "Roger The Man Corman" produced when he had NOT long before had quit directing films.
