This is a remarkably silly film. In a good way. It would probably make the best drinking game in the world. Drink when<br /><br />*The maidan looks sorrowful *Anyone looks at a picture of their lost love *Anyone goes 'Ahhahahahaha. Ahahahahaha' *Anyone appears on camera with a dodgy moustache. *Anyone fires a ridiculous weapon (rocket launcher, 12 bore shotgun...) *Anything pink is in shot *Someone with a facial tic is in closeup. *The theme music is played. *Anyone dies/explodes/gets shot in a particularly amusing/gory way.<br /><br />You would be as drunk as a newt within minutes. I laughed all the way through and had a thoroughly good time. If you like the work of Peter Jackson, or are a fan of the absurd and silly then waste no time and see this. If you aren't, you'll probably think as my friends did... Not a film to see again, but an interesting experience none the less.
