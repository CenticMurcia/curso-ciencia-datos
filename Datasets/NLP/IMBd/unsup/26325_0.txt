I really enjoyed this movie. It didn't always seem like it knew what it wanted to say about fame but I thought it was consistently funny. I especially liked the cast. Nat DeWolf and Laura Kirk are quirky and sincere and very funny as a result. I also like some of the supporting, non-celebrity roles. In particular I like the casting director of the commercial and the guy at the party who gets outed accidentally. There's a lot of talent in the film.
