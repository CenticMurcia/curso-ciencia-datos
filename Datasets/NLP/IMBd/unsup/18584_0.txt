Usually, a good horror movie is scary, creepy or unnerving. "In the Woods" is none of those. So I place this movie in a new genre: Horrorble. Horrible basically describes this movie, it doesn't deserve any more words. I laughed through the entire 90 minutes. I laughed at the not so special effects and the bad acting. Horrible acting. What was the purpose of the "cannibal hamsters"? The ending was really dumb, and it seemed the movie was partially written, shot, then written more, shot etc.<br /><br />It claims to be "creepier than the blair witch project". This line is what encouraged me to rent the movie. Don't waste your time.
