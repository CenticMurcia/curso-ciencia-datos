I found nothing new scientifically in this film, but that is because i love reading about science and new all the facts that were expressed.<br /><br />Even though I believed I knew the Bible, I was surprised to find out that I hadn't a clue to the passages often quoted by Christian fundamentalists in their hatred of homosexuals. It turns out that they don't have a clue either.<br /><br />Those passages they quote are taken out of the cultural context of the period and just knowing that there is no Aramaic, Hebrew, or Ancient Greek word for homosexual should tell you that is not what they were talking about.<br /><br />As interesting as all that was, it is not the most interesting part of the film. The impact that this hatred has on the individuals involved - whether they be gay, lesbian, bi-sexual, or transgendered - and the impact on their families is what is most important in the film. The fact that some families, like the Gephardt's, can continue to love their children is a testament to their strength. The fact that other families can learn to accept their children once they learn the truth is hopeful. The fact that some families become activists for their children, even after they have committed suicide, is amazing.<br /><br />The truth is there for those who want to take the time to see it. But, more importantly, the examples of families who have struggled with children of different sexual orientations is inspiring and shows that we do have some hope in the crazy world.
