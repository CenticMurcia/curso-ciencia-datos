I remember this film coming out in 1980, I think I even went to see it at the cinema.<br /><br />I remember then that I thought it was utter rubbish.<br /><br />America the good in another excuse for a confrontation of good against evil, in this case Russia. I do seem to recall that at the time of The Titanic going down, there was no cold war. So to make a film where America the good is in a battle against time to beat Russia to the "Byzantium" is a country purely self obsessed and blinkered to think it has any right to go down and get the Titanic up, which I recall was a British ship.<br /><br />This is a terrible film, made by an arrogant and self obsessed USA, yet again, an example of that country's arrogance and why it is so hated today by many.<br /><br />I urge, delete this film from your thoughts, it has been proved the ship is in pieces any small amount of research would have come up with a probability of such a big ship hitting the sea bed and remaining in tact is pure darn right stupidity, as is this film.<br /><br />D
