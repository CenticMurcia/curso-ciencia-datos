*Spoiler Alert* (coincidentally can you spoil crap?) Where on earth to start...oh my, I'm trying to sit here with my friend and figure out how to best describe the utter stupidity presented in this movie...truly a waste of the breath in my lungs...<br /><br />OK, lets start with one of the main characters, Alice whom my friend and I repeatedly referred to as "Boomer" because of her ability to constantly amaze us. This name is merely an understatement, as we are presented with multiple encounters of seemingly "near death" situations in which she quickly devises some witty plan, gains the strength of an ox, the agility of a rabid bunny, and the brain capacity of Stephen Hawking. One incident in particular is the scene in which "boomer" valiantly smashes through an assembly of stained glass windows on her motorcycle and carefully times her departure from the vehicle in the form of a triple back-flip, projecting the motorcycle at high speeds towards the apparently "bullet-fast" creature within the building's confines, only for the motorcycle to attain a vertical position along the creatures' abdomen, turning perfectly, exposing the "ever-so-small" gas tank, allowing "boomer" an effortless, but nonetheless accurate shot at the flammable contents of the tank, and thus "efficiently" dispatching this foul creature from existence... With her flawless perfection of shot, and ample bosom, how could anyone despise this movie...for laughs. Certainly not for actual enjoyment.<br /><br />This movie was so bad, i purged in an empty popcorn container, forgot about it, picked up the container once again, and proceeded to name the individual ingredients i recognized as food, and formulated names for things that looked supernatural. That was a much more fulfilling use of my time than watching this crappy flick.
