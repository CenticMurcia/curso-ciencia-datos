this movie has no redeeming qualities at all...none...it is insulting and worst of all it isn't funny. For example, it makes fun of an elderly homeless man, then offers up as comedy a picture of that man peeing on himself. It has a horrible stereotype of Black women bullying and beating up on their men and the men being afraid of their women. When I saw the film it didn't draw one laugh from the audience that was watching it...not one. It was a pathetic, humorless, offensive and stupid endeavor. The only partially redeeming characteristic of this film is that if you get up to go to the snack bar in the middle of the film you won't miss anything funny or important. Do NOT see this film!
