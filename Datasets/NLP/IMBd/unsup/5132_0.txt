This was a great movie!<br /><br />Beautiful shadowed images lingering on the screen. I saw this gem at the '06 San Francisco Film Noir Festival #4.<br /><br />The movie was slow early on but when it finally got going it led to an exciting climax. Interestingly narrated is all I'll say about this story. It's a great and sordid tale from a night in the urban jungle. Don't miss this if you get the opportunity.<br /><br />This tight little drama is about a cop ~ Gig Young ~ who gets tempted to dabble in the web of corruption and vice. With Marie WIndsor, Chill Wills, William Tallman, and a few other familiar character actors of the day.<br /><br />And, yes this movie was loaned to the festival by Martin Scorsese. It was his personal 35mm print.
