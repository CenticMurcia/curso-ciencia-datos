First off let me make something clear--I LOVE Liza Minnelli. She's talented, beautiful can sing and act. I'm also a big fan of her mom. But this show just bored me. I saw the restored version on Showtime last night.<br /><br />The show was remastered--the picture was as clear as a 1972 TV special can be, the colors were strong and the sound was excellent. Liza herself looked incredible and belted out the songs full force. But I didn't recognize most of the songs and she seemed to be acting in a REAL strange way during a bunch of lullabies. Also the dance numbers were just OK--nothing special. The show only came to life at the very end when she did all her songs from "Cabaret" (No "New York, New York"--that was 3 years later). Basically I quickly lost interest and patiently waited for the show to end.<br /><br />I'm not sure why I hated this so much. Minnelli was superb...but I was just bored silly. I can't recommend this at all.
