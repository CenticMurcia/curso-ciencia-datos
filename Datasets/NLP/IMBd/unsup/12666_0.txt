I was engaged for the whole movie. The sense of being out in the snow, building tension and sense of dread was totally captured. The characters were very well scripted and portrayed.<br /><br />If anything, the underlying threat could have been totally left to the imagination without a reveal. Having said that, the total impact of the movie was nevertheless not spoiled.<br /><br />The snow scenes and landscape were captured with a bleak and beautiful starkness. The action scenes were done with incredible realism and not overdone.<br /><br />Ron Perlman did a great job of portraying the rough and tough oil man, yet was able to shift as the plot unfolded. All the actors and characters were totally believable, and sustained their correct arcs through the movie.
