This is, for the first half, a great relationship movie if you can ever catch it on cable or some other medium. I gave it an 8 out of 10 because, as a TV movie, it wasn't quite as high quality as a theatrical movie on the same subject would be. For that matter, it's not quite as deep or well-written as the somewhat similar "A Question of Love"--a TV drama starring Gena Rowlands and Jane Alexander on the subject of a lesbian couple fighting to keep custody of their kids. But it's still a great little movie. Unlike the other film, this one shares more of the relationship between the two women. Valerie Bertinelli is surprisingly good as a woman who falls in love with another woman, for the first time, and doesn't have the usual stereotypical reaction to it--freaking out. Her slow realization is believable and well-acted. The romance is handled with understanding, sensitivity, and warmth. Colleen Flynn, Bertinelli's co-star, is likable and authentic. I will leave the courtroom side of the film for the viewer to judge.
