<br /><br />I saw this movie on late night local tv when i was about 12. And ever since have asked people about it but nobody ever heard of it. Literally no one...I began to think maybe i dreamt it.<br /><br />It was sad and funny and left you with a good feeling about love and friendship. I would highly recommend this to everyone. Don't remember anything that a child shouldn't see in it...the beating was ugly but we see that all the time. So the whole family could watch it.
