Before I go into the positive, I would like to point out the only drawback this "mini series" had in my opinion. And that is the fact that it wasn't made like a mini series. This was made like a TV show with a typical ending begging for the next season. Problem is mini series should be final and should have an actual satisfying ending, which this did not. The loose ends are not tied up in the way you would expect, on the contrary more and bigger questions arise.<br /><br />Now on to the better, this mini series deals with some of the most fascinating aspects of science fiction. Without giving anything away I will just say that if you were intrigued by the ideas in such movies as Donny Darko, Contact, 2001 Space Oddysey (or the 2001/2010/3000 books) then you will enjoy this show.<br /><br />Without being too extravagant there are enough special effects to make it look believable enough yet at the same time nothing is too out there. It all just seems so plausible. Acting is fine too. Having watched all of the episodes back to back to back it was just like watching one long movie. For a movie it progressed a little slowly, but once you get into the story you won't notice that at all.
