This movie was so savagely criticized that I desperately wanted to like it, to prove everybody wrong and to claim that Eddie Murphy was back with a bang and with his funny bones throbbing like they never had. I wanted all that badly...until I got to see the movie and got sourly disappointed at such flagrant waste of resources.<br /><br />Not that E.Murphy's name is a guarantee of quality cinema anymore but at least he used to have some dignity, usually top notch character actor Joe Pantoliano(just watch"Memento") also sets something close to a career low here. The visual side of the film is occasionally spectacular but nothing can overcome the increasingly frequent hollywoodian syndrome of having scripts and dialogs that look as if they were written by drunken apes, I mean zero intelligence, zero subtlety, zero coherence all amounting to one gigantic mess of half baked concepts that never gel into anything resembling a decent film.<br /><br />To top it off for an action comedy the action part is feeble at best and the least said about the jokes the better(oh the endless horny robot jokes). It flopped for a reason, nobody in a right frame of mind would want to repeat his dose of Pluto Nash.
