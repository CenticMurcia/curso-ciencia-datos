Another mafia movie out of the RGV factory. First of all, set expectations right to enjoy the movie. Don't expect the brilliance of Satya, raciness of Company, or the impact of Ab Tak Chappan. Then you will end up actually enjoying the movie instead of panning it as just another mafia movie.<br /><br />I am surprised that they didn't promote this movie as the prequel to Company. Hollywood would have milked the angle. Hindi movies need to start doing it. But it is a "prequel" to Company, no questions about that. When seen in that angle you understand the motivation behind making the film.<br /><br />The biggest plus of the movie, like other RGV movies there is no sugar coating. The scene where Deshu is sitting and eating lunch in the chawl is so realistic of chawls in B'bay that you almost can touch and smell it. There is no Yash Chopra grandeur. The romance is gritty and real. There isn't too much dialogue in the movie which furthers the impact. There is no real need for it, you can extrapolate the dialogue from the situations. The background music is fitting. Another plus point of the movie is the focus on the story. The movie never veers from it. The story is about the rise of common man to that of a mafia don (Deshu). There aren't any sub plots to divert the attention of the viewer. The acting for most part is top notch. Rukshar (Bhakti Bhatnagar) who plays Deshu's girlfriend is the only one who doesn't command a screen presence.<br /><br />So whats the biggest minus ? Like I said before it doesn't leave you breathless a.k.a Satya. You have appreciate the mumbai tapori/mafia/colloquial setup to some degree to like the movie. If you are a fan of the afore mentioned movies. Its a must see.
