I rate movies on how they perform compared to what they are supposed to be. For instance, Jason X is almost a 10, because it is bad and intended to mock the Friday the 13th movies. So that being said, this gets a solid 8. That is an 8 out of 10 for B Zombie movies.<br /><br />SO when I saw the title and the description on my cable system, I had to watch. I said to my girlfriend, "I have to watch this. It has Zombies and bank robbery. Two great movie themes in one. What could be better?" Well, the titles started and I realized this was a Ghetto,Zombie Bank Heist movie. OMFG, it just got better. Kinda like Dead Presidents with Zombies.<br /><br />When I saw this, I then said to my GF, "This could only get better if there was a spy or secret agent or something." Well, halfway into the movie we are introduced to a government agent character whose job it is to kill the zombies. PERFECT! So yeah, this is a B movie. But, as was said before by others, you can tell they tried. This is a fun romp. The acting is weak, but not terrible. Some of the characters are engaging, but not the ones that are intended to be.<br /><br />The camera work is pretty good and the movie flows. It follows the formula for a zombie movie, but that is the point. This isn't avant garde, this is a zombie movie.<br /><br />It is good for a laugh with some zombie loving friends.
