This is probably the cutest little short I have ever watched - the main star of this Tex Avery episode, a little owl called Owl Jolson (spoof on Al Jolson) is probably the cutest animated character I have seen - apart from WALL.E, perhaps. This is what makes this short so memorable. The singing from Owl Jolson and the rest of the music in this short is very good, another thing that makes this short worth watching. <br /><br />This animated short starts with two owl parents, the mother sitting on eggs and the father pacing around the nest wearing the carpet out. Finally, the four eggs hatch. Out of the first one comes an beautiful opera singing owl chick, whom his parents adore. Out the second egg comes a very good violin playing owl chick, whom his parents also adore. Out of the third egg hatches a melodious flute playing owl chick. His parents adore him as well. Out of the forth egg - comes the parents' horror, an owl chick who sings jazz! His father does not understand him and ends up throwing the poor chick out...<br /><br />I recommend this beautiful, entertaining, quite funny and VERY cute short to anyone who has enjoyed Looney Tunes and to anyone who likes music, including jazz. Enjoy "I Love to Singa"! :-)
