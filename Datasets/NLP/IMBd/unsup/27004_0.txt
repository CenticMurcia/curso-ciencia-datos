Television producers are notorious for their lack of irony. Peter Weir's 'The Truman Show' warned of the dangers of taking reality television too far. Those geniuses at Endemol U.K. couldn't have paid heed because each summer 'Big Brother' stinks up Channel 4's schedules like an overflowing dustbin in a heatwave. Its odd now to look back at that first series and see how normal the contestants were compared with those of recent years. Now the show's rules are being deliberately ignored so that 'voted-out' contestants can be brought back, resulting in understandable viewer fury. Why have rules if they can't be bothered to obey them? 'B.B.' deserves to be pilloried for giving undeserved media exposure to obnoxious, arrogant, foul-mouthed types who clearly belong in a mental home. With any luck it will one day be consigned to the same fate as 'The Black & White Minstrel Show' - unloved and forgotten, a relic of a shameful era when the lowest common denominator reigned supreme on British television.
