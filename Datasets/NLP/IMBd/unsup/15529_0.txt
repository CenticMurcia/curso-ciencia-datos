From the pilot, I'm enthused about this new version of Aquaman. I was particularly impressed on how the creators captured Aquaman's (A.C.'s) underwater life.....IMDb lists the pilot under 2006...It's 2007 now...I hope they didn't drop the show; otherwise, the channel's executives have their heads up their asses.<br /><br />When the grown A.C. first comes into the show, looking like a California beach dude, I was like "Oh No....This is going to be some Dawson's Creek, contrived teenage drama..." But actually, A.C. shows some depth in his character to make it interesting (although all the characters are pretty simple). The writing needs help being predictable, but they've done a good job at leaving the following plot open and mysterious. The acting needs serious work as well although I was glad to see Vin Rahmes and Lou Diamond Phillips bring some seasoned professionalism to the show. The directing also needs to improve...Emotionally it's "tacky." The director takes the viewer from suspenseful scenes to carefree, bubbly scenes immediately afterwards...taking away from the continuity of the plot.<br /><br />Overall though, I enjoyed it...There's a lot to work with, but I fear if certain aspects (as mentioned above) are not payed attention to the show will end up being mediocre while it could be GREAT. It really does have great potential I think, but I fear if the show continues, it will get stupid with the writing, acting, and directing, and I'll get bored and tune out.
