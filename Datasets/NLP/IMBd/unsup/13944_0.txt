Filmed in colour, which was very unusual for a British war movie of that era, this was a basically decent take on WW2 naval conflict.<br /><br />It's nice to sea genuine warships of the period in their full spectacular and menacing beauty, instead of the usual tacky and implausible models. Just check-out the 'sea-battle' of 'In Harm's Way' to sea how badly it could have been done.<br /><br />Lots of fine British character actors pop up and do their stuff. Anthony Quayle, John Gregson, Patrick Macnee and there are many more. There are also plenty of nice little details that often get overlooked, such as the gun-muzzles that become smoke-blackened after use. The actual battle sequences tend to look a little hokey nowadays, with the splashes of nearby shell-falls resembling a bucket of pelted water. Still; the destruction and confusion arising from direct hits are believable enough.<br /><br />Some commentators smirk at the stiff upper-lipped-ness of the characters portrayed, but these attitudes are, in fact, very authentic. It was terribly bad form to lapse into any kind of emotional display in those times of repressed Englishness, never mind the histrionics often (wrongly) depicted of Americans. People had a far greater sense of national obligation in those days, and lamenting one's personal losses implied a lack of proportion; everyone was suffering one way and another. A recently-interviewed former nurse who served in a war-casualty hospital remarked how, despite the most appalling injuries she had ever seen, no man ever swore or cried out in pain. The only exclamation of distress she ever heard was a whispered 'oh-dear'. There's a scene in the much more gritty 'Cruel Sea' in which a crew member, whilst writing a letter to his wife, is informed of her death in the blitz. He responds simply by saying 'I think I'll just go on deck for a while'. Everyone learnt to have a much greater sense of self-discipline and forbearance. They kept a good face and grieved in private. Unlike the wimps of today. Just look at the antics of a modern premier-league footballer who gets tripped-up.<br /><br />Another criticism has been levied about its predominantly British take on events. But what would one expect in 1956? The bleeding-heart liberal apologists hadn't taken over the media by then. In fact, Finch's Langsdorff and the Graff Spee crew in general offer a pretty sympathetic presentation of those who fought at sea for the most despicable regime of modern time. Let's not forget that this powerful warship was employed in sinking defenceless merchant vessels. When it came up against determined though still inferior-gunned adversaries, Langsdorff's response was to cut and run. Bearing in mind that the Battle is depicted from a British perspective and that they knew almost nothing of the mindset of their enemies, I'd say it is sufficiently evenly balanced for the story and the drama.<br /><br />I also like the way we patrol with the fleet as the dawn breaks on a clear morning. We see the sky brightening and the sun slowly rise as the aboard-ship dramas unfold.<br /><br />If I have a grumble about the movie it concerns the post-Montevideo section. Far too much of the drama is given over to the rogue reporter. His relentless hyperbole jars with the steadfast British understatement that dominated the first half of the action. But I suppose as American money funded it and an American warship had been borrowed to play the Graff Spee, they must be allowed in somewhere.<br /><br />Still, there's much to like and admire in this golden oldie, from top-drawer actors, excellent script, beautiful photography, and genuine warships of the time, as well as a largely authentic slice of history. Not many movies can boast all of these things. Just check-out U571.<br /><br />Recommended.
