The title comes from a silly sex book that came out in the early 1970s and was a big hit. Read today the book is hilariously naive and full of misinformation. Anyway, Woody Allen took some chapters from the book and came up with seven skits. The quality ranges from horrible to hilarious.<br /><br />In the first Allen plays a court jester who uses an aphrodisiac to seduce a queen (Lynn Redgrave). Unfortunately she has a chastity belt on! Very funny and we else can you see Redgrave wearing a chastity belt? The second has Gene Wilder as a doctor falling in love with a sheep! Don't worry--it's not explicit. It's OK. The third is a funny parody of foreign films (complete with subtitles) where Allen has trouble getting his wife (Louise Lasser) to orgasm. Good idea but it has no ending. The fourth is easily the weakest--it has Lou Jacobi who loves to wear womens clothes. The fifth is a parody of the old TV game show "What's My Line". It's shot in b&w and is called "What's My Perversion". It has a very young Regis Philbin in the cast! The sixth has John Carradine as a mad scientist (what else?) who accidentally invents a giant breast that roams the countryside drowning people with milk! The last is the best--it shows what happens in a man's body during sex. It has Tony Randall and Burt Reynolds in the mind and Allen playing a nervous sperm!<br /><br />Tasteless to be sure but even the bad skits have some great lines. The content isn't THAT bad--except for the breast there is no nudity but there is a lot of frank sexual talk. If you can deal with sex and laugh at it you might like this movie. Otherwise stay away. I give it a 7.
