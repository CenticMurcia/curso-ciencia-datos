I love this movie, I can watch it over & over. Dennis Miller should be in more movies, he is hilarious in this. I loved the first Crypt movie & love this one even more. Its scary & funny at the same time. It may have its cheesy moments but hey not every movie is perfect. The orchestral music throughout the film along with the awesome soundtrack give this movie an awesome feel to it. It has Graphic violence, language & nudity. Its worth seeing if you are a fan of D. Miller, like me or a horror/comedy fan. I want more Crypt movies NOW!
