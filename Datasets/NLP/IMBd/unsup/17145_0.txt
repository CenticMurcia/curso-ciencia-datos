I caught this movie on TV the other night, and it was so bad, I was forced to watch the whole thing. Its a retelling of the fairytale-remade as a musical with Craig T. Nelson playing two roles and the always lovely Isabella Rosellini as Little Red Riding Hoods Mother.I'm not sure if the intended audience are children or adults, but I doubt either would be satisfied. The songs -lyrics and music are abysmal and most of the actors can barely carry a tune. Poor Craig T. Nelson, who I've enjoyed elsewhere, was hammy and ridiculous as the evil king.The young actress playing Red Riding Hood had one singing voice for the ballad and another for an up tempo song.If you enjoy unintentional farce, if you are a MSTK3 fan who can imagine Crow and Tom Servo dissecting this-you'll enjoy this movie.
