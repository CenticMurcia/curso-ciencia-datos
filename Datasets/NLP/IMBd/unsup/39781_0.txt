I love Stephen King - I read most of his books (not this one)and there are some good (and of course some bad) Stephen King movies!<br /><br />But this movie is really really bad! Made by Lawrence Kasdan and starring some fine actors like Morgan Freeman, Damien Lewis, Tom Sizemore...I expected at least an entertaining movie; but it isn't even that! The acting is poorly, the story seems...... lost in the storm and the special effects look rather silly. The only advise I can give anybody who hasn't seen this movie yet is: try READING THE BOOK because this movie is awful!<br /><br />
