I really enjoyed the movie and got a chance to see Bishop TD Jakes from a different perspective. I believe this is the side of ministers that we don't see, where they visit the sick, prisoners, etc. And unless we have a crisis in our family probably will never see. Since I missed the first few moments I was a little confused by what was going on since the scenes jumped from the jail cell to the church to the past. However, the plot is not hard to follow. The characters were all great and did an excellent job in there parts.<br /><br />I sure many feel its a movie for women and that is not necessarily so. After watching the movie I am definitely interested in reading the book.
