I had steered clear from this abomination for so long to only let my guard down and allow the temptation to take hold. I see some people adore it for its sheer badness, but I didn't find it particularly amusing (save for a couple of scenes and dialogues) in that aspect. It bored me, and while technically it was rather standard with some bottom of the barrel choices in wonky make-up FX (no really cheap Halloween masks) and clumsy special effects. I was expecting something more along the lines z-grade trash. Trash it is, especially the material (bonkers plot and terribly inane script) and overbearingly inept performances (leading the way is main the kid with the screwed-up face and the hammy rejected stage-actresses Deborah Reed, and the mother is quite ding-bat too), but for me it wasn't so bad it's funny like it's mentioned it's just tiresomely bad and goes for 91 minutes too long.<br /><br />Some no all of the plot details are ridiculous, but some more so than others like very needy boys hanging out with pal (who's the boyfriend of Connie Young's character) and the welcoming town's folk with their fascination for food. Green food and drinks and no one bothers to question it.<br /><br />The thing that was running through my head (other than can see this get any more stupid yes) was this trying to be a comedy (I hope so) or serious horror. Well it's horrifyingly stupid. If I start thinking too much about it, I might have just started sweating out green sludge! What was the deal naming the film 'Troll 2', where it's goblins that appear I guess that's one of life's many mysterious. At least the ending (while tacky) is unexpected.
