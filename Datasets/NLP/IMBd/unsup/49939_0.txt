Frenetic, silly and a waste of time. This movie has nothing to recommend it. Clearly, someone had some extra money and time and decided that it would be charitable to give some B-movie actors some work. The result is a perfectly forgettable effort.<br /><br />The plot is most convoluted mix of relationships, back-stabbings and shootings imaginable. It's like a RoadRunner cartoon. Remember those? The endings were always predictable. The same is true of this movie. There is absolutely nothing to make it interesting.<br /><br />If you have any other way of spending 90 minutes then don't choose this movie. I suggest either studying your navel or thumb twiddling. Both are more exciting.
