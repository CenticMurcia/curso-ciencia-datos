Here we have another so-called horror flick made only for tasteless teenagers or fans of modern teen flicks like "Urban Legend" or "Scream".No violence,no real thrills,only a lot of predictable cliches.Oh,and there's also incredibly dumb sequence when one girl is scared to death by strange masked figure(Ha!Ha!).I hate those completely commercial 90's slasher films.If you want good eerie horror movie rent "Texas Chain Saw Massacre","Wolfen" or my favourite "Scarecrows",but stay away from this crap.My rating:3/10.
