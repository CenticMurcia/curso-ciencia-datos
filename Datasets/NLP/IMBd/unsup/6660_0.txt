I'm a Mexican..and I'm a big fan of the Mexican cinematography./..but this movie really really blows it!! the scenes are too long!! there are like 15 minute scenes..!! the movie is slow..real slow and the acting is awful!! id rather watch this film with subtitles..though the artistic expression of the body and a way to reflect Mexico's problems. but yet the movie has no point!!! there's a scene where the driver is taking the passenger home (i cant remember her name now) and the scene is from Mexico airport to her home! thats like a 40 minute trip!! half of the movie goes there!!! now the nude scenes are great! though the idea of this film was good they didn't know how to put it together..one minute you're watching the entire process of putting gas to a car,walking the entire Zocalo DE Mexico. <br /><br />the reason why I'm giving it 2 stars are because this film is based in a non-Hollywood ideology. the sexual content in this flick is pretty strong and that makes it great!...unfortunately once you see it you wont find it that exciting
