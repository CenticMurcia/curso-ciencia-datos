I have numerous complaints about this film but most importantly I did not like the characters and did not understand their feelings, motivations or actions. The was no advancement of the plot or resolution of any issues. My interest in the film was only slightly raised by the interaction between Ribisi and the father. I am treating the 90 minutes I spent watching this as a "what not to do" primer for my own screenplay.
