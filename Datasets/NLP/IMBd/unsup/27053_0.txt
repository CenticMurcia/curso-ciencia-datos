I was lucky to see this film at a Fangoria Monster Monday screening and it was very good. The theater was sold out and a lot of the cast and crew were there. The music and sound effects were really good as well as the kill scenes an special effects make-up. I later learned during the Q&A that all the kill scenes were practical and no computer effects were used. I found the story very original and it kept me thinking and wanting to find out why everything was happening in the shoreline. The editing was cool with flash frames and quick cuts and the wittier and director did a great job to keep me on the edge of my seat most of the night. The acting was good for the most part and a few really stood out as well as the girls were really hot. One actress in particular was a mind boggling bombshell. She is unbelievable looking a worth the price of the ticket alone. Every great horror film needs a shower scene and this one has a great one with one of the most graphic kills and great camera angels I have ever seen. All in all this is definitely a film to see and recently I read it is being released through Lionsgate home video.
