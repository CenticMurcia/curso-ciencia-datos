OK, I know there is so many young American actors and they need somewhere to learn to act, or to be employed............... but this TV show called Invasion is more than a silly -stupid -boring -childish. Another American family drama but with Aliens inside........ But how those writers are stupid that is amusing... to whom you try to sell this stupidity? Aliens in sub marines, in lake in river in the houses in the abandoned sea ships...<br /><br />If is not aliens than a beasts or crocodile is... and of course the American studio lovely slender sophisticated voice patterns...<br /><br />I wouldn't give you a penny for this child show. But my local TV it seams have buy this shi..<br /><br />Sincerely, bu I would like the whole world see that this is plastic not a movie.
