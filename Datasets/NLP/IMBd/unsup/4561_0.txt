The first time I bought this DVD and the first time I watched it, I was cracking up so hard all the way through. Linkin Park has always been my favorite band and this DVD is another highlight of their remarkable career. Its too funny. Whoever didn't rate this movie 10 out of 10, has to get to know LP more, or needs to loosen up cause this movie is the bomb. It also has their videos from back in the day. And you can watch a secret thing where they're in London, and Mike breaks the table. I was laughing my butt off. You really really have to watch this DVD because its one of the funniest you will ever watch I Love LP Frat Party at the Pancake Festival
