first of all I would like to say I thought the movie was hilarious and it's one of my favorite movies today. I think critics are taking this movie way to seriously ...its a movie a comedy made for laughter and ones personal enjoyment don't come on here bashing it and saying rude things just because you didn't like it...frankly, I really don't care if you liked it or not because it was a good silly laugh out loud movie...my friends and I still quote this movie and laugh about the crazy scenes If people just want a feel good movie that'll make you laugh and give you and your friends something to do this movie is perfect...
