So I usually turn to IMDb before I go see a movie and IMDb usually is on point with its overall rating for a movie. However, when I took my girlfriend to see the Forbidden Kingdom it was painful to sit through the entire movie. I had only been let down once this horribly from the overall rating before on IMDb and that was with Across the Universe when it got a review of 4 out of 10, when I thought it was a work of art. The Forbidden Kingdom has a terrible story with awful dialogue. Poor visuals, "Keep an eye out for the background while they are sitting in the cave." Poor acting, horrible character development, lack luster computer graphics and etc. The main character only knows English, but ironically so does everyone he befriends in the Forbidden Kingdom... Those are just a few examples why I disliked this movie. On the bright side the kung fu was very well done and that is the strong point of the movie. I'm boggled at all the positive reviews and ratings this movie has received on IMDb. So the lesson learned is don't believe what you read on IMDb. So disregard this rant and go see it for yourself and be prepared to be disappointed.
