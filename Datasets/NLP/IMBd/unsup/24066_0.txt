i seen this film on TV yesterday an i have got to say, i never really like to put a film 'down' but this was bad everything about it. the acting was cardboard, the plot was mediocre and best of all the main actor look's like Eric Clapton! its a good job i never went the pictures to see this shoddy excuse of a film. if i had to make a comment on a positive side to this it would have to be the laughable side of it, at times i found myself cringing over the scenes. if anyone as to say this film was otherwise i think u would need your head testing :-)seens as this film was released in 1998 then maybe back then it would have been slightly better but not by much thanks for wasting my time hope this was useful to you D
