I like a good vampire film as much, if not more so, than the next person so imagine how I felt when I had the misfortune to see this so called 'artistic' effort. Out of focus passages and pretentious dialogue doesn't make something arty, it just serves to make it so boring as to be a complete waste of film. It brings nothing new to the genre in fact it only seems to repeat the same stale old clich√©s that have already been done to death - I mean female vampire as lesbian seducer? Now where have I seen that before? Oh just about every vampire film since the early 1970's!<br /><br />In one word - AVOID!
