Popular is most certainly worth your time and money. This show has intelligent story lines, great characters, and an atmosphere of high quality comedy. <br /><br />The show is well cast and addicting to say the least. Popular is not your pre-teen comedy that belongs on Disney Channel, but rather is geared for older teen/young adult and older. The theme is mature(sex/drugs), while still being light hearted and funny. <br /><br />What I love most about Popular, besides the addicting characters, is that each episode has a theme or purpose, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, cheating, STD's, body image, sexual harassment, meaning of Christmas, and of course the underlying theme is the meaning of Popularity and what people will do to be POPULAR!<br /><br />Although Popular only aired for two seasons, the reason the season two finale was a cliffhanger, was because there was originally going to be a third season, but the show was suddenly canceled, with no time to re-write the ending into a more satisfactory explanation. I was disappointed as well. <br /><br />I did some research and here is a list of what would have happened in season three....<br /><br />Brooke breaks every bone in her face after being in the accident. Yet when the bandages are revealed, she's exactly the same - except brunette. (Brooke was hit be Nicole)<br /><br />Harrison Chooses Brooke-then dates other eligible ladies<br /><br />Nicole says she was driven to alcohol (and driving drunk) after being sexually abused by Mike McQueen. <br /><br />Josh's addiction to cockfighting/gambling ruins his relationship with Lily, so he moves in with Harrison. <br /><br />Mary Cherry is accidentally sent to the pound and put up for adoption. She is claimed just before being put to sleep by Cherry Cherry after her twin B. Ho is gunned down in her "hood". <br /><br />Cherry Cherry starts teaching at Kennedy High--a little course called Madonna 101. Sugar starts a club for people that are discouraged about their weight to help them out. <br /><br />Brooke and Nicole become united once again to stop exchange student Unique Jones from ruling the school. <br /><br />Carmen becomes a nurse after the tragedy that happened to Brooke and becomes Sugar's girlfriend. <br /><br />Kennedy High is then sold and converted into a nursing home, forcing the students to leave for college early. <br /><br />Five years later - the 3rd season finale - Mary Cherry buys Melrose Place, where the entire gang live, spoofing that series. <br /><br />Murphy has also revealed that he and the WB entered into talks about a potential spin-off called "The Cherrys" which would have starred Delta Burke and Leslie Grossman as Cherry Cherry and Mary Cherry. Unlike Popular the show would have been a half hour sit-com and follow the Cherrys as they try to rebuild their lives after losing all the money and wealth.<br /><br />ABOVE IS COPYIED FROM-http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_(TV_series)
