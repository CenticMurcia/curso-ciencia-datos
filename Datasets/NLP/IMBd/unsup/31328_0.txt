O man I love this show I first watched it at the beginning of SERIES 2, it was Saturday and I wasn't going out anywhere, so I was flicking through the channels and i caught a glimpse of PAULEY PERRETTE'S character ABBY and i was like OMG she's so gorgeous and i watched it for the entire episode and became a devote fan, I have all the DVD's. its such a great show my friends constantly think its something like CSI rip off. and convinced that it is, and its silly because its such a great entertaining show. every character is likable from GIBBS, DUCKY, MCGEE, KATLIN(RIP), ZIVA and my two favourites ABBY & Denozo. thats one of the better things about this show, every character is likable and basically you got to watch the show yourself.
