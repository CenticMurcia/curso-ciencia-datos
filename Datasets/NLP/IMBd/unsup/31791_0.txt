Nirmal Kirtisinghe, I agree with you this is one TOP happy musical! I didn't like it as much as you did Nirmal, but I enjoyed it like you for the songs, happiness and for the fact that there are no unnecessary twists. <br /><br />Everyone should see it, even if they don't enjoy it afterwards. It's also a good introduction for the teenager world! <br /><br />Two teenagers called Sandy and Danny spend their summer together and are sad when they have to leave each other. However, when they realise they are at the same high school, things take a turn for the best - or for the WORST..?<br /><br />I recommend this for people who like good musicals, teenage life, being cool and (like you Nirmal said) happiness! :) :)
