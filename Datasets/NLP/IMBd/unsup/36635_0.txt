This message goes to all fans of The Pink Panther Series. Do not buy or even rent this horrible movie. I am a fan of pink panther films and when I finished the movie I was left crying and not they way the movie wants you to. I was sad that they ruined the series. I was sad because they killed Inspector. I mean, just because Peter Sellers died. I'm not saying that I'm not sad that he died it's just that I think that Peter Sellers would also not like this movie. The first part is very funny and original but by the time Inspetor Clouseau dies there is no comedy what so ever. Please fans do not watch this movie because it will ruin your idea of The Pink Panther for ever.
