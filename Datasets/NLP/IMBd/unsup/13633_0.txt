Drop Squad is ostensibly about a black man being brought back in touch with his roots through de-programming. However it's the audience who feels it has been kidnapped and forced to endure torture. There is yelling, screaming, and endless diatribes and it all feels aimed at the audience. I saw this movie at the theatre and everyone (about 25 people) walked out within the first half hour. Unfortunately for me I stayed the entire time. The film only got worse.
