You may probably remember how much I dislike Friedberg-Seltzer's spoof movies, and I have made no secret of it. I loathed Disaster Movie, Epic Movie was pretty much the same and while not as bad as the former two Meet the Spartans was pretty poor too. While mostly very unfunny, Date Movie is the best of these spoof movies, mainly because there are one or two decent gags and the fact Alyson Hannigan's in it. The focus is on romantic comedy, and admittedly spotting the references to My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Meet the Parents and When Harry Met Sally is occasionally fun, the latter was one of the better gags as well as the stunt on the motorcycle, but the scenes where they featured in were in general very overplayed. Also there are some very cheap laughs, a scene involving a diarrhoea-afflicted cat hardly is going to spark any wit or imagination now is it? The plot line is on the lame and predictable side, and the direction is next to non-existent. The acting isn't as atrocious as it was in Disaster Movie, which was a perfect example of how NOT to act in a movie, but a majority of it was lifeless. I like Alyson Hannigan, I confess when I was 10 I was addicted to Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and I think she was trying her best with superficial material. It is just that newcomer Adam Campbell is extremely unexciting as her new boyfriend, and Carmen Electra shows visibly here that she can't act. The remainder of the acting is unexceptional. All in all, it is not unbearably awful, but I doubt I would ever want to see this film again. 3/10 Bethany Cox
