this film isn't going to change your life. it's fun and camp in a butch kinda was. these guys can act and they look good too.<br /><br />the plot is simple and that is it's greatest flaw. there is almost a porn feel to it (or it could be that i've seen too much porn) and i'm getting confused.<br /><br />I wouldn't sell this an seminal gay movie but it's good to see something which is like a mainstream movie in which instead of a girl in a bra running away from the killer you get to see a cute guy scream and run away like a girl, *smile*. I actually seem this with a room full of straight men (well the vast majority) and it got a round of applause.<br /><br />keep 'em coming.......
