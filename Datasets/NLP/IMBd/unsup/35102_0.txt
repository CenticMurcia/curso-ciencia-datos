Squirm is a film that I first saw on Mystery Science Theater 3000 and I absolutely love that episode. It was just a terrific and hilarious one that will always give me a good laugh. Now believe it or not, I later found this film in the 5 dollar bin at Wal Mart and figured, why not? This movie was just so laughable, why not watch it and make up my own sarcasm. Well, when I watched the uncut version, actually I have to in some ways admit that this wasn't the worst film ever made, worthy of MST3K sarcasm, but I would say that the problems are minor and the film just needs a band-aid, lol. The music and southern accents are just a bit much.<br /><br />Mick is coming to Fly Creek for a good country vacation and meeting an old friend, Geri. There was a nasty storm the night before and electricity hit the ground hard causing the worms to turn into killers. Mick and Geri, along with her creepy neighbor who is a mixture of Steve Young and Alvin the Chipmunk have to learn how to deal with it. But the worms are going to destroy the town and hopefully tone down the southern accents.<br /><br />Squirm isn't necessarily a bad movie, well, I think it's one of those movies that it's so bad that it's actually good. Just the way the actors present a lot of the lines are a little distracting and get a good unintentional laugh like "Yer gonna be da worm face!" was said a little oddly. This is a great Mystery Science Theater 3000 episode I would recommend, but as a film, it's worth a look if you're into a cheesy drive in flick type of movie, otherwise, don't expect too much.<br /><br />3/10
