Absolutely Horrible! Where to start? I wanted to turn off the movie from about 10 minutes in but I keep watching, hoping the movie would get better but it just got worst. All the characters are new actors except Luke Malby. I was really disappointed by the new actors of both Soren, Paige and the Queen. Paige was just too fru fu for the Paige that was introduced during the first one. Soren acted way too serious then tried being the comedic relief. But it just didn't work. And the queen wasn't mean enough when Paige screwed up as she did in the first movie. The acting is bad, the story line is bad and even the handsome prince is ugly. The whole budget seems to be about $100 because the clothes were cheap looking and the hair and makeup was horrible. I absolutely hated the way that they did Paige's hair in the movie. Luke Mably comes across as a whiny snob of a prince that was the complete opposite of the guy everyone liked in the first movie. DO NOT EVEN WASTE TIME PICKING UP THE MOVIE OFF THE SHELF!!!!
