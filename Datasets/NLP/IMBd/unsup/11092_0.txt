I nearly gave this a miss because of its inane title, poor reviews, and unknown (to me anyway) actors and Director. Thank god I didn't.(Brody was Brilliant). This wasn't a "buried alive movie". The lack of Oxygen aspect was a sub plot to what was happening between Tierney and Brody, Tierney and Kinney, and Tierney and her... Friend??? Until reading other users comments I didn't realise it was a "small town production". In the hands of the Silence of the Lambs crew this would have been a big psycho thriller. More would have been made of the "Alone" interview, which could have been a precursor to a much more masochistic violent ending. This film was a few rewrites short of being a very good film. If it had been made in the fifties we would be calling it a classic.
