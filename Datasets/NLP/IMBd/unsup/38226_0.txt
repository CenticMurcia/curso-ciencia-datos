A decent thriller starring David Janssen as a security consultant hired by Swiss bank owner Ray Milland to find out who is trying to blackmail the bank by exposing secret account information. Janssen suspects an inside job and is charged with protecting bank customer Senta Berger. John Saxon, John Ireland and Elke Sommer pop up as various suspects. Janssen is his usual stolid self and Berger is stunning, though really has nothing to do but flirt with Janssen. Ireland and Saxon overact wildly in their brief roles. The direction (by Jack Arnold!) is strictly journeyman work, with a few car chases and one too many dull shoot-outs. The whole thing is tied together nicely in the end. The screeching and over-used music is by Klaus Doldinger.
