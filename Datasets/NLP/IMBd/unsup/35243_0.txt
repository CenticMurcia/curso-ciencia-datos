I saw this yesterday on video under the highly misleading title of Murder Reincarnated. <br /><br />It might actually be the most boring straight to video thriller I have ever seen. <br /><br />The lead actor seems like he's positioning himself as the next Jean Claud Van Damme--he's got the physique and accent but, unfortunately for him, the role is entirely dialogue driven and he can't act at all, at least not in English. <br /><br />The script is laughable, the production values non-existent and the movie is nothing but talk, talk, talk. Avoid unless you want to watch a supposedly thoughtful and uplifting exploration of the idea of reincarnation disguised as a thriller.
