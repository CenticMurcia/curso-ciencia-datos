Wow, I like to think myself an open minded individual, capable of finding humor in things others might find tasteless or even downright repugnant. But I guess I was a little surprised by this flick.<br /><br />I'll do my best not to give anything away here: the first 40 minutes I found entertaining and downright creative. After that though...it took something of a downward spiral.<br /><br />I got the feeling several times in this film, that when the writers reached a crossroads as to where the plot should turn next, they just said, "F*ck it. What's the most outlandish thing we could do?" Well, what this resulted in was a crappy, discontinuous film with a horrible, horrible ending.<br /><br />This film had some potential to begin with, but ultimately I wouldn't waste your time with this one. A movie with a bad ending like this one is kind of like trying Pepsi One: The concept is intriguing, and at first it doesn't seem half-bad. But the horrible aftertaste left in its wake ultimately doesn't make it worth trying in the first place. Wow! How's that for a simile? 4/10<br /><br />Go Sun Devils!
