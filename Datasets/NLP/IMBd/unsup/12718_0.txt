The story was not compelling at all. I found myself noticing all of the inconsistencies instead. The one that really bothered me is when Salma Hyak is moving out after the wedding fiasco. I don't know a single person who would pack their stuff without tying their hair. I'm supposed to be sympathising, but instead I find them petty and senseless, and all I notice is her perfectly parted hair while she's packing.<br /><br />If it holds my interest like that, it's can't be good. I would have loved a better accent from Russell Crowe, or no accent at all. That was something that kept grating on me because of points in the film where I totally lost interest.<br /><br />You are never led understand why their motivations really make sense, or why their feelings are so capricious and petty. Ultimately, you end up with two frustrating people in a pointless relationship that is a circle of hope and failure over and over again.<br /><br />The fact that the ending left it open for them to get back together was also disturbing. It shows what vapid morons the characters are if they couldn't realise they were right for each other all along and now have to drag their innocent spouses and offspring into divorces. I can't root for people who keep doing the wrong thing, hurting each other, then possibly hurting innocent people who trusted them.<br /><br />In fact, they're to awful, perhaps they do deserve each other before they ruin their families any more than they would. I wanted to identify with this movie, but I just couldn't because I am not a clod.
