I enjoy this movie - it's funny but while the acting is really stiff - very little really comes across as other than line-reading- in everything else the movie rings pretty true. If the actors didn't open their mouths you could get the idea that you were watching film of a few real people. Warren Oates plays his role low-key but he does come across better in the acting department. Frankly I can't quite get why anyone in the movie would have been attracted to that hitchhiker babe; even Oates was having fantasies about settling down with her and building them a house. Why on earth? She seemed like a total downer.<br /><br />I'll let everyone else provide the balance of the reviews and I'll just add my favorite quote: GTO (Warren Oates) is talking up the two guys with the 55 and their car, with a guy in a small-town diner. There's a bit of antagonism going on. When GTO leaves, the other guy in the diner says, "Sure did talk to ya." GTO says "Sure did see ya." About the coolest two way slam possible....
