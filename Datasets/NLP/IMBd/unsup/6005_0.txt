I'm a great fan of polish cinematography, although I have to watch all these movies subtitled. However, I was told that "Chlopaki nie placza" is the worst movie ever. I've seen it, and I have to say: One of the most hilarious movies ever made! I can promise you will find this film amusing, when you'll see 'Laska' coming home, reminiscing his dad or 'Grucha' wearing his pink sweater and falling in love with the prostitute. Many people may have a lot of criticisms about this film; that it shows a very silly story or that it is a copy of Tarantino's "Pulp Fiction". Well maybe it is. But it definitely works for this film. MUST BE SEEN!!!
