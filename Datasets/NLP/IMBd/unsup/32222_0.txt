I especially like the gag at the end of the segment with Gene Wilder, the doctor who has an affair with a sheep. He's shown on skid row, drinking Woolite from a brown paper bag.<br /><br />Also Carradine's mad scientist who brags that he was the first to discover the correlation between masturbation and political careers (how true)!<br /><br />And Woody as a court jester-as-stand-up-comic: "It's great to be back here at the Palace."<br /><br />Not one of Allen's best, but it has its worthwhile moments once you get past the concept.
