This movie made me think, laugh, cry and most of all smile. Newcomers, Ali Hillis and Drew Fuller, did a magnificent job in the role of Alexia and Jason. I hope to see them both in more leading roles in the near future. Abigail B. is just brilliant. I love that child! Hats off to the entire cast. They were all perfect in their given roles. I know the film is based on a Christian novel, and being a Christian, I was glad to see a film of this caliber make it to the big screen. The message is clear, simple and one that we can all learn from...believer or not. Thanks to everyone involved in getting this film to the big screen. It was truly a touching and inspirational movie.
