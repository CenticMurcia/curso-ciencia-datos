This film had very little to offer anyone that appreciates good movies. It might seem silly to say, this being a remake of a haunted house movie, but there was no plot to be found, nor were there any worthy likable characters. It is just another bad remake. Hopefully producers will start actually trying to find new scripts to shoot.
