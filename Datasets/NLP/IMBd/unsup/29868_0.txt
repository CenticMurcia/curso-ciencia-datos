I couldn't believe that I was seeing Charles Durning, Marc Singer, Dennis Hopper and Mike Madsen in such an incredibly asinine movie. The only reason I watched it to the end was that I might see at least one or two good scenes that might redeem it. This didn't happen. <br /><br />As a former Law Enforcement Officer, I was appalled to see the Los Angeles Police Department portrayed as a group of bumbling buffoons and gangsters. Equally bumbling was the direction of this movie. Example: Minor cast members awkwardly gawking about sets, obviously lacking experience as to how to fit in with a scene. Don't waste your time with this one. It isn't even fit for falling asleep on.
