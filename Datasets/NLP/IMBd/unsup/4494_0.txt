This film is another dark, gloomy boxing story that's populated with unsavory characters, crooked managers and losers. John Garfield is just right as the tough, gritty boxer who wants a better life for his proud but needy mother and his fianc√© whom he seems to take for granted. Garfield is also insecure and needs the approval of his rigid, unyielding mother who disapproves of his career choice and would prefer to see her son become a success in another profession. Domestic strife seems to be a way of life for the unhappy boxer who finds self-worth and expression in only the ring. Another plot angle details tension between Garfield and his mother over his girlfriend who doesn't meet the demanding mother's high standards. The scenes of Garfield and Canada Lee in the ring are very realistic and brutal.
