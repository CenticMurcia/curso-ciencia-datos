I watched all of the TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE movies in a row recently. TCM 1 and TCM 2 are amazing films. Filled with energy, dark humor and unforgettable moments, imagery and characters. So when I watched LEATHERFACE TCM 3, I was underwhelmed. In fact, I have to say that TCM 3 is the definition of a flat, boring movie. This TCM movie has little to do with Tobe Hooper's movies. Except for Leatherface, none of the previous characters from the Hooper movies are present. They even decided to add a little girl and a mother to the family. The other characters from the family are confusing. Who are or were they?!?! But for a movie called LEATHERFACE, the character of Leatherface is remarkably flat and boring. He comes across as Jason from the FRIDAY THE 13TH series, or The Undertaker from WWF. And his mask is terrible. Leatherface in this movie is not the Leatherface we all know and love from the Hooper movies. And the other characters, the victims, are annoying or trite. And to make things even more flat, the movie wasn't even shot in Texas. Looks like California to me.<br /><br />I'm hesitating to call LEATHERFACE TCM 3 the worst TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE movies because I watched TCM 4 after this one. But even so, this "sequel" is not worth watching. It's flat, uninspired and boring. And those are its good qualities.
