I loved this movie. Since viewing her in "The Parent Trap" last year, Lindsay Lohan has become one of my favorite actresses. She has some of the most incredible talent at age 14. Tyra Banks also did a fine job at portraying the doll named Eve. Wonder if this movie will come out on either VHS or DVD? Like all movies that appeared on "Wonderful World of Disney", this probably will.
