There are few movies in the Cinemaverse, which can top the detritus of Andy Warhol, and I mean that, in the reverse. His films were the worst kind of popular tripe, the dialog so bad that it equates unintentional camp, the sets so cheesy that most of his works were filmed in someone's garage.<br /><br />And then there's Andy Warhol's Dracula. This one tops the rest as far as how BAD a movie can be. Some have called it original, creative, even a "loose" adaptation of Bram Stoker's masterpiece. I'm here to tell you that these descriptions are NOT the case.<br /><br />This work is pure garbage! There is NOTHING, not ONE redeeming quality about this "movie." Don't waste your time. You'd have more enjoyment from a root canal.<br /><br />It rates a 2.2/10 from...<br /><br />the Fiend :.
