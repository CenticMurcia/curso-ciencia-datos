STINKS! "The Lot" is a nerdy attempt to be provocative and profane. I've seen better high school plays. The Lot is a "cue-card" enactment loaded with wooden performances throughout. (Performances???) This series, in which each episode runs less than a half hour, and in which uses up nearly four and a half minutes for head titles and end credits over live action, tends to appear historically incorrect, or shall we say inaccurate, in its pretense to portray popular celebs of the day. This company's research department missed the boat when it comes to certain actual events and even, in one episode, makes mention of a mouthwash product that didn't "make the scene" until the mid-'60s. Don't forget the time-frame here is supposed to be the late '30s. This series is so bad, I doubt it could pass as "noon-time soaper" material. (My opinion, of course) I watch just to see how ostentatiously bad it can get. (Who could love a studio that is run by a sweaty Tor Johnson lookalike?) Your juxtapositions aren't working, Mitz. (Again, just my opinion)
