This film is a mood piece about the complexities and nature of love. The characters are interesting, with the main protagonist (Daniel Craig, actor) pondering love, along with other internal and interpersonal mysteries. This search at times puts his relationship with his significant other (Samantha Morton, actress) at risk. A compelling story combined with breathtaking cinematography, especially of the countryside, along with evocative music that follows the dynamic range from tuneful, haunting bucolic melodies to more strident dissonance, and profoundly natural and nuanced acting performances come together to craft an unforgettable cinematic experience. Rhys Ifans is an actor of Protean skill, and has a knack for choosing off beat and interesting roles, his role in this film being no exception. I highly recommend this film as a provocative and original work of art.
