There are no words to describe this movie. I found it hillarious and heartwarming. The two principle actors were great as their roles as Ben and Andie. Kate Hudson was great at driving Ben nuts. I laughed for days.<br /><br />I loved the soundtrack too. It had classics and modern day classics.<br /><br />I feel this movie will go down as a classic with such films as Pretty Woman and Dirty Dancing.
