A brilliant and economically photographed character study. Other users have commented on plot, on this and that, whatever. Please note the gentle use of foreshadowing and diversion (or red herrings) throughout the film. I must see it again for this very reason. The obvious uses are the digitally filmed closeup shots in low-light of skin in Roman church art masterpieces leading up to the parallel shots of skin when the actors touch ... but note in particular the clenched hand on the sheet at the end of that scene, to be followed later by a montage of clenched hands on ancient statuary (interspersed with an angel) and the almost penultimate shot of a hand at the denouement .... Cinematic style, very specific choices of music, and such foreshadowing all enhance an intriguing character study of an individual descending into emotional turmoil with superbly subtle directorial style. The scene in the bar with the barmaid when Bruce explains love -- and the final scene alone are worth the price of admission for eloquently filmed and acted moments of understated emotion.
