Why is it that some directors let us their name to promote bad movies, Do they get well payed or what? This movie here is an example of a bad one promoted by Wes Craven. It starts of pretty well with a couple getting lost at sea, seeing an island and getting ashore. The dump blond of course go wandering around in the forest and gets attacked by some dogs. The end of the girl. That really is the best part of this bad movie. Then we see the arrival of friends, and of course they got beaten by the breed. First of all, there isn't anything spectacular in this movie, no gore, almost no blood no suspense. What we get is a lot of blah blah and some showing off of the skills of Rodriguez. You can see the killings coming from miles away. Why the dogs are on the island is silly. When an arrow hits the leg of a girl there's no blood running and in the next scene's she's just walking and running around. Well Wes, if you still are promoting those kind of horrors then surely this will be your last appearance on the set, got it?
