'After Hours' is a really dark, nightmarish comedy and is one of Martin Scorsese's most enjoyable films. Griffin Dunne is perfection as the computer operator who meets lovely but ditsy Rosanna Arquette in a diner and arranges to meet her late one night. His journey to downtown New York goes hideously wrong when he loses his taxi fare and spends the rest of the evening trying to get home. Along the way we meet feisty Linda Fiorentino, whimsical Verna Bloom, Gorgeous but hysterical Teri Garr and Dusty Springfield look alike Catherine O'Hara. We also get to witness suicide, murder, robbery and vigilante mobs in this tale of big city madness. The camera-work is stupendous and features every trick in the book. There is much to admire in this film and thankfully it now has a DVD release with a commentary by the Director and star.
