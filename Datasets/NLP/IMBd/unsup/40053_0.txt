Vengeance of the Zombies is a head on collision of seven different horror genres. A hodge podge of gore, nudity, black gloved killers, voodoo, Satanism, surrealism , and unintentional camp. Naschy plays a dual role as the good Indian Guru Krishna,and his evil twisted and deformed voodoo doll making, Satan worshiping , masked killer of a brother. Obviously the plot is muddled. It reminds me of the old poverty row horror films but filtered through the distorted mind of Jess Franco. The most Franco like aspect of the film however is the jazzy score, which remarkably made the film a lot more tolerable for me. Naschy tosses in a few homages here, he's doing Blood and Black Lace in one scene, Curse of the Crimson Altar in another, things that are fun to spot. If you are in search for a good "bad" horror film with everything but the kitchen sink tossed in then you won't do much better than this.
