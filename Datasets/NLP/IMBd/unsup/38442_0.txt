This film was an insult to the intelligence of the viewers.<br /><br />The plot is that this police department has an investigator who is an expert of Teeth. So he's called out on a case where a bunch of teeth are left on a silver platter. Soon we are enmeshed in a movie where a bunch of creepy kids are involved in a plot to bring about the "Apocolypse" by mangling the scripture.<br /><br />Okay, here's the plot twist. Ziyi Zhang (who is a 30 year old playing a teen...) gives herself up in the murder of her adoptive mother. Now, oddly, this police department apparently has a dental expert, but doesn't have the computer experts or psychological experts to pick this girl's life apart, figure out who her associates are, including the son of the lead detective.<br /><br />Now, I'm sorry, if you are a detective, you have to be pretty poor at your job to not realize that your kid is seriously messed up. Yet he hasn't been in the kid's room in three years? Come on. No cop in the world is that dense... You just don't understand police mentality. Policemen tend to be overly suspicious of everyone they encounter. That's the point.
