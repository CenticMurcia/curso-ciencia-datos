I was very moved by the personal stories in the film. The movie had suspense, emotion, music, and drama, which I didn't expect from a political film. I think the movie can be very useful for communities trying to understand the legal process of changing gay marriage laws, and the personal ramifications of the changes themselves. As we left the movie tonight, my husband said, "That was much better than I expected it to be." We were both very impressed by the professionalism of this film. I hope it makes it to the big screens.<br /><br />I really like documentaries. I would put this one right up with Michael Moore's and Jesus Camp for bringing home an issue in a very personal, and profound way. Great job.<br /><br />The only small complaint I have about this film is that the scenes with the political election near the end seems to go on too long. I would love to see that edited some more, and then an update on what has happened since. The film needs a more dramatic ending, but 99% of it was stellar film-making, in my book.<br /><br />I wish them well with this extremely important subject.
