So here we have an Adam Sandler drama parading around as an Adam Sandler comedy. That's all fair and well right? Well it would be, if Adam Sandler was a dramatic actor.<br /><br />By now, you most likely know what this film is about. If you don't, Adam Sandler, an overworking father, is given a universal remote by a man named Morty (Christopher Walken) who seemingly works in the back of a Bed, Bath, & Beyond. However, this is no normal remote. No, this universal remote can actually control Sandler's universe. This means muting rants given by his wife Donna (a stunning Kate Beckinsale) and fast-forwarding through showers and sex. Soon, though, Sandler discovers that the remote may actually be a wolf in sheep's clothing.<br /><br />Here is the main problem with Click. It was sold as a comedy. Well it isn't funny. And the dramatic element? It isn't very well done. Sandler just doesn't have the chops to pull off an about face half way through the film. He doesn't make the character of Michael sympathetic enough. So when it comes time to sympathize with him, we can't.<br /><br />Maybe it's just me. It seemed that half the audience I saw this with was sobbing through the last half hour. Maybe I'm too critical. Or, on the other hand, maybe the audience was not very discerning.<br /><br />Whatever the case, Click didn't work for me. I didn't like Sandler. I didn't like the comedic or dramatic elements. In fact, the only things saving this were Kate Beckinsale, who I would watch sit in a chair for 90 minutes and Christopher Walken, who always turns in a fair performance.<br /><br />4/10: Your time could be better spent in another film.
