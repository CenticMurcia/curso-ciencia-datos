I can forgive a lot of flaws in a movie, but whew, this one was bad. I can't think of worse casting than Sandler. Everybody else was great (well, Cloris Leachman took the drunk-mom clich√© about as far as it would go), but Sandler's presence here ruined it. "50 First Dates" worked a lot better for him -- the semi-goofy guy who manages to charm the lady by virtue of his imperfection. Here, he's trying to be a charming saint of a married chef, "doing the best he can," not having any idea of how attractive he is to a woman. The only problem is, he's NOT attractive. I felt no chemistry between Flor and John. The whole concept of one culture finding a common ground just gets lost here. This is mainly because Sandler is so completely inarticulate, it's very hard to believe that a woman who's barely learned English can understand anything he says. Two devices that repeat themselves over and over here are 1-Sandler suddenly shouting out something in the middle of a conversation, which either scares Flor or amuses her, and 2-Sandler yelling "Whoa, wait-wait-wait..." every time a conversation is about to reach its merciful conclusion and the other person is trying to walk away gracefully.<br /><br />Leoni does a good job with Deborah, but still, her character is so two-dimensional. We get no sense of why she's so dysfunctional. Meredith Baxter-Birney did a much better job in a Lifetime TV movie about a bulimic. I think someone must have watched that movie and tried to model Leoni's character after it.<br /><br />I would have liked to see more of Flor's side of town, to give it added depth. It seems as if very little thought went into any aspect of this film -- casting, screen writing, direction, anything. For me, it's nada.
