When i start watching "Blue Hill Avenue", my expectations were low(Because it was an independent movie and the quality of the camera was a little bad),but i was wrong. The plot is just awesome and the actors make an excellent work. I really felt the same emotions and adrenaline that the carachters.<br /><br />It's a wonderful Drama/Action movie that everyone should see and it's really a shame that it's so over rated.<br /><br />My final classification is 7 out of 10. It's a powerful movie, with a very good storyline and an excellent acting.<br /><br />A Must-see of Independent movies.
