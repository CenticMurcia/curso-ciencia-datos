I loved Woo-ping's and Jackie Chan's Drunken Master, packed with some of the best fighting (especialy the drunken boxing) you will ever see on film. The only thing I didn't liked about that movie was the strange and simple humour. Well... Drunken Tai Chi is full of that! Stupid slapstick complete with the stupid sound effects that go along with that. Ok, there are some great fight scenes. Donnie Yen is one of the best kickers! But there is too many unapealing slapstick. And you will never forget the image of Donnie Yen dressed like a puppet BREAKDANCING!<br /><br />And now for the biggest disapointment... THERE IS NO DRUNKEN BOXING! It's about a tai chi master that is drunk most of the time. If you want to see some drunken boxing see Drunken Master, Drunken Master 2!!! or even Jet Li's Last hero in China!
