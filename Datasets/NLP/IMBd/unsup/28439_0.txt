A new Horror/Western, thank God. This Halloween brings us a treat within a treat, The legend of 'Bloody Bill' Anderson is true up until today. The first things you notice is the great soundtrack and the film ( camera angles, etc.) itself is engaging. Byron (The Killers) Werner was DP and Director, was trying to nail down has camera-style, very avante gardeMTV2 or NuSkool. The theme is like ' Brigadoon meets Rob Zombie ',or how about 'Gone With The Wind on METH !'These are close, trust meI'm a critic for god-sakes. The cast is very good, with few exceptions- Jeremy Bouvet, 'World Martial Arts Champion' plays the title character BLOODY BILL as a foreboding franchise. Gregory Bastien, steals the show as 'a cocaine as a steroid' anti-hero .One of the funniest names in show business, and She pronounces it in 'making of' segment is Denise Boutte ( say BOOTY) and she has ample. Comments would be, DON'T EAT during this film, seriously, You will regret it, makeup rocks ! Some racial slurs and images (Which I will NOT go into) push the envelope of good taste, and YES , I know It's a Zombie Movie, blah-blah. Some of the religious symbolism, was most welcome. Ending was suspenseful and NEW.
