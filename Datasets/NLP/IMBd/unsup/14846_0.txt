Simply, Harsh Realm is overall a thoughtless show with a potentially good premise. But, it fails harshly in writing because of clich√©s and weak characters. The reasoning behind the main character is flawed which made m lose interest immediately. <br /><br />Sorry, there are many more traps which Harsh Realm has seemingly stuck its head into that I could go on, and I should go on, but it is so bad I have no energy to even waste my time trying to communicate the details of finger painting with feces.<br /><br />Trust your instinct and never watch or mention this film because it does not deserve any recognition.
