"Dracula: Dead and Loving It" is a sad reminder of a great career bottoming out. Mel Brooks could do no wrong with his first 5 movies. Then the decline began. "The Producers" is a comedy classic. "The 12 Chairs" is a little seen gem. "Blazing Saddles" and "Young Frankenstein" created a superb one-two punch in 1974. And "Silent Movie" is wonderfully inventive.<br /><br />Then came "High Anxiety", Brooks' tribute to Hitchcock. It has its moments but fell short of expectations. "History of the World Part I" also has its moments but parts are greater then the whole. "Spaceballs" was made ten years later then it should have been. "Life Stinks" offers a good theme about being homeless, but his comic moments seem out of place. "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" was a near disaster.<br /><br />Now we come to this film. It is easily the worst film Brooks has made and it is no wonder (at this date) he has not made a film since. Maybe Brooks lost his touch. Or his brand of humor just doesn't belong in this day and age. Whatever the reason we are subjected to 90 minutes of tired jokes and a weary looking Leslie Nielsen in the title role.<br /><br />There was potential here but it all went wrong. And Brooks even blew the title. "Dead and Loving It"??? He could have come up with an apt title that also descibes this film. "Dracula Sucks".
