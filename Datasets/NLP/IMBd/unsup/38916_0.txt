With all the hype around this show and its being heralded as a great Canadian sitcom, I have tried to like this show. Oh, have I tried. But I just can't. Am I missing something? The acting is not good, the jokes are bad, the humour is dumb. I actually amuse myself by playing the "3 joke game" when I happen to flip across Corner Gas. The "3 joke game" involves enduring the show for 3 jokes, and seeing if I find any one of them remotely funny. I never have. I just find the whole thing unbearably dumb. There is nothing smart or edgy about it - it basically goes for silly, safe, cheesy humour. Maybe that's why it has such broad appeal.
