I'll be brief: <br /><br />1) The movie has a great opening scene (except for the fact that the bed jumped a lot...) <br /><br />2) Devon Sawa was not excellent, but he did a good job "playing" with his hand.<br /><br />3) Vivica A. Fox is really a fox.. but, so what? She was ridiculous in that movie... I don't understand why a person who made a blockbuster as ID4 (I'm not telling it is a good movie, just is a blockbuster) agrees to join such a horrible movie. <br /><br />4) To be fair, I laughed in some scenes, but in overall the movie is really awful. <br /><br />5) If you do not like Offspring, stick with this movie and be satisfied with what the hand does. <br /><br />2/10. Addam's Family is so much better...
