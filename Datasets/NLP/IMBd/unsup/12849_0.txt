I am not one to sit down and write out my own personal review of a film. However, seeing the last review which was posted for "Easy", I felt compelled to get that ridiculous "east coast" "family values" freak's comments off the screen (jerk!) and recommend this film to women everywhere. It's a delightful, fun, realistic look at a young woman's journey of love. I believe the main character's (Jamie)behavior reflects many young women's today (especially those of us who were raised without a caring mother, or no mother altogether). Jamie is a young woman exploring her sexuality, her creativity and mostly love. Searching for, and understanding what love is, is I believe the primary quest of every person (young and old alike). This film is NOT "west coast" or "liberal". It's just a very realistic look at a 20-something woman struggling with growing up and being used by men...until she learns she can control her own choices, her body and ultimately her destiny.
