Well, Technically because according to rumors had it that It was suppose to be an education cartoon about Homosexuals. Spongebob always Acts happy because He's gay Well, I don't know why but I think He and Patrick are boyfriends. I mean I know it doesn't seem true but 99% of time proves it all. Its show was for Teenagers and all, Most Parents Complain that it Influences Gay/Lesbian. But however its not really true. For some reason People Just Spread rumors everywhere saying that Its gay and all. I've seen a few Episodes of this Cartoon before but really Hate to admit it but I agree with the Angry Mob. There were some Episodes that May contain Themes that Encourages some sort of sign. For example The One episode that Spongebob and Patrick were Hugging each other. Besides from that Episode, There's another one about The FUN Song that made Some People Mad and Angry. Technically, Spongebob is Stereotypical gay person in the show. Even though He does karate in a way that makes people wonder "Why is he wearing those Things?" Let's face it, Spongebob acts different than most Cartoon Character in Nick and a better show other than this Show is "Danny Phantom" One more thing, People Shows like this is going to be a huge success Unless You tell your friends not to watch such crap. and your friends will spread Other People across the world...
