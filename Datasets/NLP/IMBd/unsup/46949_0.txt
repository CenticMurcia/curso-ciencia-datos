This movie rates a whopping 3 stars because I like SMG. In addition to that no one fell down and I could understand all of the dialogue. Besides that, it was easily the worst movie I have seen in a long, long time. The acting compared to a bad high school play and the music was poorly selected. Music is supposed to add to the movie and bring everything together. However, it was loud and never seemed to blend into the story. Perhaps that was because there was no story. <br /><br />The "story" is about a 24 year old woman (yeah right, try 30+) with daddy issues who can't get ahead in the novel editing business, who meets an overpaid legend in the field. He is only 26 years older than her and is possibly the most boring man in the history of books (and that says a lot). For some reason, that is never explained, she falls in love with him. Then it goes into the classic, boy screws up and loses girl, girl questions judgment, boy wins back girl, blah, blah, blah. We've seen this before in every other romantic comedy ever made. Oh, but I almost forgot; there is no comedy. The only difference in the story are his grandpa like qualities. Frankly, it was more disturbing that it was romantic. <br /><br />For having such large actors, it was extremely disappointing. It was filled with forced humor, fake crying and bad "Frasier" style white words on a black background scene transitions. The difference was that it worked in "Frasier."<br /><br />This movie was about as exciting as watching an intense game of pong. Stay away at all costs. Do something more productive with your time like having a deep conversation with your mother in law.
