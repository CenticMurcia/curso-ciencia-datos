I agree that this flick barely warrants removing it from the reel canister, but nowadays we have videotape and DVDs. I picked this one up to add to my collection of "biker" films and it fits the bill. The main focus of the movie is motorcycle riding rebels who just want to tear up the town (or in this case, movie set). The interesting thing is that they aren't riding the typical choppers and wearing cut-off denim jackets. No, it's dirt bikes, helmets and leather pants for these guys. Typical plot, typical amateur acting and typical 70's cinematography. But, a film that biker film addicts will enjoy. Watch for the two character actors you have seen a hundred times before.
