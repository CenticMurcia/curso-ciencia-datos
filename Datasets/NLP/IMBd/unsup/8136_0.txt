Saw this film when it came out, more than a quarter century ago. Nothing spectacular, but a good, enjoyable thriller, about a British team (led by Roger Moore, slightly out of character as a serious, sober and somewhat eccentric government agent) trying to overtake an oil platform in the North Sea that has been hijacked by a band of terrorists (led by the late, unforgettable Anthony Perkins, in one of his nervous, unsettling performances). The great James Mason also appears as one of the top admirals of the British navy. A good, solid thriller overall. A female prime minister (an obvious stand-in for then premier Margaret Thatcher) congratulates Bond (er, Roger Moore) at the end.
