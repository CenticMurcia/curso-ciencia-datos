The story is hard to understand. The relationships of the characters are in a mess. It seem to me that they are all related some how. But other than good vs evil, I don't get much else. The nudity is a little over done; most of the scene are unnecessary. The only thing good about it is the two energetic school girls in this animation and there are some funny moments from them. (However, my favorite character is the magic dog that transformed into a long hair, short skirt girl.)
