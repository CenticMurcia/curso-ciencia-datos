Grand hotel is one of the best films I've ever seen. It's romantic, tragic, funny and completely irresistible. The plot is great. The story would even make a good screenplay today. And the actors are brilliant. Garbo shines as the lonely ballerina, and gives the best performance in the movie. There's something so sparkling and human about her acting. I fall in love with her everytime she's seen on screen... and this movie is no exception.<br /><br />As for the rest of the cast; they're great!! Although Joan Crawfords character is a bit anonymous. But her talent and beauty makes the most of it!!<br /><br />Highly recommended
