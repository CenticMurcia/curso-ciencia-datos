Since this is now out on DVD, none of you have any excuse for not having seen it. When it comes to assassins, Golgo 13 is the man. Period. (He's not too shabby with the ladies either.) After completing one of his jobs, a hit on a powerful and very connected businessman's son, he becomes the target for revenge. Killing Golgo 13, though, is no easy task at all. The story here is solid, with some great moments (like the ending), cool sub-plots, twisted characters, and plenty of bloody action. The execution of this classic (1983) anime is, in a word, stylish. Freeze frames, split screens, and other such techniques are prevalent throughout. There's also a noirish feel to much of the film, often accompanied by soft, bluesy-type music. Of course, being made so many years ago, much of it seems dated (especially the very early CGI helicopters) but for me, it's a minor complaintÂ…the movie still rocks hard. Check it out. Now. (If you don't have a proper audio system, I recommend changing the track on the DVD to mono to avoid a tinny echo sound on the voices.)
