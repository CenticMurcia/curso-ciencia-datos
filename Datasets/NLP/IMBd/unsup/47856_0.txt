It could be funny.<br /><br />It could be really funny, but she has to overdo her sexist, racist humor to the point where it's overkill.<br /><br />Is that her best material? I'm no prude, saint or pervert, but she is short on the jokes and big on the insults.<br /><br />Her excuse is it's not racist if she pokes jokes at everybody...well it's not funny either.<br /><br />There is an entire world full of stupid happenings and events that can be funny aside from just people's nationalities or skin color or sexual orientation.<br /><br />10 minutes is far more than enough of this humor...an hour or so is by far too much.<br /><br />Is the President or Vice President not doing retarded stuff any longer? Is George Bush all of a sudden a smart, generous, friendly person whit a heart of gold? Is there no events of traffic problems or confusion of sorts that can trigger some comment about daily life? Do I need to hear every 3 minutes about the size of you boyfriend's dick? Or how often you get laid or how a gay man is a fag? It's no longer funny when it's boring...and it gets boring quite easily.<br /><br />Comedy is not easy to do and her show is not easy to watch unless you are truly a hillbilly with little sense and respect for anybody else.
