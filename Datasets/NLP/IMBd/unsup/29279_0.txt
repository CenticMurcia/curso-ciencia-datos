This is one of the craziest and most entertaining episodes ever on CSI.<br /><br />Sometimes the Las Vegas CSI show is bent more on humor than it is drama and crime-solving. Sometimes it works; sometimes it doesn't. It dd here, big-time, in the case of an ex-boxer found dead in a pool at a brothel somewhere outside Las Vegas. Man, this guy was hard to kill! How he's killed turns out to be an outrageous series of events. I'll say one thing for the victim: he was one tough dude!<br /><br />Meanwhile, every time "Lt. Brass" thinks he's solved the case, "Doc Robbins" has bad news for him. "Doc" keeps finding out new ways the boxer became a corpse. The autopsy keeps changing and it gets very comical. Robert David Hall ("Doc") is always good as the medical examiner. I don't know how much "fame" he gets from this role, but it's not enough. He's really fascinating, every time he's on screen.<br /><br />Another guy is just tremendous in this particular show (and all of them are, for that matter) is Paul Guilfoyle as the above-mentioned "Brass." I'm telling you, Guilfoyle and Hall proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that they are great comedic actors, not just actors in general. These guys had me laughing out loud several times each during this episode.<br /><br />As for the guest stars, Peter Stormare, who has slowly blossomed into a film star after his role in "Fargo," is entertaining, as always. In this story, he's "Binky Babinkian." Wendy Makkena is equally entertaining as Binky's wife "Doris." It's hard to imagine she was once "Sister Mary Robert" in "Sister Act." She was cute then, and she's still a very pretty woman.....and a good actress. She and Stormare are hilarious in this episode.<br /><br />All the characters over-the-top and fun to watch. You can add Vince Lieluf as "Connor Foster," the goofy bartender, to that group. It also was great to see James Whitmore again. He plays "Milton." I can't believe the 87-year-old still is acting. Good for him. There is a wonderful scene with he and Jorja Fox ("Sara Sidle") reciting Longfellow. I see by his resume here that he hadn't acted for four years until this little part, and hasn't acted since. <br /><br />It was a pleasure to see him on screen again.
