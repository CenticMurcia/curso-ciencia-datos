I am absolutely stunned that this "movie" actually made it to completion. You would have thought that somebody would have had the common sense to cease production early on,just for humanitarian reasons. I think I may be permanently scarred for the 60 minutes or so that I can never get back. I actually lost some brain cells by watching this. Awful acting by everybody, even the dog. Awful special effects - middle school quality. Awful dialog - grade school quality. This movie is truly as bad as you can get. The bottom of the barrel. I never thought ANY movie could come close to the horrific drivel in Showgirls but I was wrong. People, this movie is as bad as it gets. Everybody associated with this garbage should be shot. If you haven't watched this movie, don't even consider it. Be afraid. Be very afraid.
