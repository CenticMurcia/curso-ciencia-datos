I was really disappointed by this film. Having seen Julian Sands' name on the box, I thought 'OK, well, he's been in some pretty bad films (Arachnophobia, Boxing Helena etc.), but he's also been good in things, so I'll give it a go'. Plus it was screened at last year's Frightfest, which is usually a guide to a film's quality. Having a Spanish director also sounded good, given that it was set in Spain...<br /><br />But whilst the setting, costumes etc. were all amazing, and the script was pretty good, the actors really let it down, particularly Mr Sands, the lead actress and the professor - I couldn't take any of his scenes seriously! Probably worth seeing if you haven't got anything better to do, but don't expect a masterpiece or quality acting (with the exception of Antonio, who was well worth the cost of rental).
