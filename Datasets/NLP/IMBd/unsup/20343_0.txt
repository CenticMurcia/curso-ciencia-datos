This movie is probably the best way to end the magnificent Gundam Wing series. It answered a lot of questions asked about the series. It showed the pilots' pasts. The new Gundams are awesome, especially Tallgeese II. I didn't like Wing Zero Custom because the angel wings was ridiculous!!! Death Scythe Hell was nice too. The animation was much better than the series.<br /><br />Watch the series first or else you won't have a clue about what's going on in the movie.
