I must say that I was incredibly disappointed when I saw this film. I love Mandy Moore, and felt let down by the film. I thought it would be really cute and funny, but it was everything but that. It was like the writer wanted to see how much drama he could fit into a two hour slot. EVERYTHING happens in this movie...from weddings, to funerals, then a pregnancy, and it is thoroughly predictable. I am still a Mandy Moore fan, but I think she made a mistake by making the film...but hey you live and learn. 2.5/10
