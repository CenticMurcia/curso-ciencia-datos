This is actually the precursor to Family Guy. The similarities between Brian (the Dog) and Steve (the dog) are virtually identical as are between Larry and Peter. It would seem that Seth McFarland's main characters are mostly moronic even when compared to Homer Simpson (cf. Johnny Bravo, Chicken from Cow and Chicken, Dee-Dee and the father from Dexter's Lab). I have no difficulties with low intelligence characters, but it would be nice to see another creation from Seth that did not employ this over used technique. I remember this show from WAC show as it aired with the excellent Chicken from outer space episode of Courage. I think it was better when courage didn't speak. I'm not sure if Seth had any input into this one as well, and if he did I commend him for it.
