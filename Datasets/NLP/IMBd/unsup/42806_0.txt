I keep falling for the same crap.... Renting a movie that looks well-done on a tight budget by a first time director or someone new to the scene. When I saw Primer a couple of years ago, I said, "Now that's how to get attention. Awesome flick!" I keep looking for the next sleeper hit and I keep reading the reviews given by extras on the set or others involved with the movie saying it was the greatest movie ever made, blah, blah, blah. I am an idiot! I am going to wait longer to for the REAL reviews to come out (much like this one). The only small, tiny, bit of goodness to this film...you can hit the stop button on your remote any time you want; the one with the filled in square on it.
