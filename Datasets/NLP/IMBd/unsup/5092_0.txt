"The Endless Summer" it ain't. Still "Gidget" has a cool quality about it, being the original. Though the movie is kinda cheesy in places (a little bit of that surf meets Hollywood thing going' on), but it's cool. Takes me back to the days of surfing L.A. beaches as a kid. If only one could still find a board for $25. And those surfers are definitely hot. Especially that Tom Loughlin dude. A very cool, hot Loverboy. Always thought he was a really good looking guy. That red swimsuit on him is definitely something. In my opinion, "Gidget" edges the "Gidget Goes Hawaiian" sequel. I think it is definitely better than the third one (in Rome) though.
