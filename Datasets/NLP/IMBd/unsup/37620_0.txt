Let me start by saying that I am a fan of Peckinpah. I like Steve McQueen. But this movie is just plain bad. The delivery of the dialog is flat. McGraw is an awful actress, and McQueen's acting here...well, he didn't have much of a script to work with. I have so many problems with this film....OK; after stealing $750,000, they just cross into Mexico in the front seat of the truck?? Faces plastered all over TV? Like the borders wouldn't have reward info on them?? The remake has a great cast, for this type of film, James Woods shows what this character should be like? His dialog delivery makes you feel hate, the other version makes you feel nothing. Jennifer Tilly was even better in her role! Alec Baldwin is perfect for this, Kim Bassinger is 10 times the actress of McGraw...I'm sorry, the '72 version is junk. Just because Steve McQueen was cool, and is dead, doesn't make everything he did "the Best" Peckinpah made a few good film, but the more i watch them the more I realize that Straw Dogs and Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia are his only solid work. Wild Bunch? How many times do I have to be forced to watch a bunch of guys laugh together to imply a sense of camaraderie? Great shoot out scenes but come on?! Be honest with yourself folks.
