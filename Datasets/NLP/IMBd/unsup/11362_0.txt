This is one of the worst comedies I have ever seen. The plot is ridiculously dumb and the jokes are really bad. I wouldn't even recommend this for kids, even really stupid kids. I saw it recently amongst friends (we were having a contest as to who could rent the worst movie) and it felt really dated, even though it wasn't made THAT long ago. This movie is much worse then it's rating and should be avoided at all costs. The good thing about this movie is that it isn't carried at most video stores! But if yours has it do me a favor rent it and throw it in the trash then pay the fee to buy it (shouldn't be that much). This is a great way to help the public and it doesn't take up as many hours as community service. Be a leader in your community and help destroy all copies of this movie!<br /><br />Zoopansick
