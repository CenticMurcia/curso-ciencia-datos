I lost some serious IQ points watching this. the acting was bad. the plot was non existent. Yes, it had a quirky '70s porn feel to it, and was, as I said, quirky. I guess if you are drunk or high on some heavy drugs, it might have some redeeming value, but overall, oh my god! I love bad movies, but this one...as the subject line says, OUCH! I watched this because it was reference in a similar film, "One Eyed Monster, but have to agree with the poster there, that was a far superior film, and that is not saying much. OK, the claymation penis was humorous, but that was about the only thing this movie had going for it, other than an abundance of gratuitous boob shoots.
