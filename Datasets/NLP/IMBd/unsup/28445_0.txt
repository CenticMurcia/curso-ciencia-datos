God.....where do I even begin. Lets list the positive first.<br /><br />'Bloody Bill' does make for a potentially good movie character. Back story seems interesting. For some reason, I'm a sucker for redneck horror movies such as these (Wrong Turn, 2001 Maniacs, etc.)<br /><br />*END*<br /><br />Thats out of the way.<br /><br />This movie is flat out retarded. The zombies weren't scary one bit. In fact, they were hilarious. When they chase the characters, it reminds me of the Simpsons Treehouse of Horror episode when they used giant donuts to lure Homer clones into the ravine. The special effects range from cheesy to just sloppy, such as when the redhead was pistol whipping her zombie friends, but it just looks like she's brushing the gun against their face....all in all, don't waste your money or hardrive/IPod space on this....wait for it to come on SciFI and Laugh Your Ass Off
