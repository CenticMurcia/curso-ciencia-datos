There were two films of this genre: The Rose & A Star is Born. <br /><br />The Divine Ms. M turns in a performance that tops Kris<br /><br />Kristofferson & Barbara Streisand - with ease (using one of <br /><br />Kristofferson's songs & a drag-queen Streisand impersonator!). <br /><br />This film is a novelty / mockumentary take on a Janis Joplin type. <br /><br />Obviously, Ms. Middler would have made a documentary if she had<br /><br />wanted. . .so this is Bette jumping off where she feels she can<br /><br />give an over-the-top performance.<br /><br />There are no bad parts to this film. There are no bad songs. The<br /><br />whole film has high production values and is comparable to The<br /><br />Last Waltz in the intensity of the performance.<br /><br />My favorite song is "Fire Down Below" - a dynamite performance. <br /><br />Somehow the performance was left off of the soundtrack album<br /><br />and the only decent cover is Bob Seger's.<br /><br />If you want to see Bette acting and singing at a level few can hope<br /><br />to equal: watch the film.
