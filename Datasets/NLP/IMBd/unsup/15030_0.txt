There are not enough bad adjectives in the dictionary to describe this movie. The acting is a joke. Not one actor in this entire movie has talent. Not moderate nor slight talent. NO talent. The dialog is so laughable.<br /><br />"I'm going to slice you like a turkey" says one of the victims to the killer. "I don't scare easy and I'm pi$$ed" says another. <br /><br />The girls run around like descendants of Rambo, claiming they are going to kick some a$$. Oh yeah, that's real scary, watching chicks act like they have been shot up with a gallon of testosterone. Why do women have to try and act like men? <br /><br />The only scary in the this movie is the acting, the direction, and the fact that it was ever made. This movie is an embarrassment to the horror genre.<br /><br />Avoid at all costs!
