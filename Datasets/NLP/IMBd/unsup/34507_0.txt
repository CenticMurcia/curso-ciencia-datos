State Senator Willard Waterman is one uptight dude, but a politician with his ear to the ground. In danger of losing his election he decides to go to a ski resort to see what the youth of today are all about. Music publisher Chad Everett and coed/songwriter Mary Ann Mobley are ready to show him as well. <br /><br />Upon this flimsy plot hangs Get Yourself a College Girl which is also the name of the song Mary Ann Mobley wrote. She's been writing songs for a few years now, the royalties have helped with her tuition. When the board of trustees of this exclusive women's school find out about it they want to expel Ms. Mobley. I seem to remember this same plot involving a showgirl in Abbott&Costello's Here Come the Coeds. And it was better done there.<br /><br />Of course the film is merely an excuse to showcase several popular groups and artists of the mid sixties. The Dave Clark Five, the Animals, the Shandells, etc. all do their popular songs of the day in good style.<br /><br />And of course Willard Waterman wins the election by the tried and true method of bringing out the over 21 vote at the colleges. The film would really work now that the voting age nationwide is 18.<br /><br />And maybe John Kerry should have tried something like renting out a go-go club as his campaign headquarters. History might have been different.
