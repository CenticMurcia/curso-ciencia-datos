Since the first time I ever watched LYC it has remained very special in my memory, so much so that since the recent re-run on UK TV I have come to write my first ever review regarding viewing or reading material. I have to add this production is so special that I purchased a video copy imported from USA at a cost of Â£140 in early 2000 and now have a downloaded version that I have on DVD. I am only writing here about the special experience I have received from LYC and not about the plot etc, and wonder how much fun it must have been for the crew and actors to take part in LYC. LYC leaves you laughing, cringing and leaves me even know with a lump in my throat and shivers down my spine when watching the final of the last episode. Pack up your arms & surrender to mine, and all of the other spontaneous musical moments are truly great. The only disappointment I have is that it had to end, but I know every now and again I can pull out a copy and view this most wonderful production with an inner feeling that I need to preach to all to sit down and watch Lipstick On You Collar so they to can share this wonderful wonderful experience .
