Having read over the past ten comments to this film, I cannot but help wonder if I missed something. I found this new series by Pax entirely dependent on the earlier season with Kellie Martin. If you hadn't seen earlier episodes, you wouldn't know what the devil was going on! Also, it had no "new" storyline - they were all recycled plots, from the boy who wanted to go to school (and his father who wouldn't let him), to Miss Alice getting hurt, to the whole Lundy Tailor angle, and even the appearance of a strange and beautiful woman at the Cove, whom Christy might be slightly jealous of.<br /><br />I was vastly disappointed. This new mini series is nothing like the book, picks up in a strange place, and confuses you with new faces as well as old. "Oh, so they changed Fairlght, so Jeb is married to a new face, now?" Miss Alice is kind of nonexistent, taking backseat, and not living up to her character. Christy did a fine job... and might have even been convincing with a new set of supporting actors and an entirely new script to work with.<br /><br />We were so disappointed as a family, that we probably won't tune into future installments. Pax tried to pick up Christy, but didn't "pick up" where the last story left off, with David's proposal, the return of Neil's wife, and Christy having to make a decision. Instead, it asks us to wipe our minds clean of the past and try to believe in this "new" story that trips over itself trying to be correct.<br /><br />All in all, Pax either should have picked up where the series left off, using all of the same cast and the same location, or ditched everything and started from scratch. If it came down between this film and the first installment in the film series "Christy," I'd go for the early series, which starts off exactly like the book.
