Holy cow. I thought the Poseidon Adventure was the worst movie ever made, but that was up until I saw this bad boy. This could have been a decent movie if they'd cast a single actor in it. However, not a person in this film is an actor or actress. The story was actually pretty decent, with the requisite suspense and action. The screenplay is even pretty fair. I believe this film was directed about as well as it could be. So it all comes down to the "acting". The acting in this film is awful - just bloody awful. The plot is that of a treasure in a museum sought after by two different characters. The characters are both thieves. One is very subtle, the other is brutal and takes the bull in the china shop approach. Both are in the museum at the same time and the bad dude manages to take over the museum. The subtle thief ends up almost playing the Bruce Willis from Die Hard role. He has to save his daughter and the Police Chief's son. See, it could have been good. But, unfortunately, there's that acting thing that gets in the way. Avoid this stinker. It ain't worth your time.
