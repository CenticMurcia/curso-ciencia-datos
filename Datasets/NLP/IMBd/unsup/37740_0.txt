CANADIAN BACON is a not so thinly veiled attack on conservative American ideals. One would not expect any less from Michael Moore who is an arch-liberal.<br /><br />There are only a few laughs. John Candy shines. The only time worth watching the screen is when he is on it. There are also a few good moments provided in cameos by Steven Wright, James Belushi, and Dan Akroyd. But their total combined time onscreen is less than five minutes.<br /><br />But all in all, it is not worth the hour and a half for the four or five laughs.<br /><br />In sum, if you share the liberal political philosophies of Michael Moore, you will enjoy the America bashing, and overall enjoy the movie more than others. All others should stay away.
