Scarcely worthy of comment, except to say that "Eyes Wide Shut" would have been much better if Tom Cruise's character had a similar fate to Mr. Cleves (to the tune of the high piano note playing over and over).<br /><br />Although I was enjoying it at first, I began to suspect that something was awfully awry during the drawing room scene where 'the accident' was revealed in the news.<br /><br />It was all downhill from there
