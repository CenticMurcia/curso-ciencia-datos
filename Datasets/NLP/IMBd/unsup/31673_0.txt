Wonderful actress and fantastic screenwriter! Telling a story on several levels, one for everyone- the kids, the parents, the nanny's- the audience. I loved it, especially the casting through out- serious tragic actors playing funeral home sidekicks, delightful Colin Firth-as the frazzled Dad..and the kids were perfect! A very refreshing and entertaining change of pace from murder and mayhem, prevalent on the screens lately. A nice dose of magic is what going to the movies should be about. Now I can't wait for it to come out on DVD and see it again-On reflection I realized that Nanny Mcphee had lessons for the Dad, Evangeline and other characters,too!
