A man goes on a late night date with a woman he has just met and suffers through a harrowing night of misadventures. A black comedy that does not quite mine the situation for all its comic possibilities but manages to be amusing as the bizarre plot unfolds unpredictably. Dunne is perfectly cast as the schmuck who thinks he has lucked into a hot date, only to find himself trapped in a nightmare that he can't escape. Scorsese has surveyed the mean streets of New York numerous times before, but here he creates a uniquely surreal atmosphere in exploring the setting from the dark side. The cast of absurd characters is well played by Arquette, Fiorentino, Heard, Garr, and O'Hara.
