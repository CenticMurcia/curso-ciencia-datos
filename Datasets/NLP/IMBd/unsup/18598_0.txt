This short is an extremely funny teaming of Daffy with Porky as his "straight man" (with Porky's antics the cause of a lot of the funniest bits). I have to talk about something specific in the short, so let this be my spoiler warning: Any cartoon where Porky Pig sings the first verse of "Barbara Allen" is one my permanent list of favorites. When I first saw this cartoon, hearing an old tradition song issuing forth in the dulcet tones of Porky Pigs had me rolling on the floor and it still makes me laugh like a loon to this day.<br /><br />The fun in this cartoon is watching Daffy and his progressively desperate (and increasingly unsuccessful) attempts to convince Porky that he really is Robin Hood, honest and for truly, he is! This has been released on a Looney Tunes Golden Collection on DVD and it (and the rest of the Collections) are well worth having and all most highly recommended!
