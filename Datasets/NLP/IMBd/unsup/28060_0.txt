James Woods is a great actor and this is one of his best roles. It's nothing more than a B picture, but Woods is great as Lloyd Hopkins a bad cop in a bad city. He's the kind of cop who picks up on the bad guys girlfriend after he shoots him dead on the street. It's got a lot of good scenes with Woods at his best and a knockout ending. It also has sexy Randi Brooks and Charles Durning for support. Lesley Ann Warren also does a fine job as a chainsmoking Lesbian poet. This movie is highly reccommended. Put it in the VCR and hold on.
