The best thing about this film is Roger Moore's main character, the misogynistic cat lover Rufus Excalibur ffolkes. Despite a seemingly low budget and predictable 'action' sequences, it's worth seeing this film just to listen to the great lines Moore delivers. From beginning to end, ffolkes just rules. He has a huge chip on his shoulder, he has all the answers, and he drinks scotch "..........the way it should be drunk, neat." The story isn't too bad, a prelude to the big budget action films which followed it. Some bad guys hijack a multi-million dollar oil rig and proceed to hold the British government to ransom for it. Who you gonna call??? ffolkes, two small f's, Rufus Excalibur ffolkes, a british version of a Navy Seal, with an IQ seemingly two high to measure.<br /><br />The exchanges between ffolkes and the supporting cast are priceless. There is also a veiled suggestion of homosexuality between the two boss hijackers whom ffolkes is called upon to dispatch, which makes you wonder if Anthony Perkins, who plays one of them, had anything to do with working that into the script. If you can find it, which isn't easy these days, it's worth a look.
