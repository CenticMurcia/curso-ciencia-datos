Rory Gallagher & Taste - raw energy and talent - stole the Isle of Wight festival. They had 3 or 4 encores. Fusion of jazz and blues. Rory mixed all genres of blues - from acoustic, Mississippi Delta, Chicago.<br /><br />He combined a guitar style with his singing - that made the guitar sound like an extension of his voice. Wailing away.<br /><br />Eric Clapton was like a sheep in comparison to this Celtic tiger.<br /><br />Some songs include: Bullfrog blues, Used to be, Cant believe its true. For the last time. Sinnerboy. Messin with the kid, What in the world.<br /><br />Hes played with the greats - including Jack Bruce in Rockpalast concerts. Playing with Muddy Waters in London was the highlight of his career.
