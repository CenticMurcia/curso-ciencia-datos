After a crappy opener for Season 3, the second episode proves to be just as crappy and annoying. <br /><br />The episode is about a failure of a script writer who fantasizes about having a girl who is head-over-heels inlove with him. Then he meets this annoying failure of an actress and his landlord gives him a potion that makes her addicted to him.<br /><br />After a while, he realized how annoying it is to have someone obsessing over you. <br /><br />The episode is a mess, the dialog and performances are too over the top and the ending was just incredibly corny. Season 3 is off to a bad start.
