This movie is supremely inventive in the humour stakes. Roger Moore and Michael Caine wearing kilts! Wearing kilts in the vicinity of log tossers. Naturally, they are going to receive a log up the kilt at some point.<br /><br />Sure enough, the moment arrives as someone lifts a log as they both straddle it. The log goes up the kilts. The audience roll about in floods of tears, each receiving their own personal log up the kilt agony.<br /><br />A few minutes pass and we are treated to another log up the kilt victim. The humour then progresses to another person receiving a log up the kilt.<br /><br />The final scene involves several people straddling a log only to have someone lift up the log, giving the victims a log up the kilt.
