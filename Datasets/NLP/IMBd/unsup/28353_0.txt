A great movie. Seldom are young, urban men portrayed so humanely. The movie is very funny, but not superficial. They are confused young men trying to understand the world, women, and themselves. The film breaks movie stereotypes for these guys are struggling to make it in the world without crime, drugs or violence. Each of the 4 characters are well developed and wonderfully acted. The direction is great. NYC itself is almost a character in the film. The guys and the film takes place in the Bronx. Manhattan is viewed as the center of the universe while the Bronx (and they themselves) feel alienated from Manhattan and "making it." They're feelings of not really fitting in is demonstrated in their unwillingness to go to Manhattan. I've used the film in some of my college classrooms to discuss male friendships and male-female relationships. Great film!!!
