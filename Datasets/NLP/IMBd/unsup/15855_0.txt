"Stardom" is one of the worst films I've ever seen. With the exception of the lead, the lovely Jessica Par√©, this movie is an embarrassment for everyone involved. Come to think of it, has there ever been a movie with Frank Langella in it that doesn't suck (Body of Evidence, anyone?).<br /><br />It is a shame that so many talented film makers out there never get a chance to film their visions due to a lack of funding, while a piece of crap like this gets made. Speaking of crap, there is actually a scene late in this film where a disgruntled former model has an exhibit of sculptures made out of her own feces (I am completely serious). "Sh--, just like my life", she says. I said to myself, "You should be saying: sh--, just like this movie".
