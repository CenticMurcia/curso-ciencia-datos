No kid can take on twice his size...come on! I just didn't get it.The kid actually manages to save everyone from a bad guy. Normally, bad guys aren't so dumb. The way Hutch hits Baby is so fake! It was a touching movie but i didn't think it was all that if you know what I mean. I see why the kid actors haven't acted in anything else. Everyone I know hates this movie. It's hard to believe it actually made it on the air. Although I said this movie is terrible, it's not as bad as From Justin to Kelly. That was bad. I have to agree with someone else on this. The songs and hand-clapping games were nice touches. For all the future watchers of this movie, change the channel after you see a blonde kid with a baseball cap that he's wearing backwards. This is where its starts to turn terrible.
