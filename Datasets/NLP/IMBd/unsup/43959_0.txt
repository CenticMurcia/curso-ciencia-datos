Apart from Dicaprio's performance this film was so awful. Its up there with Honey and Cheaper by the Dozen. If you are thinking of watching this film please don't, its simply awful. Its melodramatic and the script is messy and unrealistic. Why would Dicaprio become a junkie all of a sudden? At first he was a bit of solvent sniffer and then just hours after trying a bit of coke he is raiding a medicine cabinet just to get high. I'm sorry but addiction is a gradual progress. It doesn't come out consuming a few lines of cocaine to aid sexual performance. Waste of time. What is sad that this could've been a decent film. Bloody crap
