Heed the advice of those comparing it poorly to Pulp Fiction. It is clearly trying very hard to imitate the the style of that movie, as many filmmakers were attempting at that time. It fails miserably at it. In fact, it fails miserably at even matching the low quality of "Two Days In The Valley", another piece of cinematic crap which failed miserably at attempting to imitate Pulp Fiction. (OTOH, "Two Days" is far more disappointing than "Flypaper" due to its stellar cast.) If you enjoy movies like Pulp Fiction, or Get Shorty, or Fargo, or Snatch, then see THOSE movies. This movie is a total waste of time. Plus, to add insult to injury, the multiple story lines have no payoff. They end in the middle of nowhere like unfinished highways miles before they reach a destination.
