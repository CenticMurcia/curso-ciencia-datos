Well, i cant believe what a film that was, If you are like me, then you will find that horrors nowadays are not what they used to be, But JACKPOT BABY, I mean i know that it is made in 1998 but it does not stop it from being probs one of the greatest horrors to be made, Right from the start it actually maintains the course of looking like a genuine home video, and when they realise the aliens are actually after them, The horror on there faces, Some believe Sum Do not, it is just brilliant, And the Way that they portray that Rosie has been taken over somehow is just brilliant, Also they bring in the racist side of it tackling that view with great authority, they make every bit of the film as enjoyable as the ever, People who are looking for flaws in the film i have this message( My God Get A Life ) its a film go bloody have a pop at a Disney film or summit, As for me This is Danny Robinson Signing out with a big 10 outa 10
