I LOVED this movie for the quiet truthfulness of the characters, the authentic pictures of the countryside and primitive way of life, and the understated humor. Not just women suffered, but any feeling individual was hurt by the Taliban regime. Most will really enjoy the characters, especially the moving mother, who is a female doctor not allowed to practice her craft despite a desperate need for doctors throughout the country. The director avoids all sentimentality, yet the movie has moments of humor, pathos, cynicism, charity and quiet desperation. If you are a woman, you should see this movie. Contains humor, great characters, unbelievable look into the horrors of the Taliban in Afghanistan, all portrayed with a light touch and great insight.
