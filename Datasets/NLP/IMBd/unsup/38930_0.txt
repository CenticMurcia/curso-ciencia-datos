I'd like to say that it is but that just simply wouldn't be the truth because God knows there are a lot of other t.v./reality shows out there that are ten times worse than "Growing Up Gotti" by far! Though, "Growing Up Gotti" has got to be the WORST show that A&E has ever aired which in all honesty is saying quite a lot when you compare it to the asinine and mind-numbing fodder that is "Dog: The Bounty Hunter" and "Airline"! Smacking of other successful, but just as stupid, unfunny, uninteresting and ultimately pointless garbage, as "The Osbournes", this show was also set-up as an all-access and occasionally would-be tongue-in-cheek insight into the day-to-day life of one Victoria Gotti, the younger of late notorious Mafia Don John Gotti's two daughters, who is apparently a plastic-surgery obsessed socialite/gossip columnist/author/newly divorced single-mother of three loud, spoiled, lazy, and profane teenage sons. After catching the first two episodes of this show and then taking a gander at this site's message board, it's pretty apparent that it is the teenage girls, and sadly a handful of grown women who are attracted to the so-called "Hotti-Gotti" boys as they've been dubbed who continue to watch with regularity and keep this pitiful and wretched excuse for entertainment (which can be likened to a type of mental Novocaine if you ask me) afloat just enough to cause A&E to run a second season or so I've been told anyway. Overall, as I've said this show and others like it such as "DOG: The Bount Hunter" and "Airline" are without a doubt new lows in A&E's programming! And to think there was a time when the channel used to be tops in classy, intelligent programming that showcased the better side of American culture, not anymore unfortunately.
