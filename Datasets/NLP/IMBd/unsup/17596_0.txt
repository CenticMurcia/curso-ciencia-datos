Someone else mentioned that they were surprised this movie isn't rated higher. I feel the same way. This movie is very good. I too played Little League for many many years (like some other posters here) and I have to disagree with the posters that say this movie is a completely inaccurate depiction of Little League. I saw a fight or two in Little League and some drunk parents were ejected from games a few times. I have seen kids smoke pot in the dugout and smoke cigarettes at practice. Anyway, this film was magical when I saw it as an 8 year old in 1976. Back then, many of my friends and I wished we could be Tanner or Kelly; we wished we had the courage and independence to tell an adult to go to hell and say or do whatever we wanted. I love the final scene when the Bears lose and tell the Yankees to shove the 2nd place trophy you know where! This may be considered bad sportsmanship by some, but considering what the Yankees represent, the Bears do the right thing. I'm going to buy the DVD.
