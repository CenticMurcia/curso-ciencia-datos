This film is by far one of the best made-for-TV movies ever made. Scribe Linda Voorhees is a UCLA screen writing professor and former student/current colleague of Lew Hunter, who wrote "Screenwriting 434" (one of THE best books on screen writing). Her script delivers a powerful plot as well as characters who are so well-developed, the viewer can't help but sympathize with both the mother and grandmother in the end.<br /><br />Valerie Bertinelli offers a sensitive, gutsy portrayal of Jody Shaffell, the mother struggling to keep custody of her young son. Vanessa Redgrave plays her mother, Zachary's grandmother, who fights for what she believes in. Voorhees balances the characters' arguments and emotions so well on both sides, the audience can feel the pain of these "two mothers." A real scene-stealer is Colleen Flynn who plays Jody's girlfriend, Maggie Fergus. Lesser-known (and under-appreciated) Flynn shines as her character offers first romance, then rock-solid strength to Jody as well as light touches of humor throughout the film.<br /><br />Any reader of Hunter's text would be wise to view this film as well as Voorhees' "Crazy From The Heart," or Hunter's "Fallen Angel" and "If Tomorrow Comes." The scenes flow smoothly into each other, taking the audience on an intense, thought-provoking journey to the final destination. Every line of dialogue comes straight from the character and plays right into the development of the story. No boring dinner table scenes here. No need to wonder, "What was the point of that line?" It's all good.<br /><br />One key point -- if possible, try to see a copy of the original ABC broadcast version, not the reruns on cable. The cable broadcasts deleted a few scenes (not because of content, but because of time) and it makes the transition from one scene to the next a bit bumpy unless you know what's missing.
