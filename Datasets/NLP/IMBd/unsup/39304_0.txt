If you enjoy the feeling you get when you eat way to much or when you had a really hard day or when you have a killer headache then watch this movie. Santa Clause 3 seems to be so underbudget that I could have afforded to pay for all the budget including Tim Allen's sallary (which I assume was around 10 dolloars for his impressive acting). The plot was something pulled out of a 1st graders Christmas story he made for a school project(of course this story would still fail even for grade 1). The most amazing part of this movie (other than the lack of story, acting, decent props) was that the movie gave me a major headache until that lasted till the next day. This movie flat out blows. And it isn't one of those movies that is so bad its funny ethier. It just blows.
