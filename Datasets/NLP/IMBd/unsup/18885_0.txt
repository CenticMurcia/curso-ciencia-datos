I went home and really appreciated the time I could spend with my young son after watching this. We played in the garden for at least an hour longer, everything he did was so much more vivid than if I had not watched this film. Many people have mentioned 'Melodrama' in their comments but usually with a sneer. Melodrama is not necessary a bad thing, it has a place if used well. This is a film about grief directed in the same manner as Bridget Jones. People who enjoyed Bridget Jones, Love Actually etc will find an emotional wrench with the mothers strength and weakness, as I did. A Mike Leigh type director would have made a very different film but that movie would have been unrelenting and harrowing by being much closer to the real life experiences of people suffering loss. I believe the filmmakers heart is in the right place and is not purposefully manipulating her audience. It must have taken much persistence and a strong belief to get this movie made, I imaging that it had a bumpy ride to get green lit. I'm glad they succeeded.
