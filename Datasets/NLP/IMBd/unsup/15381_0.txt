It's been a long time since I've seen such a well enacted and so realistic TV Series.<br /><br />It seems that the "narcotraficantes", some of whom I would call "NACOtraficantes" are just as real as the ones who vandalize and terrify Mexican life in the border as of today.<br /><br />It is somehow awkward the mix of English and Spanish and I just wonder if this is the kind of language spoken in the US-Mexican border. I've been to Laredo/Nuevo Laredo once and indeed it seems to be like this.<br /><br />It is also true that today the blood bath seems to be many times worse than when the movie was filmed.<br /><br />It's a shame that the series has been shut down.<br /><br />A friend of mine lent me the three DVDs and I couldn't stop until I saw all the episodes.
