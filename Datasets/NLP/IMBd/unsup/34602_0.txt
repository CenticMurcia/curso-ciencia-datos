My wife rented this along with Syriana. Guess which one is better. I'm a sucker for a good pirate movie, but this ain't it. Not by any stretch. Where to begin? Oh, the opening scene and dialog. That should have been the first clue. Maybe the second after learning Lance Henrikson was the only 'name' actor. Back to the dialog. Long John Silver and Co. are following their Captain through the jungle in order to stash their ill-gotten gain. Mr. Rogers would have sounded like a more menacing pirate captain than the stooge playing him. Mercifully, he was killed early. Good-bye to Pizzle Lips, as LJS called him. Look up the word 'pizzle'. I'm sorry, but my heart just isn't in a long review. This movie is not worth a 99 cent rental. Here's a quick and dirty: Dialog: Junior College Drama 101 level. Costumes: Ill-fitting, costume shop off the rack, not remotely accurate. Wigs: Standard wear in the 18th century, these were simply atrocious. Barbie and Ken have better hair. Accents: Capt. Smollet's raspy French accent made Pepe Le Pew's sound like Maurice Chevalier. Poor Lance tried, he even said 'Arrr' once. He must have needed a house payment to take this role. Sword-play: The Ginsu Knife demonstrator must have been the fencing instructor. Locations: Surprisingly, the exteriors were not too bad. The interior sets, about a D+. I think they even used stock footage of two, possibly three differently rigged ships for the long shots. I know a jib from a spanker and a spar from a boom. They messed up. I won't even get into the big bugs.
