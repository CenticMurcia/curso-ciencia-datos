I thought that Bulworth was one of the funniest and most well written movies to date. Warren Beatty did an astonishing job in this film, a little too good now that I think of it. But really, this film attacked all aspects of life in the united states, welfare, blacks, whites, lying politicians, sleazy businessmen, all of it. It truly was one of the most ingenious movies ever to be created, and the fact that they got Warren Beatty to rap through the whole thing, that was a hoot. But in all honesty, I would have to say that if you have not seen this movie yet, go see it, you'll be pleasantly surprised.
