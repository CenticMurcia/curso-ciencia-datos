Beynelmilel Amsterdam has a large Turkish population and this was my first Turkish movie of life. I went to see this movie because I read good review of this movie.<br /><br />The story is in a small town in Turkey in 1982 where the local military head hires a musical troupe to play for the arrival of their chief. The lead maestro's young daughter and her lover boy are influenced by communism movement. One day on hearing a communist song being secretly played by the daughter the musician assume it as an international song (thus the name of the movie) and composes a musical piece for the arrival of military chief. It is only during the last performance that everybody realizes the performance is of a communist song. The movie is a light arty comedy with a simple love story woven in it. But the ending of the movie is sad.<br /><br />Cezmi Baskin as the musician has played his role with ease, his daughter's role is played by beautiful Ozgu Namal; her lover's role is played by Umut Kurt. There are lots of other character actors who have all played their role nicely.<br /><br />This is the first directoral debut for Muharrem Gulmez. He has given a simple, light hearted approach to the serious topic, and it is there within his low budget parameters he excels to keep things real and enjoyable.<br /><br />I am from India and I do not understand Turkish, but seeing the movie reminded me of the 1970's era of Indian movie where there were many art movies made on the backdrop of communist movement.<br /><br />Just a trivia Â–There were 9 Turkish ladies who had come to see this movie and I think this was also the first movie of my life when I was the only male in the audience.<br /><br />(Stars 7 out of 10)
