Geez, isn't the public getting sick of all these Russian characters in the movies ? Its obvious a lot of producers are just copying All these great Italian Characters we have had in the past, and it sure seems pathetic. Don't the producers realize ???? Tell me a movie with Russian Gangsters or Characters that have rated so highly...NONE. Yet, producers these days seem to think how exciting these Russian or former soviet union characters are. I find The Russian Culture, and characters very dull, and just be seeing some of the characters in this movie, i sure wont go waste my money, on something that I'm totally getting sick of. If you want a good mobster movie or Gangster movie..Italian Characters are the best by far !!!! NO QUESTION !! all these imitations..are just getting way over the top. Geez, wouldn't a sequel to The Godfather be nice on this day and age !!!
