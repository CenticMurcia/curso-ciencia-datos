This movie has a very particular meaning to me. I remember the first time I watched it with my pa', I was 7 or something, and I was really captured by its deep humanity. That was the first and last time I watched this movie since this year, when I found it in a store and immediately bought it. The amazing thing is that, on my way home, I started thinking back about the movie and it was clear to me that I perfectly remembered, after over 15 years, every single part of the movie, from the beginning to the end, even the smallest details. A fact that was confirmed few minutes later when I got home and played it. I reckon not all movies have the same effects. And I think whoever watches this movie is gonna be blown away as I've been before. The real, thoughtful, amazing and, why not, entertaining story this film tells, along with the masterful acting of both McQueen and Hoffman, make of Papillon a really hard-to-forget experience, something you could become addicted to. Unmissable.
