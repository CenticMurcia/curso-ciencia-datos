I watched this film after losing a bet with my fiend over who would win in a football match (log story).<br /><br />Anyway, I could have been one of the only hetro sexual male at that theatre, so I sat at the back. So about 30 - 35 mins into the film I thought, screw this, because the Dark Knight was on at this time, I had a much better 30 mins in the Dark Knight than this. So I'm soy if you enjoyed this movie, but it's just not me. For 30 mins, the acting was below average, the lines were below average and the cast was below average, so it gets a 3/10 for being able to keep me in for 30 mins.<br /><br />Men (and woman) don't waste your time with this, watch the Dark Knight instead.<br /><br />3/10
