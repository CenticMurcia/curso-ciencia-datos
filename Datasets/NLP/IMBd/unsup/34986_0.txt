It takes a lot for me to take the time to comment on a movie, but this time I just have to.<br /><br />After seeing this movie, I actually felt sick. I'm not sure if its the dinner I ate earlier, but I suspect it has more to do with the movie. Now it actually feels like my dinner is coming up. Thats how bad this movie is.<br /><br />I've seen movies before that more or less has the same plot. The little man against the stereotypical bad-guys. But this was just...oh god.<br /><br />The lead actor should find a new job, preferably at McDonalds receiving orders. He's not funny, not by a long shot, and I have a strange feeling that he might have done some really shitty stand up comedy before that the director happened to stumble into one late afternoon. And because the director lacks most of his humorous sense, he found it amusing. Contrary to everybody else who was at the pub for a beer or ten. I feel bad for Christopher Walken as well. Once I had a lot of respect for his work, now...well lets just say you've got a long way to go baby to come back from this. Do you have a drug habit in need of funding that makes you join the cast of such an awful movie? It would be better for your reputation to check in to a rehab clinic than to join the cast of such an awful movie.<br /><br />To every single person out there, from deranged psycho to kids, stay the hell away from this movie. It'll only damage your precious minds. Don't even download it for free. Don't watch it even if it comes with your happy meal. Which it probably will if Dan Fogler is working there.
