Not even worthy of a wet-Sunday afternoon C5 slot I'm afraid.<br /><br />Take one gormless girl, add two competing handsome hunks (one home, one away), mix in a land of franglais where the locals say "good morning Madame" without a single sub-title and you wonder why the heroine had to know any French to become a spy... the kind of spy who keeps saying "what's your real name" while breaking the next person's cover and rushing up to warn the next safe house as the Bosche may or may not have got there before her.<br /><br />Add in some duplicitous Vichy french (hiss hiss), some evil *ard Germans who even take Jewish children and you'll be wondering whatever made you rent twaddle like this.<br /><br />Reminds me of that story of a very poor Anne Frank's Diary production where the audience were motivated to shout out 'she's in the Attic' when the German first came on stage. <br /><br />I'd be shouting out Goodbye FilmFour if this is the best you can waste your production £££ on - and come to think of it unfortunately it was the best they could waste their £££ on and hence goodbye FilmFour :(<br /><br />A shame...
