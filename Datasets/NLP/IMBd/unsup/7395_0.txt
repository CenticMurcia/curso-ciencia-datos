The movie is great!! and the storyline is amazing and even touching. I mean it shows how to be brave, when Pan dies and Chibi Goku goes on an adventure to search for the 4 star ball. It's also funny, when he and Pak become scared from Zangiya, The blue alien they meet in the dark forest. It even shows the appearance of the great Son Goku (The original Goku) when Chibi Goku becomes disappointed and cries when he realizes that the 4 star ball can't revive Pan, so Son Goku appears and tells him that he needs all 7 balls. He also tells him not to give up. I like the last part when Chibi Goku remembers the words of his great grandfather Son Goku.<br /><br />Anyway this movie is one of the best movies in The Dragonball GT Specials !
