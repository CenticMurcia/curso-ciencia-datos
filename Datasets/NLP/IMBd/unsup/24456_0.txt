This is complete paisa vasool film.... U can heartily laugh for 2hr 15min... Don't see logic n all, just sit down n relax... It has a simple story line... 4 guys who are not at all serious in life, meets a dying gangster who tells them bout 10cr he has made in life... n tells them to use it as they like... but a inspector comes n enquires them bout it as he is investigating the root of that very money for 10 yrs ... then the conflict starts b/w them as to who as to get the money... everyone leaves to Goa where money is supposedly hidden... The climax is beautifully planned... n i'll not spoil it... Actin is wonderful... music by sandeep is good... wonderful direction by Indra kumar....
