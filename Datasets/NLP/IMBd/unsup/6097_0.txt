I saw this movie a year ago but it left an impact on me. This is a horrible tragedy to have occurred. What that creature did to that family is too disgusting for words to describe. The movie itself had a great cast and it was well acted but the content was very disturbing.The movie leaves the viewer with so many unanswered questions. What really happened on that night when three innocent lives were taken? What was running through Susan's mind if it was William who did the actual killing? Forsome reason she trusted him greatly...but why? What kind ofrelationship did they have? What kind of power did he have over her? Susan was an educated woman but obviously very insecure and head over heels in love.Susan and her children did not deserve to die. William died in prison in 1998 and took all his secrets with him. I read that inmates attacked him, to try to get him to tell where the bodies of the kids were and he denied knowing anything.
