Okwe, a doctor of medicine, chess master and all-round renaissance man, not to mention a saint, has been forced to migrate to London from his homeland of Nigeria. Predictably, he has to work two jobs on the brink of exhaustion, because of Whitey's horrible oppression.<br /><br />Okwe lives with Senay, a Turkish woman who also has come to London in the hopes of finding a better life. To everyone's surprise, Senay falls in love with Okwe but the affair doesn't work out because of Whitey's persecution. Instead, Okwe and Senay get involved in illegal organ trade.<br /><br />Dirty Pretty Things is not entirely without merit, but it is definitely is flawed in many ways. Okwe's character is very superficial, while Senay has no depth at all. Her only attribute (besides being in love with Okwe) is that she's a virgin, and the moment we hear that, we know for certain that before the film is over, she will lose her virginity at the hands of some evil white man. <br /><br />Dirty Pretty Things works fine as self-flagellatory fodder for self-hating white liberals. Others should approach with caution.
