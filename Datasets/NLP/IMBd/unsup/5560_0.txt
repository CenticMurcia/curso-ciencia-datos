The only reason I was interested in watching The Canyon was the presence of actress Yvonne Strahovski, who is brilliant as Agent Walker in Chuck, one of my favorite TV programmes.However, The Canyon ended up being an entertaining thriller with decent performances and a generally good rhythm, although it is not very memorable.<br /><br />The screenplay from The Canyon does not offer too many surprises, but it produces an adequate level of suspense and tension thanks to its good structure.One of the fails I found on this movie is that I think a few scenes could have easily been deleted from the movie, not because they are boring, but because they add nothing to the story and they break the rhythm a little bit.And then, the characters make some stupid decisions and they occasionally do not behave naturally.<br /><br />However, in spite of its fails, The Canyon deserves a recommendation as a competent thriller, which may not be highly memorable, but at least is entertaining.
