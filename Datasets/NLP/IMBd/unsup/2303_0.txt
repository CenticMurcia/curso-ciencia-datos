Errol Flynn is perfect as Robin of Locksley, and 'The Adventures of Robin Hood' has beautiful cinematography, excellent costume design and high tempo, directed by the master-entertainer Michael Curtiz (and William Keighley)! The battle between Robin and Sir Guy is still nasty and cool, and not to be missed. There is said that the only dated thing in 'The Adventures of Robin Hood' is the music, but I disagree. I think that the music in this Robin Hood-film is much more entertaining than most of the music from any movie before the 1960's and equal to much of what is made today. When it comes to Errol Flynn, I think he has more charm than any modern actor.<br /><br />Rating: 9 of 10.
