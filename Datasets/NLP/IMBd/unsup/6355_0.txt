---WARNING--- ---SPOILER ALERT!--- This movie is horrible. not only horrible...it sucks. The death scenes suck so bad. One second the people are alive..the next...their head is on the ground. What the heck is this crap? I'll tell you. A waste of money any way you slice it. rent or buy it's not worth it. except for when the midget gets axed in the mellon or when Arabula(arab-dracula) Shoots that stupid hippy with his ring.<br /><br />Now the biggest upset of the film. I thought Dracula and Frankenstein would actually possibly be the stars of this movie (but it's these stupid hippies) and fight for like half an hour or something...Boy was I ever wrong. they fight for 3 minutes in a forest and it's so predictible what's going to happen its annoying. The sun is coming up and the Monster doesn't want drac to kill the girl (who sucks by the way) so he puts up a fight. next thing you know they're in the woods "fighting" or in other words grabbing each other and hurling their bodies around. The lighting in this scene sucks so bad the DP is probably living in a cardboard box now. anyhow, Dracula rips frank's head off (cheesy) and as he's running back to the castle, the sun kills him and turns him into a skull with gray hair. It pissed me off so bad that I spent so much money on this movie... now I think I may go kill myself or something.
