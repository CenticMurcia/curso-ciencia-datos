This has to be one of the worsted children of the corn movies but i have only seen number 1,2,3 and 7. Of course this film is corny because it is all about corn Thought that there were only one or two good scenes for example micah (bollman) is in Church and has a wooden doll and knife there is someone sitting across from him then micah starts putting the knife up the doll's nose and the guy across from him nose starts to bleed then micah keeps on doing it until the guy dies and the other good part is when micah dies. See They weren't that good but the were the best scenes.<br /><br />I would like to say Ryan Bollman is one of the worst actors so was practically everyone that was in the movie, He shouted like microphones weren't invented. This movie should not be seen
