This movie was hard to rate. I initially thought I would give it a 9, but finally decided that it was an 8. Actually, it was an 8.4999, but with rounding....<br /><br />I enjoyed virtually every minute of this film. The fact that it was a remake is of ZERO importance to me. I must assume from the many people who complained about it being a remake and whether it was, or was not, as good as the original Hitchcock film or whether it lived up to some preconceived notion as to what it was supposed to be or whether it deviated too far from the original... I must assume that those people (on average) liked it less. But, since only one out of one hundred (at most) of the people seeing this movie have ever seen/remember Dial M for Murder, then logic dictates that 99% of the population will enjoy it considerably more than the 1%. Of course, the odds are good that the 1% is on imdb.<br /><br />This is a smart, stylish, well acted suspense thriller. It covers the bases significantly better than the average thriller. I had very few questions pertaining to flaws in logic or timing than normal. In fact, after asking my wife why this and why that and getting extremely good answers, I ultimately was left with a desire to have modified only a couple very minor things. And, that's pretty darn good for me!<br /><br />This movie is a credit to all involved. I have to admit that I was caught off guard several times despite knowing how it would end. What makes a mystery really good is when the audience is asking - literally minutes before the end - how are they going to do it? We know what must be done, but we just can't seem to see the avenue to doing it.
