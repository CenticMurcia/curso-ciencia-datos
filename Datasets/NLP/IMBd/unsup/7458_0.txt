I'm a Seagal fan and the rave reviews from other Seagal fans for MFJ brought me back to his films. After I was bored to death with OUT OF REACH and INTO THE SUN I gave up and said I would return till Seagal did a decent film again. I missed Submerged, Today you die and black Dawn, but then good reviews started to flood in for this movie. Supposedly he does all his own fights and the action is well done. So I went rented this movie along with Black Dawn because the thought of a good Seagal film got me overly excited. All I ask from a Seagal films is entertainment, but I was bored my MFJ. Did Seagal do his own "fight" scene?...yes. Was it a good fight scene?..No. The key word there is "Fight" and not "Fights". He has only one real fight scene in the movie. The plot was impossible to follow and the movie was just bad. I actually watched Black Dawn the next day and while Seagal was doubled for all his fight scenes the movie was much funner to watch than MFJ.
