The reasons are: 1. A very embarrassing Greece dancing 2. There are more many women than men in the film except the underrated actor Ralph Bates & the unknown actor Michael Johnson 3. The pretty blond danish model Jutte Steensgard is not a famous Horror actress. She played Carmilla Karnstein a bit boring, the reason is that she was not really an actress but she was a model. If the famous horror actress Barbara Steele would play in that role, the movies would had been very different.<br /><br />4. The same plot 19th century Romanticism (a classic Gothic horror tale), which Hammer Film Studio didn't develop the story at all.<br /><br />The most stupid element in the movie: a young writer who fell in love in a female vampire, and could not save her and was unable to protect himself. It looks a bit cheesy, cause you'd already seen this in various Hammer films.<br /><br />2 - 3 stars as a result !!
