Toshiro Mifune showed why he was the personification of THE samurai Japanese culture/history wants us to see. He was excellent in this role. Charles Bronson's performance was as we expected from other characters he portrayed during this period along with some comedy which he really isn't known for(the fight scene with Mifune's character early on). Ursula Andress in her part goes beyond her glamorous looks to portray a woman who is truly out for her own best interests at everyone's expense. She has no problem shifting interests from Delon's character to Bronson's in order to get ahead. The model of the scheming/conniving female or vamp.
