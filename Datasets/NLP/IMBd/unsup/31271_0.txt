Question Mark was extremely disturbing, depressing, and dark. it was also bitingly funny. How i loved it! every character was very dysfunctional.. but in a way that was so real that it brought me back to my own traumatic past experiences.. it took me places in my head that i don't often go and sometimes avoid going.. and for that i thank it muchly.<br /><br />it shows family & lovers that don't even know each other. they don't share their deep secrets and for the most part don't even try. they claim to love the shells around them while holding fast to their own. they're completely alienated & disconnected. most of the time they aren't even conscious of it because it's so routine for how they live.<br /><br />there were so many interesting themes... characters who desired something deeply, then regretted it once it was theirs... pathetic self-defeating behaviors... sex and the pursuit of it... trying to be 'real' vs. living behind a facade...<br /><br />i also *loved* the music...Hideous Input, I think did most the songs? i can't say enough about it.. oh, so good! but definitely not for the faint-hearted..
