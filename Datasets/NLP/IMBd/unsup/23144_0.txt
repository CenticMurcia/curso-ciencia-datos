This is one of my favorite movies, and it hasn't been on the tube for a very long time; one of my favorite comments was the line when Fields describes Cleopatra Pepperday in his inimitable voice as: "All dressed up like a well kept grave!". According to the IMDb site it was originally produced and released by Paramount Pictures - does anyone know who has the rights to this? Why wasn't this on the WC Fields collection with My Little Chickadee and others (that was a blend of Paramount and Universal features)? I'd like to see this one and "The Big Broadcast of 1938" packaged together - there'd be the extra bonus of Bob Hope and Shirley Ross doing "Thanks for the Memory". Anyone know how to get a letter writing campaign started??
