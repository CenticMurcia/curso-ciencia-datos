I would agree with another reviewer that this film treads the line between humour and pathos - but I would qualify it by saying that the film rarely strays either side of the line - making it far less funny than a film about comedians could be, and far less dramatically satisfying than it could have been had it focused on one of the more dramatic story lines which litter it's plot.<br /><br />Despite a talented cast the film flounders with it's scatter-shot narrative, cacophonous music, utterly gratuitous sexual content, and often childish characterisation.<br /><br />There are some laughs to be had, but they are few and far between and the movie's downbeat ending (with a broken marriage, several failed relationships and the suicide of a central character) feels at odds with it's attempts at jaunty humour.<br /><br />The Edinburgh festival is definitely an event worth visiting, but this film fails even to capture the genial, colourful atmosphere of the city during the festival period.<br /><br />A terrible disappointment, and a squandered opportunity.
