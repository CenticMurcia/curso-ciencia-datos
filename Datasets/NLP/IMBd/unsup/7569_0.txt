With out a doubt, this little flick is funny then most, and way more erotic, then much of anything that has come out of Hollywood in the last few years. Darian Crane is perhaps one the best soft core erotic performers around, and if her scenes are simply girl/girl, or guy girl, she turns on just as a hot performance in both. She is very beautiful, and deserves to be allowed to carry a movie on her own. She has in this flick a great comedic timing, as does the star Misty Mundae, who's a great escape from the generic Hollywood starlets with fake chest (i.e. Paris Hilton). She, Crane, and AJ Kahn are all natural looking females who don't need much help from the make up department. If any movie out of the Hollywood cookie cutter needed to be Lampooned it is the overblown, over hyped Lord of the Rings series. The movie is fitfully funny, and just as erotic. Ignore every bad review of this movie that you have read. Those people weren't watching the same movie that I did. This movie is a must have!
