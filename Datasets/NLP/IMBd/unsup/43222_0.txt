This movie combines the friendly alien and the killer alien into one adventure. Well actually it is almost like watching three movies, and none of them are very good. First, you have poachers, then you have a kid living with relatives of some sort, then of course are the wacky teens going camping. Then there are the two aliens, both look alike, but their personalities differ. One is on the rampage, killing people here and there. The stupid thing is I just don't see how anyone dies. Sure one girl falls off a cliff and her friends pick her up and jostle her around continuously, but everyone else seems to die for no reason. The monster hits the people with very weak karate chops (the alien looks like Alf) and the people fall over dead. The friendly alien starts as an egg that the boy raises. This alien has powers to move stuff around that the other alien seems to be lacking. In the end it is just a bad movie. The boy says all the aliens want it to be their friends and sure the one he raises is nice enough, but the other one is killing indiscrimintly.
