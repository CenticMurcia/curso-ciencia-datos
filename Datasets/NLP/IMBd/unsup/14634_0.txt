Great movie with breath taking scenes and good songs. Seems original too. But that is where it ends. See: "Eye of the needle" with Donald Sutherland and Kate Nelligan. You will see the immediate connection. The isolated Kashmir background mimics storm island. The WWII German role of Donald mimics Aamir's struggle as a Kashmiri living on "foreign" soil. The role played by Rishi Kapoor as the heroine's father is similar to Kate's husband in EOTN. The role played by the isolated colonel who dies at the hand of aamir is similar to the lighthouse event in EOTN.<br /><br />In fact the final struggle is also similar. A helicopter awaits aamir and a German u-boat waits Donald.
