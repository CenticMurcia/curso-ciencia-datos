The plot of this movie is clich√©. The characters are at best one dimensional. The way the gay-scene is pictured borders on the ridiculous, and would be insulting if it weren't so stupid. The dialogue is beyond bad. The photography has the quality of your average home movie. The acting is wooden. The direction is direction-less. Why do the characters switch from Dutch to bad English all the time in the dialogue? Why was this film made? Why? But: I enjoyed watching it. To see just how bad a really bad movie can be. Compared to this, "Intensive Care" (another Dutch gem) is a masterpiece. "Gay" is unbelievably bad, bad, bad. Rent it, just for a few laughs. and who knows, maybe Mr. Six will come up with a new movie! Could be fun!
