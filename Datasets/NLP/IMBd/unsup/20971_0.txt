In a time of shallow characters, cheap story lines and bubble-gum pop entertainment, this film is incredibly needed. The characters were rich and personable and the story was very moving. Anyone who truly takes this film to heart will leave with a different outlook on life. David L. Cunningham has masterfully crafted this work into a film that should not be overlooked, especially in our time.
