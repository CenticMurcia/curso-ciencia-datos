The plot outline says it all: A footman seduces a count 's daughter. The rest of the movie is spent listening to lies, betrayal, ideas, and hopes. This play was not meant to be converted into a movie, especially from the director of LEAVING LAS VEGAS (what they were thinking?). The sound was muddled, camera work was sloppy when it should have been straight (you can experiment but that not terribly) and the music was purely awful. The three main characters were OK and saved this movie from disaster, but how well could you hear them with terrible sound? A slap in the face to the actual play, where it should have stayed.
