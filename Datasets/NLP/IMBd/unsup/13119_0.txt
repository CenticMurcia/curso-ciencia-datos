The promise of the series has been better than the fulfillment.<br /><br />Some of the programs, particularly those hour-long ones, have<br /><br />been ludicrous (A Neronian word?) and chaotic because of the<br /><br />condensation required to fit the time limits. This particular one<br /><br />belongs to the better installments.<br /><br />As has been mentioned before, Maury Chaykin fits the description<br /><br />of the part but is less than commanding even as Timothy Hutton is<br /><br />fine. Perhaps Thayer David was the best Nero but he did only one<br /><br />installment before his untimely death (Perhaps a result of the<br /><br />previously mentioned physical requirements for the part.). William<br /><br />Conrad, I thought, was twinkly and simply awful.<br /><br />The others are fine in their recurring smaller parts and the series<br /><br />has the proper period feel of the novels.
