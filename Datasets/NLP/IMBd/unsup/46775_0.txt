Boy, I never knew how bad a movie can be, but after watching about 20 minutes of this piece of s&%#t I do. To me there is nothing funny about this movie, even if I try to give my brains a so-called day of. It is not that I am interested in more pretentious movies. I mean, I do like "Under siege", "Die hard" and also some of Jacky Chan's works, but these flicks at least do have descent settings and some funny dialogue.<br /><br />City hunter will entertain let's say 3 to 8 year olds who are not so bright and it makes one wonder how this scrap made it on DVD while a genuine masterpiece like "The fearless vampire killers" is still waiting for a DVD release.
