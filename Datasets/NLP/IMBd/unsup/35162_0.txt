Anchor Bay have in the past given us some delights on DVD for example Hellraiser, Halloween and Phantasm. Then one day a film arrived on the shelves called "Freak Out". With the Anchor Bay logo on the case cover I was optimistic about the content of the film. Until I pressed play. For the next 98 minutes i was subjected to an exercise in mind numbing tedium that will never be equalled. I cant stress enough that this film should be avoided at all costs. I don't understand where all the positive buzz has come from? and all the posts must be from relatives or best friends. It is not funny, it has little or no production value, it has a ridiculous story. <br /><br />Extremely amateurish in every department..this is one to avoid. Awful.
