First off: Larry Raspberry? He's the "star" of this odd little picture and while his bio says he was in the Gentrys back in the 60's I seem to remember an album called "Larry Raspberry & the High Steppers" or something to that effect. Anyway, there's another Raspberry in this movie too, his brother, I'd guess. I imagine they got razzed in school about that. ANYWAY on to the movie: This takes place supposedly in the 50's or early 60's, and it seems to waver between when it wants to be as it talks about seeing Invasion of the Body Snatchers and then mentions a roomful of people as looking like the casting room for 'Psycho'. 50's or early 60's stock footage is interwoven with the actual film to give it a more authentic look, I reckon, and it usually works, except for the modern hairstyles and the distinctly non-period soundtrack. We have two escaped convicts, space aliens, and two rival Cola companies that all come together to make zombies out of the people of Pleasantville. I didn't know where this was filmed until the end and it's in Tennessee, I could tell it was somewhere in the south because of the obvious accents. Overall this is an interesting little movie and yes, even somewhat strange, but it's nothing terribly astounding. The look and the atmosphere is good, but trying to follow what's going on is a bit tough. I'd say this was fairly fun if you watch it in the spirit in which it was made, but don't expect a work of cinematic genius. 7 out of 10.
