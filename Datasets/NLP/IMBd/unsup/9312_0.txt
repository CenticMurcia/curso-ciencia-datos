I wont even comment on the acting, sound, effects, editing, direction, and overall production of this film as they were all terrible. The worst part of this film, for me, was how much it ripped off ideas from Steve Alten's novel MEG. While he struggled to get his book made into a feature film, with a good studio, straight to release films like this continue to rip off his work, and use it as their own. The script was ungodly horrible as the "tense" scenes were more funny than anything else, and the entire concept of the film was no good. The effects were the films strong point, but even they were sub par. Don't see this film as it is a great waste of time.
