This episode is one of the best of a mixed first season. When the Enterprise engines undergo tests by a warp field specialist Kosinski, his assistant, a being known only as the Traveler from Tau Alpha C, is inadvertently responsible for hurtling the ship across the other side of the galaxy. when a return is attempted they are pushed even further beyond into what can only be described as another place or time beyond what we know as space. In this realm thoughts become reality and we get a tantalizing look into Tasha's troubled past on Turkana 4, a pet targ owned by Worf and even a brief glimpse at several crew members fantasies becoming reality. The budget must have been huge for this episode! We also see Picard's dead mother for a moment in a touching scene too. This was an incredibly impressive episode for such a young show! When they realize the Traveler was responsible they unite to help the Traveler through good thoughts and feelings and the Enterprise is returned home. Picard does the proper thing and gives Wesley a commission to Acting Ensign for his help with the Traveler. Interestingly, the Traveler had earlier discussed with Picard Wesley's future would be an interesting one leaving the viewer to wonder what would become of this throughout the rest of the series run...
