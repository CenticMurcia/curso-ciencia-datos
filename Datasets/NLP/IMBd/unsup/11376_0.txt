Szabadsag, szerelem was a wonderful cinematic experience. I though it was visually stirring. There is something for everyone, sports, war, a love story.... It was especially good to see some recent history made into film. It was even-handed politically and I feel it is a must see for everyone! I recently read James Michner's book on the 1956 revolution, so I was pleased to see the movie following the historical accounts very closely. The water polo matches were very believable and incredibly filmed from all angles! I have only seen water polo on TV during the Olympics, but these scenes were gripping. I wondered if the actors were real water polo players. I don't understand why this sport is not more popular in the US. It is fast paced and very grueling physically. Please make a point to see this movie
