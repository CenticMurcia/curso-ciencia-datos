Documentarian/Journalist Taylor Gentry (Angela Goethals) along with her two male camera crew. They are making an documentary about an rising Serial Killer, who called himself Leslie Vernon (Nathan Baesel). They decide to follow his every move by how he's going to find ways to outsmart his prey, setting up traps, stalking his future victims, scaring his potential victims for fun and more. Leslie wants to be the next greatest psycho/horror/slasher/serial killer who ever lived like Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers. But Leslie isn't what he seems to be, especially when his ex-psychiatrist Doc Holloran (Robert Englund) looks for him and Taylor tries to uncover Leslie's real hidden agenda.<br /><br />Directed by Scott Glosserman made an modestly entertaining, sometimes clever mockumentary horror film with some dark humour. The movie it is at best when they focus on Leslie's bizarre character and when it is shot as a documentary, the picture is really effective and sometimes very original. But it's loses any real flair during the third act, when the documentary style is over and when it's becomes an slasher movie like any before is the real letdown in the film. Baesel is actually terrific in the picture. Goethals is also quite good but she shines, when she shares scenes with Baesel. It is nice to see Englund playing against type but sadly his role is a bit short to be enjoyed. Scott Wilson's role as Leslie's only friend Eugene is a hoot as a career killer in hiding. But co-writer/director Glosserman does keeps the horror fans happy by adding in-jokes to your favorite slasher movies and he is not afraid to make fun of them in a good way as well. This could have been a really good little picture but loses its way in the final act of the movie. It's above average fare with enough intelligence, humour and strangeness to keep you interested. It is worth a look. (***/*****).
