Was the word Katanga ever used by Wolfie after "Power to the people" quote? I watched the series for all episode 1977 onward. The series brilliantly depicted the many small rebel groups of the era. Wolfies character was exceptional, Shirl his girlfriend was played to perfection and her father and mother were typical of the Old Ways are best Brigade of the time. Any change from the norm was viewed with suspicion and was considered against society and only harm could come from such thoughts and actions. Wolfie and his comrades were a magnificent creation depicting urban unrest in the UK with humour, pathos and with a certain amount of sincerity in the beliefs that society should be changed. Even Wolfies avid avoidance of work in any shape or form and his bumming for drinks and money was humorous and extremely funny. Need to know about Katanga to settle argument.
