The movie looks like its been taped by some local kids doing a homework for their drama lessons, but even if so.. it would still get F minus as a grade. As the title tells its about some teenage people getting slaughtered. So after watching 1 hour of the movie I found out that it would be more fun to eat my own "***".. at least I wouldn't have such an awful aftertaste in my mouth as I had when watching this movie. The people in this movie would never even get a role in a commercial for toilet paper. Don't watch this movie, eat your own ... instead.. I recommend you watch the "Jason movies instead". Or why not Freddy vs Jason, Scream.
