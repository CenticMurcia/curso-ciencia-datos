I have just finished reading the first three books and have started the final book out of this series. The Face on the Milk Carton was a movie that I remember seeing about ten years ago. I thought that it was a true story. Is it or isn't it? I am reading conflicting stories on this matter. I would also like to see the movie again? Does anyone know if they sell this on VHS or DVD? I cannot seem to locate a copy anywhere. Do they air this on TV still? For those of you who have not read the books, they are page-turners and you will not be able to put them down until finished. The first and second books were the best: The Face on the Milk Carton and Whatever Happened to Janie?.
