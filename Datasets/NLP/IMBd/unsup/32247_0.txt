This movie was wonderful a film created by the masters. There's this Gothic kid in school and he goes crazy because of the fact the teacher didn't like the fact that the kid made a horror flick instead of what he was told to do. Next he goes to a pool party and gets in a fight with a jock then slaps a girl across the face. He rams the Jocks' car and they go into pursuit of each other. The Jock runs the Goth off the road and kills the Goth...or so he thinks. That's when the killing begins. Jeffory (the goth kid) disguises himself as a hot jock to get accepted into school and goes by the name of Chip. Nobody expects it to be "Chip" but they don't realize it is until later...
