There I was, peacefully enjoying the movie. It was quite good, realistic atmosphere, authentic dialogue etc. THEN came the twist... I'm sorry I can't tell you about the rest of the film, I switched it off after that...<br /><br /> NOT because I was offended or repulsed, but because the big 'surprise' had NOTHING WHATSOEVER to do with what had gone before it. It just came completely out of left field. When even the film's tagline shamelessly promotes the one big 'shock' in the movie for all it's worth, you can be sure the rest of the film that's built around it won't be much cop.<br /><br /> Juvenile shock tactics just to get bums on seats? It's schoolboy stuff; and that's really who this film should be aimed at, despite the clamouring of the pseudo-intellectual crowd who claim to love it for its 'daring'. Pssshht.
