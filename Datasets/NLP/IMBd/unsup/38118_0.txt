I am a fan of zombie movies, so I picked this up, knowing it wasn't going to be another Dawn of the Dead. I watched this movie today, and I feel it did what it was made to do, kill time. The zombies don't look that bad, and the gore was nice. The plot is simple, after many of the world's empires nuke the crap out of each other, zombies start springing up. Those who survive meet up and try to survive longer. Now, enough about that, on to the movie. The acting is well... meh, the characters are rather dull, but over all the movie's not a waste of time. It doesn't feel like a whole movie though. The beginning just cuts in after the zombies spring up, the characters know too much about what to do, and the ending just seems there. Many of the characters are just there, never given a name or background, and the number seems to always change. Over all, I feel this movie is a good way to kill time. 4/10
