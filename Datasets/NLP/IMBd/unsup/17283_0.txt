For those who just want a quick to the point review; this movie was awful. I'm not being a film snob; it's not like I went in expecting much, but aside from the Ryan Reynolds and Bill Bellamy eye candy, this movie had nothing to offer. The jokes were flat, the plot was derivative, and the story was not only stupid but painfully redundant. In fact, entire chunks of plot, and characters such as the "token black guy" Jonesy, played by Bill Bellamy, were absolutely pointless, and borderline offensive.<br /><br />If you are going to watch a wacky sexual young-adult romp, watch "Van Wilder" or even an Adam Sandler movie--anything to stop you from wasting your money on "Buying the Cow". It was "straight-to-video" for a reason, trust me!
