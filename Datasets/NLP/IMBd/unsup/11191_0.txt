French Canadian film based on a true story of a senseless killing by two drunken fisherman in the middle of the 19th Century. Setting is the French island of Saint Pierre off the coast of Newfoundland. Juliette Binoche is superb as "Madame La Capitaine" portraying the compassionate wife of the military commander (Daniel Auteuil) on the island. He is also in charge of the prison where the convicted killer, played by Emir Kusturica, awaits his death sentence. He must wait because the town has no guillotine and must get one from Martinque. Here's where Binoche carries the show and demonstrates her significant capability. An excellent story with superior performances that keep viewer's interest to the very end. It was very well worth watching even if I couldn't speak French.
