Good movie, good acting and a very accurate subject so close to American coasts... (St Pierre is a French island off the coast of Newfoundland).<br /><br />This is one of the best anti death penalty films I have seen. A mix of the cowardice of civilian authorities and the pettiness of outposts officials who stick to "principals" and decisions just because they do not want to loose face... killing becomes a way to wash the humiliations of their crummy existence and low wits.<br /><br />A interesting movie to be shown to all the governors of all the Republics where death penalty is still in use...<br /><br />
