I haven't laughed this hard watching a film in years! First of all the very theme is eternal life and how to get it.Sounds promising, doesn't it?Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn in conflict in which they forget the cause,and the conflict becomes it's own purpose.Until... Zemeckis gives us a film with,some might say,predictable plot.But isn't this a satire of the whole scheme? It's filled with smart little jokes and details.Every scene is very precisely built and planed.There was interesting use of longer shots with rich(er) mise-en-scene, and tension built by great editing. In her role Meryl Streep gave us so many wonderful,depicting and amusing little things that she does.Detailes,detailes!Goldie was also very funny,and Bruce was certainly unusual(but in a good way). This film could be used as great lesson in film directing.As a satire it touches a great number of Hollywood film clichés.But isn't learning how to film those clichés basis for making something unique? Anyway,great thanx to the creators of this film!
