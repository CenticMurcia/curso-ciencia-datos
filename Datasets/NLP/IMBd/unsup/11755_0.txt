In this sequel, which uses the same actors for all of Newton family members, Beethoven falls in love with a female St. Bernard and they have four puppies together. Her evil owner, Regina(whose character is not quite as evil as that of Dean Jones in the first film), wants to sell the puppies, but Emily, Ted, and Ryce are determined to take on the responsibility of taking care of them. Dad is nonetheless infuriated when he discovers them, but is once again pressured by the family into keeping them. The family soon heads off for a vacation in the mountains and are eventually tracked to a rural county fair by Regina and her none-too-bright boyfriend, Floyd. A battle ensues, with Regina and Floyd ending up plunging into a muddy river. Back home, the family settles on joint custody of the puppies with Regina's ex-husband, a good-natured man named Brillo. Like the first, this one is guaranteed to get to you in a good way, but still lacks some of the greatness of it.
