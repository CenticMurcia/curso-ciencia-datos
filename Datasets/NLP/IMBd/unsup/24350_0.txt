It's a great film cause it hasn't got too much violence as other new cartoons do, and it bring back memory's to grownups of there childhood days. the songs are great, especially the main song which i think is called care-a-lot which is what's it about, and it truly gets you in the heart where it's suppose to.<br /><br />it proves that the 80's cartoons were better than todays cartoons made by Japanese, cause they always like killing and fighting, but this animated film show we shouldn't kill or hate each other in the world but care for each other by being friends and sharing and caring and even helping each other have a great life with happiness around us.
