okay, now i know that this won an award at cannes but i can only presume that this is because the judges were working under the principle that seems to afflict literary critics from time to time. if it is incomprehensible then it cant be really bad, and who knows it might be great.<br /><br />in a handout which i picked up in the cinema the director confesses to the fact that after each days shooting she then went and wrote the screenplay for the next days filming! now i am no movie mainstream boy, i like to be challenged by films and i like films that require effort. however, i do like films that appear to have something to say, not necessarily a simple beginning, middle, end storyline but at least something in terms of character development if not plot development.<br /><br />it just makes me wonder what the reaction to this film would have been if it had been made in Britain or the USA or France? would everyone be saying its breathtaking and moving and a truly political film? or would we have been saying to the director 'next time work out what you want to say or how you are going to say it...or even better both'. last comment must go to my faithful fellow cinema goers who laughed when the titles came up and someone was credited with writing the script. the smile on my face was not so much through laughter as a wince of uncomprehending pain.
