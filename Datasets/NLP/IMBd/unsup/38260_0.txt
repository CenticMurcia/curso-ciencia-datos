I started out this movie with a positive attitude towards it. Rodney Dangerfield brings character to a character that is essentially a milder, toned down canine version of himself. The animation isn't good, though the opening scene is really well animated. As the movie drags on, more characters are introduced. All of them are clich√©d are very poorly voiced and none of them are interesting in the least. It's good to have Rodney Dangerfield as the star character and main attraction of his movie, but that doesn't mean every other character should be boring and underused. But in the end, it was the little things that made this a real stinker.<br /><br />Rover Dangerfield (Voiced by Rodney Dangerfield) is a gambling dog in Vegas and is owned by a Vegas show girl, Connie. Rover accidentally ruins an illegal deal being done by Connie's mean boyfriend Rocky, so when Connie leaves for a couple weeks, Rocky disposes of the dog, and Rover ends up on a farm. Now Rover must learn to work for his meals and learn to live out of the city. Along the way he makes some boring friends and falls in love with the neighbor farm's dog, Daisy. By the end, Rover must choose between the high life and the farm life.<br /><br />There were quite a few things in this movie that didn't make much sense. First off, Rocky wants to get rid of Rover, so he throws him over the Hoover Dam? It seems like taking him a mile out and leaving would suffice, but instead he gets thrown over a dam. Earlier, Connie got mad at Rocky for showing up late to her birthday. What didn't make sense is, she was about to go on stage, and it seemed the other showgirls surprised her with this, so how was Rocky supposed to know to come. And even if he did know, he only came like a minute after the girls sang happy birthday. One minute late to a party he wasn't in on doesn't seem like that big of deal.<br /><br />Connie shows affection towards Rover. She really loves her dog...maybe a little too much. She's living on a showgirl salary, and she feeds him steak and whatever he wants every day. Everything he does she laughs at, something Rover couldn't pull off for the viewing audience. She is constantly kissing and hugging him, and several times before leaving says she'll miss him. At the end, she drives what must be hundreds of miles to private property just because she thinks he might miss a female dog on the farm...that makes no sense. This movie is supposed to have the realism that humans are the dominant species on the Earth and dogs are their pets, but to me, it seems she is his love slave or something. It's creepy and weird. I almost expected a dog-human make out session from how much she loves him. Also, the farm people love Rover a lot, and are always hugging and kissing him, but why are they neglecting all the other more useful farm dogs?<br /><br />The voices here are just awful. The little farm boy got to my last nerve with his scratchy delivery. He sounded like he's been smoking too much or something. The kid's dad has this monotonous voice that's hard to take seriously. Raffles, the sheep dog also gives some horrid deliveries. Overall, it just should be chalked up to bad voice acting, except for Rodney, and Sal Landi who was quite good as Rocky.<br /><br />Characters and character traits are introduced, but by the end they add up to nothing. Rover is supposedly a funny dog, so you think maybe by the end he'd become a comedian, but nope. Just ditch the idea that everyone thinks he's funny. Rover meets all these dogs on the farm that have unique character traits, but not one of the dogs must've got any more than 10 lines in the entire movie, except for his love interest, Daisy.<br /><br />What's a good way to pick up a mediocre cartoon? How about making it a musical. That usually works right...usually it does, but the music here is so run of the mill. The songs are boring and add nothing to anything. Most of them are random, too and express nothing. One song, Rover sings about not peeing on Christmas trees, one about liking living the high life in Vegas. Might as well have a song about Rover sleeping, and one about him eating. They're about as important as the actual songs.<br /><br />My biggest pet peeve in animated movies was featured here. The farmer's son asks to keep the dog and the dad and the son are discussing this. Meanwhile Rover is saying all kinds of stupid things that are supposed to be witty, during their conversation. For some reason, every time Rover talks, their conversation takes a long pause, then they continue. They aren't paying attention to Rover, they're just randomly taking 30 second pauses after each statement. I seriously hate that in cartoons! Overall, this is a really cruddy animated feature, with voice work that would've been more lively if each character was voiced by Ben Stine, and inconsistencies throughout. Avoid this one, even if you're a fan of Rodney Dangerfield.<br /><br />My rating: * out of ****. 70 mins. Rated G.
