The film was done pretty good. The actresses are also fine-> young, beautiful and talented (I especially liked Fiona Scott).<br /><br />But the story did not impress me. I wasn't excited when I watched this movie, I was somehow looking forward to the end of it. I also felt a little bit sleepy while watching it. When I watch film, I have to understand everything in it-> why is everything just the way it is.. But in this story, things are just not clear enough. I never knew why something happened.. It is like a story for a 5 years old children. Some things just don't make any sense.<br /><br />That's why I give this film only 6/10.
