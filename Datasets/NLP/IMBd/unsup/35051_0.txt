This story is Ah Moon (Chingmy Yau) and Wai, a young couple who move into an apartment in Hong Kong. The movie gets a little convoluted from there, as it seems Moon is having an affair with a guy who is maintaining the pool at their apartment building. I say seems because they are all of a sudden spending time together. I missed the connection, where it came from. Ah Moon dies in a plane crash and the pool guy spots Rosa (also played by Ms. Yau), who looks just like her. You wonder if they will have a relationship. There is a side story involving Tong (the always good Eric Tsang), who is a gay real estate agent. The also always good Sandra Ng plays a laser disc store manager. The problem is, Eric and Sandra's characters are kind of meaningless. Somewhere, there is an excellent film about tragically losing your love and encountering someone who looks just like her, to see if you can fall in love again. The film spends too much time on the relationship of Moon and Wai. I was waiting for Rosa to meet with Wai and see his reaction. Sadly, this film falls short, even though every actor I've seen before (especially Ms. Ng, Ms. Yau and Mr. Tsang) has impressed me with their acting ability. I'm sorry to say I cannot recommend this.
