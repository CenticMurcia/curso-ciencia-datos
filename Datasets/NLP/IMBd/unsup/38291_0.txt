There's not much to say about this. I've tried watching the movie 6 times, but each time I fall asleep. It's boring, ugly and I'm sorry I even bothered to put it in the VCR.<br /><br />It's kinda funny, when you think about it. The first movie is one of the best movies I've ever seen. The plot, the change, the dialogs, the clich√©s, the roles, the music. This movie is the worst one and has none of those highpoints. Absolutely none. It doesn't have a descent plot. The dialogs looks like they try to be funny (though they aren't). It has no links to the real world. The roles aren't good. And even the music sucks. I remember Tito and Tarantula and the Vaughan bros. playing in the first one giving it the GREATEST soundtrack ever.<br /><br />I'm greatly disappointed
