What else would you give your own personal story...<br /><br />This film is probably a coincidence but 9 out of the 10 things that happened in this movie are about me...<br /><br />I attended Avon Old Farms (Where the movie was filmed)<br /><br />I played Hockey there (The lead actor Plays Hockey)<br /><br />The 2nd weekend there I got caught with a girl off campus and was about to get kicked out when...(Don't want to spoil the ending)<br /><br />The Boardroom scene was verbatim.<br /><br />The Teachers were identical.<br /><br />The only thing they left out was my name....<br /><br />I'm very interested in meeting the writer considering the DVD says based on a true story...<br /><br />Yours Truly,<br /><br />The Legend of Avon Old Farms...Todd Johnson<br /><br />P.S. Looks like getting kicked out of AOF 22 years ago was finally worth it.
