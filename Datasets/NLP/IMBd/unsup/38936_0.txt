I agree with the other reviewers on here- not terrible, and it started OFF strong, but fizzled and became extremely sloppy.<br /><br />I have mainly questions, which addresses said sloppiness, rather than a re-hash of the plot you can already find here: 1.) If indeed the kids were killed by the conductor, why would they push cars to safety? They weren't actually hit by a train, and when they were abducted, they were in a stopped and safe position by the tracks.<br /><br />2.) I actually suspected Penn of being the killer for a while- so right away, I didn't question why/how he was at the Depot- then after he was killed, I now wonder how/why he was there.<br /><br />3.) How did the cops know she was in the cemetery? Also, when did Melanie find out that there were none of the other kids buried there? 4.) The Mayor- this is sort of silly- but the guy would have been at LEAST in his 80's- he looked to be maybe in his early 70's...was this just an attempt to get a semi-known actor (Geoffrey Lewis, actually 73) in the movie? Just a few things wrong- otherwise it got kind of boring. But at least they tried to make something original.
