i would say that I've watched only the past 3 series and series after series its the same storyline middle eastern fundamentalist getting hold of a nuclear bomb and jack having to defuse it . thats about it ....................... zzzzzzzzzzz with the budget they have got you would have thought that they would have spent the money on proper sets instead of a car on a rolling track for example when the shots are inside a car the background is whizzing past at 200 miles an hour !!!!!!!!!!!!!! - what the hell is that all about i think that they should bring this series to a hasty conclusion because its done its time now!
