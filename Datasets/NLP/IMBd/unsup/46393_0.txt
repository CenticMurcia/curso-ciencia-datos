Michael Keaton is one of my all-time favorite actors, his style & natural performances in almost all of his films have made me a proud fan. 'The Merry Gentlemen', which marks the debut of the Legendary Actor's directorial debut is a disappointment.<br /><br />'The Merry Gentlemen' is a dull fare, the film just doesn't hold. Keaton's direction is neat, but the screenplay isn't. The film has no pace, it starts with a dull tone and ends the same. The climax also looks artificial & abrupt.<br /><br />Talking on performances, Keaton is okay. This ranks amongst his weak works. Kelly Macdonald is sincere.<br /><br />on the whole... one expected much more from Keaton.
