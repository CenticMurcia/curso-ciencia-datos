I MUST HAVE THIS SOUND TRACK!!! No longer in production, as you watch this movie and how the sound track rolls with it you'll see why both the movie and sound track are classic collector material. Some of the the dialogue was odd (like the plot), but what in the 80's wasn't? Not be goofy with any "message", but I like the love conquers theme and always good vs. bad. The special shots of the races, close to the road were nifty, it gave it a somewhat other-worldly feel and oh that car!!! Dodge really ought to go back to the production line and sell some to Joe Public. Granted not many of the stars may be thrilled with such early work and wish to be thought of as more serious, mature actors, but we all have come a long way, considering it was later that Charles Sheen was in Platoon. He's come a long way, but even in The Wraith, his star was shining, much like Mr. Quaid and Ms. Fenn....& As always, Mr. Howard provides an excellent supporting role. A must for 80's movie collectors.
