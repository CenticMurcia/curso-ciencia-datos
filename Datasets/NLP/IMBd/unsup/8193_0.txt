Although he seemed to be somewhat disappointed by his movie, and from what I gather so did most of the reviewers and audiences, I found this to be one of Kevin's better movies. Maybe it was because I saw this one after I had already seen Dogma and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, but now I got some of those great "in-jokes" that were included in those movies. Of course the running gags and themes that present themselves from one movie to the next make this a real gem. Anyone who doesn't appreciate these films and this writer and director needs serious therapy....And no, I am not related to the guy....
