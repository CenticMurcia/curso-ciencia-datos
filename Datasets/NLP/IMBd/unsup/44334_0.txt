I can agree with the critics, this film certainly started the downfall and eventually end of the Carry On franchise, followed by England, Emmannuelle, and ending with Columbus, all getting one out of five stars, deservedly. It is basically another Carry On Camping, with caravans. So Professors Anna Vooshka (Elke Sommer) and Roland Crump (Kenneth Williams) visit the archaeological site for artifacts, randy site owner Major Leep (Kenneth Connor) tries to keep most things in order, husband Arthur Upmore (Bernard Bresslaw) and Linda (Patsy Rowlands) are trying to enjoy themselves, but have snobbish mother Daphne Barnes (Joan Sims) nagging, butcher Fred Ramsden (Windsor Davies) and Ernie Bragg (Jack Douglas) are misbehaving without their wives to see, and Henry Barnes (Peter Butterworth) is the odd-job man, oh, and Joe Baxter (Dad's Army's Ian Lavender) is about too. Also starring Liz Fraser as Sylvia Ramsden, Adrienne Posta as Norma Baxter, Patricia Franklin as Vera Bragg, Donald Hewlett as The Dean and Carol Hawkins as Sandra. Sid James didn't want to, Barbara Windsor was away, and Charles Hawtrey quit the Carry Ons after Abroad, so no wonder it was doomed to be a repeat of Camping. The most innuendos, and not all funny ones it should be said, come from Sommer and Williams, mainly because of Sommer's weird Russian accent, it's just not as funny as it tries to be, and there's worse to come, trust me. Adequate!
