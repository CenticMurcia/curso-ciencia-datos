I have seen above post just now, and even it is an old comment, I must react. The original story of Vuk the fox has been written by a Hungarian author, Istv√°n Fekete in the 1950's. The book became very popular, so the animation has been created 1981. The author died in 1970, so the answer for the question: was The Glacier Fox the story he used, is NO.<br /><br />The story itself is very sweet, enjoyable for kids and for adults as well. Nowdays it is even recommended book for elementary school children, so if you find the book version, don't hesitate to buy it. For smaller kids the comic book is available also. Have fun with the book or VHS/DVD as well :)
