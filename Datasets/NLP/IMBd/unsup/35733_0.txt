A gaggle of kids - standard slasher movie characters, all of them - who are associates of one of the first film's survivors, go to the desert to race their bikes and test their experimental fuel - and are menaced by the surviving mutant (Michael Berryman) from the first film, as well as a new ugly thug, "The Reaper" (John Bloom).<br /><br />Silly sequel; truly a disappointment from a talented horror veteran (Wes Craven), from whom I expect more than just a run-of-the-mill slasher film, which is what this is. The first film could have been seen as a statement on the breakdowns of family units, but writer / director Craven obviously didn't care about making Part II particularly intelligent.<br /><br />Highly reminiscent of a "Friday the 13th" movie, with a Harry Manfredini score that sounds much too familiar.<br /><br />Cast is nothing special at all, though it is amusing to see Penny Johnson (Jerald), recently of the TV series '24' (she played Sherry Palmer), paying some serious dues, and to see Janus Blythe reprise her role from the first film.<br /><br />Michael Berryman is fun as always; with those distinctive features of his, he was born to be a cult actor.<br /><br />The fiery finale is okay.<br /><br />You know you can't take a movie seriously when even the dog has flashbacks!<br /><br />3/10
