There us no reason why this movie should ever have been made the first time yet alone twice. No one wants to see a family that includes and young boy get murdered with the psycho killers getting away. There is no reason for this idiocracy, and who makes such stupid choices? Run away you stupid kid, who hides next to a fire place? No house phone? And how many movies have you seen where the car you flag down is the villain? The answer is every horrible abductor movie. Think of something new, will ya. This movie made me angry, and if that is the reaction you wanted your the same a the psycho killers. Demented and sadistic. And for the people who say that the acting was great, wake-up No one would make the choices they make or react that way. This was just plain bad.
