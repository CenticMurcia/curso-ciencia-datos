This movie knocked me off of my feet. It is truly a masterpiece. Incredibly entertaining and will delight anyone with an adventurous spirit. This movie is about souls and emotions and the twisted splendor of the imagination. Although I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who is faint of heart or square. Those who are judgmental will never be able to be open enough to understand and be moved by this amazing film. It is truly one that I will always keep in my collection and never forget what it meant to me when I first watched it. I could watch it a million times and never be bored. It is as great as the person watching it's interpretation of it and willingness to see people and love for what it is, without all the structure and stereotypes that society attaches.
