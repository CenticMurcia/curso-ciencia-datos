Even by surgeons' standards,Doctor Stone is horrible and arrogant.Disliked by fellow medics in his big city hospital,none of whom will be sorry to see the back of him,he is on his way to L.A. keen to make his first million in Cosmetic Surgery.After taking an illegal route round a traffic jam he runs his vintage Porsche into a picket fence owned by the Judge in a one - ute town down south.Failing to bamboozle them with his big city ways,he ends up in the Judge's courtroom and is sentenced to do community service at the local hospital which is under threat due to the imminent retirement of the town doctor,a wise and experienced old-style MD.The rest is pure Preston Sturges. Mr Michael J Fox is more convincing as the big city man than the country boy he eventually aspires to be but it is the extraordinary Miss Julie Warner who keeps "Doc Hollywood" from disappearing up its own Jubilation T.Cornpone.From the moment he sees her Dr Stone's career as a Plastic Surgeon is dead in the water - he just needs to be made to realise it. Mr Ogden-Stiers and the rest of the cast comfortably carry off the not-as-easy-as-it-looks task of playing convincing small town folk without being hokey. Mr George Hamilton is especially ghastly as the Plastic Surgeon Doctor Stone aspires to work for,convincing down to his appalling pony tail. "Doc Hollywood" is a splendid view of America as it would like to be seen,all the more remarkable then that it was directed by a Scotsman.
