This is one of those movies that as itself is a gem. For those that have seen it, and "want to know more" I HIGHLY recommend getting the book the movie was based upon. The movie is like a "Cliff's Notes" version of about 5 chapters of the book!!!<br /><br /> Only complaint was that I think it was a bit TOO vague on the missionary selection process in the beginning of the movie - but did a great job avoiding the "dogma" aspect and staying true to the story.<br /><br /> Two thumbs up (even if their my own).
