I had never expected the ending! Though I was just getting the 'hints' somewhere in between.<br /><br />The acting by most of the guys is simply great. The movie is quite entertaining. I just felt that the movie would go on.<br /><br />Though Nasiruddin has not acted, his wife & son have filled the gap! <br /><br />I had never imagined that Suhasini Muley could play such a role.<br /><br />Irrfan looks cool and portrays the slightly difficult role (for him it might have been a cakewalk!) effortlessly.<br /><br />Paresh Rawal doesn't need much of writing because he delivers much more than what is expected of him.<br /><br />The most beautiful aspect of the movie is that all the newcomers act very credibly. And they have added freshness to the movie.<br /><br />Shergill is the likable best. <br /><br />On the whole, quite satisfying!
