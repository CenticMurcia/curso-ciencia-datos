This movie really surprised me because I thought it was going to be another "dumb blonde" movie but it really had purpose and meaning.The plot line was really good and I think it teaches kids a lot about responsibility and life in the real world. I think that the duo of Aly and AJ was really good, I think that being sisters in real life is good for on-screen chemistry. They had that real sibling "love" that was really great. All the actors were great except the french guy who seemed a little fake to me but he was OK. Though I must say that the guys weren't too hard to look at. Especially Michael Travino as Jackson he was really good. I really like this movie and it seemed like is should have been more than a Disney channel original movie.
