Well, to say the least of film; I'd say it is horrible. Some actor's were amateur-ish at best. As if they were hire from the street in order to get into the movie. Let us see... well we have the Bloodz which are the Vampire's and the Wolvez which are the Werewolves, that's simple enough, right?<br /><br />I was surprised to see this movie; my friend rented it and hey, the title looked "cool". So, we sat down and 30 minutes into the movie, I couldn't take it and ejected it out of the DVD player. It looked like a film that was done by a hand-held camera and was window media'd. <br /><br />I remember a part into the movie where the Wolves attacked innocent people or rivals? I'm not sure, once the killing stopped, the wolves were resting on the floor, their features were covered and masked with "blood", and traces of the masscere was left by bones. Chicken bones. Yes, Chicken bones. <br /><br />If you wish to rent or own this movie; stay away!<br /><br />On the bright side, it'd make one of hell of a present for someone you hate.
