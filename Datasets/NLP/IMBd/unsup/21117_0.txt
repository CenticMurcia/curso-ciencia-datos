"Assault! Jack the Ripper" is a notoriously popular pinku eiga film with a heaping dose of brutality and sex. Two restaurant employees - one an inadequate male and the other a vexed female - accidentally kill a flaky hitch-hiker after she, quite sexfully, smears cake on her naked breasts and self-mutilates in their backseat. Terribly scared of their misdeed, they develop a sexually romantic relationship, though it seems to only spark when they commit murder... They soon embark on a killing spree, kidnapping women, raping them and stabbing them with a pastry knife. The guy acquires a predilection for vaginal evisceration and his girlfriend seems to like it when he sixty-nine's chicks. There is plenty of what the 'pinky violence' fans are after: cruel death scenes and constant sleaze. "Assault!" never lets up throughout it's short run-time and isn't afraid to delve into all sorts of lurid activity. Very entertaining stuff! The production value is very good, might I add, and well shot and the acting is also believable. Highly recommended!
