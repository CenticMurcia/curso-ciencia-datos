The first five minutes we see some really bad actors go into a cave where there's a monster. The monster comes out quickly, we don't see him, so I'm assuming this might make a good movie.<br /><br />The next half hour we get a bimbo, who we're supposed to believe is a park ranger, the only park ranger who never wears her uniform top. Instead, she prances around in a tight tank top displaying her large breasts. If this were real, every ranger in the U.S. would want to work with her. She wouldn't be believable as a mall security guard, let alone a park ranger.<br /><br />For the next 30 minutes we get 100% soap opera. Really, really bad dialog and amazingly bad acting and the whole time I'm literally cringing wondering how in the world any filmmaker could start out what is supposed to be a horror film with this? We get thousands of flashes back to an accident she caused and a really badly dubbed bird that not a single viewer bought into (man, this is one of the most clich√©d movie devices ever, in fact we get two: the blabbing, poorly dubbed bird and the "a bad thing happened to me so I'm an alcoholic" character). <br /><br />Was this movie made by some junior high kids? Didn't I see Steven Cannell's name in the credits? I couldn't watch anymore. After a half hour I started fast forwarding, then skipping sections to see if anything would happen and there was LOTS of bad acting and still whatever I'd skip to was long and boring and finally I couldn't watch anymore. I don't know what the monster looked like or what he was up to because I couldn't take this unbelievably boring and poorly acted film. And looking at the lead actress's credits, she actually has gotten a lot of work. It makes me sad; very, very sad.<br /><br />Note to idiot filmmakers who make these bad straight-to-DVD movies: bad acting and dialog to start out a movie (and throughout the movie) is not going to get your movie watched or any positive reviews (or more work for you). I absolutely cannot remember how this ended up in my Netflix queue but it did force me to go through it with a fine tuned comb.
