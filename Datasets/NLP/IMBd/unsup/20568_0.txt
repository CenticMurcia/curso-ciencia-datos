John Anderton (Tom Cruise), chief of the service of precrime in Wanshington, tries to prove his innocence against a system which has indicated him as a future murderer. <br /><br />In Order to give life to a rather pessimistic universe, from the American writer Philip K. Dick, Steven Spielberg had the courage to create the darkest movie of his career (so far at least), which touches important ethical dilemmas about the types of protection of the human being, beating the crime, respect for the individual freedom and the responsibilities of the citizens and the law.<br /><br />Pioneering and deeply prophetical representation of a dark future , with Tom Cruise in one of his darkest and most demanding interpretations of his career.<br /><br />I believe there are similarities with Davis' The fugitive. At least after a while you feel the same agony about the hero.
