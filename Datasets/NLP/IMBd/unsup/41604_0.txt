In the beginning, Harry Enfield played a character called "Little Brother". Then one day Little Brother grew up, morphed into Kevin the Teenager and was joined by Kathy Burke as his friend Perry. The resulting sketches, screened on Enfield's television program over a number of series, were among the highlights of the show. When Kevin finally got laid the result was hilarious, a long-awaited punchline to a joke years in the telling.<br /><br />At the peak of his creativity, Enfield frequently killed off characters before they exceeded their natural lifespan (Little Brother himself being a case in point). But recently, that creativity seems to have been drying up, and Kevin and Perry were resurrected, first on TV (Kevin's sexual encounter explained as a dream) and now in this disappointing film.<br /><br />So what's wrong? Firstly, this film is cruder than the TV series (illustrated by the endless repetition of one particular sight gag that was fresh at its first outing but that does not survive its over-exposure here). Secondly, Enfield has bizarrely decided to make a parody of the clubbing scene, and does so with such clumsiness that he fails to make a mark on a very easy target. With a dance soundtrack playing throughout, he has actually made the sort of film that Kevin and Perry themselves might enjoy. This is not a compliment.<br /><br />More generally, a lot of the humour of the original sketches comes from the sheer unlikeness of the leads, the way that they somehow exactly capture teenage behaviour in spite of their ill-disguised age and, in Burke's case, sex. The simple shock delivered each time one is re-introduced to the characters leaves one laughing for half of a two minute scene; but for only one percent of a feature film. With nothing in the way of character development, only very many, very good, and very varied jokes could save this movie. There are funny moments; but nowhere near enough. <br /><br />My advice: stick to the TV re-runs to enjoy Kevin in his natural habitat. Or watch "Norbert Smith - A Life", a TV film and underrated gem from Enfield's past rich with a creativity sadly lacking here.
