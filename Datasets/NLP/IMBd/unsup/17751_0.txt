I'm always up for a good caper movie, and this is one of the better ones. It doesn't get overworked with such intricacy and tension that trying to keep up with it would prove unsatisfying. Instead, this one puts together a nice blend of mystery, suspense, intrigue and humor, and does it with a capable cast and clever writing. The hacker group's lone egghead is at the same time a conspiracy theorist (Dan Ackroyd) who balances out his own personality, while the rest are a complementary lot to their leader, Robert Redford, alias Martin Brice, alias Martin Bishop. I couldn't quite see Sidney Poitier as a member of the group in the early going, but he did deliver the film's best line in my estimation - "You guys would be chalk outlines without me".<br /><br />The film was somewhat eerily prophetic in it's treatment of an attempt by our country's enemies to acquire access to computers controlling the national power grid. Recent headlines in the news make mention of just such a scenario with the potential to cripple the nation's infrastructure. The bad guys have been pitted against the good guys since the beginning of time, but with each passing year, the stakes continue only to escalate.<br /><br />I tuned in to "Sneakers" last night without realizing that I had seen it before, and kept wondering for a while why I knew what was coming next. It was Mary McDonnell's appearance that finally brought me to my senses - I remembered that she was also pretty hot the first time around!
