this could have been really interesting, if it hadn't got bogged down with the inevitable patriotic do your bit bull that you just knew was coming. I'd have to say I was very disappointed when the guy who questions the motives on America's war on Iraq turns up to do his bit to fight for his country. a half as$ed attempt to show the film makers are looking at all sides proves they were only ever going to show one. and the ridiculous bit in the beginning where the macho loser says yeah I want to fight them cos of what they did in 911???? like we don't all know that Iraq had nothing to do with 911. lame lame lame. a good opportunity wasted. who wrote and funded this again?
