I think one of the reason we favor this show over shows like Survivor is that, for the most part, the contestants are in charge of their own fates. In a race around the world, if you avoid finishing last on each leg, you stay in the game ... no voting beyond the contestants' control exists to spoil their effort.<br /><br />Outside of the drama of the contest, the show is an educational travel show in many ways. For example, the show often goes through India. After seeing what happens to contestants there, I'll never travel to India.<br /><br />An entertaining and for the most part intelligent show, I highly recommend The Amazing Race to fans of TV reality contests.
