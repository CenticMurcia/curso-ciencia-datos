Yes I admit I like this show. I enjoyed the first family more but the banter between Mr. Powell , the grandpa , curmudgeon military man vs. silly,naive, party animal, reckless Buddy Lembeck was truly magic and fun to watch every episode. I thought Scott Baio character was horrible on Happy Days and ChaChi was a shark jumper for that show. On this show , I felt that Scott Baio was a great character as the 'nanny' so to speak. It was a light show and thoroughly enjoyable. Not great acting, not exactly ALL IN THE FAMILY status, but it worked and it did not pretend to be something it was not. A light show with OK acting and good for a few wholesome laughs.
