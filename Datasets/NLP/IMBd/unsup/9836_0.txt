For the kind of film and the budget available it was a decent movie. The acting was fairly good. I just think that more detail should have been given about some of the character's past like Lily and Constance and their home. What happened to it exactly? How are they able to mimic human behavior so naturally and change their physical form? What do they do to their mate exactly? Luke and his female officer friend seemed to have met before. When, and what happened to them? I felt that this was the biggest drawback of the entire film. Other than that it was great. Hopefully in the sequel all these unanswered questions will be explained. If at all possible I hope to see some of the original cast returning (Corey Sevier, Kim Poirier, Elias Toufexis, Meghan Ory, and Stefanie von Pfetten). A soundtrack would have been nice. I really liked the music.
