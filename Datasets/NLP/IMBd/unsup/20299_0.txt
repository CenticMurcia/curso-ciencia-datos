I first saw this movie several years ago when I was really on a role on seeing films starring the Marx Brothers, I loved a lot of those great comedy teams, Abbott and Costello, Martin and Lewis, Laurel and Hardy, and The Three Stooges! And so one day, I watched this movie, and I can absolutely say a lot of things in its favor! This is a movie that is filled with what you'd expect to see from the Marx Brothers! This is their best of the 1940's! This is not as funny as their earlier films, Duck Soup and A Night At The Opera, but this is totally worth a rating of ten stars! This movie is really hysterical, I remember that when I saw this, I was laughing so hard, I fell on the floor in tears, I honestly thought that I was going to die, this is so very hysterical! If you are really a huge fan of the Marx Brothers and want to see a movie that is really a huge slap-happy time, then this is a movie that I would very recommend that you see! As usual, Groucho is his usual self in this movie, saying very sarcastic comments to people who are complaining to him! Out of all of the Marx Brothers that I have seen, Grouch is my favorite, he is funny, he is abusive, he is just Groucho!<br /><br />Like I just said, this is not the best movie that the Marx Brothers ever made, their best film is Duck Soup, but this is a movie that is going to get you laughing your head off at, this movie has very big laughs, it is a must see for all fans of the Marx Brothers! I can say that this is another one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen, though I have seen a lot of movies funnier than this one, but it is just one of the funniest movie that I have seen in my life! <br /><br />10/10
