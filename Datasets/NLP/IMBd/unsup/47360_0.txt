The main problem with this version of "Bedazzled" is that it wants to be loved. The Peter Cook/Dudley Moore original had a cynical bite that is completely missing here. It was also concerned not just with the schlemiel's wishes, but with what makes the Devil tick. Why does he do what he does? What's his relationship with God? Unfortunately, that movie's viewpoint that God is generally far more callous and satanic than Satan is not even hinted at here.<br /><br />That being said, this version does what it wants to do very well. Elizabeth Hurley is hot and Brendan Fraser again proves to be a likable and versatile actor. He also convinced me: you can believe Dudley Moore as an unnoticed little shnook. But Brendan Fraser??? Well, he does it.<br /><br />This is a good (safe) American version of an acerbic British classic. It is well worth seeing (at matine√© prices.) I just hope this means that the original will become available on DVD now. *That* one is a keeper.
