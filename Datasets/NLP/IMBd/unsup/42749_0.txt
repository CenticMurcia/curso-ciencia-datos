If you have to watch one horror movie with a ghost-killer donning a pair of mountain climbing boots with spikes and brandishing a pick-ax as a weapon this season, this will have to suffice for now. It's about a guy who, after being a successful mountain climber, came home and in a daze killed his wife and children, then hung himself. So, what better way to celebrate Halloween years later than to have a internet-camera view of every room during one night when a bunch of teens have sex in nearly every room for paying customers on0line to see (after, you know, conjuring the dead back to life in a wedgie-board set-up)? Then, of course, wackiness ensues! And by that I mean there's lots of grisly murders, and a lot of people doing stupid things and getting themselves killed.<br /><br />Now, as far as direction goes, Adam Matalon isn't any genius but he's done a few scenes here that are somewhat horrific visually (even the opening scenes, tinted puke-green, have a good effect on the mood), and as he treads very familiar ground (from various haunted house movies to Halloween Resurrection just to name one obvious title) he makes things dumb, trashy, sleazy, and sometimes funny in the most garish ways imaginable. The cast, mostly first-timers and indie players like Broome, Ciccarelle, Christal, Falcone, Folan, Greer, do what little they can (which, actually, isn't very much with such paltry writing and invisible-paper-thin characters), and the filmmakers rely on lots of 'GOTCHA!' suspense and violence that goes to as far extremes as a direct-to-DVD can try to go.<br /><br />Despite an ending that is (somewhat) promisingly bleak, and the so-real-it's-real turn by Krista Grotte as guest porn star Kristy Luv (who may be a real porn star, I'm not sure, definitely looks the part), it's all second-rate at best. While not really a Z-grade offering, and with a couple of moments of inspiration and cheap thrills and laughs, it's mostly lame and sour work.
