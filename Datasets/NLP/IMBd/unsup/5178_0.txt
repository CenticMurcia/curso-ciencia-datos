You would think that acting would be in Cameron Douglas' genetic code with his Dad and especially grandfather being talented actors. That is what I thought going into this movie. With the past successes of National Lampoons with Chevy Chase, Animal House, Van Wilder and coupled in this movie with the lovely Emmanuelle Chriqui and my expectations were high. <br /><br />So disappointed. Douglas is absolutely horrid. Quite obviously he received this job based solely on his last name. You will sit there hoping the movie gets better, but it does not. Don't waste your time with this one. "Pathetic" really doesn't do this film justice.
