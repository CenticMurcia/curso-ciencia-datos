Dreadful film, with some of the worst acting this side of "Dynasty." I've seen MÃ¤dchen Amick before, and liked her, but this time she definitely sank to the level of the script. But give her credit--at least she had the good sense to look embarrassed and uncomfortable (constipated even) virtually every time she uttered one of her poorly-written lines. And who is Andrew W. Walker? My best guess is, he's related to the director or casting director, because how else could such an unappealing and untalented actor be cast in this part? The chemistry between the "leads" wasn't just missing--it had actually turned putrid and emitted a foul odor. Save yourself a lot of aggravation and 2 hours of your precious time. Avoid this movie!!!
