The sequel to The Ring, The Ring 2 is a continuation of the story in the first movie. It is better if you watch the first one because seeing it will only lead to many questions. After the events that happened in the first movie. Mai the student of Ryuji continues the search of the origin of the videotape and how it can be stopped. With the help of the university doctor, they found an idea on how to pacify the contents of the videotape. Not as good as the first but the last scenes of the The Ring intrigues moviegoers to the sequel. A great sequel that lack only some chilling scenes like as the first that was very scary. Frightening scenes are lessen in the movie but as i have said a great sequel to watch.
