Let me first try to give you some reasons of why you SHOULD see this movie.... Errrrrm....Wait, I'ts on the tip of my tongue...errmmm....Gimme a minute, will ya...errrm....<br /><br />Well, that rather says it all doesn't it?<br /><br />Bad acting (!SPOILER! - Especially the damsel in distress who turn into a Rambo after losing all her friends), bad effects (! SPOILER! - No really, how can a giant spider emerge from someone's mouth like that? )and especially : Bad casting (although the Male lead character who's name escapes me DID closesly resemble a HeMan type o' guy...)<br /><br />If you are into this kind of "underground" movies, go right ahead and take a good laugh at it before you return it to the video rental store, because I know you won't laugh as easily if you decided to actually buy this one....
