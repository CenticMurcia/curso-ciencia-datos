This might be the WORST movie I've ever seen. Junk like PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE at least has some camp entertainment value. But this movie doesn't even have that sense of fun going for it. The acting is uniformly dreadful. The police procedure is of the most ridiculous level (let's see, kids getting slaughtered nightly at the same drive-in movie, what should we do? Close the theatre? Have dozens of cops staking it out? Nope, let's just have two cops park at one end of this huge parking lot and hope they see something. And one of them has to dress as a woman, because God knows only couples to to drive-ins). The sound is horrible, the opening song is unbearable. Oh, God, I could go on and on and on, but I've already wasted enough with this movie. If can only stop one person from seeing this movie, it'll have been worth it!
