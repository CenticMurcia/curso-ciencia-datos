I love the original Nightmare on Elm Street like everyone else does but I also liked 'Freddy's Revenge' just as much. Many critics give it a horrible rating for it straying too far from the original ideas of Craven and Co. But wait a second.... Freddy is attempting this time to take over a young teenagers body and therefore become 'human' and no longer just a figment of perception, so far the idea is captivating to me. I think what did it for me in this movie was the fact that before this movie, Freddy could only come to you in your dreams and that was it. Freddy doesn't really have much breathing room as far as his capabilities go at this point but now (Part 2) he can get into a body and become real! Just the thought of this madman coming into the real world and wreaking havoc is scary enough for anyone that could realistically perceive this. Yes there were some 'pseudo-gay' references in some scenes which could have been handled differently (director Jack Sholder to this date still denies any intentional use of homo-erotic references). And when we were all teenagers we all had those teenage-sexual confused period/phases in our lives and maybe these references in the movie were only done to better capture whats going on in the mind of the life of a male teenager in Springwood, Ohio in 1985. I may be wrong but all in all I thought this movie was very good , and regardless of what other critics think..I will proudly give this movie eight out of ten stars.
