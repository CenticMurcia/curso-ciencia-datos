I found this movie incredibly hilarious. I went to see it purely because I knew an acquaintance of mine had a cameo in it. (He interned for Will Shortz and was one of the competition judges.) <br /><br />I ended up being completely surprised at how funny it was. The witty quips from participants and judges were priceless. I've never played a crossword puzzle in my life and I still enjoyed the film. You'll find yourself rooting for certain contestants to win the competition. <br /><br />The celebrity cameos are done well and are actually a substantial part of the movie.<br /><br />I've recommended this movie to the entire English department at my college. You won't regret the price of admission!
