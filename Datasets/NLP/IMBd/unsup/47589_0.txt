I have this movie on a Rhino Collection called "Horrible Horrors" and it's not really a horror movie. A native American dude is sent to a psychiatric institute for leaving 4 of his companions in the desert to die as part of some tribal justice thing. Of course he was tried and committed by white folk so therefore when he escapes he goes after them, and takes them out to the desert for...either tribal justice or revenge, you can decide. He leaves these 4 people in the desert to die but they're crafty to some extent and have read their survivalist manuals, apparently, so they make shoes out of dead rabbits, eat cactus, and collect water with a plastic raincoat. Of course, Mr. "I'm Not Insane" is hanging out nearby to make sure they don't wander away from his desired fate for them, but somehow they do manage to decide that they want to live and begin to look for help. None of the characters are particularly likable so there's one big problem there, go ahead and die, the viewer might wish. At one point the head "survivalist guy" Sam, says "it's not over yet" but you'll sure wish it was. Overall it's sort of watchable but in a sort of "I'm too lazy to get up and take it off" way. 4 out of 10.
