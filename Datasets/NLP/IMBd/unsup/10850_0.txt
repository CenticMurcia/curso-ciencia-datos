The OMEN, CARRIE, DAMIEN, CARRIE, LAURA MARS, and even HIGH ANXIETY... wasn't he late 70s full of ghastly eye-rolling trubbbble! BURNT OFFERINGS and even AUDREY ROSE.... some paranormal some psychic most pukey (but DAMIEN OMEN 2 was terrific, and ANXIETY genuinely hilarious) .......and then the worst this one, THE FURY. It is a weak link in an ordinary chain of thrillers. I really disliked it 30 years ago and groaned even more again tonight. As the film progressed, with awful back projected car chases and hammy faux Hermann/Hitchcock music score, implausible plot twists (personal phone calls to pubic railway platforms etc) and basically disgusting bleeding and body part effects THE FURY was considered a major misfire in 1978. After his fabulous PHANTOM OF THE PARADISE and horrible CARRIE and spew worthy BODY DOUBLE and the hilariously awful but compelling SCARFACE in the 80s, I basically gave up on De Palma and I actually believe most audiences did too. I ran cinemas at the time and the audiences let us know their irritation at his bad films well known. Andrew Stevens was a surprise in the casting and effective very early on as the male version of Amy Irving but sadly absent for most of the rest of the film. Cassavetes. like Douglas must have wanted some cash to buy a holiday house and accepted the silly parts offered here. THE FURY should be remade as an orgasm comedy even with the same script, then it would be more plausible and enjoyable. That's its best and only possibility for a new century audience.
