it looks like this movie cost ten dollars to make. I love chuck but damn! this is so cheesy. the camera work sucks, its bad folks. the editing, you name it. what really worries me is the same producing team and company is working on Rambo 4. oh no! avi Lerner eh? looks like we have the next Golan globus. man even they hired better directors! there is no way this cost ten mil to make. that may have been chucks pay. the movie the perfect weapon was probably made for just about the same amount of money when that came out and that looked 100 times better than this movie. chuck! please do something with better film makers.<br /><br />oh and what sucks is that whenever he encounters a bad guy, hmm he just happens to know martial arts too??? and oh man, the close ups were killing me. the one extreme close up on Tracy scoggins' face were really bad! those wrinkles! oy vey
