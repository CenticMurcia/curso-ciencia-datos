In this Walt Disney produced comedy, a track coach (Dean Jones) begins a new job coaching the "Godolphins", a team without a ghost of a chance of winning anything. <br /><br /> The ladies he is staying with are the great-great granddaugters of Blackbeard the ghost, and they are about to lose their home if they don't come up with $38,000 to pay off their mortgage. A crooked gambling man plans to get their propterty and build a casino on the site. <br /><br /> Dean Jones' charcter accidently finds a spell or 'conjuration' that brings back the 'ghost of Blackbeard' who gets involved in trying to save the home of his great-great granddaughters from the crooked gambler, and all types of antics follow. <br /><br /> The characters in this film do not click together. Translation: it's just not funny. Perhaps younger children (definitely under 13) might like it, but I suspect most adults will be annoyed by the corny acting performances of almost every principle actor in the film. Even the great Peter Ustinov can't save this sinking ship. It would have been better to leave 'Blackbeard's Ghost' in limbo, thus sparing the rest of us from this shipwreck of a movie. I give it a 4/10
