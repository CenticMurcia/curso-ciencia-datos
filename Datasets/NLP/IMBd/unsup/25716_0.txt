Well I haven't yet watched this movie but I would surely like to watch it. I would like to appreciate director for such a bold and courageous effort. And the bad thing is that masses would watch it as just another work of art or ....... sadly in the so called largest democracy of the world there is no democracy at all. minorities in Punjab, eastern states, Kashmir have suffered thru successive Indian governments and continue to do so. My heart and feelings are with all those unfortunate but brave people who stood out for their self-respect and civil rights. SHAME on fascist people who still thrive freely !!! It is a blot on the image of India until justice is done to those innocent people
