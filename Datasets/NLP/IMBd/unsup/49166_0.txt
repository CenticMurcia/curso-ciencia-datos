yet another example of hollywood being totally out touch with how to make GOOD movies. and yet another example of an editing team/studio thinking they can cut and chop a movie to make it something it wasn't intended to be (a boring art house flick, not an action movie). Uma Thurman looks fantastic in dual roles, but she along with everyone else, looks lost and confused as to what they're supposed to do with these characters. ralph fiennes was laughably bad and Sean Connery finally gave his first truly horrible performance.<br /><br />i don't totally feel they are to blame though. the blame should be dumped on the director, editor and studio. how stuff like this gets past quality control is beyond me.<br /><br />if you want to check out Uma's amazing body (which is the ONLY reason i rented it) then go ahead. but when you get the worst migraine you've ever had trying to comprehend why you sat through this pile of dung, you have noone to blame but yourself.<br /><br />
