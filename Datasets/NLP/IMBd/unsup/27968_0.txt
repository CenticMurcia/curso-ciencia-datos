Indigo is a wonderful movie, that appeals to all ages as essentially it is a movie about "remembering" the wonderful love within each of us and the psychic abilities we all have, when we remember how to use our psychic muscle. <br /><br />Indigo young people and children been on earth since Atlantis and up until the 1970's ! its all about DNA .. they have been being born in huge numbers since 1975 and are here to herald in a new age of light, love & communication on earth.<br /><br />I hosted the movie in New Zealand and had totally amazing reviews! I am still receiving emails and phone calls a week later. I have seen the movie twice and look forward to seeing it again soon.<br /><br />Namaste, Jo Brothers
