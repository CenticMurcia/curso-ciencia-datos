Unfortunately is is often overlooked in the competition because it's not as much fun to watch as MANOS or PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE but honest, believe me, you won't fail to be disappointed if you watch this. From an alien presence which is, unapologetically, a red flashlight beam sliding across the wall, to the end of the entire world told from the point of view of a single remote cabin in the Canadian woods, to the SPACE ODDESSEY-influenced ending involving a non-sequiter image of naked children frolicking in a meadow, this movie will rock your world. And possibly, tip it over.<br /><br />Plus there is the amazing disregard of normal attention spans - this plays like an editor's worst nightmare. You can learn a lot about movie-making from watching this movie closely. I think you know what I mean.
