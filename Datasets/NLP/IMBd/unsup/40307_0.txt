That's about the start and the finish to it. This movie portrays a woman lusting not after the greater good, but after the celebrity that accompanied her work - irregardless of whether or not her family suffered consequences of her actions.<br /><br />After being threatened with the kidnap and rape of her child, she still goes on television telling her story, it became obvious to me that this is not the tale of a hero, but the story of the self-obsessed idiot who only cared for her own career.<br /><br />Terrible film, poor acting and the make-up crew screwed up on John (tan face, white hands) so badly I actually laughed. In summary,I wouldn't recommend this film to my dog. Nothing else can really be said about it.
