I saw the trailer and thought o this looks like a good film, so i went to the cinema to see it and within the first 10 mins it got straight into it, which was great. Then it were 2hrs of boring chit chat between the 2. People were actually leaving the cinema about 50% the way through, saying it was crap. And yeh the twist was good idea, but for 2 mins then the end, come on ppl that was a let down tbh. When the credits rolled, i was wonderin when this "amazing" "masterpiece" film acclaimed by top movie critics was actually going to start lol !!. What were these guys on man !!.<br /><br />Overall: Good start, then awful throughout, then a disappointing ending !
