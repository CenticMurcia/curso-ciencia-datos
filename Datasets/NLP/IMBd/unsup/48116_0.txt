This worthless piece of garbage is an absolute embarrassment and shame to the amazing anime series. They change so much that it may as well not be called death note, and the cinematography/effects are worse than the acting. These live action adaptations are simply horrid, and it boggles my mind how this has a rating beyond 2/10 overall. I can only assume that a bunch of 10 year old's who've never seen the anime voted 10 a bunch of time.<br /><br />Do not waste your precious time watching this terrible live action adaptation of a GREAT anime series. Ironically, this movie does not do justice to the series at all, and in fact, tarnishes its name and may be considered evil by some.
