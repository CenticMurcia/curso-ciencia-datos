This was a labor of love for cagney and it was a big flop. When he played a gangster again in white heat a year later it was a big hit. In the 40's cagney wanted to stay away from the gangster films but most of the films he made did pretty bad. This is one of his best films, up there with smart money and the roaring twenties.
