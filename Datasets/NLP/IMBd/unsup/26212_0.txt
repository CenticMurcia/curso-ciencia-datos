Fran√ßois Ozon revisits the pairing of a young woman with an older one of his brilliant and haunting Regarde la mer (1997) n a whimsical parody of a serial detective writer , Charlotte Rampling as Sarah, an Agathe Christi like authoress, you know, in whose pages the bodies pile up like cordwood but no one is really hurt, attempting to find lost inspiration for yet another iteration. Her interlude in, where else, the south of France, is interrupted by a brash and slightly overripe nymphet, Ludivine Sagnier as Julie, daughter of Sarah's publisher and owner of the villa, and the prim and disciplined Sarah. who lives in London with her father, engage in a intergeneration game of dare, with Julie subtly drawing Sarah, lulled by the warmth and French cuisine, into activities she normally would eschew. Sarah's muse is roused and she happily pecks away on her laptop, expanding her scope with the journal she pinched from Julie's knapsack. At this point the plot becomes so far-fetched I began to believe we had entered the reality of Sarah's incipient novel. But this is more Claire Denis than Ozon, who seems to adhere to a linear narrative in his films, so the whimsy theory took hold. Viewed in that light, the film is entertaining.
