Gee, I really liked that movie! It was very very good. I am a great fan of romantic comedies and I have seen so many of them. This movie goes a huge step further. Take an ordinary romantic comedy: 2 people meet, fall in love for each other, mostly have to get over some difficulties and in the end: BOOM! They finally got each other and some heartbreaking music is being played while the credits are shown. But noone knows what happens afterwards. Do they stay together? Where is their love going to? This movie is just about that. And that is a very innovative idea. The movie starts at a point where the feeling of fresh love is gone and everyday-life has come into place. The love of Katie ( Michelle Pfeiffer who gives yet another moving performance) and Ben ( Bruce Willis who shows great talent in an unusual role. With this movie and The Sixth Sense, he is on the best way to become a character actor.) isn't as big as it would be when they met. They get separated while their kids are in a camp and remember THE STORY OF THEM. These scenes are incredible funny and sad moments. The supporting cast ( especially Rita Wilson and director Rob Reiner) also do a great job. For it's originality and intelligent script and great performances, I give this movie 10/10.
