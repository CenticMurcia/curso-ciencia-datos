I absolutely loved this series about a coroner's experiences, and have tried in recent years to find a TV replacement, all to no avail. Cold Case Files is bearable (but no Quincy) while CSI is both dark & stark and far too graphic. No opportunity is lost to display blood and guts, generally at the expense of character and plot. Why people view this as entertainment befuddles me. Crossing Jordan is yet another dark tale and generally as concerned with Jordan's sex life as with crime investigation.<br /><br />By contrast, Quincy is very engaging but also optimistic. Yes, Quincy has his 'relationships' with beautiful young women, but they are portrayed light heartedly, with humour and minimal focus. Jack Klugman is brilliant in the role of the smart & tough, kind hearted & principled, grumpy but charismatic coroner. He is always the underdog's champion, indignant at the crimes & cover ups of the wealthy and influential, and not hesitant to ruffle a few feathers. Quincy is always professional but also personally engaged in the victim's plight. Each episode sees him ferreting out some new case of foul play, aided by his faithful Oriental lab cohort, Sam, engagingly played by Robert Ito. The pair enjoy a touching friendship.<br /><br />The series gave us a glimpse into the forensic techniques and research of that era. (These may have improved during the intervening decades but alas, the TV series portraying them have not.) Also, many issues equally relevant today were explored, including child abuse, fad diets, alcoholism, child pornography, and so forth. Who cares whether aspects of the show are predictable or whether it is particularly realistic? I for one remain a great fan of the series. As I see it, all the forensic dramas of today pale by comparison.
