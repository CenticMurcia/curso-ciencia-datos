I have just returned from watching Aamir and Kajol's latest movie. This movie bored me to death. I had a lot of expectations after Aamir's totally awesome Rang De Basanti and Kunal Kohli's Hum Tum. But this movie was a total waste of time and money. Yashraj films have been cashing in with their standard sugar coated lovely dovey movies for a long time but somehow the formula just didn't work in this one. Fanaa tried to have too many genres in one movie including James Bond, Mission Impossible and some trash Hollywood love story to name a few. The premise, as promoted, of the movie is about a blind girl falling in love with a terrorist which is technically correct. First half is about Aamir and Kajol's never ending sickly sweet love story, at least that's how it felt like. Second half focused on Aamir's terrorist character, and how he re-kindles his love with Kajol ... again a total drag. One thing is for sure that Kajol is so beautiful and Aamir Khan needs to shed some weight. In one of the wet sari songs one could see his tummy through a white t-shirt he was wearing.
