Found this at the grocery store on a 2 movie DVD for a buck! Almost no one in this stinker can act, especially Faith Clift. Noticed there were 3 directors! Explains a lot. This was filmed at the beginning of the 1980's; so, a couple of scenes are filmed in an "evil" disco which seems to be owned by Olivier, a demon/devil/servant of the devil . . . who knows what he is? Never was quite clear about what this film was about. A few good scares and camera shots. Richard Moll appears to have significant greying on his temples in some scenes, and jet black hair in others. Some out-of-date references to energy conservation: so 70's. The whole "God is dead" thing was so 1960's--and, certainly a dead issue by 1980. Series of inexplicable scenes; never explained or tied into anything else. Did I mention Faith Clift couldn't act? The film has something to do with Satan's wish to recruit her character's husband, while a number of people get in the way. Knuckleheads. But, other scenes make it appear that the devil is after Faith herself. What do you expect for 50 cents?
