Stay calm, don't panic, and use your head. I can't think of any other show on TV that stresses this. OK there might be some, but they don't spring to mind. Now thinking about it I still can't. The host Les Stroud is the only guy on the show. He lugs around all of his equipment(video and sound stuff) so there is no mysterious unseen cameraman. He refers to his crew but they just drop him off in the middle of nowhere and stay away only to be seen at the end. He does take in supplies but they are minimal. They consist of basically garbage and whatever is lying around. With this he survives for a week in all sorts of different climates, situations and then hikes out lugging his equipment. All this is done with a minimum of flash. Which is the best part. And as an extra bonus you can watch it with your kids and learn something in the process.
