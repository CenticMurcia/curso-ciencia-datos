What more can one ask for than the greatest rock band in history jamming, feuding, joking, creating and for the finale, performing live on a London rooftop? The reason why this movie is sometimes panned is because of how ragged their (the Beatles) playing was at times. That is the good stuff to me,and for people that love the album. That ragged sound was popular by bands later, but the Beatles had moments of pure brilliance. John and Paul harmonizing at the beginning of "Across the Universe" and the rehearsal of "Two of Us" is what the public never saw before of the Beatles recording process. A must see for any Beatles fan or music fan. This is a classic film that captures an era of the break-up of the Beatles.
