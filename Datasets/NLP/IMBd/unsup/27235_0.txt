Before this movie I didn't know anything about Preston Tucker or his car. Therefor I can judge this movie only by its entertainment value and not by its historical accuracy. <br /><br />Ever since The Godfather and Apocalypse Now I've been a big Coppola fan. I like the fact that - like Martin Scorcese - he keeps looking for visual experiments. Remember the mirror scene in Peggy Sue Got Married? That was never done before. Or the way time was used in Rumble Fish. The staging of One from the heart. Original and daring. <br /><br />In Tucker Coppola goes to visual extremes. The whole movie looks like a big commercial for Tucker himself - and it all works great. The story - an honest underdog must fight against the system - reminds us of the works of Frank Capra. The always brilliant Jeff Bridges is a very (or maybe too) likable hero. In the beginning he's maybe a little bit too unreal until you see how he reacts when he finds real trouble on his way. Then he becomes more human. <br /><br />But the real drama in this movie comes from Martin Landau. His scene in which he confesses that he "caught Tucker's dreams" is a moving one. The way he gets accepted into Tucker's family is so natural. Besides Landau I liked almost all the cast. Frederic Forrest, Mako, Joan Allen, Christian Slater, Lloyd BridgesÂ… their roles aren't earthmoving, but work very well in the whole picture. Tucker's meeting with Howard Hughes (Dean Stockwell) is pure magic.<br /><br />Together with The Godfather part I and II, Rumble Fish and Apocalypse Now I consider Tucker: A man and his dream to be Coppola's best work. Too bad it's not available on DVD anywhere in Europe.<br /><br />9/10
