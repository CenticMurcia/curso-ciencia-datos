This movie is bad. One of the worst romantic comedies i have seen lately. The plot is simple - a guy and a girl fall in love, move in together, start fighting, try to save their relationship. About Last Night doesn't bring anything new to the genre. Same predictable so-called comedy - believe me, there is nothing in this movie that comes even close to the word "funny", same stupid lines, and same bad acting. There are many scenes that just don't seem real. Many moments in which Zwick wants to get somewhere with the plot and just doesn't know how to do that. So come up some really bad scenes, that just don't work at all. And then there's the acting. Rob Lowe is not a great actor at all. His role is simple and still he doesn't seem believeble at all. And Demi Moore... she's alright throughout most of the film. Except when she cries and really tries to express some feelings. In those moments she is really bad.<br /><br />All in all, this movie doesn't bring anything new. It's just a waste of two hours. Vote: 3 out of 10.
