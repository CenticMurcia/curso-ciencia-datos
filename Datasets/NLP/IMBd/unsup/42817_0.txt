This movie proves several things: there is no sure thing in life, many very stupid people work in Hollywood, and plot does matter. "Godzilla" was supposed to be the monster hit of 1998, overwhelming audiences with its hype and special effects. But when word got around, it's no surprise that it was quickly forgotten (or at the very least, people TRIED to forget it). The story is a carbon copy of thousands of past movies, the characters are one dimensional cardboard cut outs, the dialogue is completly ludicrous, and the special effects aren't very special. There are only two, slightly original elements of this story: Godzilla shows up in NYC, and it's pregnant. Neither of these is enough to carrying this overblown movie though, especially the NYC angle, which is spoiled because it appears they shot this movie during the monsoon season. Avoid this one if at all possible and rent the original instead; at least its camp is somewhat entertaining, while the remake just disappoints.
