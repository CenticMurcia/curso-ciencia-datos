I loved this movie. Jessica Lange is very convincing as the controlling , vindictive mother-in law to Gwenyth Paltrow's seemingly unsuspecting Helen. Jonathon Scheatch (what a hunk) is the believable, niave son, does a fantastic job as well. Nina Foch is awesome, where did they get her? Overall, a great suspense-thriller
