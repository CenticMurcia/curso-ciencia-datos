I thought this might be a fairly disposable action movie, but it's not, it's a very dramatic action movie with a wonderfully sharp script done full justice by an excellent cast. It is very stylized in places but with finesse, nothing looks excessive or gratuitous but rather serves the story.<br /><br />John Abraham fits right into the role of the protagonist. He really accentuates the vulnerability of the character which adds a lot to his plight. Priyanka Chopra also does a great job with the character. One of her best performances maybe. Shiny Ahuja also delivers, adding another perspective to the story.<br /><br />The film is perfectly paced, never letting up or getting distracted with side-stories. The songs are well implemented and serve the themes effortlessly. The first song "Tinka Tinka" is wonderfully subdued yet stirring and will stick with the viewer for long after viewing the movie.
