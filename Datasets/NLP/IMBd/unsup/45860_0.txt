Ummmmmmmmmmm, may I ask why this, THIS "movie" got over the 5 rating? This movie is preachy and laughable bunk!<br /><br />I read reviews on it, it either was good or bad.I got confused,so I watched it late at night one day.<br /><br />GOD,DID THAT MOVIE REEK! They have so much stock-footage from war films or from "National Geographic" specials.Yes, I have also seen the Japanese version too.It's not any better,they too sound like they are reading the scripts STILL.<br /><br />I don't think this is a movie at all.This is a big waste of stock-footage.Nothing more.
