Unlike most of the family movies today this one does not find a need for profanity or hidden innuendos to make it work. It is light hearted and easy to follow for most any age yet has enough comic relief for adults to be entertained from the gnomes. Although there is some bare bottom nudity it is easily explained to children without any concerns (if a fairy grows to human size her clothes no longer fit!). The only aspect that I found unnecessary was the interaction with the teacher.<br /><br />There are no Oscar winning performances or brilliant morals to this story of a fairy (Chantelle Stander) that loses her memory and is taken in by a widow (Maxwell Caulfield) and his daughter (Charlotte Savage). The story line works very well for anyone that likes fairies and fairy tales, no matter your age.<br /><br />As family movies go, I would let my grandchildren watch this one.
