This film, in spite of having a very decent cast, goes nowhere in trying to tie in handguns to the intertwined lives of several different people. I found the film weird, but not in an intellectually good way; it's as if the writer/director just wanted to creep us out a little bit, but instead of succeeding at this, just made one boring dud. The script is poor; characters pause too long to deliver lines (probably scripted and not the actor's fault), or say rather pointless, uninteresting things. Nowhere in the movie does it delve into why Americans want handguns. Only a few handguns appear in the movie, and they seem more of a prop in order to give the pointless "climax" more punch, I guess. I thought I was going to watch a film where the power of owning a handgun would transform people's personalities, and have them do crazy things, but the film wasn't that deep. The characters were already rather despicable and unrealistic, so you just don't even care about them. Josh Brolin's character is especially awkward and unrealistic. The only highlight of the movie was Gary Sinise's very strange Bill Gates type geek/mogul character, which was oddly amusing. Handguns were just a prop, and the device of intertwining a bunch of disparate lives together (a la Short Cuts or Crash-much better films) is just annoying here.
