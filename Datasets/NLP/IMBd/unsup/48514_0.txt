As a man who LOVES the inept film Children of the Living Dead, I was stunned by just how horrid this 'film' is. This videotape can only possibly be enjoyed by the cast of retarded amateurs whose names populate the credits. <br /><br />Nothing Troma has done has EVER been this worthless. Never purchase, rent, or even download this videotape.<br /><br />I must fill out a few more lines to submit this, and with the videotape still in mind I now submit these lines: <br /><br />nose breathing is not funny.<br /><br />not editing out the director's voice is not funny.<br /><br />whacky hair is not funny.<br /><br />everything in this videotape that people spent time on is not funny
