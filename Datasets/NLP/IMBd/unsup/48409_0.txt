Yes of all the things to notice about the flick the one that stood out for me is the fact the set had to be really small. When ever the characters went anywhere in the movie it seemed they only had to go a couple of steps to get there. Enough of that though I have a movie to review. This movie is a about two researchers and their attempt to send a prostitute back into one of her former lives. They suceed and she ends up as this gal who is imprisoned in the Tower of Death which strangely enough seems to have only one floor. She is accused of being a witch and must die. She escapes with the help from her future self and this messes everything up so that maybe her future self won't live. It gets even more jumbled by the end with one of the researchers going back to that time to...he really doesn't need to, but I guess he just wanted to check it out. Billy Barty appears in this one as an imp and you will meet the most annoying grave digger ever. Also, watch for the good looking evil witch who can change into muliple things. Not much to recommend here, unless you watch the MST 3000 version of this flick. One thing I did learn is that you can't take your clothes with you to the past, but you can take your watch apparently.
