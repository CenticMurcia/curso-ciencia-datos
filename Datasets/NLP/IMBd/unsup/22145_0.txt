What great family fun, you must have crowded around the fire and watch this movie burn because that is the only thing this movie is good for. This movie was quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen, hands down. They had almost every clich√© in this movie that I have ever heard, the only time I laughed was when my friend told me it was a real movie and not a spoof. They really stole lines and themes from any teen movie over the past ten years worth mentioning. If you want examples I will be happy to give them, but not now because I really don't feel like it, there are too many to mention without being asked for it. But seriously how on Earth can you call this a good movie, and Michael Medved must be out of work by now because there is no way any decent movie reviewer would recommend this movie to anyone. The fact that this movie is even mentioned in the same breath as Hoosiers and Remember the Titans should be considered blasphemy and taken outside and beaten with the "bone" that apparently keeps rolling throughout the 108 minutes of pure hell. These actors and writers are total hacks and suck at life, I hope none of them work again in the movie business another day in their life. Did anyone else notice that they lost by 30 points in the state championship game? That wasn't heartwarming, it was pathetic, they got crushed. If you are still reading this I will be impressed. I can't believe that no one else has ripped into this movie the way it should have been ripped into. I am going to go take a dump and get more entertainment in that ten minutes then I got in 108 minutes from that train wreck of a movie. -Disgruntled Movie Goer<br /><br />P.S. By the way the movie was 3 bucks at coconuts, the movie "Bronx Warriors: 2001" that was made in the 80's with a payroll the price of a bike costs 5 bucks. Think about that, and I hope you all get a bad rash.
