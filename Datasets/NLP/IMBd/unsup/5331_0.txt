Especially, if you like WWII movies, you will enjoy this well done film. I happened to catch it late night tonight on HBO. I first fell in love with Caroline Brouquet in FOR YOUR EYES ONLY, which is my favorite Bond flick, btw. Wow, not only is she a goddess and still looked great 10+ years after FYO, but she is a riveting actress. This is the first movie, I can recall being about the French resistance also. I highly recommend this film.<br /><br />The color and the lighting and the overall cinematography in this movie was especially pleasing, also. Reminicent of the movie, AMEN, another good WWII emotional film. The movie is in subtitles, which is fine by me, since many of my favorite war movies are foreign (i.e. STALINGRAD). Even the supporting cast did an amazing job, acting-wise in the movie!<br /><br />p.s. If you liked the movie, SHINING THROUGH and MAX, you will like this movie, also.
