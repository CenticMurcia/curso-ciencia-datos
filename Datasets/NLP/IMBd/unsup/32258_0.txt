This is the most crappy film I've seen in a long time. The bones of a creature is found in a jungle and they turned in to a creature of malice(I can't remember how, the movies was so bad). The creature starts killing people. The visuals of the monster is a history of it's own. Sometimes it's a man in a costume, sometimes it's animated. The differance is like the one between a wookie and a fish. The special effects are... hard to describe without crying. They are horrible. Some events in the movie are just odd, like when a grenadelauncher, or some sort of big mega gun is thrown in the water and floats ashore.<br /><br />I'd say you should see the movie though, just to get a laughter. We laught/cried in the end, we had rented it for some money, and, well...
