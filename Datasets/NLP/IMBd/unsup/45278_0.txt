This movie has no story, no character development, no reasonable dialogue and no intelligence. The plot is a weak and empty bus that serves no purpose other than to drive the movie from one fight scene to the next. What this movie does have: a blond-haired, blue eyed girl that wears this totally cool motorcycle suit and, like, totally kills 200 people, single-handedly, with one sword, Awesome!!!!! Doesn't take much to impress at the box office anymore.
