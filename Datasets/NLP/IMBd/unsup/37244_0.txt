I am sorry, it may be a 'work of art' as some have suggested here, but Fargo is the most BORING movie I have ever seen. You just can't care about the characters, the plot, anything! The only way my friends and I could continue to watch after the first hour was to MST3K it, shouting comments at our TV screen that at least kept us amused. There was a whole lot of snow..a bunch of really 'meaningful' scenes including snow. Some more snow. Some person who was so pregnant she could hardly walk, but seemed just fine stalking down the rabid killer at the end...oh, and she was in the snow when she did it. Then there was some more snow. I think the snow had a really bad accent, but I cannot be sure, because eventually I couldn't even stand looking at the screen to see who was saying their incredibly banal and annoying lines. Fargo is boring. Fargo is bad. Never watch Fargo, not even to put you to sleep. It just isn't worth it.
