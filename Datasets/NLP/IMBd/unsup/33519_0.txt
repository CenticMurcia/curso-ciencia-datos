This is one of Leslie Nielsen's worst movies ever, even though he's not really the main character. I laughed about 0.4 times during this dragging crapfest that seemed to last forever and made me question why I enjoy movies at all. The studio was wise to make it a straight-to-video release because it would have made about $40 in theaters.
