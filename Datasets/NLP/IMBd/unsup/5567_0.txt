Shows we see on regular TV lack so much compared to their cable counter parts. Finally we have a show that leaves me dying to see the next episode. The entire cast does a phenomenal job. Out of all of them though, Tyler Labine is going to blow up in a big bad way. He amazingly hysterical. With how much he has done before this, it's a shame it didn't happen sooner. Excellent delivery and great acting show this man will be an excellent career to watch.<br /><br />So far this show has had Kevin Smith back a few times to be a consultant which I think is genius. You can definitely feel his presence whenever he gets in there. This (despite the naysayers) adds a lot to the comedy. Hopefully this show receives the treatment it deserves and becomes a cult classic.
