This work of pure art, in its' sounds, visual beauty, global heart, and the recognition of spirit and soul is just so awesome that it just takes your breath away. The music is universal and so in tune with the life's' spirit that you cannot help but to be moved and move to its' message. It is possible that the only thing I could say to the negative is that it could have included many other cultures and been another 2-3 hours longer. Also I want the sound track. But the bottom line and the message that we seem to constantly forget is that; We need to always be aware that we are all from the one family of LIFE and that we are all on the same journey in or on this one minute little speck of terra, atmosphere and water, and that we all share the outcome that is put into action. Very bottom line is that we either ALL stand together or we ALL will fall.
