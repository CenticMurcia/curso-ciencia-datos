This hilariously horrible Italian horror howler slavishly imitates both "Jaws" and "Jaws 2" so blatantly that Universal successfully sued the shameless filmmakers on the grounds of plagiarism and had this perfectly putrid picture yanked out of theaters during its disastrously short-lived American release. James Franciscus sleepwalks through the part of a drippy shark expert with a numbing blankness which suggests that poor Jim was severely doped up on anti-depressant drugs when he acted in this endearingly awful atrocity. Fortunately, we've also got the incomparable Vic Morrow on board hamming it up with his customary deliciously eye-rolling rip-snorting gusto as a crusty, macho, rough'n'tumble Robert Shawesque old sea salt fisherman sporting Vic's trademark furry mustache and a simply sidesplitting "won't fool you for a second" overripe Scottish accent ("I've been killin' sharks for most of my life!"). Enzo G. Castellari's hopelessly ham-fisted direction fails to generate any tension or momentum, with an especially clumsy use of slow motion which sucks all the punch and suspense out of scenes that are meant to be harrowing and frightening. The sequence where the shark attacks a bunch of surfers during a big surfing contest is absolutely gut-busting. Ditto the wonderfully ridiculous, uproarious and utterly preposterous scene where the shark jumps some ten feet up into the air as if was shot out of a cannon and bites a guy hanging out of a helicopter in half. What this beautifully bad baby lacks in credibility and originality (plenty, to be brutally honest) it more than compensates for in sheer riotous absurdity, tasty all-out cheesiness (the shark looks laughably fake throughout), and, since this is an Italian fright feature, the expected in-your-face graphic and unflinching abundance of gory carnage (one poor lass has a leg bitten off by the shark). While it's by no means in any way, shape or form a remotely good movie, this delightfully dopey and unabashedly derivative doozy nonetheless still manages to provide loads of sublimely stinky schlockoid fun just the same.
