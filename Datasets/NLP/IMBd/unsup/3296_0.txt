I saw Cavite recently here in L.A., in the only theater it is being released, the Nuart at West LA. I've been hearing the buzz on this film so it was curiosity that drove me from Long Beach to L.A to watch it. OK, as a prospective filmmaker, I laud and commend the efforts of the filmmaker for just doing the film. With very limited budget, equipment and actors, they were able to pull it through despite the meager means they have. I can understand the sloppy camera work and even the not-so-great acting of the actor/director, but it makes me uncomfortable not to mention that the filmmakers left some important detail in the movie - logic. First, Cavite is, a conservative estimate, 40 miles from Quiapo church in Manila. In the Philippines, were traffic is part of the daily commute, we measure the distance between two locations not by miles but by travel time. And Cavite is more or less a 2 hr drive from Manila. How the hell did Adam get back in forth from Cavite to Quiapo and vice versa in such quick time? And using public transport no less? And how did his cellphone battery last that long? I mean, they should've considered people who are familiar with the location that are going to see this movie. Its like insulting them, I should know, I grew up in Quiapo. Anyways, like I said, I still admire them for their mere guts in doing this film. And please stop using scenes of poverty as a depiction of the Philippines! Scenes like these get manipulated so much in movies like these.
