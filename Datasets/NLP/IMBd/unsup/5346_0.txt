MYESTERIOUS ISLAND, more like JOKE ISLAND there is no excuse for such poor special effects in this day and age it was very poor quality total rubbish, so unbelievable, the animals were a joke, i was expecting it to be quite good with it being a modern film, and a pretty good cast, the scenery is beautiful, but totally spoilt by the poor effects, look out for the cast away guy he has a hair cut and his hair appear blond were,as it was dark brown before, and the crow was pathetic, i have seen better effects in movies from the 70s, over all it was a very disappointing film wish i had not bothered, i can not rate it more than 1 point totally laughable
