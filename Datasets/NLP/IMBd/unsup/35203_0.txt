This, next to Volcano, is the worst Tommy Lee Jones film I've ever seen. The ghost bit didn't come off, the friends of Jones' character added nothing to the story...and the story! Just what was the story? Something about a ghost wanting her jewels back and her hubby running some creepy game on Jones. Stupid tale plus dull, plodding dialogue equals a real loser movie.
