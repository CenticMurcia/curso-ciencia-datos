I have now watched all of Paul McGuigan's films and love every single one of them. he's really gone up in my ratings as one of the best directors around at the moment. other classics he's made are Lucky Number Slevin, Wicker Park and Push. its the style he puts into his films that really win me over. the sets look really rich and marvellous. i hope he keeps up his amazing directing techniques. in this film he centres on the gangster world in the 1960's england, and pulls it off brilliantly. the film is slightly surreal with the odd camera shots and dark atmospheric acting. <br /><br />Paul Bettany gives an exceptional performance as a ruthless psycho of a gangster that will do anything to reign supreme on the gangster family. another cool thing about this film is that you never find out what his characters name is. Malcolm McDowell also gives a magnetic performance as the older version of Paul Bettany's character many years later. David Thewlis and Saffron Burrows give good support in this classic gangster masterpiece. <br /><br />the film is very original for its intense and very violent scenes that will shock any audience that watch it. the tracking shots and music really go well with this film. there really isn't a problem i can say with this, maybe the film should be on for a little longer because of the shortness of it due to so many other gangster classics surpassing the 2 hour mark.<br /><br />all in all this film is brilliant. Paul McGuigan is a hero director that has really won me over. he's a genius. if you love this then check out his other films.......... 10/10.........j.d Seaton
