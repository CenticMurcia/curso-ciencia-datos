One of the things I like about Escape From New York is the fact that the lead character is named Snake. It was a snake who tricked mankind out of paradise and in John Carpenter's world a snake is what saves the free world's leader.<br /><br />Of course the free world ain't all that free any more. In Escape From New York crime has risen to astronomic proportions, so much so that the entire island of Manhattan is now one big prison surrounded by the National Police Force. We now have one of those, I assume this is what the Federal Bureau of Investigation has morphed into. <br /><br />And the USA is at war, with who they don't say. But the enemies of the new American way of life have seized Air Force One and crash it in a suicide move worthy of what we see from the Middle East. But President Donald Pleasance, who looks a whole lot like Peter Sellers's president from Dr. Strangelove. He escapes in a pod that crashes on the prison island of Manhattan.<br /><br />What to do, but rescue Pleasance. And the guy that police chief Lee Van Cleef has in mind is Snake Plissken, former war hero, now career criminal with a Rooster Cogburn patch and played by Kurt Russell. <br /><br />To make sure that Russell doesn't double-cross him, Van Cleef implants a couple of mini bombs in his veins, just enough for him to bleed out when detonated in seconds. And they will detonate 22 hours from the point implantation. <br /><br />The rest of the film is Russell's rescue of President Pleasance who is being held by the head of the criminal society that has grown up in Manhattan headed by Isaac Hayes. Russell gets some help and some betrayal from folks like Adrienne Barbeau, Ernest Borgnine, Harry Dean Stanton and Season Hubley. To see who does what, watch the film.<br /><br />Escape From New York is a fun science fiction film that's attained a cult status of sorts. Certainly the world has not quite developed as John Carpenter envisioned it for 1997.<br /><br />Or has it?
