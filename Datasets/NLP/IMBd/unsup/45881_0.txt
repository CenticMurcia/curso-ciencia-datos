A couple soon going to be married has to complete a Marriage preparation course made compulsory by a Reverend Frank for 100% guaranteed successful marriage & it's not an easy ride. They have to follow wedding vows, attend the classes regularly & get abstain from sex, handle robotic infant twins etc.etc.during the course. Robin Williams is one of prominent comedian of Hollywood but if you don't have humor in script, even God can't save it. In film like situational fix there's lot of room for funny incidents & that's what is missing in the film. Mandy Moore just looks like a girl next door & she is the only one who tried to act here apart of Robin. Film has just a few funny moments to explore. It's not every time that American humor makes Indian laugh & this is good example of it. Below average.<br /><br />Ratings- 4.5/10
