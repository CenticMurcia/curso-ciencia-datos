Okay, this film was alright. I didn't care for the negative Asian stereotype throughout the film, but the adventure had me interested. I gave this movie a poor rating because of the stereotypes, and the ending is Hollywood's "everything will be alright" cliche that makes you mad for watching the whole thing. Performance by Dietrich is the best I've seen it and Anna May Wong is simply gorgeous. I would recommend skipping this movie unless you are a fan of Wong or Dietrich.
