On the list of werewolf movies, "Big Bad Wolf" ranks pretty low but still manages to stay above "Arizona Werewolf." I encourage you to get to a Redbox and rent this movie but don't blow $3.50 at Hastings for it.<br /><br />Richard Tyson brings a great presence to the film but overshadows the two leads (Trevor Duke & Kimberly Brown). Duke obviously couldn't hang with Tyson in their scenes together and looked genuinely intimidated but not in a good way. One wonders if Tyson didn't push him around off camera as well. Brown's character was just wrong, wrong and pointless and she and Duke didn't have anything between them chemistry wise. After the initial encounter with the beast I was in denial that Duke was the hero of the movie.<br /><br />At any rate, the movie was entertaining and you gotta love the idea of a werewolf that rips your lungs out through your mouth and talks trash while he does it. The extras all made for great werewolf chow but I wish the finale had let us see a bit more kills. They loaded up the scenes with wolf fodder and we only got to see two gory deaths while the rest were implied. That's okay though, I laughed, I said "Ewwww" out loud and at the end of the film I didn't feel ripped off.<br /><br />P.S. Kudos to the producers for the extras on the DVD. Films like this don't usually get that kind of treatment.
