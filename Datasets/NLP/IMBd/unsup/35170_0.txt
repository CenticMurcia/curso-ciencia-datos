What do you get when you cross a low-budget zombie movie with a story about a team of masked wrestlers? The answer is apparently something called "Enter... Zombie King." <br /><br />Actually, "low-budget" is an inappropriate description, since that might imply there WAS a budget for this crap. I think instead what happened is the would-be director found some change when he was vacuuming under his couch cushions and thought, "What the hell, I'm calling my pals and we're gonna make a movie." <br /><br />Then, after getting together and drinking six cases of beer, they came up with the idea to combine zombies with wrestlers. The result: A bunch of Canadians pretending to be Mexican wrestlers from the United States (I didn't get it either) must fight a former wrestler who's become the Zombie King and is trying to take over the world with an army of the living dead. Or something.<br /><br />Yeah, it's dumb.
