I saw this movie title on SyFy just now. Thought to myself wow this can't be bad. Boy was I wowingly wrong (Couldn't be a word, yet but I think it will be) Story was good, effects and the writing of this were stupid.. I don't wanna say I hate the cast cause they were good. Its the writer/s and maybe Director... Alligator if it only looked like one. Or "Mutant Alligator". Now they say it's a pre-historic Alligator. Explain how old would it make this.. Alligator.. Explain how a FUEL INJECTED JEEP, made for outdoors playing dies just like that... When they have already a killed a girl in a bikini who was doing the right thing now moving and staying 'out of sight'. Her and Fatty still get found and ate. When they just saw Mr. big gator but yet how would they not hear him circle where they were..? It doesn't make sense.. Now the, blonde Dr. Lady has been demolished? Who wrote this garbage.. When you got a dumb hunter with a 'LITTLE' @$$ gun..... When he's seen this thing and knows how big and should know how strong it is.... BEING PRE-HISTORIC... BURT GOMER aka Michael Gross (Tremors I-IV)would have ROFLMAO... Well, there's your movie... You want me to write it fine. Contact me. But he's my star with some others 1 other star and couple other co stars. This movie could have been better just with a little more thought and talent.. Poor Graphics on this Gator... Anaconda is how old and its got better looking graphics for its snake... And this movie just keeps getting worse...
