I was in my twenties when this show was on and I loved it, too. It was quirky and different and I just wish it had been given time to grab an audience. Unfortunately, it came out before the viewing public started wanting something different from the usual detective TV show fare...that was so dull and predictable that you not only recognized the plot but could usually anticipate the dialogue. I always liked different though and remember how refreshing I found this show and its stars. It was delightful and introduced me to it's two stars Ben Vereen and Jeff Goldblum. It's sense of humor, for those that never had the opportunity to see it, reminded me of a show that came out several years later and was quite successful, Moonlighting. It was fresh and totally different and perhaps, in retrospect, that uniqueness is exactly what sent this wonderful show to an early grave. I hope that eventually some kind (and highly intelligent) soul does see the need to release it on DVD; I will certainly buy it. And I'd love to see it show up as a rerun...if some bright exec from TVland or Sleuth channels happens to be reading this. I think this show would weather the years well and that audiences today would love it. Sadly, it was just a show that debuted before its time.
