This review applies to big brother in general as well. For the 9th season, the tasks for the shopping budget have improved and seem less shoddy the in previous series. The cast was predictable, with the notable recurring characters including the camp homosexual, the token minority, middle-aged woman acting like a 3 year old, prick teaser, arrogant pretty boy, insecure pretty boy, the mother/cleaner, etc. This year the dull, boring and fake person who played dumb won the show for at a least a third consecutive time. I don't need to watch it next year because I know who's going to win. 95% contestants are acting up to the cameras making the show entirely superficial whether it be to win or to be noticed. Another thing is that the type off people who end up on big brother are shallow or lack character depth. The show uses political correctness to it's advantages jumping on any opportunity out of anything that displeases the average left wing extremist to make headlines and increase ratings. That alone defeats the purpose of the experiment due to too much influence from the outside world. I rate this season 3 out of 10, this program is ready for the scrap heap.
