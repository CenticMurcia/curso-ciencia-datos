You would think, with the voice talent in this movie, that it would be at least a little funny. 90% of this cast has made me laugh out loud at least once. Maybe, MAYBE it's funnier if you're gay but I like to think that gay people have better sense of humor than this. It's full of silly puns, old messages and tired stereotype jokes. South Park has done more credit to people who are homosexual.<br /><br />I have considered that if someone has a different sexual orientation, maybe they also have a different comic orientation but I don't think this is a case of humor being different, as if written in a language other than my "straight" tongue. I get the jokes, Michael Jackson looks like an old woman, Judy Garland is Queen of the Gays and Cher is just an endless source of fabulous humor. How many Evil Christian Preacher characters have we seen before? I've just heard it all before and it was funnier and better said the first time. I mean, look at the movie "But I'm a Cheerleader" about a girl who goes off to a straight reprogramming camp. Same theme but funny!
