I just downloaded the Aquaman pilot from iTunes and I cannot believe that it never got picked up for the CW fall schedule. This show easily beats One Tree Hill, Supernatural, and 7th Heaven. The acting was superb, the plot was amazing, and it got me hooked. By the end I was furious that there were no more episodes to watch, because it is just that compelling. There's so much that could be explored in later episodes... the actual extent of his powers, if he is able to find his mom, is Lt. Torres from Atlantis, and how A.C. is able to save both the world and the sea. I hope that Miles Millar and Al Gough keep pushing for this show to air. Maybe the CW will pick it up next season, or mid season next year if enough of a following develops. I've read nothing but good things about this show; everyone that's seen it seems to love it and I think that should send a message to the network to pick it up.
