The only thing the movie had in common with the book was the title, and a few of the characters. They were walking around in sand and dirt and their clothes were always cleaned and pressed. One scene the girl was attacked by a large bird and had what looked like a large cut on one shoulder. She also had blood on her blouse. The next scene all the blood was gone and the cut was completely healed. They had Captain Nemo living in a large house on the Island with a servant. I Don't remember any servant or large house in the book. The also had pirates going after a treasure chest I don't remember any treasure chest in the book. They had Captain Nemo making firearms I always thought Nemo was against war. The bomb he was making looked like it was made of machine made parts.
