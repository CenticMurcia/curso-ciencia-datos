Some of these reviews must have been from a friend of someone connected to the movie.<br /><br />The box cover is the most professional part of the movie. The writing is unoriginal and the acting is just bad. It starts off in a slow time warp and then the cement starts to set.<br /><br />I spent most of the movie wondering how much time was left. I kept waiting for it to get better and live up to the box cover. Half way through felt like too long for a feature film. Most of the time I just felt bad for the actors having to recite the horrible dialog and the rest of the time feeling mad at those who decided to release it.<br /><br />Do not watch this movie if you value your time! The most frightening part will be that you didn't have anything better to watch.
