I just loved Spike Lee's 25th Hour with Edward Norton so I thought why not watch some more movies by Lee. However, I must admit that She Hate Me was a disappointment - yeah, the topics are very hot and relevant, the execution is beautiful, but the film somehow lacks a coherent overall line, perhaps its due to the fact that the film tries to connect and mix too many things (whistleblowers, lesbians, love, African Americans), the bottom line is just not clear and none of the topics are dealt with in detail in this film.<br /><br />Moreover, some actions by the actors don't make sense at all (to me - a major flaw), some actors were totally unnecessary (ex. Monica Belucci didn't add anything other than to extend the length of this already lengthy movie). The drama looks fake to me, but I liked the ending, though. Thus the 4/10.
