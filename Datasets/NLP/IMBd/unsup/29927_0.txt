I read somewhere that Marina Golbahari used the money she made from this film to buy her parents a house in a poor part of Afghanistan. For me this seemed to fit in with the inequality of life that was depicted in this movie. I couldn't help but think that the star of one of the best movies I have seen in years could only manage a cheap house with her earnings while lesser actors in much lesser films earn millions. This movie for me was a real eye opener, not only in regards to the treatment of people under the rule of a military regime, but life in general in Afghanistan. The main point that I got from this movie is that not everyone who lives under a particular government supports or agrees with what they are told to do or with what is happening in their country. Most people just want to raise their children, have food to eat, and to get on with their lives.
