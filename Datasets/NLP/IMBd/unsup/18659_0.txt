Stage Beauty is a truly beautifully- crafted movie which recreates the spirit of Restoration England wonderfully. From the characters who inhabit the theatre world of the day to the laissez faire attitude of the court of Charles II, we gain a privileged view into an age of bawdy good humour.<br /><br />The lead parts are played in great style by the enormously accomplished Billy Crudup and Claire Danes who create a sense of true chemistry between them. Crudup's acting is deserving of an Oscar, although sadly it seems unlikely that the Academy will take too much notice of a relatively small budget film and will, as usual, hand out awards for Hollywood blockbusters. The supporting cast are also excellent with Rupert Everett being born to play the tolerant, witty and womanising King.<br /><br />The tight direction of the film is a credit to Richard Eyres and the pace never flags for a moment. There has obviously been much historical research gone into the background of the story which has paid off handsomely. The score keeps pace with the action and the story gallops along to its breathtaking conclusion.<br /><br />We should urge everyone we know to go to see Stage Beauty at least twice and to harangue the Academy into awarding this gem of a movie a clutch of Oscars!
