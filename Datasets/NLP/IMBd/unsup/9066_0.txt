Andy Garcia is always good as an personal character. Which he proves in this movie. It's a shame that the story is being clumbsy told, the movie has a bad flow, well not that bad but still enough to notice. It's good that mr. Garcia is such a good actor so he can lift this movie.<br /><br />Everyone else in the movie play their part very well, but the main character "Tommy" is a little to "green" on the big screen, it shows, but alltogheter he does a good job.<br /><br />The "plot" and the final ending or whatever you want to call it is bad according to me, but others disagree, I guess I have a strange taste in endings.. hehe.<br /><br />But the movie is still very see worthy, and I recommend this movie, it's not a oscar winning movie, but still.
