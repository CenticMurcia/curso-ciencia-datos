The criticisms of this movie may be a bit harsh. The plot is a little thin but it meanders along well enough for a "B" movie, which is exactly what this is, a "B" horror flick. Nothing fantastic happens here nothing horrible happens either. There are some good special effects, not great but fun anyway. I enjoyed the diving scenes and the underwater cinematography, which I'm sure was CGI, was kind of cool. The villain was pretty creepy, the Alistair Crowley connection was kind of fun. Here again nothing fantastic but kind of fun. Not for kids by the way. The movie displays the usual naked debauchery of your normal portal of hell stories. In other words plenty of bare breasts, I really found the gal smashing her breasts into the cake funny. You know your town is under the influence of satanic forces when that happens! I'm not exactly ready to recommend this movie but I have seen much worse.
