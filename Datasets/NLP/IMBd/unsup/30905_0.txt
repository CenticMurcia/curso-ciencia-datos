This movie, in my opinion, is one of the better Haunted House/Ghost movies I have seen. The acting was alright, and I did enjoy the story, sure there were a couple predictable moments but there was also a few surprises thrown in with a bunch of very creepy/eerie moments, which include a freaky looking Clown doll. This movie did manage to create an eerie atmosphere which also helped it out. I gave this movie an 8 out of 10. If you are considering renting this movie definnately rent it, you will not be dissapointed.<br /><br />********
