WOW! I have never ever seen such spoilt brats like these girls. Don't their parents do anything about it? And they are only child's so they don't know what it is like to have the attention on other people i think. This show totally disappointed me. That is what is wrong with the world, people like those girl think they are large and in charge because their parents are super-rich and own a couple cars and a pool. They think that the world revolves around them (as a matter of fact it revolves around the sun!) and it is just annoying. Why do they have to act so B*t*y? Those girls AND their parents deserve a big a** kicking!! From everyone on the earth!! This show just shows how awful people can get. I am glad that there ARE some people in the world who are not self centred and so selfish. People like the people i know, not the people i see on My Super Sweet 16. It is quite weird how everything just gets better by the end of the party! This show just annoys me so much! Cant they have just a little small party or go to a restaurant? NO they have to make a name of themselves. I hope they will get taught a life lesson!!
