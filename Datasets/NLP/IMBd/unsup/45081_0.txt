There is absolutely nothing special about Pluto Nash. I was wondering for a time if I was going to run into the Mario Brothers as the set looked awfully familiar. The plot was poor, or maybe just nothing special. The sex jokes old, he saw her with big breasts and buttocks, why not give him something big? The only surprise in the whole thing was when Pluto Nash found out who he was up against. The movie was just Eddie Murphy doing the same old thing again. He could have just as well done it on earth in the 21th Century. At least he would have saved us a trip to the moon.
