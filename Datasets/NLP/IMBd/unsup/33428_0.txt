A handful of years before "Halloween", "Friday the 13th" and other movies that claim to have started the slasher-genre, there was "Sister of Death" More than a decade before sorority-themed slashers like "House on Sorority Row" etc, there was "Sisters of Death"! This movie was even shot (not released, though) before "Black Christmas", and that classic horror film is more or less regarded to as the granddaddy of ALL crazy murderers on the loose flicks! Then why doesn't this movie enjoy the status of a genre milestone? Well, quite simply because it's crappy! Immensely entertainingbut nevertheless crappy! Seven years after that dreadful, life-ruining evening where a group of sorority babes accidentally killed their newest member (guns aren't toys, ladies!), the five remaining members all receive invitations to a reunion. They all go, even though it's unclear who invited them, and end up in an isolated mansion in the middle of nowhere. It doesn't take long before they meet their killer, who turns out to be the revengeful father of the murdered girl. Simple, straightforward plot and five incredibly sexy female leads! How on earth could this go wrong? Well, due to some really poor plotting, a total lack of continuity and weak directing, Joseph Mazzuca still somehow managed to mess it all up! This is the type of movie in which dumb characters do incredibly stupid things for absolutely no reason, so they pretty much all deserve to die. There are occasional flashes of sheer tension, but even more imbecility and lameness. And, like another reviewer already pointed out, there's should at least have been some nudity. What's the point of casting nothing but gorgeous sorority coeds if they're not taking their tops off? Stay clear, unless you're a fan of low-budget and forgotten 70's trash.
