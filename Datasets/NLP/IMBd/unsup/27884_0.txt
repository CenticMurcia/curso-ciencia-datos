Will the wonders never cease? First Denmark introduces a long line of Dogme films, many of them better than anything out of Hollywood, and now they have developed a talent for romantic comedies as well? If someone had told me 10 years ago that this would happen, I wouldn't have believed them.<br /><br />This is a wonderfully warm and funny movie. It's great to see Niels Olsen in this type of role, not playing his usual wacky roles but instead a romantic lead - yet another surprise. And what can I say about Paprika Steen - she's fast becoming one of my favourite actresses, Danish or otherwise. What a comedic talent!<br /><br />I recommend this movie to anyone who doesn't mind subtitles - comedy is a language in itself.
