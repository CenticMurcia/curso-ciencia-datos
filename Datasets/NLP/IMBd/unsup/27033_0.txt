This is one action movie I like very fair. "A Better Way To Die" is something that's anything but ordinary. You got a good cast like Lou Diamond Phillips, Natasha Henstridge, Andre Braugher, and Joe Pantoliano. It's a movie that is worth the watch while. Here you got a cop from the "Windy City"(Chicago) who happens to run afoul from the mafia. And it's up to him to stop them. The Feds want him as well to help out. However, there are some of them who are nothing but killers in disguise. Not quite infiltrators, but one crooked Fed(Phillips). Then in one scene the ex-cop and a mob leader put aside their differences and help out each other. The cop's fianc√© was killed by one of the killers, and the ex-cop killed the mobster's cousin. When all the teamwork came into play everyone got their satisfaction, guaranteed. It's understandable to be fair game, but when you team with a killer who is also the target, you have no choice but to work together. A very good movie, rather mild than over-hyped. 2.5 out of 5 stars!
