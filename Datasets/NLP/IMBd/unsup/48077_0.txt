I found a DVD of this movie on the shelf at the library. I should have left it there. About fifteen minutes into the film I was somewhat intrigued. By the time I'd reached thirty minutes, I was gasping for air, but had to watch the rest to see if it would ever recover. It didn't. I still have a problem deciding if it was meant to be a black comedy or not. Surely, this story of quirky characters and the situation in which they find themselves was not meant to be taken seriously. I love animals as much as the next guy, but to see people who take their love of animals to such extremes just made for a bad movie. The best actor was Pencil the dog, who had the good sense to die early on.
