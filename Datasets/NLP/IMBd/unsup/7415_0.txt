Well, Its not Funny, if you are that "Stupid Comedy" Kind of person like me, you could make fun of it or laugh at it for how "Stupid" it is. Behind all that, Its actually a pretty good film, i am disappointed on the way the rest of the public took it. It has pretty good performances by Lloyd, Hogan, and others. I am a Big Wrestling Fan but i enjoyed this movie even before i was. Its a "typical" 80's film in the 90's. It is Funny for some people that are just looking for clean jokes. The Best Hulk Hogan Movie though, since he didn't give many good ones. I will give it a 6 out of 10 stars, but its still very good, so don't take the low ratings and don't rent it, its worth it. Its worth the few dollars. And its very funny at times, Any Star Wars fans would like it, it spoofs and connects with the movies in ways that are very funny. RENT IT! ITS WORTH IT!<br /><br />
