Friends warned me that this one wasn't worth seeing. But I thought I'd show 'em. Especially after watching the first 20 minutes or so, I was preparing my "you don't know what you're talking about" speech. I so much wanted to find the value in this film that was right there below the surface, where only the smart people care to look. But there just isn't anything there.<br /><br />This film tries to be thought-provoking and enlightening, but in my final analysis it is just as bad as any brain-dead teenage moron-o-fest. Retarded people are people just like you and me? Yeah, yeah, yeah ... I know that and I don't need a ridiculously earnest film to tell me so. And if you're going to make a ridiculously earnest film about the "Noble" Retarded Man (who I am sure is JUST as noble as the Noble American Indian and the Noble Black Guy) then at least hire real handicapped people to show up on screen. All I saw were a bunch of actors trying lamely to walk and move about like they imagined retarded people should be. That alone is offensive enough.<br /><br />My final thought: I just watched "Death To Smoochy" and "Pumpkin" back-to-back and after doing so I can't decide which was the bigger waste of time. Does that tell you how bad of a movie this was?<br /><br />I'm not your friend, but I'm warning you: "This one isn't worth seeing."
