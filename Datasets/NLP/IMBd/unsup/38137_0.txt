I believe the film makers could have done so much more with this film, than what they did. I love the first Children of the Corn movie. When I found out there was a sequel, of course I rented it; what a disappointment. I can't believe it took them nine years to make a sequel and with none of the original cast or characters. (They mention Isaac's name a few times and that's about it). Micah was probably my favorite character because he was the bad guy and you finally want him to win because you get so sick of the "protagonists". They had really annoying/corny love scenes too. I never thought I would say this about a COTC movie, but I seriously thought it would be better. This movie would probably be good if it wasn't supposed to be a sequel to something made a lot of years ago. Hey, I give the makers of this movie credit for at least keeping the "original town" of Gatlin and Hemmingford and mentioning Isaac. There's also another thing I do not get about this film, a lot of those teens in this movie would have been like 7 or 8 in the first movie, so how do they remember all of this? And, how does Micah remember his father if he's only a teen and the original Gatlin slaughtering was like 12 years before this movie even happened? If somebody could please explain that to me. Anyway, I guess if you like a little more "frights" you should see this, if not then I highly do not recommend this to you.
