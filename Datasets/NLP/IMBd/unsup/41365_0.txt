this movie is the worst thing ever made. even worse than Jaws the Revenge. My little cousin (girl) likes Bratz (the dolls)and had thoughts about seeing the movie. well i'm glad she didn't see it! this movie and the dolls teach little girls how to be sluts. that girl meredith was the most annoying little bitch i've ever seen on a movie screen, the four lead actresses are just your typical 20 something year old whores who can't act trying to make it big, and not even John Voight (that's right, JOHN VOIGHT) could save this film. I'm very close to my little cousin, and she looks up to me. i personally told her not to see the film because it would make her feel unpretty and stupid. i'm very glad she followed my advice. if you're a shallow low-life crackhead who thinks fashion and acting like a bitchy slut is what life is all about, then this movie is for you. i'm serious this movie is so bad, bad acting, stupid plot, and EXTREMELY ANNOYING CHARACTERS. 1/10
