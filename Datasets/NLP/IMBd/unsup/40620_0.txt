I like watching Law and Order with my parents. We like Special Victims Unit and the original Law and Order. But we just can't watch this one. 1 reason; Vincent D'Onofrio. He is just bad. Not just him, but his character too. He is a cocky little crap and is a stink bag police officer.<br /><br />The acting is another thing. Whenever Mr. D'Onofrio is working on a case, he sucks at acting. He always says his lines really boringly and acts awful. Me, my dad, my mom, my sister, my brother, my aunt all hate him. Whenever, we see him, my mom says, "Aww, I hate that guy!" <br /><br />Could be a better show if Vince wasn't on it. 4.4/10
