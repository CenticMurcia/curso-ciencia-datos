This is a decent romantic comedy that touches on several differences between American (lack of) culture and Indian culture (the correct term is actually offshored- outsourcing was historically an American stealing your job by undercutting the fee) a newly offshored manager flies to India to train his replacements and discovers Indian culture and living conditions, their insight on marriage and family and of course some blunders with customary practices in India. This stars one of the most sexy actresses around and that makes this very easy to watch even if our central character is bit light in the loafers to make convincing chemistry with such an Asian fox.<br /><br />What is unfortunate about this movie is that it is, in the end, irresponsible propaganda to make light of the most disastrous thing happening to Americans today- they are losing their jobs because politicians have been bribed to look the other way or worse create new legislation that makes it easier for scumbag corporations to live in America, manufacture outside of it, and still charge similar prices as if it was produced by American labor, and they destroy local economies in the process by removing all wealth from the community via offshoring their jobs to India or china. I think after watching this movie it is required viewing to go watch "Walmart- the high cost of low prices" and the documentary "Corporation" to help balance the viewpoints. Offshoring is no laughing matter and it's looking like only bloody revolution is going to stop it. Remember- Americans have a constitutional right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Corporations intentionally removing their jobs to create a higher profit margins for themselves(robber barons) and reap the benefits of American citizenship need to be stamped out- they are a direct threat to the guarantees of the constitution and a disgrace to their fellow Americans.
