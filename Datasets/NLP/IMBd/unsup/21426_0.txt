Ringu 2 (1999) picks up right where Ringu (1998) left off. Reiko and Yoichi have vanished and Mai is snooping around trying to solve the mystery of Sadako, will anyone believe what she has uncovered? The cast from the first film is back along with the original director. This one has more horrific overtones than the first one. Whilst part one was more of a mystery/suspense film part two is more of a straight forward horror story. I found Ringu 2 to be more enjoyable. Ironically Ringu 2 was incorporated more in the U.S. remake than part one (that's why they're not going to make the remake sequel based upon this film). Watch Ringu 1 and 2 then watch The Ring, you'll understand why some of the set pieces in the remake are so out of place. Silly director tried to cram two movies into one. Let's hope they give Ringu 2 a proper release in the future. <br /><br />Highly recommended.
