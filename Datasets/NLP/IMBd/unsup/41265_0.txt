I just finished watching this on late night television and I am in awe. I mean, I have seen a few TV movies in my day, but this one almost comes across like a bad satire of TV movies. It is bad in just about every way imaginable.<br /><br />The music is pretentious, the editing bears the mark of a first year film student, and the acting is horrifyingly bad. At some points this movie heads off following Andrew Cunanan in aimless directionless scenes. It has the characters fighting in swearing fits that come off like children learning the "f-word" for the first time. And every scene, particularly those with the actor playing Andrew Cunanan are stretched out with the most appalling acting I have ever seen. I mean it. Every single line of dialogue is delivered almost painfully. The most excruciating example is the scene at the very end when the two FBI agents have this really presumptuous and pretentious theory session on murder and consumerism. It was truly "crap-tacular".<br /><br />This movie is a complete waste of time, and unintentionally turns a horrifying true-life story into a sloppy farce. Worse still, I got this impression the film makers were vastly overestimating the importance of this movie in their own minds. This comes off with endless scenes with the various characters where they spout speeches thinly veiled single entendres about their motivations and society. I get the impression the film makers even wanted to make a connection between the glitz and glamour of the fashion world and how it drove Cunanan to kill - except that no viewer is going to buy that the way it is presented here.<br /><br />If I were Donatelli Versace, I would sue on principle alone just to end TV movies of mediocre quality.
