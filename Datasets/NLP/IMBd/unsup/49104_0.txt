This film is the worst film of the year so far.<br /><br />The whole film seems rather disjointed and is unbelievably dull.<br /><br />It consists of bad written script and broken storyline, poor soundtrack, too many bad quality special effects, humble acting.<br /><br />I have read the book after watching a movie and got some clues about the original plot. Book is excellent, but it does not make a film better. I guess film only was based on the book, and truly fails to deliver any storyline. <br /><br />I would say most of you could skip "Nochnoj dozor" and save your time and money. <br /><br />So Bad It Hurts!
