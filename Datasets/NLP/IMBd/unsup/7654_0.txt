Likeable film from science fiction turned action director Margheriti. Cannibal Apocalypse features a lot of gore and violence in the fashion of Margheriti's older horror films FLESH FOR FRANKENSTEIN and BLOOD FOR DRACULA. One of the only cannibal flicks to come out of Italy in the late 70's, early 80's which was not set in the jungle, but instead in some American city! Good camerawork at times, decent music by Alexander Blonksteiner, and a reasonably cool cast all give this its share of entertainment value. Good for gore in the last 20 minutes or so, while most of the action is confined to the short intro sequence in Viet Nam (which was decently well done). Passable, satisfying cannibal film, still does not hold a candle to Cannibal Holocaust.
