What a very disappointing sequel! The first movie, "White Fang," was an outstanding adventure story. It is one of the best Disney movies made during their "slump" period of the '80s to the early '90s. This movie is one of the worst movies they ever made. It abandoned all the good ingredients the first film had just to get in its politically-correct nonsense. Yes, this is the beginnings of the PC period which is going full force now.<br /><br />White Fang had an adult appeal to it; it was not a movie just for kids. With that in mind, they can zap 'em with their anti-Christian bias by showing a minister in an evil light for 99 percent of the film. In the end, the guy is shown to be someone in disguise; not really a minister....but Disney's mission is accomplished. Under that ploy - and don't be naive not to think this was the idea - kids got a bad view of a minister for almost the entire time. At the same time, they get told and shown how valid all the Native American superstitions are! This, too, is an old Disney ploy, but rarely exhibited as blatantly as in this film. Add to that simply a dumb story and you have a real poor sequel, a real loser of a film.
