I just saw a screening of this movie and I thought it was really good. The story is of a struggling film producer and his writer/director wife. It is a well written story, and having met the director/writer, is semi-autobiographical, which I found amazing. I went into seeing this movie without any real idea of what to expect and was pleasantly surprised. It had the right amount of humor and reality without getting to cheesy. And Morgan Freeman really does make an appearance in this film! The film contains a lot of close up shots on the characters, but it works; it's a different style than I was used to. Although slow in some parts, overall the characters they meet and the plot really kept me interested in the film. It made me want to go out an rent the first movie, All About You.
