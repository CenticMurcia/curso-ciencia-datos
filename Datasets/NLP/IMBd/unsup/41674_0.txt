Well seems again those no good kids are about to learn a valuable life lesson through the art of dancing. Whenever you see a group of real gangster kids you know there is a well dressed hard-ass ready to teach the kids how to be successful and have rhythm. The idea has been done before, there is no originality whatsoever in any of the scenes made.<br /><br />If I can give it one complement it would be the dance scenes, they were well choreographed and took some skill to it for that I applaud. Otherwise, yawn, has nothing to it. Story focuses on a man (Banderas) who one afternoon teaches a few bad apples how to salsa and change their ways. <br /><br />"Take the Lead" has a less the choreographed plot to it other than a few cool moves on the dance floor. I don't no why Antonio Banderas keeps doing these bad movies "Spy Kids" and "Take the Lead", what happened to "Desperado", nowhere in sight. Sadly his career has fell flat on its face.---4/10
