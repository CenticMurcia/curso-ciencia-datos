Mario Landi's PATRICK STILL LIVES is a weird little film that is weak on pretty much every level - but still manages to be entertaining and pretty fun to watch...<br /><br />Patrick is the victim of an unfortunate (and kinda hilarious...)accident: while standing by the side of the road, he's randomly hit in the face with a bottle that a passing motorist chucks out of his window, leaving poor Patrick in a coma, but with telekinetic powers (!!??!!) Patrick's scientist father owns a villa with a lab in the basement where he conducts experiments to strengthen Patrick's mind powers so that he can one day seek revenge for his condition. Dad lures several people to his villa with the intention of letting vegetable-boy wreak some havoc. This eventually does happen and the results are pretty rewarding...<br /><br />PATRICK STILL LIVES is a pretty good example of classic 70's/80's exploitation sleaze. Plenty of tits and ass (including a pretty hot masturbation scene from a sexy - if a little too "bushy" for my taste - blonde), and some decent gore, including: a man hung by his throat from a hook, a woman eaten by dogs, another woman decapitated but a car window, and the "famous" graphic vaginal-impalement-via-fire-poker. This one in particular is a keeper, as I was surprised that they showed this scene as "up-close and personal" as they did. PATRICK has some of the most ridiculous dialog ("It's obvious that Mr. Cough's cause of death was from a fatality..." (?????)), a retarded and threadbare plot, pretty stupid FX (the "floating-hypnotic-eyeballs" come to mind...), and atrocious acting. Regardless, or possibly because of these things, I still got a kick out of this one. I have a soft spot for these types of 70's/80's shock/schlock films - and this one is another perfect example. If you're looking for high-art, you can leave this one on the shelf. If you like tit's, ass, furry bush, and gore - I'd recommend this one pretty highly. 8/10
