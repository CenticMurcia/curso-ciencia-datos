This horrible attempt of a "movie" was the worst piece of crap I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot of horrible B-movies). I am ashamed that I wasted any time on this at all. The worst thing about it was the acting--NOT ONE person cast in this movie has the right to call themselves an actor. It seemed as though they were reading from cue cards the entire time. You can tell they must have went up to people on the streets and said "Hey, want to be in a movie?"! From the laughable performance by the child playing Jack Jr. to the ridiculous writing, directing, plot, ridiculous attempt at special effects, etc..etc..etc.. The list goes on and on.<br /><br />
