this is your typical teen movie...<br /><br />there's just nothing great about this.<br /><br />it's not scary either. the hanging body in the beginning didn't scare me at all. it seemed rather pretentious... and very predictable.<br /><br />then nothing happens in a long time. the movie just lags..<br /><br />the nerdy girl isn't particularly interesting.<br /><br />tomie is kinda hot, but she doesn't show her tits in this flick... =D=D=D <br /><br />i guess i've seen worse, but i would skip this one... don't rent it.<br /><br />...
