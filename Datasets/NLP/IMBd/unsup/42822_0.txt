Yet more proof that Harold Lloyd was a much better silent comedian than a sound one.<br /><br />In "Movie Crazy," Lloyd plays Harold, a star-struck country boy who, due to a case of (sort of) mistaken identity, lands a screen test in Hollywood. He falls for both a starlet (an engaging Constance Cummings) and a sexy Spanish actress, not realizing that the Spanish actress is really Cummings herself playing a character in a movie. The film could have been a major entry in the "movies about making movies" genre, but it instead opts for blandness and convention. It's not very funny; Lloyd and his collaborators seemed to think that there was no place in a sound film for Lloyd's remarkable acrobatics and physical comedy antics, the things that made his silent films so much fun, but they don't replace them with anything but scene after scene of sluggishly paced, wooden dialogue.<br /><br />Grade: C-
