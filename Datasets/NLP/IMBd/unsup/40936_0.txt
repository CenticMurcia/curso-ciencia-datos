This Movie, is in the worst "B"-Grade Horror Movie Catagorie. The plot is based off of an Old 1950's show created by Rod Serling "The Twilight Zone" (IMO)-- Ventriloquist dummy is alive -- this does have a little more ridiculous, stupid, and down right very quickly forgotten atrocities. --Some one taking on police force.<br /><br />An abductee, running through the woods trying to escape a crazy shot-gun toting, crazed maniac, then all of a sudden wow -- there's a saloon -- what luck!!!!!!<br /><br />Give me chuckie any day -- and I didn't like that movie either -- But it was hands down a 10 over this one.<br /><br />Waste of time -- I gave it a 2!!!
