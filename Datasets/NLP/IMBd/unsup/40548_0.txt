The main virtue of this movie is the cinematography and the languorous mood it creates. The plot on the other hand was nonsensical and boring. The Joey character was good for a young man experiencing his first love, but I found the Sissel character convoluted and hard to follow. There were a lot of parts where Sissel's character was overacted and boring at the same time, and this especially made me not like the movie. I don't recommend this movie.
