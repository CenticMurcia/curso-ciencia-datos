The 13th Floor is more of a thriller than a horror as it contains virtually no horror elements at all. So all horror fans should avoid it unless you can tolerate a simple thriller.<br /><br />The plot is very simple indeed, and takes a bit too long to reach the conclusion. I actually quite enjoyed the basic storyline, and thought that the cheesy romance between the rebel girl and the boring older guy was sweet. I even felt a twinge if sadness when he got murdered. When it boils down to it though, The 13th Floor is just far too boring. It had potential but unfortunately played down the supernatural elements that could have made it interesting. <br /><br />Don't bother seeking this out, but if you find an old VHS really cheap, it will look good in your collection because the artwork on the Medusa label is quite cool.
