If you are not from the Midwest (let alone Chicago), or didn't attend Northern Illinois University, or you are not enrolled in a university right now, you probably wouldn't understand the script of this film.<br /><br />The actors/actresses overall do a fine job with the script, although you will catch some flaws along the way, but portraying Midwestern college kids they do not. The lines in the film are a bunch of cliche, one-liners, that would be difficult to understand for the average moviegoer. Some of the scenes get boring and can run rather long.<br /><br />The story is basic, but it works. Two roommates, one girl, one dorky guy is enamored with her, the cool guy gets her. What's going to happen?!<br /><br />The movie makes you kind of want to go back to college and stay there, but is it all believeable? You make the call.<br /><br />
