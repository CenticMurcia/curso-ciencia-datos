Rubbish - Utter rubbish Why?<br /><br />- Its not a comedy - Its Bad Acting - Not Storyline - Makes as much sense as my cat does - The characters are out of character - BADLY ADVITISED<br /><br />Yeah - The list goes on<br /><br />This IS NOT what French and saunders are used to doing, they should stick to making great comedy's like Ab Fab, Vicar of Dibly. Not this Rubbish.<br /><br />Kill this series before it gives the great British comedy a bad name. Seriously, my dog is a better source of comedy when it is asleep!
