From the title, I assumed this was another sendup flick like NOT ANOTHER TEEN MOVIE or SCARY MOVIE or even AIRPLANE, the flick that launched the genre. If that was what was intended, DATE MOVIE fails on all counts. There isn't a single laugh to be had, and the movie feels like a bad high school play. A nebbish (Campbell) is courting a sweet young gal (Hannigan, who should know better). But his best-est friend is a fem,ale and a knockout (Monk) who also happens to be a former girlfriend. She intends to spoil their marriage plans and win him back. A slew of familiar faces play various parents, other relatives and friends. Eddie Griffin is along for the ride, and he is singularly unfunny in this. Somehow, I don't think it was his fault. Let me give you one instance of how this film fails at every turn: When Hannigan first meets her beau's best-est buddy, Monk is shown diving into a pool, coming up on the other side, showering off, then washing a car in her too-tiny bikini and even pole-dancing with the shower. This is all done in slow-mo and seems to go on on forever. Hanigan even comments on it. Through it all, we keep cutting back to Campbell and Hanigan for reacti0n shots, but they are all too obviously staring at the camera and not at Monk, who clearly filmed her sultry scenes separately. If this is supposed to be funny, it isn't. And when the three of them finally sit down together next to the pool, Monk whips off her tiny swimsuit and sits down nekked, except it just isn't funny or arousing or anything. You just want the damned sequence to end. Please pass this stinker by.
