Group of guys grow up together, go different ways...couple go bad, couple buy a truck. Act like it's the greatest thing in the world until the end when one decides he needs a new start. The big conflict was when they scratched the truck...I just didn't get it. Other than the fact that the director went on to do Battle Royale I can't think of any reason to see this. Ending made no sense to me at all.
