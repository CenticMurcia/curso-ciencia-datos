Sunshine is my all time favorite movie in the entire world.I also have been looking for The Sunshine Years TV Series that aired as Sunshine for half a season. I have been searching for years and years. I have the DVD sunshine, I have the DVD Sunshine Christmas.. I have all three Norma Klein books ( Sunshine, Sunshine Christmas and The Sunshine Years)... I have the Soundtrack on Cassette and Cd and LP.. I am desperate to see the TV series again... I watched it as a kid and remember every episode... Also there was a movie called My Sweet Lady Sunshine part 11, It was shown in London. I have desperately been trying to find a copy of that... Have you had any luck? Maybe we can work together..
