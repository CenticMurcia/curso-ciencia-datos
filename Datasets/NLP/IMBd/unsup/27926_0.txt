Why would I lie? I rate this movie a 10 for excellent. It's the best romantic comedy with a surprise ending that I have ever seen. I have to say that this is my all time favorite movie. I was 19 when it first came out on HBO. I would watch it over and over, I have no idea how many times I watched it. I don't think that VCR's were even around yet. If they were I would have taped it. I would love to get a copy of this. I have looked high and low for it and have challenged video stores and friends to find the video. No one can! This is a great movie and I just can't see why it's not available on tape or now that I have a VCR I wish HBO would pull it out of the basement and show it again.
