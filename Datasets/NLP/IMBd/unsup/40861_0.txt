right, well. I work in a cinema and we get staff screenings of films. So I thought to all who are wanting to see it ( Australians, unless it's still not released else-where) To do something constructive with the time you would spend with this film. I just got home from it and I can safely say it's one of the worst films I've EVER seen, if not THE worst.<br /><br />The good. Slightly funny references to MTV & Pop culture. <br /><br />The bad. It's a disgrace to the classic and or brilliant films we all enjoy. Boring Predictable, as a parody film usually is. un-original silly the humor is just pointless use of 'slap-stick' , lame sexual humor, and manipulating other films in a predictable way. A Waste of time. The Villon / 'bady' of the film's name is the white bitch of Gnarnia, originating from the white witch of Narnia. Congrats guys, you can think of words that rhyme! It's not even bad enough to laugh at. In comparison to another bad film, Snakes on a plane, was humorous as it was so poorly done. This however is just lame. <br /><br />Rating 1/10 ( There was no 0 option)
