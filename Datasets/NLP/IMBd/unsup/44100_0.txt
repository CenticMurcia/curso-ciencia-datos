Waste of time! <br /><br />IF the movie was made by a High School Drama Team... then OK... good work. Otherwise, this stinks<br /><br />Just like all the other "Mini Movies"... which are put together in haste... <br /><br />Token Asian "brain" guy Token female "hero" chick Token White "bad" guy Token military "evil" guy Token politician "cover-up" guy Token teenage "couple in love" pair<br /><br />Typical small town Typical... "this is going to end it all for the world" theme<br /><br />Bad acting, bad casting, and VERY BAD research...<br /><br />The USAF logo... is a RECRUITING logo for the USAF<br /><br />There are NO 4-Star Generals except in time of war!<br /><br />Why have a camouflaged business jet for the "General"? Is he going to land that thing in Iraq? <br /><br />Where did that response team come from so fast? No-town Utah is suppose to be in the middle of nowhere! Oh... that's right, they were dropped out of the government sponsored UFO!<br /><br />Since when has ANY "First Lady" looked that good?<br /><br />And from the very start I just knew that someone would suggest "nuking" the town... which they did suggest. That is how predictable this waste of time is!<br /><br />Again... if it was done by a bunch of High School drama students... then great! You have some imagination. But if I paid to have a ad during the movie... I would demand a refund!<br /><br />Speaking of ads.... Ford actually did an ad during the movie based on the movie... I will never buy a Ford!
