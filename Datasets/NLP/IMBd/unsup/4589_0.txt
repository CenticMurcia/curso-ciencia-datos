I found this short to be uninteresting while watching it, but afterwards it did stir up some thought in me about the horror and beauty of film.<br /><br />I don't really know if this is a spoiler, but just in case you may not want to read.<br /><br />The Old Man mentioned something about the camera captures the death of a moment and the old man says he is a retired actor. To me at least that meant that this Old Man has been slowly dying in front of the Camera his whole life (reference from his dream). He has a new life until the children bring the Camera into the house, and he notes that children and camera's should not be put together. Obviously again noting since that this Camera "captures the death of a moment" that would make sense because the children should have a life instead of slowly dying like the old man. Write something back to me if you want to discuss.<br /><br />Also I liked how it was a sort of criticism on cinema itself, but at the same time honoring it. Plus the idea that the Old Man is dying, but is being immortalized by the same camera that is killing him.<br /><br />I gave it a 4 strictly because of visuals. Other than that, at least it was better than Fast Company.
