Lets forget the "how" the ship got to where (or when) it was. The story here is of the conflicts that arise as the evidence mounts that for whatever reason, a modern aircraft carrier has found itself 280 miles from Hawaii in the afternoon of December 6th 1941! Will the captain order his men to attack the incoming Japanese force and thus change the course of history, or if not, what then? Have they already changed history by their actions presiding the decision to attack or not. Lets face it, if this could have happened, WWII would have essentially been over in about 20 minutes. Suspend your disbelief and enjoy the ride. Make sure to stay with it to the end for the surprise twist at the very end.
