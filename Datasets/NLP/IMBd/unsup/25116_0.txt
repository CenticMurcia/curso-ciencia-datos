movies from this era. Clearly acting, directing, and writing styles have changed drastically. Not to mention production values. I admit I don't always understand why some films are considered "classics". This is one of those films. Released in 1932, Grand Hotel must have been a wonderful escape for those living through the depression. Beautiful people, in a beautiful, rich location, living their beautiful lives. M-G-M at the time advertised that they had "more stars than the heavens", and they proved it with the wonderful cast in this movie.<br /><br />I admire the way the different stories are interwoven and clumsily connected to each other. Off the top of my head, I can't think of another film that did this as well during this period. The opening sequence of the overhead shots and the introduction of the lead characters is also very well done, for the period. I also like the way that Jean Hersholt's(spelling?)character frames the movie. And the amount of sexuality suggested must have brought people pouring back into the theatres.<br /><br />But there is no denying that many parts of this movie are pure melodrama. It is not helped by the fact that none of the lead actors would ever be accused of "under playing" their roles. The scene where Garbo is on the phone trying to find Barrymore, and the one towards the end with Lionel Barrymore and Wallace Beery are particularly bad. But again, that was the style of the day, so how much can you discount the film for that?<br /><br />I would love to see this picture re-made, but left in the pre-WWII Berlin, and hopefully include a minor storyline of what was happening in Berlin at the time.<br /><br />A wonderful artifact from Hollywood's golden age, I would rate "Grand Hotel" a 8 out of 10.<br /><br />
