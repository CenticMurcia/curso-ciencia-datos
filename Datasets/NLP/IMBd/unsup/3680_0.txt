Even giving it the benefit of the doubt, I can't find too many redeeming qualities in Texas Chainsaw Massacre.<br /><br />The plot has become the standard story for the next four decades of horror flicks, the characters are as generic as they can be, the violence isn't even scary nor disturbing...<br /><br />Horror movies have different ways to scare the audience: the most common are gore (i.e. physical violence/torture) or psychological distress.<br /><br />TCM fails at both.<br /><br />The violence is pretty much par for the course, with nothing overly graphic or nauseating.<br /><br />The psychological aspect is totally absent: it's impossible feeling empathy for the victims, and the murderers are so implausible and cartoonish you almost expect Uncle Fester to show up at dinner table.<br /><br />Not scary, not unsettling, just grotesque and dull.<br /><br />I'm aware I can't judge the movie with today's standards, but despite its status of Cult Movie, groundbreaking work etc etc, I just can't bring myself to care much about it.<br /><br />As scary as this may sound (and it IS scary to say), the glossy and Hollywood-style remake was better. At least it didn't look like an high-school project filmed with grandpa's old 8mm
