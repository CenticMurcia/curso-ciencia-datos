Worst Animated Movie Ever. It was a good idea, with good charachters poorly executed. Charachters had absolutely nothing to do. The 7 female "dwarfs" was an interesting idea, but unfortunately the talent was wasted by a horrendous script. The animation was elementary school quality. The final scenes were probably the worst animated sequence I have ever seen. They looked like early Hannah - Barbera cartoons. Such a waste!
