The television show "Farscape" is perhaps one of the best I have ever watched. I sat fascinated through the 88 episodes, whether I was laughing, crying, or cheering on the crew of Moya. But this mini-series lacks the feel of the television series (which it began to lose in its fourth season). It feels like any old sci-fi movie - not like Farscape. The cameos of old characters seem a bit forced, the plot is clich√©, the battles are uninteresting (and much to long and unrealistic). JC and the crew of Moya are *not* heroes - thats what makes them so fun to watch, they are just looking out for themselves, trying to survive in a dangerous universe - so why force them into that role in this movie? Its unfortunate that such a fantastic show has to go out by such a terrible movie. It could have - should have been - much better. <br /><br />Its not terrible, but I rate it a 1 in hopes of dropping its too generous score as is. I rate the show 10. Check that out, then watch this if you love the show, but don't keep your hopes too high.
