well I don't watch star gate in general, but watched this crap..... waste of time, the actors sucked the story as well... and what about those "mecano spiders"? U know the old construction set for kids, as most of the movie was about struggle against the toys many of us was building when really young. so why don't show some more fantastic Ori fights instead... fantastic??? nope awful and without spark and temper. I once had a strange feeling to start watching star gate series but now I know... hope I didn't offend some of U that actually like this crap, but for the best of planet earth I rather take Ori as my leader than to see any star gate again. well had a laugh and slept nice =)
