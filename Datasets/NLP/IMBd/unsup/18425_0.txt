(note: not really spoilers, but this review contains basic information about the plot) It IS well directed & acted. Dialogue is well written. But the characters bring little sympathy as they are all flawed and selfish. Everyone was so corrupted by lies and immorality that I couldn't relate personally and I tired of all Moll's bad decisions. I come away feeling like no one was admirable in this.<br /><br />Sex scene after *explicit* sex scene makes it more like porn that art. This movie would be NC-17 if it were rated. There must be 15 sex scenes. You can get the gist of the fact she's having sex with lots of people without showing us every single one, in detail.<br /><br />If you like period movies, there are many better ones. Try North and South or Cranford by Gaskell, or there are many excellent Charles Dickens movies like Nicholas Nickleby and the newest Oliver Twist.
