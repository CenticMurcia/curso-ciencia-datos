CRIME WAVE is a movie with much to offer. Although maybe over-titled in the sense there are only 4 criminals, it's still a solid story which is well directed, acted and photographed. This counts for a lot in 2007 as the last two movies we went out to see --- At World's End & Order of the Phoenix --- neither film had anything that could be truthfully described as a story.<br /><br />A few things I really liked about CRIME WAVE: Seeing real-life World War II mega-hero STERLING HAYDEN again, as there are no real life heroes in 2007 Hollywood. I also liked seeing tough guy CHARLES BRONSON in one of his early roles. Bronson went on to become the #1 box office star in the World (although not #1 in the USA), herein playing a street punk rather than crime fighter. Beautiful Phyllis Kirk never looked better, as did LOS ANGELES; 50 years ago before 90% of their population arrived.<br /><br />Now paired on DVD with Monogram Pictures' famous film noir, DECOY, that's quite a lot for a $1.50 DVD rental.
