This movie totally SUCKED! I was SHOCKED! I rented this movie because Jackie Chan produced it, and I figured I was in for a real action movie, Jackie Chan style. What I got was a load of slop! I kept waiting for the movie to get better and it never did. There are NO Jackie Chan style action sequences. The story is paper thin. The fat, stupid cop named "Chan," is a character for whom the audience is supposed to feel sorry, but you hate him just as much as the characters in the movie do! They are all making fun of him and you have to agree with them! He is not likable. Neither are the Gen X cops! They are just a bunch of punks. I would have liked to have seen at least ONE Jackie Chan style fight scene, but there wasn't any to be found.<br /><br />At the end of the movie, Jackie Chan makes a cameo as a fisherman. He tells the three young punks, "When I was your age, I was stronger, faster, and better." That line sums up this movie! It is totally true! Not only was Jackie better when he was younger, he still IS better and he is more than twice the age of the stars of this movie! They did not display ANY talent worth watching.<br /><br />As if that wasn't enough, the plot and dialogue were absolutely awful. This is nothing but cheap, poorly written crap. I hated this movie and I am sorry I rented it. This movie is not up to standard for a Jackie Chan project. Avoid at all costs!
