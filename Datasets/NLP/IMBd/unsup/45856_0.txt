Not even the title "Versus 2", under which it did play at the Fantasy Filmfest in Stuttgart/Germany, could fool anybody, that this is more than a piece of crap. Only thing this has in common with Versus, is the main actor here.<br /><br />Other than that, don't look for a decent script (for a b-movie that is, not an actual movie, of course) nor decent acting nor decent humour nor decent anything. It's just plain stupid. And it's a shame, because it does start promising enough and there is a funny moment here and there ... but not nearly enough to grant this movie more than two stars ... it's still a waste of time!
