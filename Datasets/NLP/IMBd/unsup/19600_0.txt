In "Bulworth," Warren Beatty plays a liberal senator who puts a contract out on himself. Since he knows he is going to die soon, he decides to be honest with the public for the very first time in his political career. However, to the surprise of everyone (including himself), his new attitude makes him more popular than ever before. Audacious political satire, maybe the best of its kind. Savage wit and penetrating observations about the American society, are just a few ingredients that help make this movie a winner. This is definitely Beatty's best film as an actor/director/writer. He is fearless in his exploration of the USA's political machinery, sparing no one, and making his points in an intelligent and very funny manner. It is also a very disturbing movie. Kubrick's "Dr. Strangelove (1964)" looks like child's play compared to the dark implications of this film. It is refreshing to see a mature Beatty, display so much creativity and energy in one film. Funny, wise and profane. Guarantee to offend all kinds of viewers. Highly Recommended!
