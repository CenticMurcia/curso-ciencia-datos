I like this movie very much. Anyone committing or having committed ID Theft should be made to watch this movie no less than 20hrs a day and not less than 2yrs every day. Maybe then people will understand what kind of damage they have caused and stop and think about it. I can personally related because two people in my extended family did this and they're getting off the easy way. No sympathy should be the punishment. Anyway I thought the movie was directed and performed with the excellence to make this seem so realistic and not twist the truth of what happened. I think everyone should watch this movie. It really gives you an idea of what can happened when you least expect it.
