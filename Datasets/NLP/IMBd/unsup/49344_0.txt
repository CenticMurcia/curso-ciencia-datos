I was forced to see this movie in the theater by my friends. I tought it would be a bad, semi-porn kind of movie. I wish it would have been that. It was actually worse. It is not only grotesque but also boring. The sex scenes (which includes 1 gay) are not at all good, sometimes disgusting. I can't believe that actors like Spader and Hunter acted in this movie.
