Extremely amateurish "faux-reality-show" or "home-movie" feel. Total waste of time. We "rented" this as one of our monthly "freebies" from Blockbuster and it wasn't even worth the effort to get it. We groaned even as we fast forwarded through the really bad parts. Moved slower than molasses. The description on the cover suggested a real movie, so it was completely disappointing when it turned out to be someone's poorly done home movie. I will be looking to avoid anyone that had anything to do with this picture in the future - if this is their sense of movie-making or of entertainment, I want to stay clear. Don't waste your time.
