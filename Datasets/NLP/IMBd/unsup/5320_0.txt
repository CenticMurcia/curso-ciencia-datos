In the beginning, while watching this film, I was alternately disgusted and infuriated. I was looking at the characters thinking things like "get a job", "say something" or "take a bath!". Needless to say, I ended up being humbled and deeply moved. We glimpse each character's inner world, revealing their pain, faults and strength. And it literally turned the tables on me and got me to examine myself--my capacity for understanding and love. This is truly a great film.
