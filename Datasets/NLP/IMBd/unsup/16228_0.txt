Here's a movie I wish I'd seen when I was 16: edgy, almost lovable main characters that are weird enough to identify with and an interesting plotline that makes most other "teen" movies bow their heads in shame.<br /><br />Also, I've read the original comic, that the film is based on, months before seeing the movie, so I was actually surprised how much I liked the movie. Ghost World the Comic (in my humble opinion) is one of the most overrated graphic novels of our times. It was nice, but nothing so special. So when the movie turned out good, I was very pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />Some elements of the original comics plot were altered for the movie version, which I don't actually mind, because Dan Clowes was one of the screenwriters and was at charge (at least to some extent) in bringing his own comic to the big screen. One of the changes, that I didn't like, was the ending. The ending in the comic was much better, although it might have been difficult to recreate it in a movie (anyone seen a nicely done ageing-makeup in a movie? :D)<br /><br />
