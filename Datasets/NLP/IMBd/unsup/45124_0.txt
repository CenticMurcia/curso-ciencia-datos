In what I can only describe as a "perfect storm" of bad acting, bad writing, bad producing, bad stunts, bad camera-work, and bad editing, this movie has gone beyond being a campy B-Movie. This is one that, when you think you've reached the bottom of the barrel but lift up the barrel and examine what's underneath, you find.<br /><br />The plot is strictly formula driven - no originality. The actors are plasticly in their performances, and the special effects really do look like something a high-school kid might create in his garage.<br /><br />In general, I found it to have a made-for-TV or a direct-to-video quality to it. <br /><br />This is one that the Mystery Science Theater 3000 team would have a field-day suffering through.
