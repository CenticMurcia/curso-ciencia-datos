Although I was not expecting this to be a classic bit of comedy, I clearly had no idea that the script would be so weak that it could not be saved even with the best efforts of Nicholson and Sandler. Within the first thirty minutes, I observed twelve people walk out of the theater; I managed to hold out for almost an hour.<br /><br />As expected, the movie contained all of the obligatory direct and indirect references to every conceivable bodily function, both scatological and sexual. Perhaps I am being overly harsh (and maybe even stodgy), but I'm definitely past the point in my life where I crack up at overly-repetitive "pee-pee" and "pooh-pooh" humor. Lest it be thought that I can't enjoy ANY movie in this genre, I should state that I did like "Something About Mary." I guess it's a matter of degree.<br /><br />As the movie progressed, I kept imagining the scene where actors were reviewing this lame script for the first time and could not help but wonder, "What were they thinking?" Could anyone seeing this dialog on paper possibly think it was funny? There were precious few scenes that worked - and most of them were in the trailer.<br /><br />My advice: Watch the trailer. Skip the movie.
