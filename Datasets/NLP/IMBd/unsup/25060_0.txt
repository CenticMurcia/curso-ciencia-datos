I happened to see a sneak preview of this film and let me say, this is one indie to seek out.<br /><br />For starters, the script is solid, with more witty dialog than a Kevin Smith film. The story is unique, sexy, and absolutely hilarious. I don't want to give too much away, but the story is about Zack and his girlfriend who have a threesome with a friend of theirs.<br /><br />The story takes place after the threesome at the Billiads store where they all work. Zack wants to be a player, but his girlfriend doesn't want to give him up. hilarity ensues as Zack handles all the activity at the billiards shop while trying to figure out what happened and what to do.<br /><br />The acting in Kisses and Caroms is far and above that of most indie films, and even a great deal of Hollywood films. Zack, you've probably seen the main character in countless commercials from high speed internet to jock itch. Well, not jock itch, but you get the idea.<br /><br />The supporting cast shines just as well, in both the men and women that surround the main character. There are no weak performances at all in this film.<br /><br />That quality is a definite credit to Director Vince Rocca, who helms this fun movie with the skill and talent of world class athlete.<br /><br />Be sure to pick this film up. This is one to OWN!!!!!
