Most old B-movie buffs know Mantan Moreland as the sidekick for Charlie Chan in the later Monogram Pictures Chan films. In this role, he was often very funny but also the embodiment of what many Black Americans hated about Hollywood during the era. He was almost always cast as the scared Black man who overreacted as White folks laughed their heads off at his antics. He was quite funny, but at the same time this reinforced a negative and paternalistic stereotype. Now I do NOT recommend people avoid his films--after all, throwing out his films would do a disservice to his talents and living in a 100% politically correct world where we cannot allow evidence of "incorrect thinking" is a scary prospect indeed. But be aware of this before you watch the film--you could easily be offended. Oddly, however, while this is definitely a horror film featuring Mantan reacting to zombies and the like again and again, his antics weren't nearly as offensive as usual. Plus, oddly, he had one of the best vocabularies of any character from his age--using very high-brow words AND using them in the correct context! So, while Moreland might have been a negative role model in one way, in another he showed that a Black man can be very bright and articulate as well (now THAT'S a first in film).<br /><br />Apart from Moreland, the rest of the film is a pretty flimsy story about a plane that crashes onto an unnamed Caribbean island. There they are assisted by a guy who obviously is a German but the three men never seem to catch on and put 2 and 2 together! While the US was not yet in the war when the film was made, WWII was in full swing and only a group of idiots wouldn't have guessed what was really occurring! Because the heroes were too stupid to live and the plot was handled so much better in films like WHITE ZOMBIE and I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE, this film is totally skip-able. However, if you do watch, don't expect it to be either bad or good--sort of like the VELVETA of films.
