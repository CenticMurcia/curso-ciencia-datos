This movie focus the war from a religious point of view, and it shows the Muslims as the good guys and Christian and Jewish as the bad ones. I won't say if they are right about Muslim and Jewish beliefs, but about Christian I can assure they are 100% wrong. An assassin, and American military chief, is portrayed as fervent Christian believer, and I can say that it can't be true at all. The Bible doesn't encourage war at all, as they want to show in the movie, that's a terrible lie, and no more than Muslim propaganda. That man was not a Christian believer at all, in fact, he could be an atheist or any other thing, but not Christian as they pretend to show in the movie. On the other hand, the movie is really well done, and shows the war from a Turkish point of view. I can imagine the pain of these people, but please don't put Christianity and the Bible on it because it has nothing to do with the Bible.
