"Teenage Zombies" is a bad movie. Make that an absolutely horrible movie. It isn't as bad as "The Beast of Yucca Flats", but that's not saying too much. Jerry Warren was one of the worst directors ever. The man had absolutely no clue on how to keep up a pace. This isn't even his worst film (I actually sat through "The Wild World of Batwoman" and "The Incredible Petrified World"). The man seemed to have no idea on how to craft some degree of tension or suspense. His films aren't even that funny, which is the main draw for many folks to b-movies. "Teenage Zombies" suffers from all these problems, yet for some reason I've never been able to forget it.<br /><br />It all achieves a sense of unintentional surrealism due to the sheer ineptitude of it all. The bargain basement sets, the "zombie" which is just a guy rolling his eyes upward, the sexless teens, the sheer implausibility of the script, the awkward silences throughout, and the standard explanation for the horror being perpetrated by Russian spies. All of this seems so fabricated and yet so bizarre, like your most severe fever dream. Even without the supernatural elements, the film resembles absolutely nothing in reality. I'm not sure if this is exactly a recommendation, but I don't believe I'll ever forget the unexpectedly disorienting affect "Teenage Zombies" had on me. (3/10)
