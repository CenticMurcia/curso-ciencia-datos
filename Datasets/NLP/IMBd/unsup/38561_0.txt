I was disappointed when I saw this movie in 1954, probably because I was expecting more "ancient Egypt stuff." What we got was a pretty slow-moving, completely predictable romance. I just watched it again and it hasn't improved. Originally, the location shots were probably interesting; I would still like to see the actual places. However, by now, the sites are very familiar. It's really a '50s potboiler with a big budget. But I was right the first time. Robert Taylor was wooden; Eleanor Parker, pretty; Victor Jory's face was covered but we were treated to his wonderful voice. Taylor was much better in "Camille" when he but a sprig of a lad, but very sincere. Of course, the Egyptians were stereotyped according to the Hollywood vision of the time. Making Parker's husband the villain-fortune hunter was a bit much.
