If I could hand out awards, I would give this movie the Worst Movie Ever Award for being devoid of any real plot and having absolutely no believable characters with terrible dialog. I was never sure how much time had passed or how all the random people kept showing up. And because there were so many randoms in this movie it made it hard to even follow who some of the main characters were (i.e. Amber). The supposed "good guy" was almost as much of a douche as Derrick (up until the point that Derrick kills the girl). Also, if you're fighting for survival in a world overrun by zombies (and in a supposed nuclear fallout - or something quite similar), why would you let such a terrible person stay in your midst? Anyhow. This movie was terrible, and I only finished watching it out of pure fascination as to how it is possible to make such a terrible movie, even on such a low budget - which is no excuse, just to let you know.<br /><br />A cheesy movie is acceptable when done right - this wasn't.<br /><br />If you're going to watch this movie, be prepared for the worst cinematic adventure of your life.<br /><br />PS, I agree that this should be called an F Movie instead of a B Movie, and should not even get the good graces of a 1, for it was far more terrible than that. Also, there should never be a sequel to this atrocity.<br /><br />Thank you, and good night.
