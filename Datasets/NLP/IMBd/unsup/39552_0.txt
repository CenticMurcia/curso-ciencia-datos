Good Lord. I've seen some strange stuff but this one may well take the cake. A woman who is dabbling in witchcraft manages to get more-or-less possessed by a witch named Abigail, and Abigail treats her to all kinds of strange sexual adventures, including seducing her gay neighbor & even her very own Aunt Fanny. All seemingly while "remaining a virgin for her daddy" whatever that means....not sure I want to know.<br /><br />Eventually this woman's brother is also taken over by Abigail & he's turned into a "sex vampire". Why exactly a sex vampire needs fangs would be something I don't want to think about too long, but this transformation also makes her brother lurch along like Quasimodo, perhaps because he has an erection; again, not something to ponder very much.<br /><br />This has no dialog, really, it's all voice-over narration, along with a bunch of Halloween masks & people in weird costumes which are supposedly Astral Demons, which flash in and out of the action in "transetheric vision". Not really a film made for watching on acid, so much as a film MADE by people on acid, I guess.<br /><br />Still though, for all its faults (there's plenty), it's still kind of fascinating at times, in a "why am I watching this?" kind of way. Only something that would be released on Something Weird Video.<br /><br />Decidedly weird and quite amateur, but maybe worth a look if you're both adventurous & bored. 4 out of 10.
