I pretty much avoid movies I don't think I'll like. And if I do start one I usually quit early. In this case, because of the performers I fast forwarded to see the performances. They were nearly all bad, too.<br /><br />The only redeeming features in the movie are 2 minutes of Jackie Wilson and several minutes of Chuck Berry. But even the Chuck Berry portion with a so called "band" was such a joke, a bunch of white guys pretending to play.<br /><br />And like many films of 50's music, the singing was lip sync'd to a previous recording.<br /><br />It's a shame. I went to high school from '57 to '61 and there was great music. Would love to see/hear some in a movie.
