I intended to watch Saawariya as much as Om Shanti Om and I've already seen OSO on the first day it came out and I loved it. I seen Saawariya the next day and it was very peaceful & relaxing. Not everyone is able to watch this film not because it has unsuitable content (it is PG) but because it requires a maximum amount of patience. Personally I'm so fanatical about films and so patient that I can even watch the worst possible movie there is.<br /><br />The story of the film is quite old about a simple love story that has been tackled a lot of times in Bollywood but it was still different than them. The filmmakers took 2 hours & 10 minutes to tell the story although it could even be made in 1 hour 30 minutes because it is an adaptation from an Old Russian short story called "White Nights". All Ranbir & Sonam Kapoor did was talk and sing throughout the whole film on top of a small bridge. It was like that you are looking out your window all day watching a couple but I had a nice time watching. Sonam was OK but Ranbir was good. Salman Khan & Rani Mukerji acted really well for their small roles.<br /><br />I always look at the bright side of a movie which is that the film is very well made for a dream world. The cinematography was excellent and you can see every penny spent from the $10 million budget. That was the best thing I was enjoying. Music is beautiful and the best songs are: Saawariya the title song and Jab Se Tere Naina. Anyway Saawariya is a very nice heart touching film and I have seen much, much worse films. Sanjay Leela Bhansali's best film to date is Black and I would say Saawariya is the second.
