(some spoilers) I saw this annoying and pointless film yesterday after few friends told me it was great. I don't share their view point at all, maybe I didn't understand the message Araki wanted to get through here. It's just non sense and stupid dialogues, and it's just amazing how he could get such a B-cast for such a bad movie. If ever you're compelled to see this trash, press forward to the scene where Elvis runs amuck and smashes time and again a guy's skull with a tin can so that you'll realize how silly this awful flick is. No plot, no acting, no ideas, just a total waste of time. Fortunately it lasts only 1h15 but it seems much longer. Good score though. 1/10 stars
