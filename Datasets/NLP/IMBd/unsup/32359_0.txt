This is the single worst movie, with the exception of "The People Under the Stairs" that I have ever seen. For many titles on IMDb, some comment on how intriguing a plot is. Well, that can be skipped for this film, because the plot is so ill-thought out that there might as well not be one. Why would a director waste time/money on: 1. Horrible "special" effects. EVERY single stunt was ludicrously cheesy and fake. Only a ten year old kid would enjoy them.<br /><br />2. Dialog. It has to be the worst for ANY movie that I can remember watching. I mean, it's embarrassing. The writer(s) should be shunned from film-making forever.<br /><br />3. Cast. Ridiculous does not do it justice. John Cena, WWE wrestler, is one of the worst "actors" of all time. First of all, no one cares about WWE. People did in the 90's, and only idiots who thought it was real enjoyed it. Secondly, his voice is so annoying and the dialog is so terrible that I wanted to see him die a horrible death every three minutes.<br /><br />4. Concept. Honestly. Diamond thieves. GIVE ME A BREAK. Number two: hostage situation. It's so bad that I had to laugh.<br /><br />5. The black guy. Not being racist, but he was the worst character of all of them. I mean come on, this movie is obviously projected to younger teens, but why do the stupid racist jokes have to come out of this guy's mouth? They aren't even funny! It all goes back to dialog. Second, the language. The foul language sounded so ridiculous because of horrible acting, and often didn't fit with the context. Again, this is why 13 year olds are stupid.<br /><br />6 (and last). Overall crap. This movie sucks. Period. It is absolutely terrible. Do not, even if you are stuck in a cabin from the snow, watch this movie. Burn it. Throw it away. Anything. If you get it for Christmas, never speak to the giver again.<br /><br />Bottom line: This movie sucked from opening propaganda to final stunt. If you want a good laugh, watch it. Because it seriously needs to be moved from "Action" to "Comedy"
