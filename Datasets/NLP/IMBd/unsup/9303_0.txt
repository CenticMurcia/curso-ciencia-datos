Well what is there to say about Megalodon, Well the CGI is OK the Station looks like CGI and so dose the water and ICE around it The shark looks like a Shark that is disproportionate his body is big and his mouth is really small. It is really slow moving. There really isn't any story development and the acting is somewhat unbelievable.<br /><br />Over all it's OK if you are a really big shark fan. I like shark movies and it's not a bad movie but it could have been a lot better. I would watch it every once and awhile but it's not one to watch all the time it's not by any means a Jaws type movie<br /><br />I give it a 4/10
