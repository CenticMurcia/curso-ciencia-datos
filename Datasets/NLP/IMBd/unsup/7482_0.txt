This is just a great great filmed version of a great great play. Watching it was amazing because I've seen this play so many times, and yet for some reason they found a new better way of doing it. Spalding Grey is an inspired choice for the Stage Manager, he's sharp and prickly and much darker than the old friendly guy who usually plays this part. And Penelope Anne Miller and Eric Stoltz as Emily and George are just fantastic, I was very moved by the famous 'soda fountain scene', that if done poorly can ruin the play. The third act with the dead was very moving, I just can't say enough good things about this version of Our Town. Track it down, you won't be sorry.
