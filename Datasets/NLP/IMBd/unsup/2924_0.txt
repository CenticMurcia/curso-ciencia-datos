A young steelworker earns a scholarship to Yale, where he eventually joins the prestigious football team. But will he ever get to HUDDLE with the best player's upper-class sister?<br /><br />Ramon Novarro, MGM's chameleon star of the 1920's & '30's, gives this minor film the old college try, but is ultimately defeated by the plot & story line. His acting is good, as usual, and he even gets to sing a little, but he's simply too old to be playing a university football hero (he turned 33 in 1932).<br /><br />The real difficulty, however, is that the film tries for some degree of social consciousness in its dealing with class struggle, but the framework is just too flimsy for such a weighty, albeit noble, subject. It is difficult to get much solemnity out of a sports film, especially when sprinkled with such ludicrous scenes as Novarro drunk in a public restroom or fist fighting with his coach. The game sequences seem a trifle interminable and MGM didn't help by giving the movie rather cheap production values.<br /><br />One expects action & romance from a Ramon Novarro picture, not a message film, but the Studio was obviously losing interest in its star. Novarro had become a relic from a bygone era, his private life was always a worry to the front office, and by 1935 his career at MGM would be over.<br /><br />Novarro's costars, although rather boisterous, are ultimately defeated by the script as well. Pretty Madge Evans is the girl Novarro pines after for four years. John Arledge plays Novarro's loyal roommate; their scenes together, perhaps unconsciously, tend to be a mite gynandrous. Frank Albertson (an actor who deserved major stardom, but never achieved it) is a college buddy, while Kane Richmond is Novarro's nemesis.<br /><br />Ralph Graves, who was actually a year younger than Novarro, gives a fine performance as Yale's football coach. Una Merkel is a Southern doll with an almost impenetrable accent. Henry Armetta & Ferike Boros add more than a dash of ethnicity as Novarro's Italian-American parents.<br /><br />Finally, Ramon Novarro still remains the principle reason to watch most of his MGM sound films. As a young immigrant, he had persevered over much hardship to become a major silent screen star. Charming & talented, it is a shame that today Novarro is remembered chiefly for the manner of his death rather than his contribution to American movies.
