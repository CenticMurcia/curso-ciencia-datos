I rented Bullitt with high hopes and Steve McQueen is one of my all time favorite actors, but I was so disappointed. The movie is very slow paced, so I would call the movie rather crime than action or thriller. I waited some action in the first half, waited, waited and waited. I can't say that I got bored exactly, but. In the first half, no action, it is just visually well movie with Steve McQueen. The movie runs by him. In the second half, still things don't get into action, I waited, waited but it never came. And then, the famous car chase takes place, but unfortunately it is pretty short, a few minutes and very unsatisfying, because it is mild like the movie itself, but the editing is really astonishing, cool. Yes, the word cool that many people use for the movie fits the movie very well, this is the word, cool, but no more than that. The movie is visually stylish as said, but it is not enough, because ithe movie is lack of action and it was not boring, but it was not engrossing either. In the second half, besides the car chase, there is one more afoot chase and that's all. Therefore, don't expect something like French Connection. Bullitt is such kind of a movie, it recalls French Connection, but with three differences, it is lack of action, suspense and the story is not engrossing enough. Returning to the car chase, Bullitt's car chase might be in some people's the best car chases list, but if you ask me, we have seen much better car chases and I want to give a few examples, also I am sure that there are more car chases that I can't remember or haven't seen yet. These are my favorite car chases so far: The Terminator 2, The Terminator 3, too much CGI may be, but great. The Matrix Reloaded, again too much CGI and showy, but great. Bourne Supremacy, some people don't like it owing to the shaky camera, but my second favorite of all time. The Peacemaker. And my favorite car chase of all time is Ronin.
