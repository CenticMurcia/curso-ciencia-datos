I'm from Romania, not from Bucharest but I know that we don't have Opel Astra Police cars. We have NEW Volkswagen Passat POLICE CARS and Romanian cars like Dacia. This movie is a shame for the US film industry. At least they could do some research before filming in another country. I know that Romania is a poor country but the least they could do is make the movie accurate. I really expected a good movie but no every time some other county films in Romania they do something wrong I'm sick of this. We have a beautiful country. We have beautiful landscapes, we have the Black See. Another thing i can't believe that some Americans think that Romania is some kind of food. Shame on you.
