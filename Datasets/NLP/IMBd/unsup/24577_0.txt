khamosh pani is among those few films which really matter. After watching his film i couldn't sleep properly for next few nights. it was disheartening to know that Pakistan, which has a similar culture to India underwent major changes culturally during Zia-ul-haq's regime. General Zia in his efforts to avenge the loss of east Pakistan tried to undo any so called Indian influence on social structure by turning Pakistan into a theocratic state. all the radical changes brought in name of islamisation further gave rise to problems which were created by fanatic minds..like tali bans in Afghanistan or i.s.i sponsored terrorism in Kashmir. Though khamosh pani doesn't tackle these issues directly but shows a changing social scenario in Pakistan during the seventies & eighties.this movie subtle also reflects the futility of partition & insecurities of the time.It should be a lesson to all the people who give more importance to theology than humanity.
