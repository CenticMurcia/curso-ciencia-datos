Not a bad movie, but since it is made by Americans, there is a lot of USA born Chinese trying to speak Chinese without much success, and it turns out to be goobledegook. Should have hired some real chinese to do the speaking parts.<br /><br />John Wayne's reference to "baby" makes me want to puke, it is cheesy to the extreme. Some great actions by the steam boat, unfortunately not by actors. I will not watch this film again, once is enough.
