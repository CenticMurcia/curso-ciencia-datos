I feel a sense of betrayal on behalf of the characters depicted in this movie.<br /><br />I can say Lange did a good job portraying the younger Edith. Lange's portrayal of older Edith, documentary remake, was absolutely terrible with the exception of the "Tea for Two" scene. The real Edith, from the original documentary, maintained unique characteristics that were completely foreign and unreal to me. There was a sense of improvised and on the spot personality to the real Edith I saw in the original documentary that was not captured in this "reinterpretation." Barrymore fared much better than Lange in both the documentary imitation and earlier years. Although Edie's encounter with Jackie O was absolutely appalling, disrespectful and unnecessary...not to mention untrue.<br /><br />All Baldwins act the same all the time in anything they're ever in, gross.<br /><br />The documentary portions of this movie that were remade to model the original should have been exactly as they were in the original or completely different. Instead, they took specific scenes, swapped specific words, combined words and made it seem so scripted and dramatic! The Beales are beautiful in the sense of honesty and thinking in the moment, with reasoning behind anything and everything that is done. The movie took this admirable authenticity from the characters into a fantastical over-the-top melodramatic drama that should never have happened.<br /><br />A reissue of the documentary would have been much better than this glossy fantasy that never happened<br /><br />P.S.
