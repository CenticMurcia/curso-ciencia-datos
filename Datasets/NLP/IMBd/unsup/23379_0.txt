When I first heard about this movie, I really had no expectations. I thought it would be just another one of those films that would come and go without leaving any impression. Finally, after hours of coaxing from my sister, I finally went to see the movie. And I was surprised to find that this was one of the most wonderful films I've seen in a long time.<br /><br />The one word that I can think of to describe this film is "Korean". And I don't mean that this film is like other Korean films. I mean that the whole film shows very beautifully a picture of Korean culture. You can experience Korea's culture, Korea's beauty, Korea's people, and Korea's sad past. After watching this movie, I am sure that you could get a clear idea what Korea itself is like.<br /><br />This movie really is a spectacular film. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry. It will leave you awed when you leave the theater. A highly recommended film. I give it a 10 out of 10.
