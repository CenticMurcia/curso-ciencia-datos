First lets start with stating this is NOT real - it is a TV movie with Actors based on what was meant to of happened that night , go into the film with that in mind & you'll enjoy a little more.Weather or not you believe the story of the Lake Country Abduction should really be put aside to watch this - some parts are quiet scary & it does make a good horror movie for a late Friday night.The Acting is really mixed - some good , some great ! others very bad - lol.There are a lot of parts of the movie that are stupid (like most horror movies) , such as Tommy getting EVERY important scene on the camera no matter if his holding it or just sits it down wherever .. and there's always that question of why the aliens toyed with them for so long ? but in the end i did enjoy it & say anyone going into it with a open mind may so as well.<br /><br />lol - be kind , this is my first review.
