Give Sex and the City a B-movie treatment and this is what you get. The story is in place and the characters are in place, but it is just put together in a very over-the-top, run-of-the-mill way that is hardly as classy as Sex and the City ("SatC" from now on). And no, making the characters wear designer clothes does not count as classy! I would understand that the people making this would have wanted to stay away from giving it the same treatment as SatC, but in an effort to do so ended up making it bland, pretentious and preposterous. And to be honest, having some candid sex scenes in it would have made it more honest! For me, what soured it was the fact that i could predict what was going to happen and instead of being immersed in the story, i found myself recognizing every camera trick and cut that was used in the filming! There are so many points here that could have been explored in better and/or subtle ways...Joe the billionaire deserved to be toned down for the sake of realism, for one! When, after watching an episode, you find yourself discussing what could have been instead of discussing what just happened, you know what the fate of the show is going to be, and that's what happened!<br /><br />P.S.: This review is based on Season one only. Never bothered myself with season-2.
