Apparenlty this is suppose to be a horror/triller movie. Laughed so hard, one of the worst movies I have seen in a while. Acting is awful. Filming is terrible. Special effects, if that is what they are suppose to be, are as good as any you can create at home yourself. Used a 'known' name to attract people. There are actually other recognizable people in this movie, I am not sure why they agreed to be in this. The most money was spent on the cover/poster for this movie. I felt tricked into renting it, the DVD case made it appear to not be as bad as it was, I guess the saying of 'Don't Judge a Book by It's Cover' applies here.Worth watching, just so you can see how bad it really is.
