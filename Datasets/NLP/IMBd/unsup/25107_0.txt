I have seen this movie several times. It has a plot of what could have been and like the movie says, "What dreams are made of." At least for me that is what this movie is. I thought the narration was okay. <br /><br />I love the scenery and even though it was not filmed in the USA it could have been. I own horses and ride quite a bit in country similar to this where I live. We even have many waterfalls in the area. Not quite as spectacular as the one in the movie, but..... When I feel the pressures of modern day living closing in on me I can watch this movie and then take off on one of my horses into the wilderness outside my back door and get away from everything except for an occasional, "Silver bird with a long white tail," overhead. When watching the movie I can almost smell the smells and hear the sounds of being in the wilderness. That's when I get the itch to feel my horse moving under me while riding through the thick forest.<br /><br />I liked the, you know it is going to happen, love story and the idea of a Native American tribe surviving all those years without being found.<br /><br />The American Paint horses use in the movie for the "Lost Tribe," were a special touch for me, since I own a Paint horse. Very nice choices of horseflesh! This movie was recommended to me by a Native American friend and I have recommended it to many other friends. Not one of them did not enjoy it. They all thought it was an excellent movie in every way.
