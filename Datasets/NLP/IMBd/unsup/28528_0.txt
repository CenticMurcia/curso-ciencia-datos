My cousin rented this movie when he was staying over one night. This movie is a howler. The acting, budget and fight scenes are bad. My father had a hoot making all of us laugh with his witty observations. Come to think of it, this makes a great party movie. Bad acting, sloppy direction and lame chop socky= Great party movie.<br /><br />Recommended for party viewing. Those brave enough to view it alone will truly be dissapointed.<br /><br />C<br /><br />Another hit or miss, a case of hit or miss... -The Damned
