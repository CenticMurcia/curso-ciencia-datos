Trampas:"I'd tell you something if I'd wanted you to know you long-legged son of a-" The Virginian:(pulls his gun) "When you say that to me,smile!" Trampas:(smiles) "When there's a gun next to my belly, I...I always smile! Ha, ha, ha, ha!" This is one of the most legendary lines in Western movie history as exchanged between Gary Cooper and Walter Huston (Cecil B. DeMille's 1914 version also has a variation of this dialogue in the intertitles). The story of a ranch foreman who has to hang his best friend Steve for stealing cattle under Trampas and the schoolmarm Molly who loves him is still a compelling story to tell for the early talkie era though it might seem old-fashioned today. There is, however, an interesting exchange between the schoolmarm (Mary Brian) and an old pioneer woman (Helen Ware) about violence vs. pacifism that still seems relevant today no matter if you're conservative or liberal. Cooper is a natural in his talkie debut as is director Victor Fleming with live outdoor filming. Walter Huston is great as the villainous Trampas. There are some interesting musical interludes at the beginning and interesting dialogue between Cooper and Brian about Romeo and Juliet. There's also the amusingly gravelly voiced Eugene Palette as Honey, one of Cooper's friends. If you're a fan of early talkie westerns, by all means seek this one out!
