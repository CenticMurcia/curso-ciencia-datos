I enjoyed PRINCE AND ME 1 so much more than the second one. The new actress that took over Julia Stiles' part did such a horrible job! She looked like she would fit the roles of some evil scheming step-sister or step-mother. I actually felt bad for Luke Mably since he's such a hottie. There was no chemistry between them. There were so many parts of the movie that was just so laughable because of it's poor acting skills from some of the characters. And certain scenes were incredibly stupid that it actually makes you ask yourself... "did they really just do that?" I feel sorry for the writer...i think she was high when she wrote it. SAVE YOUR MONEY...DON'T RENT THIS MOVIE...rent the first one!
