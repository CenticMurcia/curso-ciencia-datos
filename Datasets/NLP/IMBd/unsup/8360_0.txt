This movie was a favorite of mine as a kid as it had me laughing the entire time. It also was actually a good whodunit movie even though that was exactly what this movie was trying to spoof to a certain degree. The story has to private eyes played by Knots and Conway investigating what appears to be a murder. As they go through the case more people are murdered with a very badly done poem with each death. The house they are in is neat to as it has many secret doors and passage ways in it. Though through it all Knots and Conway shine the brightest as they try to make heads or tails of the investigation interrogating everyone in the house at the time of the death and so on. Yes, interrogating deaf people, people with no tongues and a whole lot of others that are a bit off and such. All the while Conway's character talking about the sinister wookilar monster, a creature with a pig head. There are also multiple attempts to use pigeons to send word back to the yard. Yes, this movie was funny and the best movie Conway and Knots were in together.
