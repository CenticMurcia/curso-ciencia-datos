Who can you really trust? Your husband of many years, or a stranger you have only just met, but upon whom your life depends?<br /><br />Janos and Kata are thrown together during the war forced to pose as husband and wife to hide from the Nazis. As they grow closer, the intensity and suffocating intimacy of their new relationship and the circumstances in which they find themselves, forces them to confront past prejudices and assumptions and challenge what they truly believe.<br /><br />The nature of our trust and faith in others is delicately, yet powerfully explored in this profoundly moving film by István Szabó.<br /><br />
