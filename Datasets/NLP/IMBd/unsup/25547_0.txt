D-Yikes is definitely one of the stronger episodes of season 11, funny, imaginative and intelligent, as always it's hilarious and extremely enjoyable to watch. The episode revolves around Mrs. Garrison, at the beginning she is aggravated that her date blew off, because she was asked if she used to be a man. Later on she becomes friends with Allison, and is invited to her local bar "LesBos", and proceeds to find out "LesBos" is actually a lesbian bar. It is at this point South Park start to mock the film "300". Persians attempt to buy out "lesBos", a reference to the Persians attacking the Spartans. Garrison kicks a Persian in the balls, a reference to when Leonidas kicks a Persian messenger down a hole, and ans many more. The episode is full of "300" style special effects, and is still remains hilarious. The dialogue is funny, written very well and just a well rounded good episode in my opinion.<br /><br />I give it 8/10
