Chad Everet and Dirk Benedict as military officers denying the existence of UFO's. Parker Stevenson as the abductee whose life has been turned up side down. I know..I know..I know. But hold on this one is different.Parker Stevenson gives a sensitive, endearing performance when he first encounters the alien that the military have captured. It's reminiscent of "ET" but without the happy ending. It is not geared for small children.
