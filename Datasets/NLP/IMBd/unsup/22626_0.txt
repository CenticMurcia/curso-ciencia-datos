Musically this is the definitive version. All leads demonstrate outstanding vocal technique and dramatic showmanship. It is some of Goulet's finest singing, Falk plays the perfect shallow friend, and Howe,the comic female, and the townsfolk tenor are fantastic.They convey all the romance of the musical, sadly lacking in the Gene Kelly version,(hampered by weak vocal performances and eccentric character portrayal, sorry Gene & Van). Although the production values were that of television tape at that time, the performances are so strong that a vivid memory remains.I hope that a tape of this performance will surface someday so that the full intent of the production can be shared. Until then there is only the LP.
