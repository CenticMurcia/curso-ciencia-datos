A mentally unstable pilot kills another pilot & takes over his mission. He travels to a remote hydroponic station on one of Saturn's moons, Triton, where he builds a robot that is connected to his brain by radio. The robot is polluted by his unstable mind & threatens the couple who maintain the station.<br /><br />Saturn 3 was conceived & originally to be directed by John Barry, who did production design on "A Clockwork Orange", "Star Wars" & "Superman". Barry pulled out after a few days shooting due to creative differences. Stanley Donen, known for his musicals, took over. What you get is a film that tries so hard to emulate Alien but fails on every front. The script ends up an allegory to the Garden of Eden. The sets are not practical, looking like some of Donen's musicals. The acting varies, with Farrah Fawcett clearly not a good actress, although Kirk Douglas & Harvey Keitel are not too bad. The visual effects also vary, from the good (the robot looks menacing), the average (the spaceship sets) to the bad (the rocks in Saturn's rings look like they're in a pond). The ending is a bit of a downer.<br /><br />Grade: D Review by M. K. Geist.
