I think when movies are rated, their intended purpose should be taken into consideration. "The Cannonball Run" was never intended to be an award winner or a highly artistic movie and thus should not be rated against such movies. What it sets out to do - just be a cross-country riot - it does beautifully! The movie has an amazing cast, and just about every interaction leaves me in stitches! And to the poster who commented on the censored versions - I totally agree. The movie loses its edge with the mild profanity cut out. When I tried to get this movie on VHS, I only found the edited version. However, the DVD I bought is the original movie. Just FYI, the original IS PG. The profanity level is not high enough to be rated R. The other version, which for some reason was the only one I could find on VHS, was a made for TV movie, so even the mild profanity was cut.
