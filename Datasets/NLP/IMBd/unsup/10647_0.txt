Possibly a classic, Francis Coppola's R rated 'One from the heart' has a very simple plot line set in neon lit Las Vegas in which a man and woman are tired of each other after living together for five years, they split apart for a night, then somehow or other they get back together. What is exceptional about the film is the cinematography, the spectacular lighting, seamless no transition scenes without cuts, the integral sound track by Tom Waits and Crystal Gayle, and a stunning Nastassia Kinski in an over-sized martini glass. With the use of such vivid color by cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, it is highly reminiscent of Fassbinder's 1981 'Lola' in which green and blue lighting come off skin and works quite well. Recently released on a spectacular two DVD set that was remastered by Coppola, the high quality transfer, supervised by Storaro, from Zoetrope via Fantoma works quite well on the normal sized TV screen and looks even better than it did in its short time release around the country in late 2003 and January 2004. 'One from the heart' is an unusual romantic musical with dance sequences supervised by Gene Kelly, with the only singing done by a cast member is Nastassia's 'Little Boy Blue.' The DVD is exceptionally visual with running film commentary by Coppola plus many other bonus features.
