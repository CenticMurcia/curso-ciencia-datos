I've watched a whole lot of movies in my life. I'm pretty sure "The Dream Catcher" is the best one I've ever seen.<br /><br />It's the perfect road movie. It's the perfect lost boys movie. It's the perfect American movie.<br /><br />It's stuck with me more than any other film. The characters seem more real to me than some people I've actually met. The photography is outstanding, and unlike a typical Hollywood film chock full of grand vistas and long helicopter aerial shots and so on, this shows the real America as we'd see it, from eastern railyards to the empty expanse of the Bonneville Salt Flats.<br /><br />If you're reading this, please do yourself a favor and see this movie.
