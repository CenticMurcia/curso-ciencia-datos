While the very first adventure in the Final Fantasy universe is far from the best of the games, it does manage to be a fine addition to the lineup and is far from the worst. The gameplay is a bit simple and the graphics by today's standards are horrid, but what can you expect from an 8 bit engine? The elements that fans have come to expect from an FF game are all here to be seen, although they are in an infancy stage since this is the first game. Still, fans can expect monsters, knights and heroes, and villains trying to destroy the world. As with the early games in the series, characters are not named, that task is left up to the gamer, and only a basic storyline is given. While this makes for a less than satisfying story experience, there is some signs of things to come. Worth a play for nostalgia's sake.
