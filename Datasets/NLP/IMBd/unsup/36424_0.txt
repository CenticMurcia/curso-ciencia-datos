We all know the story already. For some reason, God thinks that the French should be spared the oppressive force of the English (why God 'mysteriously' gives up the French to the Germans countless times in later years is another question all together). Joan is appears to lead them to victory. Besson, who has created a number of memorable films, tries to spin a great epic in the manner of 'Braveheart'... but it's hit-and-miss. I was hugely disappointed.<br /><br />Milla Jovovich, who was very good in "The 5th Element", is practically unbearable here. She should probably win an overacting award. And her strained voice sounds like a teenage boy just entering puberty... very grating. I can't imagine anyone following the real Joan if she had the same personality and demeanor of Milla. They'd get too tired of her whiny, holier-than-thou attitude.<br /><br />'The Messenger' would make a decent rental, but not a purchase.
