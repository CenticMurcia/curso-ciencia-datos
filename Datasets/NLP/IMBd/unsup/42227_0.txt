This could easily be the worst film ever made. I had to force myself to watch half of it and even then I truly felt like killing myself. I have never encountered any such film in my life and hope to never again.<br /><br />Not one part of this film was positive. The story was terrible, the acting was beyond terrible (You are likely to see the worst actress of all time in this film). I think its also safe to say that Mort Ransen should not be acting. Some of his earlier directorial projects were good, but what possessed him to make this film is beyond me.<br /><br />What is even more shocking is that film industry funds, including from TeleFIlm Canada was invested into this horror of a film.<br /><br />So if you really feel like convincing yourself to commit suicide then watch, or at least attempt to, watch this movie. If you do not enjoy torturing yourself then stay far far far away from this garbage, for the love of everything that holy.
