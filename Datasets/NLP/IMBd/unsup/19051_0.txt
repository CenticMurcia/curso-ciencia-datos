Even after 15 years, this movie is still pretty much amazing, even though it's surely not as half as shocking as it was before. The story is fickle. You have one perfect family, on top of which a Stepford mom resides, like a queen bee. She hates swearing, bugs, and don't even think of chewing a piece of gum in her kitchen; if there's one thing she hates the most, is somebody messing with her family. She's perfect: she's the Brie Van Der Kamp of the 90s. And one might think, that she takes her parental duties a little bit too seriously. Is she? The basic core of the movie is for a viewer to confess: didn't you ever want to kill your neighbor? Of course, one might say, but I'd never do it. Didn't you ever want to kill that bitch from across the street? She's never been nice. Of course, but I'd never do it. The victims of Beverly Suthpin aren't nice people: they're fake, they're nasty, they're everything that's wrong with the world. In some people's eyes, they should be eliminated. And that's where the true genius of the movie emerges: the silly comedy has an actual moral discussion going on under the layers of ridiculous rage and gore. Waters is a genius: he knows exactly how to play with all of the ingredients of his movies. He places words in right situations as it was a breeze; he puts some black humor when it gets too serious and just a little bit of scare and creepiness when it gets too kitschy. He's always one step ahead of the viewer: he knows his stuff. Or maybe he doesn't care and just goes with his guts? Either way,
