Basically, It was like a pretty good movie with a really bad ending. The problem with the main event is that there is a tradition with Wrestlemania where the good guys win in the end. Why they had to change it for this one, I have no idea. This was the perfect chance to give Mick Foley the send-off he deserved. He could've retired as WWF champion. But what happened? Triple H wins the match with a screw job finish. The match itself had some good points, like the final teaming of the Rock and Sock Connection. Aside from that, the Main sucked!<br /><br />The undercard went from decent to classic. I am primarily referring to the first three-way tag ladder match between the Dudley's, Edge and Christian, and The Hardy's. Spectacular.<br /><br />You can also throw in the triple threat, double title match featuring Benoit, Jericho, and Angle. It was great to see Benoit and Jericho as champions by the end of that match. And yes, I know Benoit was a heel in that one, but Vince was an idiot to make him one in the first place.<br /><br />Of course, Vince being an idiot might explain the crappy ratings they've had over the past year or so.
