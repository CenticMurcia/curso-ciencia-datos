Well, I felt watching this movie that it is sometimes very pathetic and in the same way very Catholic or 'fundamentalistic' in any sense of believing. However, it was interesting to watch for me until Marcos kills his real love. This scene wasn't real for me at all and I couldn't understand this scene except for throwing in Catholic believes. However, the movie tries to be 'shocking' by it's explicit sex scenes - which are just one thing: REAL. I would summarize this movie as 'One guy fells in love with the one he took care since she was a baby and is lost in his daily live'. This means he doesn't have so many emotions for his family any more and his love for the 'strange women' becomes stronger and stronger and he adores her. At th end, he knows he did something or many things wrong and kills himself by going on a pilgrimage. It's worth to watch you, because it let's you dive into a unique and different world. At the end, it didn't tell me very much about life but it gives you a different angle of view.
