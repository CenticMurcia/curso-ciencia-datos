There isn't an independent film from this century or last which looks nearly as good, both in context and as far as production values are concerned. An utterly remarkable achievement, not only by von Manahan's budget's standards, but also by any American filmmaker's.<br /><br />The other technical factor that floored me nearly has often as the settings was the score. Creative and rightfully epic, yet familiar, prompting a sense of nostalgia rarely obtained by indy films.<br /><br />Haunting you for days will be the film's memorably inspired characters. They are as unique and as vibrant as the coloring book-esquire intertitles, both of which are littered with nuggets of wisdom usually reserved for that of parables.<br /><br />At the heart of the plot, there's an insightful and ingenious tale of a Peter Pan who's left Neverland, only to return and discover maybe he wasn't the hero everyone thought he could, would, and or should have been all along.<br /><br />While serious at times, the Book of Caleb is never quite melancholy or morose, and the more moving moments are often offset by sight gags and physical humor more akin to the comprehensive attitude of the story. This provides for a brilliant balance of laughs and introspection in an inventive and incredibly well paced film going experience.
