Animated children's movies should really stick to real fairy tales rather than manufacturing them out of grim novels and grimmer history. Making a fairy tale out of one of the grimmest of twentieth century events and completely destroy any resemblance to well documented history is a crime against history, its victims and the children it grossly misinforms. Rasputin was not a supernatural evil wizard/demon. He was killed before the revolution. He had no part in the murder/assassination of the Romanov's or Anastasia's fate. Where is the Leninist terror? Where is the truth about what happened to Anastasia's family, even if even now no one can be completely sure about Anastasia herself? This movie is being made in an era when the Anastasia/Anna Andersen hoax on which the Bergman movie was based has been exposed via genetic testing. There is no excuse for cluttering children's minds with such nonsense given the cruel brutal facts of history.<br /><br />This is not a classic fairy tale, nor a bible epic, it is just a really contemptible idea for an entertainment vehicle. There is also no reason it could not be translated to a fiction time and place without connection to actual events and then be a successful movie without the baggage.<br /><br />What's next?<br /><br />The happy holocaust survivor a la "Life is Beautiful" complete with singing, dancing camp inmates, and humorous bumbling guards? And perhaps big smiling ovens!<br /><br />How about the adventures of a sweet young thing with a big princess attitude that barely got out of the World Trade Center with her hunky young hero just before a giant flying demon Bin Laden reduces the buildings to rubble with blast of his powerful satanic breath?<br /><br />Rating of 2 is for the unquestionably good looking product and the work of the voice actors that was wasted on it, leaving some room at the bottom for totally unredeemable works.<br /><br />The movies should stick to established fairy tales, and leave making up modern ones to politicians and their spin doctors, for example: We come as liberators, that's why we are building a dozen or two permanent bases in your country!
