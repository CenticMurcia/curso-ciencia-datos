I rented this film, knowing nothing about it. I knew Patricia Clarkson from other indie films and she has always delivered a fine performance. The plot promised an eerie ride so I was game for the ride. Although the story became an often told tale I was extremely taken aback by how originally it was being told. Most importantly, I was thoroughly engaged by Agnes Bruckner's performance---her beautiful face entranced the camera as it did me---she made the movie. Despite this story having been told in many different ways over the decades, if you love macabre films, I wholly recommend this film because of the inventive direction and the sensitive performance of Ms Bruchner.<br /><br />Nuff said, Dean Merriman, former film maker and editor.
