The plot twist in this movie is almost as well executed as the one in the Crying Game. The characters are gradually developed through intricate dialogue, leading up to the moment of truth for our protagonist. I especially like the way the director juxtaposes the innate goodness of the main character with the cold and inherently evil society in which he lives. This is given new meaning at the critical plot point which I described above. The Gibson-esque qualities of the setting are absolutely chilling. Anyone who claims to be a sci-fi fan must see this movie.
