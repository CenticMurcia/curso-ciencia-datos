The idea of a little girl wanting to bring her mother back to life made me thought the plot and movie was going to be kind of cheesy. I was wrong. It was sad because of Casey's mother, but it made a great story of friendship. The first time I ever even heard of the movie (and saw it) was on Disney Channel. I wish it could be sold so other people can see it even if they weren't Disney Channel fans. I also did not recognize Tyra Banksat at first. She has been the host of reality shows(such as American's Next Top Model) made her own show, (the Tyra Show) made a music video, (shake your body) and now acting? Talk about talent.
