I may have heard of the two star rappers focused in this film, but I can't be sure. Anyway, this documentary by Nick Broomfield focuses on (for a while) friend rappers Tupac Shakur, murdered in 1997, and Biggie Smalls (Christopher Wallace, the Notorious B.I.G.), murdered in 1996. Both murders could have been connected by a shop called Death Row Records, as they were both involved with them. Or it could have been something to do with a rivalry that started after many death threats between the two stars. Nick Broomfield found some footage of the two stars past, but there is still the questions of who really committed the two murders, and were they connected? I actually went to LA where one of them was a murdered. Adequate!
