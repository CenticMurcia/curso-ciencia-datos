When the movie's trailer released in TV,I thought it will be cool. After watching it,I felt huge disappointing. <br /><br />"Ming Ming is a 21st Century martial arts princess and lady Robin Hood who steals for love. Her Prince Charming is D, a maverick fighter and irresistible rogue who posted this challenge to his swarms of female admirers - give him 5 million dollars and he'll run away with his benefactress to Harbin. Ming Ming meets D's another girlfriend Nana, who is a virtual look-alike of Ming Ming. Meanwhile, disappears from Shanghai without a trace. The only clue he leaves behind is a cryptic phone message."<br /><br />The summary looks pretty,but the movie is horrible.Susie Au's debut copied her Music Video's cosmo & fashion,and this is the solo spot in the movie.If she wants to continue her career as a movie director.Au should go back to school to learn how to tell a story.Otherwise,the weaken and awful screenplay such as "Mingming" will destroy her future. Zhou looks cool when she as Mingming.But her acting is limited in this movie,which is awful & boring.From 2003,Zhou's acting is narrow and powerless,for example,Baby in Love,Beauty Remain & A West Lake Moment.
