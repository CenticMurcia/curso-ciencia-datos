Mendy brought me in contact with a culture I knew very little about in a very modern way. Instead of following the typical introduction of a people through their rituals, the film actually deconstructs this culture via its main character. This unusual journey of a Hassidic Jew on the path of Western hedonism not only brings to light the sectarianism of such drastic religions, it also point the finger at the lack of spirituality (not religiosity) in the United States. By clashing these two worlds, Mr. Vardy has discovered what we could expect to be a controversial explosion. But far from simply contenting himself with the shock factor, the director finds the root of beautiful emotions, sincerity, loneliness, and therefore serves to us a palette of characters so sincere and touching that one cannot help but be carried into the story. Ivan Sandomire's acting is surprisingly dead-on for a newcomer and not once did I question the sincerity of his actions. Adam Vardy has tackled a difficult subject matter with tact and the result is worthy of the best festivals.
