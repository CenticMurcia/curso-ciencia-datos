(aka: Cannibal Apocalypse)<br /><br />Finally an uncut version instead of the bastardized VHS tape that Vestron put out so many years ago. The censors took this film WAY too seriously in order to give it an R raring.<br /><br />This film is so laughingly bad that it's hilarious. Breasts get bit off, tongues get bit off in such a funny, cheesy way that I couldn't contain myself. And I don't think that's what Margheriti expected, so I was wondering if he experienced the same kind of reaction from the audience when he first screened this film back in 1980. Now that WOULD be interesting.<br /><br />At least this is nowhere near as vulgar and gross as the garbage Unberto Lenzi and Ruggero Deodatro filmed in the Amazon(?) because CANNIBAL APOCALYPSE comes across in so campy and implausible that it defies any kind of belief in reality, whatsoever.<br /><br />Plus, the DVD also has plenty of interview extras and film clips that wind up almost being as long as the film itself. Never seen a DVD that had that much extra playing time before, so be prepared.<br /><br />The plot consists of Vietnam vets coming back from the war carrying a virus that turns whoever they bite into a cannibal. Pretty soon, half of Atlanta is eating each other. (laughing)<br /><br />Well almost...<br /><br />I'll give it a 4 out of 10 for inspiring a few laughs
