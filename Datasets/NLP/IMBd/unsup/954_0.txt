Shooting Fish is hilarious with two great male leads and a charming female lead as well. The clever and witty writing is wonderful to the very last drop. The many adventures of Jez and Dylan bring many laughs especially the LofTeck experience. I recommend this to anyone in the mood for a good chuckle.
