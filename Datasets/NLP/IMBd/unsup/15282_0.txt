This was bad. Really bad. Extremely bad. Let's start with the most important element of any movie: the plot. Or actually, the lack of any. If anyone sees the plot, please return it to the filmmakers. Questions... questions... where are the answers? Isn't a movie supposed to give at least one answer? Ah wel... The SFX. Now those were quite good, for a B-movie. Don't really have to complain about those (except perhaps the use, which they don't have) The actors. This movie was poorly acted, the characters stayed as flat as can be. But hey, there was no room for character development, they had to move the 'story' along! The overall feel. If you watch the first three minutes and feel like pushing the 'stop'-button, do it. You won't regret it.<br /><br />So, my conclusion: a one-way ticket to the trashbin for Ice Planet.
