This was an incredibly ambitious sci-fi series produced in the UK for international distribution. It was extremely expensive for its day and unfortunately, the series never took off due to a Luke-warm reception. Some of this can be blamed on the series itself--the show had a very sterile look and action was something it was usually lacking. While Martin Landau and Barbara Bain were fine actors, the parts and script were amazingly low-key for the genre. Additionally, had it appeared a few years later, after the sci-fi craze began following STAR WARS, it probably would have fared better.<br /><br />Another problem is that although I enjoyed the show, there were huge changes (mostly unwelcome) in the second season. Because the show was struggling in the ratings, huge cast changes were made. The most notable ones were the loss of the wonderful doctor (played by Barry Morse) and the introduction of a shape-shifting alien (Maya) who seemed rather inappropriate to the style of the show. The intention was to pump some life into it, but devotees of the series like myself were not particularly pleased).<br /><br />Overall, there were some amazing episodes (such as the one about the Queller Drive) and some bombs. It's a shame, really, as the show deserved to do better than it did.
