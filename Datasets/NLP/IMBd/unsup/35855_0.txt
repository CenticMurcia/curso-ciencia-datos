I really liked the first movie. I thought it was an entertaining film with a decent cast, sharp action scenes and special effects, and the movie paid respectful attention to its source material.<br /><br />MK Annihilation is anything but a good film. <br /><br />It comes off like a bad Power Rangers episode, with most of the original actors gone, goofy camera angles and zoom shots, no story and pathetic special effects. "Animality"? Please. I've seen better stuff out of old "Gamera" movies. This movie introduced almost every character from Mortal Kombat Trilogy only to kill them off five seconds after their debut. What's the point of that other than to say that "this character" was in the movie? All it accomplished was bogging down what little plot there is. The story itself (based off MK3 and MK4), was shaky, the techno music was nowhere near as good as the first film, and the whole movie seemed uneven and a waste of film. It lacked the feel of a movie, and earned the second 1997 award of a "film that I almost walked out of in the first fifteen minutes."<br /><br />I've talked to more than a fair share of people who have said this movie is "wonderful". Of course, all of these people were die-hard MK fans who feel that anything with the famous dragon logo can do no wrong.<br /><br />Want a Mortal Kombat movie to watch? Watch the first film. At least that one is a fun movie to sit through and enjoy. Too bad MK:A didn't live up to the first one. The line "Pretty cool, huh? That's my Animality" made me absolutely groan in agony that I actually spent money to see this. Avoid this movie.
