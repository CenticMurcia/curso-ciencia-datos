This movie is one of only two movies that I walked out of the theater before it was over (the other being cobra, another Stallone flick go figure). The story was bad the acting horrible I think they even burned the popcorn the night I went to see it. Anyone that liked this movie must have absolutely no taste when it comes to movies
