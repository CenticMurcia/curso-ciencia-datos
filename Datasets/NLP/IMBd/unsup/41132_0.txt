Nicktoons were an artistic medium in a way. They original, funny, and the first for-kids cartoons on a for-kids network on the air. Rugrats was a childhood favorite. Ren and Stimpy, while vulgar and gross, was one of the most original ideas on the air. Hey Arnold! and Doug were simplistic and had morals. This was a golden age of television. But in the late 90's, with Ren and Stimpy, Rocko's Modern Life, and other original Nicktoons off the air, Nick ran out of ideas. <br /><br />This is where Spongebob came in. It was about a squeaky-voiced stupid character who should have been locked up in the looney bin along with his friend. Ren and Stimpy much? At first it was okay, but it just seemed too bland. The Dennis the Mennis relationship with Squidward wasn't funny, the ever greedy Mr. Krabs was like Big Bob from Hey Arnold, and it was trying to be random but never got it right (T.V. has never been able to do that). Patrick was thrown in for comic relief, as a stupid stupid character, like Stimpy. Nick jumped off a cliff, with spikes at the bottom, a rope around it's neck, and a award for "Most likely to repeat mistakes." And it did. With bad, unoriginal, stereotypical cartoons. Good-bye quality television. I never forget you.
