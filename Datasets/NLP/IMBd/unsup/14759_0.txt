why anyone would give this movie anything more than a 1 rating is beyond me.<br /><br />It is filled to the brim with clich√©s, terrible acting, a bad script, and just badness. C'mon, a hooker with a heart of gold? Again?!?! I watched this with my family when I was 12, because we lived in a town with one theater that showed one movie, and only on the weekends. We would go every week, no matter what was showing. We agreed unanimously that this was the worst piece of drivel that has ever been created. We still pretty much stand by that judgment.<br /><br />I won't go so far as saying that this movie was created by Satan, but it has such a concentration of raw evil and bile underneath it's lily white veneer, that I wouldn't be surprised if Lucifer's hoof marks weren't all over this one.<br /><br />Shame on anyone who gives this movie a 3 or better.
