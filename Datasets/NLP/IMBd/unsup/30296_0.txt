One of my personal faves from the early 80`s.This insane tale of teen rebellion and television abuse features an intensely wild and animated performance from Robin Johnson as the juvenile delinquent come rock star Nicky Marauda,and some wickedly understated(for a change)camp from Tim Curry as the enigmatic yet highly opportunistic D.J.Features some great new wave music from XTC,The Ramones,Gary Numan and others set against the backdrop of NYC`s seedier side.Great fun.
