"Happy Gilmore" is one of those movies that you end up watching many times in your life. Someone will always own it, have rented it, or brought it along in some situation in your life. That's because this movie is just plain funny. Adam Sandler plays what he plays best, a guy whom seems like a jerk, but ends up being really sweet. Sandler plays Happy Gilmore, a low-luck hockey player with no skill, but an incredible slapshot. His parents are both dead and the person he goes to for advice or comfort is his grandma. She, however, hasn't paid her taxes in years, and gets her house repossessed by the bank. Happy stumbles on golfing, and finds that he has an extraordinary talent for driving the ball incredibly far. To get money, he joins the PGA tour. His lead rival, Shooter McGavin, buys Happy's grandma's home to make him quit, but they drive a bargain. If Happy can win the PGA tour, the house is his again. The results are hilarious. This movie is an Adam Sandler must-see, right up there with "Billy Madison".
