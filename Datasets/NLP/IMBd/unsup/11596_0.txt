A wild and hardball comic adventure that stars Robert De Niro as Jack Walsh, a sarcastic bounty hunter who is sent to the Big Apple to bring back Jonathon "The Duke" Mardukas (Charles Grodin), an accountant (who jumped bail) back to L.A. in four days. Walsh's boss, Eddie Moscone (Joe Pantilano) defines it as a "Midnight Run". Get it?<br /><br />The only thing that Walsh doesn't suspect that's Mardukas' former boss, Jimmy Serrano (Dennis Farina), a hot-tempered Las Vegas mobster, has ordered the hit on "The Duke" for donating a large amount of Serrano's money to charity. Besides dealing with the Mob, the two men must dodge the feds and Alonzo Mosley (Yaphet Kotto), an FBI agent who's determined to get back at Walsh for snatching his badge and Marvin Dorfler (John Ashton), a fellow bounty hunter who tries to get Mardukas for less money.<br /><br />What makes the movie work so well? Director Martin Brest ("Beverly Hills Cop", "Scent of a Woman") and screenwriter George Gallo let the film go at a steady pace and in the scenes where De Niro and Grodin aren't being chased or shot at. Mardukas tries now and then to get Walsh to open up and tell him about his past. One perfect example of that is when Jack and Jon go visit the home of where Jack's ex-wife and daughter live.<br /><br />The performances here in this film are nothing short of excellent and shows how great of a director that Brest himself is.
