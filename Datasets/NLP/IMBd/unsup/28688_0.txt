As Good as it Gets was really a funny romantic comedy just like I expected. The movie focuses around the character of Melvin (Jack Nicholson) a superstitous, bigot, and writer. He then meets a waitress (Helen Hunt) and his gay neighbor (Greg Kinnear) and they all form a friendship with each other. As Good as it Gets got me hooked from the start. I like Jack Nicholson and Greg Kinnear. The two are paired with Helen Hunt and what comes out is a great, romantic comedy. There are some parts that are draggy but everything else is just great.<br /><br />9/10
