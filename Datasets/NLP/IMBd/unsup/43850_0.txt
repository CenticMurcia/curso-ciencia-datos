The lead characters are just plain stupid to the point that the plot is totally unbelievable. Almost every scene reeks of morbid stupidity making suspension of disbelief impossible except to wonder how bad can it be right to the end of this abysmal quagmire. I agree with anyone who hated this movie. Anyone who claims to like this movie must own shares in or be a shill for the production company. If not, please have your head examined, immediately. The character Duke is an absolute puke in this film. The actor who portrays him gives a Rassie worthy performance. I kept waiting for him to show something to no avail. I couldn't bear to watch this stupidity right through to the end. I had to switch to another movie and switched back to see if this disastrous entity had any hope of redeeming itself in the end. It didn't. Dumb and Dumber make this the Dumbest movie I have ever seen and the least worthy of watching, ever.
