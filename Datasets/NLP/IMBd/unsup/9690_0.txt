I have read the book a year & a half ago, was fascinated by it, but as it goes had some very high expectation about the movie.<br /><br />The cast off course was logical although some names that were nominated to take part declined, at my great astonishment the movie was simply awesome.<br /><br />All characters were obviously very well written as a script , the actors ,all of them gave an outstanding performance, Adel Imam , radiant , witty & funny as ever;Nour el Sheriff made a come back..... it's been a while since I've seen him perform so well on the silver screen; Hend Sabry was lovely; Yousra just Radiant; Esaad Younes more than superb; Ahmed Bedier Wow.... he had the Egyptian Coptic genera nailed to the T; Ahmed Rateb as usual a gr8 performance although the part was too small for such a talent;Khaled Saleh a monster of acting A+ ; Soumaya el khashab a small role but with a lot of soul put into it.<br /><br />The bomb or should I say bombs are Mohamed Imam a very impressive performance for a 1st timer, I was amazed by the authenticity he played his role; the 2nd is Khaled el Sawy in the role of Hatem the GAY ,I see a new star is born.<br /><br />The biggest Bomb of all is (young) Marawan Hamed, if I did not know for a fact that he only had a couple of 'court met rage' I would have thought he was a veteran movie director.<br /><br />In all the movie is a gr8 & a worthy addition to the Egyptian movie Industry.<br /><br />I think in all fairness that this movie should go to the Osracs.
