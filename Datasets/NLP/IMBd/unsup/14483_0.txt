This is one of the WORST movies I have seen in years! The acting was AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL and the story was BAD. There was no chemistry between the characters at all. I didn't see any real dancing until the very end. There was only "marking" or interpretive crap which looked like aerobics throughout the whole movie. I kept wondering if Patrick Swayze and his wife were too old for the stamina real dancing entails so they just "marked" the dances throughout until the very end. I suppose the "one last dance" was to be the big finale at the end but it didn't work. POORLY POORLY written - are you kidding me with this crap?? Left me feeling nothing and showed me that Lisa Neimi has no talent for writing or acting. I would be embarrassed to have my name associated with such a film. Give it up !!
