While the story is bog standard with only one twist, the film is a technical gem. It's shot largely on location (in L.A.) and using a minimum of additional lighting and ambient sound.<br /><br />Cast is worthy of note -- a lot of future stars here. Not only Sterling Hayden in the title role, but a very young Charlie Bronson. Also Timothy Carey is a wonderful hood (he steals every scene he's in!). Great cinematography -- it's a joy to watch.<br /><br />The DVD I laid my hands on includes commentary from James Ellroy. Worth listening to (and so few of these things are!). Ellroy is a character and he talks a length about the genre and how this film influenced his work on things like L.A. Confidential. <br /><br />My version was also bundled with Decoy (which is actually referenced in the commentary to Crime Wave). Decoy is also a gem. A bizarre gem.
