I awoke in the middle of the night after watching this movie, and couldn't fall back to sleep as I couldn't take quit thinking about the issues discussed.<br /><br />Never before have I been afraid that I am too young, and might live to experience the crisis outlined in this film.<br /><br />It almost makes "An Inconvenient Truth" seem like a Disney movie, as there are zero aspects of our life today that will be untouched by the impact of the disappearance of the worlds oil supply. <br /><br />This is as a must see film, that needs to have the same level of awareness and concern that has been generated by global warming. The impact to the world, and specifically our nation, appears worse than global warming as we will be challenged to transport food to segments of the population far away from rural farms. It seems that our total economy will revert to an agricultural base rather than industrial and technological.
