I don't watch much bollywood movies, only a select few which my friends tell me are very good. This one was getting very good reviews and people said it was funny so I thought I'll see it. The comedy part essentially lasts for the first half an hour or 45 minutes of the movie and is okay, not anything new or hilarious, after that, it's all the same old typical bollywood story with emotions and sad sobs thrown in. The acting is good in the comedy scenes where it is needed. But if I get a choice, I wouldn't watch a 2 hour and 20 minute movie just for the thirty minutes of rinse-and-repeat jokes. The opening song with the plethora of actresses is excellent eye candy and Shahrukh Khan is a superstar whether you like it or not and his cameo is exciting. You can easily skip this one if you're not one of those people who just have to watch every low or hi budget movie bollywood churns out.
