I don't know what the first few reviewers were watching, but this program is dreadful. The acting is pathetic, the plot lines are implausible, and the writing is so sophomoric, horny teenage middle school children could put two words together that made more sense. I fully understand that black, gay culture is a mythical creature, not unlike lesbian culture, that needs to be shared and expressed with the homophobic world we live in, but I find it hard to believe that any of these people could ever exist in real life. Mostly due to the fact they are such blatant stereotypes. One's a twink, one's a sex fiend, one's a repressed nerd, and the last is a drag queen waiting to happen.<br /><br />Beyond the hot guys and the deleted "sex" scenes, there is absolutely no reason to watch this show. My partner and I forced ourselves to suffer the first season just to mock the characters. <br /><br />Please, if this is your first foray into gay culture, run away! Fast!
