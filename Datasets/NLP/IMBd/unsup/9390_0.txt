While I'm a large fan of horror and Karloff, this one failed to really hook me. There are some very tense or creepy moments, but they are few and far between, unlike other Karloff works with a feeling of dread throughout. To be fair, I believe this was a production, plot and directorial weakness that's too much for Karloff and others to overcome.
