It is amazing how such an action packed movie can be oh so boring. I have never before felt so restless during a movie, shifting in my chair, looking at my watch, wishing I could fast forward. It felt like three hours. I could not believe the movie was not over when the main character died, he came back to life again to bore us even more.<br /><br />The whole movie didn't make any sense. Who was the bad guy? Why could the girl stop bullets? What was with the father? How is it that her mother was a computer? <br /><br />Just a huge mess of unfinished ideas, characters that no one cares about and badly shot action.
