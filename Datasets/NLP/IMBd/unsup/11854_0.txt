This has to be one of the worst educational films I've ever run across, which of course makes it perfect for Mike and the 'bots.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT We open on a depressing scene, young men engaged in the futile attempt to make sturdy and efficient furniture. The focus of our story is seen sanding or polishing his latest creation ("it's for the Grand Wizard"). He then proceeds to daydream (while obviously polishing or sanding the wood down to nothing) about the professions open to him if he pursues industrial arts (all of which are equally depressing). Over the course of the film, he tries to convince his friend, a taxicab with its doors wide open, about the merits of taking IA. He cites his mentor, the stiff shop teacher, and gets backed up by the coach ("boys...hey, boys!"). In the end, Big Ears grabs our hero in an uncomfortable way, and we are left with the knowledge that Industrial Arts is the path to a dull and pointless existence.<br /><br />In Mike and the 'bots' hands, of course, the film transcends its crappy premise (and thus the ten-star rating). There's at least a half-dozen zingers in their commentary. This is a gem from the shorts legacy.<br /><br />So why study industrial arts? Because one day you might need to keep your house from sliding downhill, or to construct a desk-set for the local Klan leader. Why else?
