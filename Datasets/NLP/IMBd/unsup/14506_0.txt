OK -- i had to hide from my parents to watch this when I was 12 -- and I think it's why I have what my friend calls "RSS" Rock Star Syndrome!! ha! I'm 40, and still love these long haired musicians - geez, what's wrong with me? Actually, NOTHING. This was what I wish our girls these days could hope for.... I still do.... But seriously, these were simpler times, no internet, all that... I would love to go to the mall and see a fabulous guy like that. Always wished it could happen. What's funny is, I'm a librarian, and people will pay literally a fortune for the sequels to "Sooner or Later". Like $50!!! Embarrassingly enough, I probably would too. Well... what a great movie and book. It will always take me back to that time - seriously, felt like a 13 year old again. Yay!!!
