I have seen most of the After-Dark Horror-Fest movies and this one is the worst. It is uneven and really does not flow well. The acting is stale and the story is a little unbelievable.<br /><br />The only reason I give this movie more than one star is because the killer is pretty awesome. If there was more of the killer in the movie, it may have had a better result. There are a few scenes that work and the blood and gore is a plus. But, the movie fails to do anything but play on stereotypes and show the same teenagers do stupid things just to get killed in the end.<br /><br />This movie is pretty bad.
