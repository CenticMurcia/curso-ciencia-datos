I saw this movie this morning by chance on cable and it is absolutely charming.<br /><br />Though this doesn't have the plot twists that Sixth Sense had, it does address some of the same issues, including death and the spirituality of children.<br /><br />Joseph Cross, the kid who plays the main character, is great and so is Rosie O'Donnell as one of the nuns at the school he attends. Also very good is Dan Lauria(he was the Dad on "The Wonder Years) in a small role as one of the priests.<br /><br />All in All, very good movie for kids 9+ and families.<br /><br />Bob C.
