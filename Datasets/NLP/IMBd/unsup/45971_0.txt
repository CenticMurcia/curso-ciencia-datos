I waited hoping this would be a great show. Rarely in my life have less than thirty minutes been so lost to me as they have been tonight. I'm giving this two stars out of respect to Christina Applegate. She was great on Broadway. She made me laugh on Married With Children. She made me laugh on Jesse. I'm hoping it's not her. This show is NOT funny. Not for a second. Not a single laugh giggle chuckle titter. Nothing. I sat amazed. The writers didn't have one funny line. It's not really boring. The cast is attractive but most play basically people I would never know or like under any circumstances. I'm guessing that I'll be the very small minority on my next statement since everyone but me loves this show but the only show I can compare it to is How I Met Your Mother. Again I can sit through that one without even a mild ha ha. I know it's me but while I can't stop laughing at Two and a Half Men or Big Bang Theory these shows just left me not wanting to watch again. I know I will in hopes I'll find a laugh but after tonight I have my doubts. Sitting through six How I Mets was rough going for me but I'll sit through five more Samanthas in hopes I get to actually hear a funny line. I will check back on the reviewers for this show to see what lines they post that they found funny here. Give me a line quote. Please.
