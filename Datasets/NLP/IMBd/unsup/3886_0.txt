Leonard Maltin has this movie perfectly pegged with his 1/2 point rating. Rebecca De Mornay and Fred Thompson are much too good to be associated with a film of this caliber, which did not even come close to being anything comparable to a "Police Academy". Just to even watch the whole film tells you that I certainly did not have anything better to do.
