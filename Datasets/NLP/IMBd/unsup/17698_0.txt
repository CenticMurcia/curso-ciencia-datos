"Metal: A Headbanger's Journey" is an entertaining documentary about Sam Dunn, a Heavy Metal fan trying to find an answer to the question why Metal fans are always outcast by the general public and why Metal itself is often not recognized as a valid form of music. In doing so Dunn categorizes Metal into different subgenres (a process that will always lead to a lot of discussion among fans as proved by the IMDb boards), he tries to find the origins of Metal and divides his survey rather cleverly in chapters like "Religion And Satanism", "Gender And Sexuality" or "Death And Violence".<br /><br />The results are not really ground breaking. If you ever were into Metal, you'll already know most of the facts presented here. What makes the movie worth watching anyway are the comments by some genre-defining and some underground musicians that have been interviewed. Unfortunately, Sam Dunn couldn't get all the important Metal bands, so he has to do without contributions by Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Judas Priest, Metallica, Anthrax, Megadeth or Pantera, which makes "Metal" seem a bit random.<br /><br />Very rarely are we getting substantial insight into the minds of those who listen to Metal or even contribute half their life to it. An explanation like Metal is always there for you come what may just isn't very enlightening. I mean soccer fans will say the same about soccer, right? So, no, this documentary doesn't tell you things you hadn't already known before, but it helps you to relume your passion about Metal. And the interviews are often quite hilarious. Just watch out for Gaahl, a wine-filled glass of Cognac and the mention of Satan... you'll understand what I mean when you see it!
