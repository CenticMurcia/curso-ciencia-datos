Interesting and engaging as far as documentaries go, but maybe that's because I'm interested in the topic. Overall, I thought the message was overly dramatized. Trying to link vinyl chloride monomer, the stuff that's reacted to form PVC, and allegedly poor manufacturing processes from 30 yrs ago to DES, a pharmaceutical that was created specifically to interact with and was prescribed to people was a bit of a stretch. And to try and say that burning PVC is the most dangerous thing about a fire is completely ridiculous. This inability to rank risk is why we spend soooo much time and money focusing on small issues while completely ignoring the big picture. Don't get me wrong, the manufacturing industry, and the chemical industry in particular, had and has issues. But to continue to think that they operate with a 1970s mentality and technology is wrong. We need to recognize the progress that's been made and continue to partner with industry to drive further improvements in safety while acknowledging that the products of chemistry have had a vast influence on making our everyday lives better. And that includes PVC, a versatile, affordable product that's had a positive impact for a whole lot of people.
