Louis Gossett Jr returns as Chappy Sinclair who is this time aided by Sonny Chiba and Co to battle Colombian drug-lords who have kidnapped the brother of rebel fighter (Played by body builder Rachel McGlish) and so the grumpy old men show up to put on a show that proves that these old farts still have what it takes to become one man armies. Okay this is when things got terrible and the main reason is that we are forced to watch over the hill guys save the day. Not fun to watch at all and even Gossett seems bored with the material. Also of disappointment is just how wussed out they make Chiba's character. Back in the 70's Chiba was the most ruthless martial artist ever and now he is reduced to a sobbing soldier who isn't up to par. It is all terrible to watch and really it serves as example as of what killed Gossett's career.<br /><br />* out of 4-(Bad)
