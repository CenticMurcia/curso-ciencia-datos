This movie was very boring. When I was a teenager, I saw it in a theatre. I got up halfway through the movie to get some Raisinets. My leg had fallen asleep and I fell down in the aisle. I remember that vividly but I remember virtually nothing about the movie. Didn't Walter Matthau and Robin Williams stand in some snow at one point?
