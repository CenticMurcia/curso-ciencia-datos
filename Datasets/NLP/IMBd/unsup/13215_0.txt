Not sure what to say. i saw nothing at all good about this movie. Not funny, not interesting, not anything. And the "crash scene" at the end might be the most stupid thing I've ever seen in a movie. It lasts forever, as one car after another drives into the wreck. And each one, even the ones going slow, explode like they have a hydrogen bomb in them. The most fake and worst special effects I've ever seen. And it seems like it's never going to end, not realistic at all. The characters are not interesting at all, it was hard just to stay awake through it. I was thinking it might have some connection to the Cannonball Run movies when I first saw it come on, but it doesn't. Don't waste your time watching this pile of crap.
