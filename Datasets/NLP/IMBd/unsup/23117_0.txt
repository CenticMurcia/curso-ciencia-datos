OK there are plenty of Ghost stories out there. Then again there are plenty of ghosts and stories told in front of a warm fire on a wintery night. I for one liked the pace of the film. Maybe too many people are used to the wham bam thank you mam styles that are so prevalent today. I thought that both stars did a great service to the part. I adored Forests interpretation of the character Hunt that he portrayed, quirky and matter of fact, a nice touch. Gabriels search was well thought out. What would another have done under those circumstances, a life filled with memories and dreams and then to face and even embrace those fears in the search for the truth and to save that little girl. The changing room and the tormented boy. What happens to people who hide the truth. They become trapped in their own lies by being tied to a small town or drowning in drink. So I think this movie is more than a 5 minute scare and more a discussion over dinner about what would happen if you where any of the characters. Fine food fodder. My score kept changing because I thought I had sussed it out and I am glad I didn't, gave me much more to think about. I for one am also happy that Ghost stories are making a comeback, and I would much sooner jump in my chair a few times than cringe or hide my eyes or be disgusted by the graphic slasher films also doing the rounds. Give me a good old fashioned Ghost Story any day
