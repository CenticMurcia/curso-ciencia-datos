I watched this movie as a rental, knowing nothing about it beforehand, and was very pleasantly surprised. This film is far more original than most of what comes out of Hollywood, and was one of the most entertaining films I've seen this year. Like all sci-fi, it does require suspension of disbelief to go along with the idea that one could see/interact with the past (and the technology that makes it possible), but once you've that single premise, Deja Vu is one of the most captivating films to come out in awhile. Most of the haters on this board seem to have gotten too twisted up in the plot turns and time travel to enjoy the film. This is not a movie that you'll want to walk away from for a few minutes without pausing, but if you pay attention through it all, you'll find that the conclusion is just about bulletproof, and you got more than your money's worth at the video store.
