I anticipated the episode following the masterful "Silent Scream" to be a lot weaker, but "Children of the Full Moon" is more than just weak; it's an actual disappointment! This short movie directed by Tom Clegg ("McVicar") is senseless, incredibly predictable and far too implausible to evoke any feelings of fright or disturbance. I love a good old-fashioned tale about werewolves & full moon curses, but Murray Smith's screenplay lacks the bright ideas to become one. The plot centers on a young couple as they're traveling through a remote area when their car suddenly breaks down and nearly crashes. Tom and Sarah seek for help in the only house for miles around, where a friendly old lady and her eight (!) children welcome them with open arms. Tom loses consciousness during a nightly attack by a strange looking monster and wakes up in a hospital bed and Sarah tries to convince him it was all just a bad dream. Still, she's pregnant now and mysterious forces draw her back to the isolated house she claims doesn't exist. The pre-credits intro looked promising, as it showed a little girl with blood on her lips devouring a lamb, but the rest of the story made little to no sense at all. It's obvious that the old lady  Diana Dors  and her partner are breeding an army of junior werewolves, but for what purpose and why implicate strangers in their fiendish plan? The answers to these questions are never given, and the story doesn't even focus on the eight children that much. A horror short about werewolf-children would have been quite original, yet we never see them transform in hairy little monsters with huge fangs or sharp claws. In fact, there's just one transformation-sequence in the whole episode, yet the special effects were laughable and far below usual Hammer standards. Oh well, they can't all be winners I guess
