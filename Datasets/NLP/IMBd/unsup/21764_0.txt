I think this was the first time Mark Mothersbaugh(of Devo) didn't do the music, and it kinda shows, it all sounded like Anderson's ipod left to shuffle (i almost thought this was gonna be a theme of the film, but it was just a passing in-joke), the music highlighted where emotion was happening on screen, but didn't really give me any sense of "what emotions" we were supposed to be experiencing(save for the i-pod scene already mentioned), it all just felt kinda vague like someone left the radio on in the other room. And I'm talking about the pop songs, the Indian music was okay.<br /><br />Though it was enjoyable and I feel like I would watch it again(and have), I just wanted more, and not in the "I hope this never ends" way, but in the "really there's not another half an hour here...or something?" sense of wanting more. The discarded luggage at the films end, though a nice bow at the end of the package, felt sudden, not unresolved, just sudden.<br /><br />Maybe Schwartzman as screen-writer wasn't the best idea, then again Coppla's "CQ" was okay at best, so who knows where it went wrong, and though it could have been worse, and wasn't that bad, it just left me kinda disappointed.<br /><br />Still Wes Anderson at his weakest is still more interesting to watch than many at their best. I can see how people could like this though, some of it feels like "Bottle Rocket", another beloved Anderson film I was't too thrilled with.<br /><br />Hotel Chevelaire kind of makes up for some of the weaker bits, in retrospect. It's just an encapsulation of everything great about Anderson, the music, the shrines, the dialog, the camera-work...and Natalie Portman doesn't hurt too...
