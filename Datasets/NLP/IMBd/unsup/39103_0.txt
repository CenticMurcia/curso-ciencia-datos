Boring one dimension characters, pathetic writing, recycled predicable story lines, I'm trying to figure out how a show this bad can stay on the air for so long, the only explanation I can come up with is UK audiences must love it, they are tad more retarded than Australian audiences so this would be a reasonable conclusion as nobody I know that I've spoken to here watches it.<br /><br />People must think I'm exaggerating when I say this show is bad, I'm not, I myself didn't realise how bad it was until I was watching TV one afternoon, I didn't know what it was I was watching but I said to myself: "Man this show is even worse than Neighbours!" When the ad break finished I was somewhat bemused to find out that it actually was Neighbours, it was a repeat of an earlier episode.<br /><br />Acting is terrible, but I'm not sure if it's due the actors themselves or the abysmal writing so I'm really not certain if I should feel sorry for them or be disgusted by them, though I have to say some of them look truly embarrassed to be there.<br /><br />As I said the story lines are nothing but recycled predicable crap, you know the drill, boy meets girl, boy and girl flirt ad nauseam, boy kisses girl, girl fights with boy, girl breaks up with boy, rinse wash repeat, honestly the writers of this show should be blasted from a cannon into the sun there's nothing original here.<br /><br />OK so how to rate something as bad a s Neighbours, well I rated it one, only because you can't rate it any lower, I really wanted to rate it -1 for every year it's been on air, 20+ years of nothing but crap I can't wait for this show to be axed just knowing it exists disturbs me on so many levels, I find it odd that some people say this show used to be good, it was never good!
