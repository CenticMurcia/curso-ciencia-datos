i saw this movie,and it's my love now. But i don't have it at home. It's my only one problem with it. I love Charlie,as an actor,and i love this movie because it can touch my heart. It's the best!!! I need to watch it every time i want! Yes,i love the another movies too. You can understand what i feel if i see the movie,if you had a lonely life like mine. i am a hungering girl,i love cars,so i love this movie. I want to meet another people who feels like me. i need to know if i am not alone. i don't have anything about Charlie sheen except maybe a little photo of he. But i have the title song from the wraith... If secret loser from Ozzy is that song...
