I had to review this film here, as terrible as it is, just because all of the other reviews were positive. This movie is positive, positively terrible. I saw it in 87 and loathed it then, and I'm absolutely sure that it is just as bad now. Bad acting, bad jokes, bad premise. Not funny. I could go on, but it's not worth the effort to write about. The IMDB ranking of 3.7 says it all. (and it's too high, I tell ya)
