I picked this film from the local video store when noticing that Christopher Walken was in it. Man, it wasn't even "so bad it's good". It was just simply horrible and I couldn't watch it more than 30 minutes. The so called "jokes" were desperately trying to be funny and I found myself shaking my head and wondering what was going through Walken's mind when he agreed to be in this one. I guess every great actor makes mistakes, but...ugh! I tried, I really tried to watch it till Walken would appear, but I just couldn't. So here I am, warning you who haven't seen this movie yet. Don't watch it. Don't rent it. Don't buy it. Don't even THINK about it. Read a good book instead, you will thank me later. 1 out of 10 stars.
