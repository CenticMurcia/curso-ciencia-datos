I saw 'The Blackwater Lightship' originally on the Hallmark Playhouse on television..complete with numerous commercials! I loved the film so I bought the DVD from Hallmark...minus commercials...what a treat...the film doesn't play like usual TV movies...with a 'hanger' right before the commercial to hold your interest and get one to return to the film after the commercial.<br /><br />This film plays smoothly as one piece....not fragmented and spotty like most TV films.<br /><br />The cast is magnificent....the sublime Angela Lansbury playing the Irish granny...Diane Wiest as the daughter of GRanny, and with several actors who were unfamiliar to me.<br /><br />However two actors I am familiar with are Sam Robards (have to see more of his work) and Brian F. O' Bryan (I know I didn't get this name correctly, but he is currently collecting all the awards on Broadway this season for his superb work in 'Doubt') They are exceptional as two gay friends of Wiest's son who is dying of Aids.<br /><br />With an Irish seaside setting (the Blackwater Lightship) and superb character transformations...this is a film I recommend unhesitatingly.
