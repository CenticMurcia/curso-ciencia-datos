I started to watch this movie due to reaction of my customers :-(. And I totally agree with them, it is a very bad movie, it could have been so much better. Bill Cobbs is really great but cannot rescue the movie. Alex Feldman is everything but good in this movie. <br /><br />You just do not get the story because the film is not finished. It builds up very nicely, but I still do not get it why the doctor while drinking beer starts to bleed more and more (suicide?. Why is his wife so mean and knows everything? even when she is locked up only in her bedroom?)And then suddenly she is lying in a hospital under Alex Feldman's bed? What happened in the burning house how did Alex Feldman get out? Why not his friend? And it ended fast and like cheap slasher movie.
