Big Bad Wolf is another in a long line of attempts to make a good werewolf movie. This film tries to give us a slightly different twist. Instead of an all animalistic werewolf we get a werewolf that knows who he is, what hes doing and can shoot a wisecrack back atcha with well...lets just say he tries to be funny.<br /><br />The beginning starts with a hunt in Africa where a group of hunters are attacked by the wisecracking canine. From there we flash forward years later to find out that one of the guys killed had a wife and son who are now being taken care of by one of the guys on the hunt. Said son decides to steal some keys to his step dads cabin only to have most of the beginning cast get slaughtered by the Big Bad One.<br /><br />Thinking no one will believe them they decide to stick to a story about a wild animal killing them until the boys uncle, who was also on the hunting trip begins to come back into his life and confirm with him his worst fears...the killer was a werewolf.<br /><br />BBW tries its best to rise above mediocrity even throwing in some all to brief cameos from horror veterans Clint Howard and David Naughton. It has a nice start to the film but when we get to the story you will have figured out the werewolf way before the middle act and your left with a lot of stupid decision making by some of the characters to pad the running time (ex. DNA testing). We do get an OK conclusion to this one but unfortunately for some viewers it may be too little too late. Also let's also not forget the trash talking, chick raping werewolf who tries to be funny and at times may give you a slight chuckle but more than likely will give you a feeling of uhhhhhhh.<br /><br />In the end we do get a couple of nice gore sequences, a solid turn in from Richard Tyson and Kimberly Brown but in the end it just doesn't make the grade for me. Though the film generally uses prosthetics and blood packs there is one transformation sequence that uses CGI and is not very convincing. Those who are into Freddy Kreuger style killers or just love their Werewolves may want to try this out as a rental as it is worth that. All others can skip this one by.<br /><br />My final score 4/10: Below Average: though I did like that they limited the CGI and that there was some decent gore here and there some of its own hokeyness and middle act bogged this one down enough for me not to recommend this one to the horror masses but the select few who can overlook its shortcomings.
