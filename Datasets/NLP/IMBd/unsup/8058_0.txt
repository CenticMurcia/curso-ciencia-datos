You see someone is driving a very fast car, a yellow one, a Ferrari from the peripherique of Paris into the center, the heart, the Sacre Coeur. You see the car driving - and you are the camera, you are the car, you are the movement towards the center. This movie is both miracle and myth. It was shot without permission, in the early 70ies by Claude Lelouch. The ride through the city takes place in the very early morning, fantastic light - and it ends with a rendezvous in front of the famous church high above the city. So finally you see one of the main reasons of driving too fast - the fear of getting late to a date. This is exactly what cinema is about: movement. Perfect! (But I don't believe that they really fixed the camera on the car directly)
