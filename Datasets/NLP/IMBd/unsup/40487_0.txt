I admit some of the quips from the commentators were funny, but I have to disagree with a lot of what is said. For instance, when they ruthlessly make fun of Meatloaf's "I Would Do Anything for Love (But I Won't Do That)", they say it doesn't make sense - what won't he do? Uh, well, if you listen to the end of the song you'd find out. Sure, some of the songs deserved to be on the list, but many were great songs, and did NOT deserve the trash talk so given by the comedians. It is also inaccurate to call this show "50 Most Awesomely Bad Songs...Ever", because after it was released at least a dozen more "awesomely bad songs" appeared on the radio.
