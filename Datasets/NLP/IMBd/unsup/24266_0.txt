This has to be my all-time favorite,it's just pure brilliance,i've watched it a countless number of times and it gets better and better every time, the dialogue is just hilarious and the slightly predictable ending is just heart-warming!!!Contains an excellent soundtrack and Adam Sandler does an excellent job as Robbie Hart, the singer. A great performance also came from Drew Barrymore as the waitress Julia Sullivan and cousin Holly Sullivan was portrayed well by Christine Taylor. The complete plot of the story is very original and hard to find in any other film which once again adds to the excellence of this classic. This film is definitely in my top five of favorites and in my opinion deserves more recognition and credit for its excellence.
