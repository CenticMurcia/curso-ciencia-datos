Hi, It's actually a right hand drive car but alas I can't be positive with the identification of it. I too thought it was a Mercedes but now know it probably isn't. It could well be an Hispano Suiza though. If you do an image internet search on this car a very similar one comes up albeit with a spare wheel attached to the door but it wouldn't be unknown for this to be removed by the production company because it got in the way. What I can say though is that it can decelerate from 110mph to 20mph in half a second (ha!)I will watch this with interest.<br /><br />I agree that it is a great film though. Film4 have just shown it for the second time to my knowledge. Hope they show Love Me Or Leave Me soon, a favourite of mine and apparently of Cagney himself. In both these films Cagney was in his early 50s, being born in 1899 but still believable as a character.
