A movie from Naseeruddin Shah was expected to be "THE BEST". I sat for watching something best, but I guess I expected too much. The movie seems to be pure nonsense. Hope, Naseer comes out with something better in the future. As someone has already pointed out, do you really expect a brother talking to sister about his "Exploitation tool"? Similarly, a sister talks to his mother about the brother being naked. This is not Indian movie. The title made me think, this might be a light comedy movie like "Jane be do yaaron". But, I must admit that it totally failed my expectations. The star cast is OK (expect Paresh Rawal, who is best in any role). I could not really see any value in showing Konkona Sen Sharma bathing and talking to Jimmy Shergill for so long. Jimmy Shergill seemed to be uncomfortable in his role. Overall, the movie is nonsense. Please do not waste your time in watching it.
