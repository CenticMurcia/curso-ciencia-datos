I though this was a pretty cool movie out the Asylum films. I have seen Frankenstien, Beast of Bray Road, and King of the Lost World,and War of the Worlds as well. I know Mr. Scott directed some of them and I do have to say this is the best one yet! The blurry feel gives such an old school look to it. I usually never comment of films at all but this one I felt needed a boost! The two female leads I thought really did a great job,Yeah, and there both hot, but the sex scene was so believable, and were good at their parts.Of course nothing will ever beat the Exorcist because it rocked, however this one held its own. I cant wait until the next Asylum film
