"The Last Winter" is a very moody film with a lot going for it in terms of having a great theme, interesting camera work, good acting and a strong cast. The director did a good job of setting up the story and following through the major plot points of horror movie structure, ala "The Thing," or "The Shining." I was pretty much with it all the way until... ahem... suddenly, Bullwinkle appeared. Come on guys, this CGI stuff just doesn't cut it on this scale. This movie would have been that much better and more mysterious had the "monsters" never appeared. I am trying to give credit where credit is due here, but didn't anyone say no to the glowing green moose-monster in a preview?
