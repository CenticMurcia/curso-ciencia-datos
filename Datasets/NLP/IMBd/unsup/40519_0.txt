I really tried to like this movie. The critics (before I knew better) raved about this film so much it got me pumped up to see it. Well, to say it was a letdown is putting it mildly. Then again, a lot of people like sick and sordid films. I learned the hard way how sick mainline film critics are since they just loved the idea of a key character in the film turning out to be a transsexual. Wow! Cool! (Okay, if you say so.)<br /><br />There are just too many uncomfortable, sordid and dark scenes in this movie, including a horrible first 15 minutes in which Forest Whitaker is a hysterical IRA hostage out in the middle of the woods. That beginning was anything but entertaining, at least to me.<br /><br />However, I don't know anyone who watched this movie and liked it - not one!
