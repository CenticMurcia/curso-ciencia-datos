Personally, I don't think the comments from the original poster are worthy of this movie. I don't thin the original poster would know a good movie if it slapped him in the head...<br /><br />This was a very well done movie with a great cast. Patrick Swayze did an excellent job of portraying a redneck-gone-big-city cop. Liam did a fantastic job of playing the out-for-revenge redneck-vs-mafia role as well. There is not much that would have made this movie any better than it was. In fact, changing it would have ruined it. Perhaps if Bill Paxton would have had a larger role rather than a get-killed-quick cameo... but other than that, I don't see what would have made this much better...
