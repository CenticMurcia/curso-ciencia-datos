I have a Hook-Ups shirt (Jeremy Klein's Skateboarding products company) which has the Genocyber's menacing pose from the back of the DVD sleeve on it. Having spurned my interest, I went to the ends of the earth to find a copy of it so I could see for myself whether or not it lived up to the hype, and finally ordered it from my local anime house for $30+. Boy did I have no clue. The Genocyber is present in about 5% of the story, and scenes with it in action are woefully short and inadequate to even support the drawn out (2 and a half hours!) story in which it seems to be a sidebar item rather than the cause itself.<br /><br />Utterly awful. I should've seen this coming however knowing full well going into this that this stinking pile came from the director of M.D. Geist, one of the most loathesome pieces of japanese animation of all time.<br /><br />Not recommended for anyone but the most elitest of anime snobs.
