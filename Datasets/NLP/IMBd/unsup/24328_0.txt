Another old goodie from RKO studios, in the era when they were churning out spy melodramas almost by the dozen.<br /><br />I decide to watch this one for two main reasons: first, it has a still young-looking James Mason, appearing in his thirtieth movie (he first appeared in 1935) and there's also one of the heavies of the thirties and forties, Herbert Lom, once again showing his under-rated acting ability.<br /><br />I was also surprised at the great camera work: some truly imaginative interiors, great use of shadows and lighting, and quite an interesting denouement between the two men at the top of a building, again with some brilliant camera work. The setting was supposed to be in 1938 southern France, but in wartime, one makes do with the back lot at Pinewood; unhappily, that was all too obvious. There are other technical faults and shortcomings but just pretend you're in the local Palace on a bleak afternoon in 1944 London.<br /><br />The story about a young man, Peter Vadassy (Mason), being framed for espionage seemed to me a bit weak, at the outset: the local gendarmerie allow him to go free so that he can help trap the real spy, after he proves, sort of, that he is not the guilty party. Why then would the director of French Naval Intelligence rope in a stranger to help do their work? Ah, well, that's a bit of the puzzle that all comes together at the end, and very nicely done too... Of course, that's what one should expect from an Alistair Maclean novel, I reckon.<br /><br />Given the times, it's a good cast and the acting is generally good, even if the characters are a bit stereotypical. Hey, it was wartime, so it was good propaganda, I guess...<br /><br />At 85 minutes, it was a nice break after a busy day and the office...my PC! It won't appeal to the younger set, of course, but RKO and spy-story enthusiasts, who probably tend to be a bit older, would enjoy this one. I did.
