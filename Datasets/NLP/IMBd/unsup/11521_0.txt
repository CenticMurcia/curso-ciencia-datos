This movie might have a directional setting towards the political and private life of India's Prime Minister, Indra Gandhi, nonetheless, its powerful and sentimental theme carries the audience with the subtle forces of life which all and sundry experience, at least, one or the other times in their married lives.<br /><br />Gulzar has excellently directed the movie while adorning it with passionately electrifying emotional focus during certain scenes. The musical score and songs are worthy of all praise. The hypnotically tranquil appeal of the song "Tere Bina Zindagi se Shikwa" speaks volumes about the meaningful and touching melody besides its filming against the gloomy backdrop of a ruined historical monument in a moonlit night. Much different from the rubbish artificiality of present day movies, the songs of this film exude a living originality to the flow of events. <br /><br />Sanjeev Kumar and Suchitra Sen both have given their lifetime best performances and Gulzar earned a big name with its release. It is definitely a must-see film.
