Not a lot here in the genre of city boys wandering into hillbilly country. All the clich√©'s are here, but this movie takes itself too seriously as a scary movie which it is not. As a B movie its not campy enough and as a thriller it fails miserably. For hysterical laughs I would recommend Redneck Zombies made on 100th of the budget and better cheesy gore effects. If you want a serious well made movie which this one is grafted from,Deliverance is the Gold Standard and Southern Comfort comes in a close second. A newer movie, Wrong Turn has done this premise again and is also well made. If this movie would have exploited ITSELF as Redneck Zombies did it might have been better.
