Awful, is unfortunately all I can say about this movie. It is an interesting object to look at the problem in the conflict in Iraq/Kurdistan from another perspective but when this perspective is from a fascistic point of view, (Turks superior compare to Kurds) and seeks no dialog or a message about understanding the problem there, makes the viewer to leave the theater as soon as possible to go home and feel sorry for a director with so many hate within his chest! maybe you could think " does not matter, I just want to see an action movie!" Well this movie is far from a good action. Really bad special effects, bad acting and not so fancy technique used in this movie. So if the only reason to watch this movie is to see some action, watch something else!
