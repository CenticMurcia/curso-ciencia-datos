London is terrorized by a "Jack the Ripper" copycat calling himself "The Avenger". In the opening scream, he claims a seventh victim. While the "Ripper" preferred prostitutes, the "Avenger" digs blondes. Each victim has been a fair-haired lass. Naturally, the sale of British peroxide plummets... Lead policeman on the case is Malcolm Keen (as Joe Chandler). He also likes blondes, especially golden-curled heroine, and Avenger-bait, June Tripp (as Daisy Bunting). Mr. Keen gets stiff competition from tall, dark, and handsome Ivor Novello (as Jonathan Drew), who arrives on the scene as "The Lodger" at the home of Marie Ault and Arthur Chesney (as Mr. and Mrs. Bunting). Suspicion begins to fall upon Mr. Novello, who also has a thing for blondes. Could he be "The Avenger"? <br /><br />"The Lodger" (subtitled "A Story of the London Fog") helped put director Alfred Hitchcock on the map, in Great Britain. It showcases Mr. Hitchcock's great visual storytelling style. The most commented-on example is the shot of "The Lodger" walking in his upstairs room, as seen from the point-of-view of the downstairs Buntings. Hitchcock had a glass ceiling constructed, for Novello to walk across. The director explained this was a way to show footsteps visually. Other filmmakers would have added the "Footsteps!" to a title card or sound effects track. The director issued some minor complaints about changing to film's ending to suit Novello's star status, but it gave him one of his most enduring film themes, the "wronged" man. "The Lodger" was a very influential film, especially on its own director.<br /><br />******** The Lodger (2/14/27) Alfred Hitchcock ~ Ivor Novello, June Tripp, Malcolm Keen, Marie Ault
