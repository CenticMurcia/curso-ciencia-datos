Here is a movie of my favourite sort regardless of the genre - you feel you would neither add nor substract anything from it. Excellent cast, beautiful script, professional director's work. The main strength of the movie can be found in its unpretentiousness. It primarily aims at providing fun and entertainment, and fulfills it in an efficient way. You have your comedy and action galore. <br /><br />We are usually willing to suspend our disbelief when watching comedies. No such need when it comes to this movie - the plot, the relations between characters, their motives, everything works like a flawless machinery. It is as credible as life itself.<br /><br />The movie is brimming with memorable scenes. I have seen it twice - first when it appeared more than 15 years ago, and then again yesterday. I was delighted to find that the movie had lost nothing of its freshness and endured all time traps. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />9/10 !
