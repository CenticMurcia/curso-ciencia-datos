This movie was highly recommended by some folks. i saw it in cinema with my brother and his 2 friends. At the end we were in disgust and regretting our decision to pay extra money and losing one weekend over this. From the start we did not understand what s going on , there was only killing with bullets firing in an unrealistic fashion. Quite a few action sequences were unbelievable carrying no weight. In one final battle cars were coming directly straight Antonio and his 2 buddies they spray bullets over bullets , not a single one hits the while his shot just inside from his guitar case is far more accurate. The whole film was lost during the process of mindless gun fights. I think its successor was way better than it. such movies can only be enjoyed very much teenage and some immature minds who only want to see violence with no proper plot.
