Hausu is a horror comedy which depicts the subtle art of Japanese film-making. The scare factor here does not lie on the visuals, but more on the emotions of the characters, Oshare, the teenage girl who lost her Mom and eventually reunited with her father during her vacation. Her bliss faded when her father introduced her to her stepmother. That disappointing fact made her change to be sullen, and started writing letters to her aunt, and that was the start of her journey with her bunch of friends to the mysterious house.<br /><br />The loss of a loved one, being in solitude, hoping for broken promises are the every person's fears that are hard to recognize. Amidst the funny visuals and average effects,(what can we expect from the technology in 1970s and movie-making is not that much better as we have it now) the movie wants to impart these things and I believe this what makes this film worth seeing and truly a classic.
