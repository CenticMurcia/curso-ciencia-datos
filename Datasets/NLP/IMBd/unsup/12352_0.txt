This is not a war-movie, but a movie about traveling through time. And the best of its kind in my opinion.<br /><br />So other recommendations should rather be sci-fi movies of the same kind, and not just war movies.<br /><br />The great thing about this one in the genre of time travel, is that its made in a so epic and serious way. <br /><br />I know first time seeing it on the screen and it looked to be a huge drama, action-thriller or something in the beginning, and then suddenly the most unexpected thing happens. It was awesome.<br /><br />I never get tired of this movie. Only wish there had been much more of it.
