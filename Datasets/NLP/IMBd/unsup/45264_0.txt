Having seen this film 3 times I am still struggling to understand the raw deal arnie is given? Also part way through there is a 10 minute scene where on his way to somewhere arnie pops into a casino to do a bit of gambling, it becomes apparent the craps table is rigged (including the line "magic or MAGNETS") he then immediately proceeds to smash up the casino, and for good measure, drive a truck through it. He then carries on going about his business. Although it has to be said, this is my favourite part of the film, I still cannot see its relevance in the overall storyline. These points however seem to add to my enjoyment of the film and it is one of my arnie favourites, a definite must see.
