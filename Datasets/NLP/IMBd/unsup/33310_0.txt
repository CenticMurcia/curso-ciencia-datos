You come to Lambada for the passion, the awesome music, the cool clothes, and the constant flashes of g-string under ruffled skirts that intrigued you from the TV commercial. You leave with a trig lesson that just BLEW YOUR MIND!!!<br /><br />This film is so uncannily like my own high school years, I was half convinced it was a straight up documentary for the first ten or twenty seconds.<br /><br />What gave it away was the fact that the actors cast as high school students looked WAY too young (they only looked 23-25, when we were in school, we all looked at least 29). The second thing that was highly suspect was the fact that there was only ONE spontaneous group dance number (during a computer class). Give me a break!!! There is a particularly nuanced supporting roll performed with aplomb by a young upstart actress who never quite flew so high in her later years; Jennifer Lopez as Booker.
