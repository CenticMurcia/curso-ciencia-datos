That mountain top box hut was bigger on the inside than it was on the outside; if you didn't get that, you won't "get" this movie.<br /><br />It took a good 30 minutes before I realized that I wasn't watching a pathetic apocalyptical made for TV love story and suddenly grasped the neatly crafted humor cleverly stitched just beneath the scenes of growing panic and mushrooming affection.<br /><br />A tiny helicopter becomes the perfect Noah's Ark metaphor with a gay bodybuilding Vietnam era Huey pilot snatched from a local health club at 4:00 in the morning along with his submissive girlfriend "Leslie" dutifully at the stick.

You too may lose some vital bodily fluids on the Miracle Mile.
