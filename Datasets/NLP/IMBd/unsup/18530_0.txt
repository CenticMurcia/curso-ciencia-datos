I am seldom at a loss for words, but this was, just possibly, the very worst movie I've ever seen. The acting, dialogue and special effects were so bad that at first I thought I was watching a parody. Aghhhhh. The special effects were quite strange, such as buckets of blood seemingly splashed from behind rocks and other props in a strange one-dimensional perspective. The actors read their lines like high school kids auditioning for their first play. The dual plot of volcano and supergator just didn't mesh and the ending made no sense at all. Okay, gator dead, let's show some old clips of a volcano erupting. If any of these actors ever make "the big time" in film, they may want to erase this movie from their bios. This movie might be fun at a boozy frat party, but only if no other options were available.
