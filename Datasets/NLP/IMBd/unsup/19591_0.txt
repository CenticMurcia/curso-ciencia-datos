I was expecting great things from this film from the trailers which advertised Beatty speaking the truth to a black congregation. But what I got was two hours of one sight gag -- a rich, old white guy rapping and jiving in the "hood" in an effort to "enlighten" the audience. One example of Bulworth's notions to improve the world is that "we should all just keep having sex with each other until we're all the same color." How brilliant! If we're all the same color, we won't have to use our minds anymore to appreciate the differences of each race. As a racially homogenous society, we will all be the same color and life will be beautiful because we'll all be the same -- I think Hitler had a similar idea.<br /><br />According to the gospel of Bulworth, gun-toting juvenile delinquents can be reformed by simply buying them an ice-cream cone. And if white people would only dress like crack-dealers, snort cocaine and rap their way through life, they'd endear themselves into the hearts of black Americans everywhere.<br /><br />As someone who lives in the inner-city and faces its rigors on a daily basis, I must say that Warren Beatty has unintentionally managed to illustrate exactly what a "limosine liberal" he really is -- stereotyping blacks and whites while trying to prove how "with it" an old, rich, white guy from Beverly Hills can really be.<br /><br />
