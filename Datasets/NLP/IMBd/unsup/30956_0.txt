I have been a movie freak since my birth. You cannot help but feel the heavy emotion from this movie. Who cares about film quality, chase scenes, blah blah blah. Nitpick nitpick nitpick.<br /><br />This story is meant to portray a happy married couple struggling to get through life with a son who has a blood disease(although the movie does not focus on the boy). It's about real-life circumstances. Trying to find work to make ends meet and maybe create alittle extra to feel rewarded(buying a boat). Getting caught up into trouble and paying hard for it, just to get all the things you love taken away from you. The question you've gotta ask yourself is: What would you do in a situation like that? Would you do anything to get back to your wife and kid?<br /><br />I would.
