Produced during WW2, I guess this film can be excused for its romanticised account of the story of the development of the Spitfire. The basic details are current: development from the Supermarine seaplanes, Mitchell dying of cancer, etc - but the development was nowhere near as smooth as depicted!<br /><br />The William Walton score (now known as the "Spitfire Prelude and Fugue") works particularly well.
