With so many East End gangster movies being churned out recently you might be forgiven for dismissing this as a band wagon movie. Having seen it I would urge you to look beyond that and go and see this second offering from British director Paul McGuigan.<br /><br />While I felt that the film didn't quite hang together well enough to put it amongst the greets of The Long Good Friday and Get Carter, the leading newcomer (who's name escapes me) played such an outstanding part as the ambitious and ruthless understudy to the gang leader played by David Thewlis that the film merits much praise. The film has the most violent and disturbing (without being graphic) scene that I can recall in a film which must be largely credited to the director who's individual style was both fresh and effective.<br /><br />I was disappointed by the performance of Malcolm McDowell but on reflection it may be due to the script which seemed to loose direction at the end when Malcolm dominates the screen, and also due to my personal over expectation of Malcolm's return to the big screen.<br /><br />A film well worth seeing and one which SHOULD propel it's young star into the limelight. This time next year I hope his name would not be escaping me still....
