Julie Delpy might very well be one of the biggest threats in Hollywood today. She acts. She directs. She writes. She sings. Her talent stretches for miles, and what a breath of fresh air she is. Her latest project, '2 Days in Paris', is such an accomplished piece of work that's sad and funny, sharp and intelligent. Another terrific picture that takes us to the streets of Paris, but with a unique and wonderful twist.<br /><br />If you think you've seen this story played out on screen countless times before, think again. '2 Days in Paris' does away with tradition and clich√©s and instead plays to a different beat. Delpy's ability to make observations without screaming them from the rooftops is a true gift. Whether it's the sharp dialogue between two lovers struggling to keep their relationship together or keenly aware political injections that at times are used to hilarious comedic effect, '2 Days' is a tour de force in almost every way.<br /><br />Despite the subject material, '2 Days in Paris' is actually a wickedly funny film. I laughed. A lot. Delpy doesn't look down on us or treat us like we're stupid, she's made a film that stands alone as a great achievement. We're given unusual access to some of the most personal moments that go on between Delpy and Adam Goldberg, and with an air of improvisation, the performances speak for themselves.<br /><br />I believe Julie Delpy knew exactly what kind of film she wanted to make with '2 Days in Paris', and the results are a bittersweet film that shouldn't be missed. It's an honest and authentic portrayal of a relationship in turbulence, both funny and insightful.<br /><br />More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public
