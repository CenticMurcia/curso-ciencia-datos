Communion is a good alien movie that's based on a true story. Christopher Walken was very good. I don't want to get into the film much but I will say that the film can be quite scary sometimes especially with that haunting music! The film is entertaining and interesting! The box is beautiful! I believe this story as I believe in aliens and the unknown! That's all I can say without spoiling it. I can say I strongly recommend you see Communion!<br /><br />Movie Nuttball's note: If you like alien movies I also recommend the following films: The UFO Incident, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T. the Extra- Terrestrial, Time Walker, Invaders from Mars, Fire in the Sky, Independence Day, The Arrival, Xtro 3: Watch the Skies, Life Form, Alien, Aliens, Alien 3, Predator, and Predator 2!
