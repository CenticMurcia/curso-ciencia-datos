LIVING DEAD GIRL was my first Jean Rollin experience and I have to say that I somewhat enjoyed it. The production values, from the actors to the sets to the FX, ranged from average to below average. The direction though was glacially slow and for many moments, my attention drifted to other things than the movie, which ain't a good thing. <br /><br />Some scenes are haunting and the look of the movie is a nice change from the usual horror movies but I never really got involved with the plight of the two girls. I don't know why but I thought the two lead actresses were a bit too aloof. Overall, LDG is okay but you need to fast forward through many long and dull moments. And some of the FX are really terrible, even for such a low budget effort.
