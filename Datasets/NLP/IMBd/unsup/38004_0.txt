This is a very early Our Gang comedy, yet oddly when the film begins it says it stars James Finlayson and Charley Chase. Chase is barely in the movie at all and beneath a huge mustache it's hard to see that it's him. Finlayson does have a much larger role, but it's really the kids who are the star of this trifling comedy.<br /><br />The kids are somehow interested in collecting fleas for their own flea circus. At the same time, one of the gang's sisters is getting married so they all tag along for the free food. Unfortunately, they bring along a jar filled with fleas. Given the premise and title of the film, it's not a spoiler to say that the fleas get loose and cause the wedding to be a disaster--with everyone itching like crazy. Not exactly subtle humor and not terribly funny.<br /><br />In a small role, look for a pre-Laurel and Hardy solo performance by Oliver Hardy as a cop. It's not much to speak of, but if you're watching the film anyways, look for him.
