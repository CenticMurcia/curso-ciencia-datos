Being an August Underground series fan, I could hardly wait to get my hands on this movie and see something different from the obviously talented ToeTag crew. Yeah, sure, it's different, but this is not for me. I give it 3 out of 10 because of this: 1. This type of story is told about 10 000 000 times already. Girl breaks up with her mentally unstable boyfriend and he begins to stalk her. His behavior is increasingly aggressive and near the end of the movie he ends up butchering someone with an axe.This storyline meets one that is very reminiscent of movies such as " Evil Dead" because his girlfriend hooks up with the bunch of brainless , shallow bores and goes with them to party in an abandoned tower ( but where are the stairs inside of that tower? ) which is haunted by evil forces that like to kill and rape for no apparent reason. Nothing at least slightly original . From beginning to the end.<br /><br />2. Most of the movie is boring and consists mainly of these characters ( i didn't get the impression that there are real characters here ) getting high, drinking beer, and talking about absolutely nothing relevant or interesting.It takes a lot until we get to the gore, guts and demons. And when we do, it ends quickly. Not much for the gore fans here.<br /><br />3. The acting is mainly lousy and flat. It adds to my impression that this departure from previous entries made by the same crew is disappointing, because AU movies included good , very convincing acting.<br /><br />4. Fred Vogel is obviously a talented director and he proves that in " Redsin Tower", but he's not good when it comes to writing scripts for horror flicks of this kind. Or maybe he is, because this type of mainstream banalities needs no good ideas, just recycling of the old, old, old senseless rubbish. But still, it could have been more interesting and dynamic.<br /><br />5. The special effects are good because they are done by Jeramie Cruise , and he proved himself as the master of that art in AU series. There aren't much of them though.<br /><br />6. The overall atmosphere in the movie is fairly O.K. , but it's not frightening or creepy because the plot quickly becomes very predictable.<br /><br />7. There is something lacking at the end of the movie: explanation for the fact that the only person spared from wrath of " evil forces " is the dumped , homicidal boyfriend. Why? Did they like him because he's a murderer? But who cares, this is not the movie that's supposed to raise questions and make you think. At least I got that impression.<br /><br />All in all: very typical,mainly boring, directed skillfully, acting average or below ( but the guy who played the dumped boyfriend was O.K.), good SFX and make-up... You can see thousands of movies very similar to this one. It's pale, predictable and unimaginative. I think I'll stick to the ToeTag's earlier work.
