This has to be one of the worst movies I've seen lately. The main character is so stereotypic and I have no idea what the moviemakers want us to think about him. First he goes on a shooting rampage on a muslim mosque, then he kills innocent people in Kosovo.<br /><br />Then when the child comes into the picture he suddenly softens up and everything is ok.<br /><br />It would have been nice with a better plot and storyline for sure. And calling this a Drama film is beyond my understanding. The cruel scenes may be moving, but it doesn't help in the long run.<br /><br />If you can avoid seeing this picture, do so. You get a better picture of the Kosovo war on old newsclips.
