This is a well done and entertaining film/documentary. <br /><br />Whether you believe every single word said on it, or you don't at all. You wont get bored, since this a very interesting presentation of another point of view of the events of 9/11. Maybe some very specific facts can be wrong, but that doesn't means this movie is not worth watching. I would recommend this film, since you can watch it for free from different sources through the internet. <br /><br />I am amazed by number of Reviews rating this movie with 1, that I actually consider the possibility of people being paid to rate it that way. Eg. Look How most of the negative reviews are twice or three times longer than the positive ones...
