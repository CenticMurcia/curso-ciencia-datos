This movie contains the worst actors I've ever seen. I got the felon that they had an open casting on the street outside Burger King and selected the persons who wanted the least amount of pay. But the idea of the movie is great. I think if it was a higher budget on this flick and if a better director made this movie it could be a really great movie. The idea of escaping and cheating death and then try to get the Grim Reaper of your back is really exiting. So if you like the idea and don't pay much attention to the effort of the actors see it. But if you think the actors is very important in a movie "like myself" then DO NOT see this movie.
