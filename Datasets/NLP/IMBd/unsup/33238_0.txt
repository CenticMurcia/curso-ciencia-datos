Other than not being remotely related to the actual mythology, having absolutely awful dialog and worse readings and being a collaborative effort of six countries, it wasn't too bad.<br /><br />Characters die after being gored (and lots of gore, at that). The plot dies after being bored. No, wait.<br /><br />Actually, my wife and I both like Sci Fi, are fans of Stargate (in both incarnations) and Battlestar. We like those. We hated this. Complete waste of TiVo space.<br /><br />Think early Godzilla meets late Cujo for the beast effects. Think lots of syrup for blood and gore. Think Grand Canyon for plot holes. This would make a great movie for Mystery Science Theater.
