IÂ´m a big fan of the innovative and daring Danish film scene and "the Dogma" has of course a big part of its success. "Mifune" follows in the right tracks but unlike previous dogma history I was delighted to encounter a happy ending for a change. Iben Hjejle and Anders W Berthelsen are perfect as the fumbelers that finally find each other and of course a Danish film, any film really, is not full without Paprika Steen.
