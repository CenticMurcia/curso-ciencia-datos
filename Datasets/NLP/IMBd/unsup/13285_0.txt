I liked this movie a lot. I found inside many reflexions from Warrior's Path described by Carlos Castaneda and his Shaman Don Juan. Breaking all connections with our day-to-day world, all relations, going to supposed goal with unbend intent ... almost all is present here as pure essence. Allpresent butchering and manslaughter will probably filter out those weak and yet undecided, but this is here important part of artistic representation. Killing of the "innocent" also clearly demonstrate that somewhere on the Path we have to stop using outside criteria for "good" and "bad" and use only our own, hopefully already developed at that point. The final point is also a first point of new cycle. Masterwork.
