This movie was seriously the worst movie I have seen since like ever. I wish I could give it a 0 out of 10. It made no since in how it flowed into a movie, they crammed way too many parodies into a 1 hour and 20 minute movie. Horrible sad excuse of a movie. They could have made this into like 2 or 3 different movies and expanded. making it more original. But every scene was taken from something else. The scenes just made no sense when you watch them all as one movie, they even had movie spoofs of films that came out literally like 6 months ago. Some of the actors did not even seem to have any life to them, they were just there to be fillers. They should have taken more time to make this.To sum up this movie: sad, just a sad poorly done film.
