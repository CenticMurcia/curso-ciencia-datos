You watched the film? If no, don't hesitate. Just go and watch. And talk about it later. It is a hard-gore thriller(they named) It shows a lot of cut-things(heads, arms, legs). And full of blood. But very different from the movies like "Slayer". It's a kind of psychological slatter movie, I think. Some said its rate should be "Over Master's degrees, not Bachelor's". But I think it is better than "A silence of the lamb". Remember, it make your eyes pop up, and head ache, but when it ends you wanna watch it again.
