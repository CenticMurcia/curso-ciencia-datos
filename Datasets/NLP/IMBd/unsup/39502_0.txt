Fourth and last in the scuzzy 'Confessions' series, with charmless slut Robin Askwith working in the dreariest holiday camp you ever saw and getting up to all the usual antics with various guests. This isn't so much saucy seaside postcard humour as it is 'Razzle' letters page, with demeaning roles for women and a barrage of unfunny, and occasionally homophobic gags adding to the 'fun'. Askwith, as usual, mugs as if his life depends on it while the movie provides a masterclass in how to make a bunch of attractive women appear completely devoid of sex appeal. Aside from the rather off-putting shags, the movie is a succession of scenes that set up punchlines but never deliver.
