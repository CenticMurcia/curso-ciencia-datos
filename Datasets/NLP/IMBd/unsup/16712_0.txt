2002 is the ghostbusting department of the Hong Kong Police. The hero is fated to cause the death of anyone he gets close to, which cramps his love-life somewhat. He gets through partners rather quickly too, since they die, become super-powered ghost partners and then get re-incarnated. His mentor sells paper offerings for the hero to burn for their ghost friends.<br /><br />The script is always intelligent and witty. The action sequences are just right - they move the plot along without dominating it and are great fun. The acting and directing are both excellent and the main characters are likeable and sexy - strong, but vulnerable.<br /><br />We laughed out-loud, especially at the comments that brought the characters down to earth. We didn't actually cry at the pathos but it was there.<br /><br />This review relates to the English subtitled version shown on TV.
