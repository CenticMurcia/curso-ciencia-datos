The colors in this movie were exquisite. The scene showing the colored car bodies coming off the assembly line was a vividly stunning visual. The fact that I was able to see it in an old fashioned movie theater with a HUGE screen surely made the difference in my appreciation of this movie. Not too many movies make the audience want to cheer out loud for the hero, this one did!
