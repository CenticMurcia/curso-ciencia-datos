After the promising first minutes of the movie which look like they where trying to build a serious profile behind the killings, the movie drifts to a simple and disgusting presentation of violence.<br /><br />A movie made for perverts...<br /><br />The acting is decent, the storyline is not. The entire plot focused on the student trying to understand the psyche of the killer is only based loosely on the facts, all leading to build up more shots with violence. Even so it may have happened that way - why would you make a movie that features the most disgusting things a human has done? Looked to me like the director and writer failed to find a clear statement for the film and therefore went down the easy way by producing a flick that thrives on pain and the scandal behind it to get recognition at the box office.
