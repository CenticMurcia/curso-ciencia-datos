I have never wanted to walk out on a film more than this one. A few other people in the theater had the same idea except they actually acted on it. This movie is a mess. It can never pick a theme and stick to it. I think we are supposed to see John Wilmot as some kind of free thinking liberated person. Apparently the theme of the play it was based on was that Wilmot could have been remembered as one of the great writers of his age if he weren't so debauched. The film missed this point completely. All I saw was a drunk stumbling around from one aimless, pretentious scene to another. Though the acting was good, no one could save this terrible film. If you want to see a film that has a similar theme and actually makes a point, see Quills with Geoffrey Rush.
