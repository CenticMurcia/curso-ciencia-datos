This movie starts out with a promising premise, a manned flight to Mars is planned but just before lift off there is a problem so it is decided to surreptiously remove the astronauts from the ship and fake the whole thing (of course many people believe this is exactly what happened with the Apollo moon landing but that's a different story). The first sign that this movie going down hill fast is when James Brolin asks Hal Holbrook 'how many people know about this' and Hal replies something like 'only a few' but we have already seen about 75 people involved which later turns into about 750. The second worrying sign is when we realise that OJ has a speaking part. Then Elliot Gould turns up to do his best robot impression. We start to ask questions like how does a car accelerate like it's on a hill in San Fransisco when it's on what looks like a flat stretch of road in Houston with no foot on the gas and why when Elliot Gould is arrested by the conspirators on a fake charge is he released the same night to continue his investigations. Unfortunately this movie has no redeemimg features.
