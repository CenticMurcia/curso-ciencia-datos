When I saw this film, I honestly went in expecting to watch an awful film.<br /><br />The story is well written (although I now know it is based on previous films). And the acting is also well, not great but OK.<br /><br />One point I will get across though. Aside from the fact that this was so obviously a low budget film with bad editing and good enough story. I did notice an obvious and dare I say... pathetic message.<br /><br />This film seems to support the idea that the average Mexican feels inferior to the average American, thus the need to make a film to emphasize the idea, by creating a pretend-world where the American begs for the Mexican to return. Basically supporting the fact that Mexicans are no more than laborers.<br /><br />It was a good film until the end credits when we see the American farmer smoking weed. It is in very poor taste, and it is so obvious that the director wanted to film that and show it. Why? Because he does it himself? Who knows... but that basically destroyed much of the little credibility the film had going.<br /><br />The film is enjoyable, just forget about the actual social issues and cut the weed smoking scene.
