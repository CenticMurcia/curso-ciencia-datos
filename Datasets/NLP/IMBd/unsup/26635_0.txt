Ugh, what a gut-wrenching movie this is.<br /><br />Peter Bogdanovich avoids the maudlin histrionics that could have marred this story about a young man suffering from a fatal disease that leaves him horribly deformed. Eric Stoltz is remarkable as the young man, Rocky Dennis, and it's entirely thanks to him, and to his charm as an actor, that we fall in love with Rocky and are heart-broken to see him die at the end. Cher is equally as good as his mom, who sees nothing ugly in her son and feels nothing but ferocious love for him.<br /><br />I will always remember a wonderful scene in this movie, in which Rocky is trying to explain colors to a blind girl (played by a lovely and young Laura Dern) and does so by giving her items to touch -- a hot potato for red, cotton for white, ice for blue.<br /><br />Grade: A
