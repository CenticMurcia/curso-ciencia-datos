I thought that this movie was great. I really feel that it was supposed to be a silly way of conveying the importance of immigrants in society. Though the setting was on a small scale, (the state of California rather than the entire U.S.) it shows the chaos of what could happen and that is just in California. However it was a little far fetched and didn't make sense in some places. I don't believe that the country as we know it would come to an end as the film portrays, but it would suffer some very painful consequences. I thought that overall it was a very good movie. The director, Sergio Arau, is known for his interesting artistic take on his films. This one is really no different. The overflowing glass and leaky water faucet was nice symbolism as well. Although this film is a comedy, it does a nice job of bringing across its serious underlying message. Through some of the fluff and nonsensical points this movie in the end makes its point. Also, the special features interviewing some of the Latino population and their points of view were also a really eye opening complement to the movie.
