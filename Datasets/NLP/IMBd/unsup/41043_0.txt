Although it is amusing to see Linnea Quigley, Michelle Bauer, and Brinke Stevens as "ugly" coeds, this movie relies too much on nudity and really bad jokes. Don't get me wrong, these three girls look good naked and have a good sense of humor; There just isn't enough for them to do. Richard Gabai should go away and never return. Michael Sonye or Dukey Flyswatter if you prefer, which I do, is extremely annoying as Omar, the psychic. His voice is pain, so if you like that sort of thing, watch the beginning sequence. He also is the lead singer of a band which does a couple of songs of which I did like the beginning of one of them. "Sucky sucky sucky sucky succ u bus! (dun dun) Sucky sucky sucky sucky succ u bus! (dun dun) Sucky sucky sucky sucky succ u bus! (dun dun dun dun) Suck me! (dun dun dun dun) Suck you!" If you must see this, you will enjoy the three girls cleaning each other in the bathtub. Although Michelle's tan scares me, I get over it.
