Firstly, Rear Window by Alfred Hitchcock is one of my favorite movies, however it is important not to compare this to that classic. Remakes are often less impressive than the originals because you know what's coming and because older films relied much more on acting as opposed to present day films which tend to rely on special effects, violence and sex.<br /><br />That aside, this film was overall a fairly enjoyable film to watch. My one major complaint for this one is that it wrapped up too quickly. By the time we have this guy getting accused of killing people, he's shoving the mother's head into the door and coming to the main character's house and slamming people's heads in with a bat.<br /><br />I think the film could really have been improved by letting the suspicions and tensions run a little longer. It seemed like we found out that he really was the killer too soon.<br /><br />Otherwise, I thought this was a fun film to watch mixed with some funny moments. It's worth watching.
