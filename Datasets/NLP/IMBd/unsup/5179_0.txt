Adam & Eve is a guilty pleasure of mine. The movie is unusual in that it is a sweet and innocent love story mixed with gross out sex humor. Its definitely not your typical National Lampoon movie... its a little more classy and a lot more thoughtful. The guy humor is amazing. I've never seen a movie that comes close to realistically capturing the sex crazed, beer hungry college guy. Not every guy in college is as ridiculous as this, but trust me these guys existed. Cameron Douglas is ADORABLE. (I love the song he sings to Eve on their first date)And of course, Emanuelle Chiriqui is as lovable as ever. My only complaints are that the sorority girl stuff wasn't realistic and Eve's parents characters were annoying. (The acting was good. I just didn't like the way it was written). All in all, its a fun movie that gives you a little dose of love and laughter.
