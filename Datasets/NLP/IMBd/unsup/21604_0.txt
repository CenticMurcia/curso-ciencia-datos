I have to say that butter was the greatest movies ever made. I am not joking when I say this. Using the talents of Zeus, Ernie Hudson, and Tony Todd was pure gold. Now, maybe I am biased when I rate this movie a 10, but I was on the edge of my seat in this non-stop thriller. I happen to love these three actors and having them work together was icing on the cake. Ernie Hudson put in an Oscar winning performance and Tony Todd and Zeus were great as Ernie's right hand men. The ending was a classic similar to the ending of Reservoir Dogs. All I can say is "It's butter baby!"
