"The Very Thought of You" tells the tale of one woman who encounters three men individually while starting her life over in the UK. Curiously, the three men happen to be best friends...the crux which launches this charming and amusing little romantic comedy. Low on schmaltz, fresh and fun, "TVToY" is a three star flick worth a watch for anyone into this genre.
