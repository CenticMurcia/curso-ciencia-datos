Every time I see this movie, It stirs something in me. It moves me and it takes me back to a time when things where simple and a good story could be told without the bells and whistles and still move you years after. This fairy tale is one of those films that no sequels can conquer. It invokes a nostalgia that will make you regress back to your childhood. If you were a kid like I was when this film first came out. I saw it many times. Now I ownd the soudtrack (record cause up to today I have not found the CD soundtrack to this film) and the DVD with all the great behind the scenes footage. Tom Hanks has star quality acting here and the chemistry that Daryl and Tom have are blown out of the water! A really truly wonderful film!
