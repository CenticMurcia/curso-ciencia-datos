<br /><br />Probably , this is the most incredible picture i 've ever seen. Wintterbottom following the way of a fantastic Leigh , could show the autentic atmosphere of the cold London . Every person who has been there , can notice how the director can give us a little piece of the londoner reality. With a fantastic crew and actors the film became one of the most perfect of the nieneties.
