Lenny is the best picture of 1974 by far. Overshadowed by masterpieces like the Godfather Part 2 and Chinatown, Lenny is equal to the two if not better. It sad to say this but Lenny is the most underrated film in movie history. Everything about it is top notch. Fosse is great behind the camera and Perrine acts great as Bruce's wife. But the whole greatness to the film, the whole masterpiece of it, lies in the performance given by Dustin Hoffman. He keeps you glued to the screen. The way he says his lines, his facial expressions, his gestures. He should have won every acting award there was. Excuse me, I'm wrong. Awards don't mean anything, especially the Oscars, which are nothing but a popularity contest. The oscars are obscene, dirty, and no better than a beauty contest. All in all the best pic of 1974 and of all time for that matter. Hoffman's best ever, or that could be Midnight Cowboy. Hoffman, the greatest actor who ever lived.
