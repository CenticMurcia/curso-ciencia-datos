This film is a great film that show cases Harold LLoyd at his best. The film manages to be funny, entertaining, have a meaningful plot, & includes great stunt work all in one great menage of entertainment. While Harold LLoyd has other films that rank up with this one, I find this one is one of the best I've seen. The pace of the film is perfect & Harold fits his role in this film better than a form fitting glove. This film is so good, that years later Harold Lloyd was hired in the 1960's as a consultant for another film which borrows from this one & goes on to win Best Picture. I won't spoil this for you except to say watch this film when you get a chance, & when your done viewing it, find out the other Best Picture's title, watch it, & you will be able to tell what was borrowed from this film in the other one. Great Comedy from beginning to finale makes this a classic silent film!!! Harold was so proud of the chase scene in this that he borrowed from it in the 1960's & because of that borrowing, he helped make another comedy star whose name is Dustin Hoffman. While the technology of the 20's in the forms of horse & street cars in the chases seem ancient now, they are never more skillfully employed in a film than they are in this gem. I like it more every time I watch it. You can see in this where W C Fields borrowed from it for a sequence in The Bank Dick. My favorite scene is where Lloyd gets the letter with the check from the publisher & tears it up without realizing what it is. His indignation upon finding out his what his novel has been re-titled is classic. This is a must for any Lloyd fan.
