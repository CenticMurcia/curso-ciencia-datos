The jokes came and went within the first 10 minutes.<br /><br />This got boring quickly and lost my interest.<br /><br />What gets me is that costs $35 million to produce yet there is no huge cast or no over costly effects.<br /><br />The locations are all over North America from Mexico, Jamaica, Chicago, L.A. and Vancouver and that makes no sense.<br /><br />I saw this being filmed in Vancouver...and there is nothing anywhere else that really had to be filmed in another part of the country.<br /><br />Even the beach scenes could have been filmed in or around Vancouver.<br /><br />Why was so much expense put into filming in so many locations? It didn't add to the story...it didn't take away or develop the plot.<br /><br />All scenes could have been basically shot in 1 city - whether it was Vancouver or Jamaico r Mexico...but hauling the crew and equipment all over the pace was retarded and useless.<br /><br />It's not an overly funny movie, it's not a boring movie but it lacks the polish...and for a budget of this script, there could have been 5 more movies made that are just as entertaining.
