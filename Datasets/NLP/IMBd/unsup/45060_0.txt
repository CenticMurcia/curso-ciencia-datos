<br /><br />The irony of this film the is that the reaction of the producer in the first few scene, should have been the same as the real producer.<br /><br />What a load of self-indulgent drivel this was.<br /><br />I'm not going to go in detail as there isn't really much to comment on, no real jokes, poor acting, no direction, no story.<br /><br />The scene with the salad summed the whole thing up. Lets throw in a pie-in-the-face scene that'll get a laugh.<br /><br />I saw this film on a flight from Salt Lake to Boston and I don't recall seeing anyone even smile let alone laugh. Rightly flopped at the box office. 0/10
