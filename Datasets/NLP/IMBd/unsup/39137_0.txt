This movie left me feeling empty. I didn't need to be taught that some men are controlling and abusive, or that some teens are troubled and emotionally fragile, and I didn't need to be taught that true faith in God, or goodness, is difficult in a violent world. Like most people, I knew these things already. This movie is so full of depressing tragedy that it desperately needed fully-developed, interesting characters to make us care, and I found the characters sketchy at best. Martha Plimpton is always interesting and it was nice to see her in a lead role, but she deserved a better script. A disappointment, and it's no wonder it didn't get much of a theatrical run.
