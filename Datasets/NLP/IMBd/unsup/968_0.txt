This movie is simply great. While it perhaps lacks a larger social message, other than the simple "do good with what you have", it is a smart, funny movie which definitely has its moments, both cinematic and dramatic. The rags to riches story of two orphan con men: one, a genius Brit, the other, the American spin doctor. Together they engage in "shooting fish", or fleecing rich people of their extra cash, in order to buy themselves the lavish house they've each coveted because of their simple upbringing. The story is fun and engaging, the characters seem very very real, and the different cons they pull off together are extremely funny. I won't give away any of the story, except to say that the has a nice, unexpected twist. An excellent date movie, or even to take in with a couple of close friends. You may not laugh out loud the whole time like you did at "There's Something About Mary" or other slapstick comedies, but you'll definitely be smiling the whole time, and by the time the credits role you'll simply be in a much better mood than you were when you started.
