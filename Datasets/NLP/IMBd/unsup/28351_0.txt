This movie reminded me of all of those "crazy guys on the loose" movies. "Weekend Pass", "Fraternity Vacation", et al. Except in this case the main characters were minorities. A big negative was all of the swearing, way too much. To me, a lot of swearing in a film shows a weak script. "How can we punch up this scene, dramatically?" "Ah, just put in a lot of swear words, that adds drama". I don't think so. Another thing is how each of the four main characters have an epiphany, that is straight out the "crazy guy" film handbook. Finally, the first few minutes start off promising and there is some humor but that vanishes further on. Unless, one finds humor in degrading women. And am I the only one that thought the title song sounded a lot like Motley Crue's "Dr. Feelgood"?
