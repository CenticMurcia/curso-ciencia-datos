best cartoon i ever saw, James rang me at 3am - 'some crazy film on, u really better come over and watch this,' so i did. what we witnessed could not be remembered, due to all the joints we had, but will not be forgotten. For 3 years we searched the net and asked in all the shops for the crazy cartoon with robots riding Jewish women, stoned aliens and nymphomaniac queens, but last week checking out the world cinema in chart busters...the name Heavy Metal caught my eye. i nearly wept with joy. Just watched it again with James, and off i go to ebay to buy it. (have since given up dope, but u don't need to be a stoner to watch this) so get it post haste. (although it is better wasted!)<br /><br />The most fun film yet... relax charlie...i got an angle
