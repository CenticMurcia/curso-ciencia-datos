My friend gave me the vcd of mistress of spice because i was bored.<br /><br />I would rather be bored. I closed the movie in about 20mins. I was that annoyed.<br /><br />This is miscast, mis-shot, mis-edit, a miss-miss and probably was a mistake.<br /><br />The acting is mediocre. Ash's performance, like any of her Hindi movies, was pathetic. I am surprise she gets all this attention. Seriously, beauty can take places.<br /><br />The story is strange and the way to present it is even stranger.<br /><br />Not recommended to watch it. Unless you really want to drool over Ash.
