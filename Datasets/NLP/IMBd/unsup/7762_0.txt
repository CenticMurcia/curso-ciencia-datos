Zombie movies, they've been with us for a long time. They are easy to make too. All you need is a camera, 6 or 8 friends living to wear raggedly clothes stained with stage blood; 4 or 5 other friends willing to run around a scream; some offal from a local butcher's shop and some guns with blank cartridges. Put them all together and presto, you are ready to make a zombie movie.<br /><br />That's not to say that all zombie movies are GOOD though; and that brings me to the movie I am here to-night to talk about, William Victor Schotten's DEAD LIFE. This movie is bad! No, I mean REAL bad! It's not even so-bad-it's-good!<br /><br />It starts with a young boy named Maxx who watches his dad go insane and kill himself. Dad was a worker at a chemical plant that was working on some mysterious toxin . . . but I am getting ahead of myself. Many years later Maxx is all grown up (and played by Michael Hanton). He and his buddies don't do much more than sit around, drink beer, listen to heavy metal music, complain about how bored they are and lie about their sex lives. Life gets a little more interesting when one of Maxx's buddies is attacked by a weird looking guy with silver skin (note to director: zombies are supposed to have a gray complexion!) and oozing a black fluid from his mouth. Pretty soon the guys are noticing more and more people with rotting faces and an appetite for blood. Luckily this is Redneckville, USA and everybody has a gun so defending themselves is no problem. Problem is, these infected people are tough! Nothing stops 'em except . . . all together now . . . a bullet to the brain. Finally the good 'ol boys figure out that somehow the recently dead are coming back to life as . . . now let's all say it together folks . . . flesh eating zombies!<br /><br />Their town is pretty much toast by the time they figure this out so it's time to hit the road. While looking for a safe place they meet up with a doctor who tells them the zombies were created by a disease called Necrotising Faceitis M, which is an actual disease that the filmmakers embellished. The adult zombies eat flesh because their minds have been corrupted by bigotry, greed, corruption and all the things we experience when we grow up. Child zombies don't eat flesh because they have retained their innocence. Sound logical to you? It does? Good because it sounds like a load of tripe to me!<br /><br />Well anyway the guys can't decide if they want to go live on a deserted island or in the desert. By the end of the picture it becomes a moot point anyway.<br /><br />The plot is really off the wall, acting talent is non-existent; the zombies are . . . well . . . as convincing as any zombie is capable of being. Near the end of the film we even get to see a zombie clown with tears of blood leaking through his makeup (symbolism?) being followed by a bunch of living dead children, one of who is carrying a huge teddy bear. Somebody in the production crew was very fond of the Japanese cyber-punk subgenre because whenever someone turns into a zombie the camera is undercranked while they shake their heads violently back and forth. I have noticed this in movies like TETSUO THE IRON MAN and PINOCCHIO 964.<br /><br />There are a lot of zombie movies out there now like FEEDING THE MASSES, DAY OF THE DEAD II, SHAUN OF THE DEAD and many more. With so many to choose from you can skip this movie and you will not have missed a thing.
