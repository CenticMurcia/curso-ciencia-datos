The blend of horror and mystery is a cool combination, but that simply wears out thin after you see it the first time. This may have been a good drive-in film 25 years ago at a time when VCR's never existed. The supposed purpose of THE BEAST MUST DIE is for the viewer to discover clues of eight people, one of which is the werewolf (and no, it's not Paul Naschy, it's a genuine wolf!). Many of the clues are explained in the dialogue. While this is OK as a mystery, it greatly fails as a horror film. There also isn't a specific plot to follow, just a game of CLUE. After the "Werewolf Break", where the viewer decides who exactly is the beast for 30 seconds, things get more suspenseful and somewhat disturbing that leads to the ultimate conclusion where THE BEAST MUST DIE. Nice try for a movie labeled "audience participation", but most likely, you won't be interested in it. And I sure hope those so-called "VCR Games" don't come back!
