Don't ya just love Hollywood? They know you will return for a sequel of a hugely popular movie and thus take the time to overload it with PC (see Porky's 2 and about a million others). Lets see here, we got the idiotic bikers who try and destroy everything but are so stupid they are easily swayed by anyone with half a brain. We get the KKK (wouldnt be pc without them making an appearance) and of course Fletch is way too smart for those folks. Well I do declare they got the whole South in this movie and they is just about as racist and ignorant as anyone you ever wish to meet....heaven forbid I feel like I must have a mint julep now. Ohhh yes, and we got the loud mouthed Evangelist (played by a real life honorable and good person). Wow, give it a break Hollywood. Just make a decent movie without all the over the top stereotypes to bring in the brain dead masses.<br /><br />If you didn't notice the agenda here.....you're stupid.
