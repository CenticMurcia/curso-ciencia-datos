The movie is about Asmi Ganatra (Juhi Chawla), a woman who dreams of becoming a famous director. She then visits the Joshi family, requesting that she use their upcoming family wedding as a part of her TV serial. The bride's father agrees to the idea, but the rest of the family refuses, thinking that they will lose their right of privacy. Asmi is disappointed at their decision, but doesn't give up just yet. She then comes to realize that Manoj Joshi (Irrfan Khan), the bride's youngest uncle has fallen in love with her. She manages to talk him into an arrangement where hundreds of cameras would be installed in the huge house. Manoj gives in and agrees to the deal. The family, unaware of the hidden cameras continue to act like their normal, everyday selves. Over some time, Manoj realizes that he has made a huge mistake. His family's privacy gets invaded by secret cameras, and incidents that should be kept secret are revealed. But the story doesn't end just there, it goes on further... more secrets are revealed... some that may even change the story's plot... to find out what happens next, watch 7 1/2 Phere...<br /><br />I, honestly think this is a great movie. What makes 7 1/2 Phere unique is its storyline; it is unlike any other Hindi film I have ever seen.In addition to that, the movie is loaded with comedy. I especially thought Juhi's acting was as great as ever and she looks beautiful as always. The only downside to the movie is it's not really the kind of movie you would want to see over and over again, but I would recommend it to anyone.
