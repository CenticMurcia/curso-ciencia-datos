This is probably the worst TV-show I have ever seen. I saw two or three of it's episodes and I felt terrible. Sometimes I really like criminal shows - especially "Without a Trace" which was great. But not this one. I saw its episodes dubbed in Bulgarian so I can not tell anything about the acting but I really hated D'Onofrio after I saw his character. He is the main reason for me not to like the show. I mean... Robert Goren knows everything, speaks every language, can do everything...<br /><br />But despite his knowledge about everything Goren was actually so dumb so it hurts to watch him. I guess the screenwriters thought they would show him as a great psychologist but if anyone speaks to me like he speaks to the suspects I would die laughing at his face. Come on, do you really think this is good? We have seen better shows. We can see better psychology even in "Power Rangers". "Law & Order: Criminal Intent" is a trash. If you want a good show watch something else.
