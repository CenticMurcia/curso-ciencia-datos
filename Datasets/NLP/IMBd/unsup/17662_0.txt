One of my favorite films. My Dad took me to see this movie when I was about 8 years old. Seeing the movie available on DVD made me want to purchase and analyze it. What great acting work by John Payne. Three of the greatest gangster villains were cast in this movie. Seeing Lee Van Cleef as a ladies man was very believable. One of the best plots involving the ex police chief masterminding the bank robbery for the reward money was outstanding. Preston Foster was excellent in the portrayal of the father of John Payne's romantic lead and being the robbery mastermind. The movie moves swiftly from Kansas City where Payne's character Joe Rolfe is before Miranda thoroughly grilled to where he takes over the identity of gangster Phil Harris who was one of the robbers. This movie is well worth seeing with a decent ending.
