It is an nostalgic trip down memory lane. Micheal Tucker and Julie Kavner work off of one another and are perfectly paired for the cracks that they make off of each other. It is one of Diane Weist's best performances. She is one of Woody's favorite actress' especially when she appeared in Hannah and Her Sisters. Supporting cast superb; Josh Mostel extremely funny as Uncle Abe; and the cameos by old radio people were really enjoyable.<br /><br />I knew Diane Keaton sings but I didn't know how well until she did that number for New Year's Party. <br /><br />Perfect for the New Year viewing and nostalgic at the same time; this is one of my favorite films of the past twenty years. No matter how may times I watch it I always enjoy it.
