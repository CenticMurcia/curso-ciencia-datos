Good characters and a well written script always left me wondering where the plot was heading next. I love non-obvious storytelling something you don't often see in movies these days - where it all seems to be about the formula that they think will draw audiences.<br /><br />Bill Murray has hit a stride in recent years. He's found the perfect characters for his personality. Another stellar job.<br /><br />And once again Wes Anderson joins a few other recent directors in weaving great music into his movies. Why is it when (commericial) radio seems to have sunk to new lows in quality and originality, movies seem to be soaring to new heights in choosing good creative music.
