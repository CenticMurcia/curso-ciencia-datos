As an Arab Muslim, I am mostly impressed at the effort that went into researching various verses in Quran, the understandable Arabic spoken by Mr. Cheadle, and the 'correct' way that he did his prayers. I am used to people not praying correctly and putting in a show for the Camera. Mr. Cheadle was praying correctly. He has researched his role very well.<br /><br />The movie itself was excellent. The views presented of a more moderate Islam that abhors the violence on civilians and that does not support the more radical version is greatly appreciated. We are the silent majority.<br /><br />Well done to the team.<br /><br />AND thanks for a researched movie, and a balanced view.<br /><br />Thank You.
