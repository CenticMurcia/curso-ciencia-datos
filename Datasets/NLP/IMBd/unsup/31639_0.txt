This is one of the "lost but found" films shown on TCM on 4/4/07. Apparently this and two other films shown that night were held out of public release due to litigation concerning royalties and now the powers that be at Turner Classic Movies have taken care of the licensing issues. Of the three films shown that night, none of them were great treasures but all three were excellent--very solid examples of the type of films RKO made during the era. Normally, when you think of RKO in 1933, you think KING KONG or Astaire and Rogers as a team, but there were other good films that might rank just below them in quality and entertainment.<br /><br />One of the big reasons I saw this film (aside from the fact that I am a major old movie junkie) is that it featured William Powell--one of my favorite old movie stars. While this WAS one of his movies, he was not exactly the same type of funny and sophisticated guy he later played in the Thin Man films or in LIBELED LADY. Instead, he was a rich playboy who was a little less likable, though he was honest enough to tell his girlfriend (plaed by Ann Harding) that he wanted to be a playboy and didn't want deep commitment. Ms. Harding, though a nice person, was determined to marry him so she concocts a plan to trick him into feeling he must marry her. She is successful, though afterwards her victory seems very hollow. How all this is deftly resolved is pretty clever and interesting and makes this film well worth seeing.<br /><br />The acting and writing are excellent despite this being a less than big budget sort of production. It's a good example of a "Pre-Code" film as topics such as adultery and premarital sex are actually discussed--something that would probably NOT been allowed after the new and strict Production Code was enacted in 1934-35. While the topics were NOT dealt with in a salacious manner, the adult aspects of this film make it pretty timeless and topical today.
