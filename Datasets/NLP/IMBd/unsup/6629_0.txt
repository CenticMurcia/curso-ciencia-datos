I thoroughly enjoyed the first movie. But the sequel was horrible. Only Prince Edvard is the same actor. All the others have been replaced and the main characters personalities and the qualities that made you love them are just not there. There's a line in the first movie... Paige's mom says to Paige... "chemistry doesn't just happen in the class room and you two have it." They did... but they lost it. There is no on screen chemistry between Edvard and Paige in 2! It was just somebody trying to carry on the flame of a fairytale that was already that wonderful afterglow. They destroyed the beauty of the first movie by trying to find a replacements for its remarkable cast ! Just can't be done! PS Where'd his sister go? Just wondering.
