The funny thing about this movie is how dumb it is. It's stupid plot line is what makes it funny. You have to see this when you get drunk though, because it will be a whole night full of laughs. The deal with the credits rolling at the end with the voice over is enough to make you laugh for weeks. Not only that, just how dumb "Sam" or "Uncle Sam" really is when it comes to killing.
