Although WILBUR WANTS TO KILL HIMSELF is an honest and unflinching look at death and suicide, it manages to evoke overwhelming feelings of compassion and tenderness. Lone Scherfig, the director, has crafted a moving characterization of how individuals respond to the loss of love. Wilbur, played by Jamie Sives, is despondent over the the death of his parents, and he has made numerous attempts at suicide to end his pain. He and his older brother manage the family business, a ramshackle used bookstore. And, when his brother becomes romantically involved with a woman, it seems Wilbur has inadvertently stumbled upon a reason to live. At first, it seems that he is animated by his brother's good fortune, but soon he finds himself romantically drawn to, Alice, his brother's lover and wife to be. Shirley Henderson is resplendent as Alice. She authentically expresses an irresistible yet forbidden attraction to Wilbur, while simultaneously displaying deep affection for Harbour, Wilbur's brother. As the narrative becomes even more tangled, yet never contrived, we are drawn to the true heart of the film-Lone Scherfig's deft and loving examination of the characters' interactions. And throughout all of the gloom and melancholy, the film always manages a light and almost playful tone. Do not let the downbeat subject of this film put you off, WILBUR WANTS TO KILL HIMSELF is truly a heartwarming experience.
