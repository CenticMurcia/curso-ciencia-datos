I rented this movie and was sadly disappointed. First the print of the DVD was very bad. Okay, so that's not the filmmaker's fault. Fine. Next, the characters were boring and not interesting at all! Usually in a giallo, there are sleazy and/or interesting people. Not here. Secondly, the murders were boring and lacked style. The one thing I will say is that perhaps if I saw a better print of the movie I would have had a better experience. Also, the "raspy voice" of the killer in the beginning was effective. And the whole revelation was pretty plausible for a giallo. Just wait for Blue Underground or someone to put out a better copy.
