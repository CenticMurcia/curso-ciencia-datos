Utter piece of trash, I can't believe I actually watched it all the way to the end. Speaking of the ending, I have to admit I didn't see it coming. Probably because I stopped paying close attention after ten minutes. I won't spoil it for you, but hopefully you won't ever be watching this c - - p. Reading the back of a cereal box would have been a better use of time than watching this movie.<br /><br />That said, there are a few fascinating things about this movie. There is, of course, the obvious: fascinatingly bad direction, writing and acting. The other is, where did they find actors with mouths this big? I mean, honest, they all make Julia Roberts' mouth look petite. You can't help but just watch these people talk... it's like watching alien lifeforms. I notice on some of the cast's filmographies here on IMDb they've done nothing much else but this movie. Thank God. We've all been spared. I hope the director and scriptwriter realize they ought to be selling real estate and stay out of the movie business.
