The only thing I'd like to add here is that, my friend had a video store on the Upper East Side (Manhattan) in the early-mid 80s, and Joyce Schneider walked in one day (1986?) promoting this film. The story as I've heard it was she told him "you walk down 42nd street these days and what do you see? F-ck films and Fight films...F-ck films and Fight films...so I decided to write a film with both!"...and he bought a copy of the film and we wore it out in the basement. Among the highlights of the film are Jerry Butler's and Ron Jeremy's Kung-Fu-Fighting battle (reminiscent of the Day of the Jackal) and the all-time classic "revenge of the waiter" scene with Joey Silvera and Jerry taking their revenge on a pinched tart in Leo Lindy's in Times Square.<br /><br />42nd St? F-ck films and Fight films? Yes, it was the "mean streets" of 1980s Times Square, before the Disneyfied, Shrager'd, Giulani'd Times Square took hold. It was a badge of honor to be mugged in Times Square back then, when you'd have to beg for a token (!) from the Times Square Police Station (now an Army recruiting outpost) when your wallet got lifted in the balcony during a Bruce Lee triple-feature.<br /><br />Anyway, back to the film...Lisa DeLeeuw turns in a great performance as a jaded porn director trying to cash in on a young hunk ("that's how I like them...young, dumb and hung!") while putting in a lesbian scene and then getting sodomized by her now-assertive "protege". Taija Rae is the (chubby) sweet girl next door (who will do double(you-know-what)), while Joey, Gerry, and Ron raise hell and remind you of why the porn industry is not what it's cracked up to be.<br /><br />Enjoy this film...it's a slice of NY and porn from the '80s.
