Pretty bad as compared to Top Gun and Flight of the Intruder.<br /><br />Stock crap and only one flight director..... Yeah right People don't age in 10 years ????? I like the scenes at the Air force base , where they steal the F117, with all the private planes all around... uh huh. The Navy officer in a Naval Uniform being addressed as Colonel ???? Ice T is supposed to be acting ?????<br /><br />Wasted performance by William Sandler.
