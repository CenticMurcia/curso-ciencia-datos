Rock school (more like a platform for a frank Zappa fan). not much rock other than Zappa. I love Zappa don't mistake it. I saw the film over a month ago so I don't recall the teachers name, however I think he is a idiot, i have to give him credit for being different...and sharing his love of music with kids but its outbursts seamed like a mimic of the classic "rock" artist. rebel, outcast, temper...the guys not on the road with frank Zappa, hes teaching music to kids. tough love works yes, but not in every case. I have been playing guitar for thirteen years, and as a guitar player I am sensitive, had a teacher treated me like that I would have whacked him upside the head with my guitar. Anyway There is a part where the ass**** teacher is playing a blues type jam, and had said he hates it when a student is better then him, well it seams that is easy cause he sucks, he had no licks, no soul and no vibrato...then the film seams to play him up as the "mentor" when your ear can tell you he blows.... what grounds then does he have for yelling at the kids, when his own playing fails to impress..The one kid I hope keeps rocking is the 12 year old who at the end plays a amazing solo, kids got it....(teacher don't) thats all oh yeah, most adults who act like the butt monkey teacher end up profiled as weird........aside from the yelling I act the same way its fine, however I play a meaner blues and I am not as much of a honker as said butt monkey....Ps I know my grammar sucks, then again this is not about me........Peace movie fans M.Run
