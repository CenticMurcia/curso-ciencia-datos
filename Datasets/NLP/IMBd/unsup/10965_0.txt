Movies about relationships are nothing new, but this is one of few I've seen that gives equal time to both the male and female perspectives. I wonder how much of it was scripted and how much of it was ad-libbed, because there was a very natural feel to the way the characters expressed themselves. They seemed like real people. Heather Graham should do more films like this--talky, ad-libbed, grown-up relationship movies, which is what she excels at (Two Girls And A Guy). She doesn't need to play dumb blondes and prostitutes all the time. Brittany Murphy plays another quirky character, but like always, she shows that she can play quirky in a variety of ways (Clueless, Don't Say A Word, Girl Interrupted). The unfolding romance with the at-first unlikable David Krumholtz is surprisingly touching. However, I think less time should have been spent on Stanley Tucci's love triangle and more on the Heather Graham-Edward Burns relationship, and more Rosario Dawson. I wish everybody would stop complaining about how they can't find a decent guy or girl out there, when they really need to examine themselves first to see if they are even "decent" and ready for a real relationship.
