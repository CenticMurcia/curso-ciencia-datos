The only thing worse than a boring movie, is an overly long boring movie. I was hoping for a nice, intelligent look at war, but instead got a 2 1/2 hour navel-gazing session. If you like introspection and more internal-thought-voice-overs than dialogue, and fighting scenes shorter than the actual credits, then this is the movie for you...<br /><br />I enjoyed Woody Harrelson's mishap with a grenade and Nick Nolte's gruff and manic officer, but apart from that I found myself rooting for the Japanese to wipe out the lot of them.
