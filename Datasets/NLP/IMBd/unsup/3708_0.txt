This is a very well made war movie, though I've got to admit that this is a genre that usually doesn't do that much for me. What sets this movie apart is its strong desire for realism--instead of a Hollywood version of war, this WAS war as it really appeared. Fanatics who love realism will really be pleased about this. Plus, it focuses on the Korean War, a period in our history that is generally ignored in movies.<br /><br />Gregory Peck does a fine job in the lead, though I thought he looked a little old to be such a fine career soldier and only a lieutenant. At his age, he could have easily been playing colonels or even a general.<br /><br />The supporting cast are a lot of then unknowns who later went on to more visible careers. Watch the movie and see all the familiar faces.<br /><br />About the only negative of this movie is its pace. It involves one engagement and seems a bit "claustrophobic" or static at times, as you have trench after trench and explosion after explosion. Still, it's pretty good stuff.
