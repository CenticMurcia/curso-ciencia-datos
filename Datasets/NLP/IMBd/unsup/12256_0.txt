Having been allowed behind the scene access during this tour, I have to say that everything you see in these videos truly portrays JJ Cale in the most accurate way possible.<br /><br />The film moves slow, sometimes to the point of boring. But, that's the "laid back" feel you're supposed to get. Waiting for a train to pass, sitting in a parking lot playing guitar. This is the calm, relaxed way John leads his life. Definitely something to look up to considering his financial wealth.<br /><br />The interviews with Eric Clapton are great. He puts Cale on a pedestal (so to say) and credits him properly. I admire that.<br /><br />This film has finally been released in the US as well and definitely worth a look for those interested in the Tulsa Sound, the roots of popular music, and of course, JJ Cale himself.
