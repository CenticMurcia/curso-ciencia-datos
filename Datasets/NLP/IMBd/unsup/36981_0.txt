adam sandler is probably my worst actor of all time, the only good film he's ever been in is air heads when he wasn't popular. i don't hate this film because i was a young teen when this came out and did find it pretty funny but never thought it was good. adam sandler should do something else besides acting, maybe a tea boy ha ha. i'm sorry adam but you ain't fooling me with your silly acting. he's just trying to copy jim carrey in which jim carrey isn't so great in his silly performances either. i would recommend this film to people who just want to chill out and watch a film with no thoughts put into it. other than that just leave this film on the shelfs at the shops ........3/10.......j.d seaton
