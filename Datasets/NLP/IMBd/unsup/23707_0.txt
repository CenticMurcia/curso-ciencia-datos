A leading critic had exclaimed that "Dev" is an average Film yet is Important. "Dev" is important as it provides a clear picture of Indian Politician's brawny involvement in Hindu-Muslim Rifts. "Dev" although not based on any true story but is Reminiscent of many alleged political events which led to Hindu-Muslim Riots.<br /><br />The Fatal drawback is the lack of intense drama which Nihalani is expert in making. It seems that Nihalani left over all the Dramatic strength which was endowed in Ardh Satya, Droh Kaal & Thakshak.<br /><br />"Dev" is Govind Nihalani's second commercial venture this time with superstar Amitach Bachchan. The first combination of India's finest Director & Finest Actor gave a lot of expectations. But I shall not say that those expectations were shattered completely. Nihalani's work is an extract of his distinct Art. His Non - "larger than life" approach is unique factor responsible to induce solemn reality.<br /><br />"Dev" is a story about two friends, Joint Commissioner of Police Dev Pratap Singh played by Amitabh Bachchan & Commissioner Tejinder Khosla played by Om Puri. Just when we thought that "Dev" is a film about The Good defying The Evil, we are wrong. Dev is not a conventional story which we see in all Cop movies. The Film is Primarily based on Ideologies. The Different Ideologies which the two best friends have and their efforts to justify it.<br /><br />"Dev" starts & ends with two close friends who are cops, while having their drinks, shares each others ideologies on backdrop of Hindu-Muslim Rifts. The Rifts are created by Political ensemble which the common man are not so aware of. The Focus is then laid on a small Muslim Community area, where the young muslims are getting carried away by their leader's fanatic guidelines. Nihalani shows, that the reason for religious fanaticism is a result of non-acceptance of minorities which in turn is due to fanaticism and the cycle goes on. The Anti-Social activists from the minority community, when get nabbed down by the Police, results a provocation by the leaders to protest the Police simultaneously provoking the formation of more Anti-social elements.<br /><br />Dev has an ethical morals and a holistic view of crime & justice. He believes in providing complete justice to anyone irrespective of his/her minor or major presence in the community. But Tej has concentric view and believes in exterminating the Anti-social elements & terrorism by the System supported by Politicians. While doing so, Tej also believes that there's no injustice even if the innocents are exterminated. Here Tej & the Chief Minister works hand in hand, while they remain dormant during Hindu attacks on Muslim. Dev is found alone in his struggle to support the Muslims get their Justice.<br /><br />Finally Dev reports the Political-Police driven Riot scandal to the top authorities. The Last scene discovers, that the movie is more a focus on ideologies. Two friends can have different beliefs in the same system. May be both are right. Dev selects to do what he feels right even if he have to sacrifice the age old friendship.<br /><br />The Philosophical ideas exhibited in this movie is by far superior than any other Nihalani movies. The Conversation between Dev & Tej are prime scene stealers.<br /><br />Kareena Kapoor as Muslim witness to the riot is fantastic. Fardeen Khan as the carried away extremist, needs to improve a lot. Om Puri is just superb. Finally its Big B Amitabh Bachchan gives full justice to "Dev". The Final dialog is splendid when he says the Moral of Story : "A Soldier's duty is to fight, fight till the last drop of blood, irrespective of whether the war shall be won or not"
