A tough rough sea captain named Thorne Sherman (James Best), love interest Ann Craigis (Ingrid Goude), hot-headed boyfriend Jerry (Ken Curtis), two scientists and a token black and token Latino guy are stuck on an island during a hurricane with large killer shrews running loose. The scientists developed them to deal with overpopulation (!!!) but they escaped. There is a boat offshore...but how will they get to it with the shrews running around? You won't really care.<br /><br />Pretty silly with a stupid script (come on--large killer shrews???) and laughable dialogue. The shrews themselves look like what they are--either puppets or dogs with extra fur on them and fake fangs. Nothing is shown when the shrews attack someone and the first ones to die are (of course) the black guy then the Latino. If this were a good movie I would find that offensive. The sets are cheap (it shows) and the ending is howlingly bad.<br /><br />Acting isn't that good. Best is terrible--he just stands around with a blank look on his face and yells orders. Goude is certainly beautiful but no actress. She tries but it's no go. However her wavering Swedish accent was amusing. Curtis is stuck with the stock villain role and he's not half bad. Everybody else are stuck in clich√©d roles and play them out as best as they can.<br /><br />This played constantly on a local TV station back in the 1970s. I was in high school then and thought it was silly but fun. Now it comes across as VERY silly and more than a little campy. If you're in the mood you might enjoy this for laughs. Otherwise stay far away.
