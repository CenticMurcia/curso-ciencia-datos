First thing to think about: Don't enter this movie thinking a serious horror movie. It's nothing like that. I guess in a way I blame myself for not liking it, expecting something at least a little bit like Dead Silence.<br /><br />This movie is mainly a comedy, or at least I thought so, because I was not frightened one bit. The voice of the dummy is not scary it all, in fact it reminded me a little of Chris from Family Guy.<br /><br />The soundtrack is the worst of recent films. Painful songs that they play over and over again.<br /><br />Don't expect any cleverness or thrills from this flick. You may get some laughs, but overall, this movie is not good.
