I disagree with the other person's comments.<br /><br />I found this film to be one-sided (i.e propaganda) in its portrayal of a Mormon missionary.<br /><br />Which is fine, but just boring for a movie.<br /><br />Sorry the other person seems to have a chip on his/her shoulder in defending this movie.<br /><br />But I found it sugar-coated while avoiding some deeper issues - like what is the traditional spirituality of these people that the Mormon missionary was replacing.<br /><br />The movie glorifies religious colonialism - so if that bothers you, you may not want to waste your time on this movie.<br /><br />However, if you want to learn how the narcissism of missionaries and religious zealots works, it's a good example.
