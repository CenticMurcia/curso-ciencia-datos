This is one of the most original visions and personal ever made in cinema about ancient Rome. It has all the mood and spirit of the classic Rome mentality and artistic way of life. Only an Italian could have describe this distant world so well and accurate.<br /><br /> Everything in the production is carefully chosen and every detail has this very Fellinian touch of dreams and reality touching the very essence of the human life, and our psychology. This is an art master piece that shows what a movie should look like and makes us remember that films can be the most powerful artistic expression. the best scenes are the roman undergrounds full of whores and weirdos, also the big orgy scene is a classic with a very perfect direction, really good photo and artistic direction.
