First off, I will say that there are some good things about the rehash of Friday the 13th. Though I was less than thrilled when they announced they were remaking one of my favourite franchises from the 80s, a little part of me wanted to see how they will remake this.<br /><br />What's good about the film? The quality of film-making is much improved. Technically speaking, it's an attractive, modestly-budgeted film with great special effects. As well, the first 15 minutes of the film are strong, summarizing the plot of the first two films (Mother's massacre, Jason's revenge) and showing Jason as a stronger, meaner killing machine. It even gives a glimpse of how Jason actually lives, stealing from townsfolk and hiding in the woods, left to fend for himself.<br /><br />Now... what's wrong with it? The characters are extremely unlikeable. Aside from the three leads (Jenna, Whitney, Clay), I cringed at most of the one-dimensional, obnoxious characters, even though the acting were fine. This is a contrast from the older films, where the characters were memorable and most of the acting was bad.<br /><br />The plot holes. So let me get this straight... Jason is in the woods for all of his life, killing tons of people; yet the cops have no idea that anything is going on. "People go missing every day". The townsfolk don't, either. And, the majority of the plot takes place in a beautiful (and well kept) house in the woods owned by a character's rich father who goes there frequently... they never had a chance run-in with the maniac living in the woods for the past 20 years? <br /><br />The lack of subtlety. The old films flirted with peek-a-boo nudity, mild language and quick kills, making it fun to watch and more effective. This one features full-on, almost explicit sex, F-bombs dropping almost every minute, and long, drawn out, unpleasant kills that make it more tuned for the "Saw" or "Hostel" crowd. I'll note now that I'm not a prude, I have no problems with sex and violence, but sometimes less is more.<br /><br />All in all, I didn't hate Friday the 13th, but I hope five years from now I'll be watching Friday the 13th The Remake Part 5. Sadly, if they do make one I know I'll probably watch it.
