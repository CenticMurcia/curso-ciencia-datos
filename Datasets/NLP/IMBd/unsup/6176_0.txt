Opinion from the former USSR. My childhood has coincided with our Reorganization and disintegration of the USSR and then at us information freedom, which was not in the USSR, has begun, and has appeared a lot of western, especially American, films, cartoon films, music. I saw very many, much was pleasant to me were a favorite "Ninza Turtles", and from "ThunderCats" I then saw only one episode (about huge spiders), but they have sunk down to me in soul and later 20 years they (ThunderCats) is my favorite cartoon serial from serious (and from comic - "The Pink Panther") and I now try to extract a full serial on disks in the original (without a translation into Russian).
