*May contain spoilers in reference to thematically important quotes*<br /><br />What first caught my eye about this movie was the title: Dark Prince: The "True" Story of Dracula. After watching the film, and doing research on my own, I have found that this was not the historically accurate movie I was anticipating. However, in the respect of creating a movie based on some historical events and linking them to present day folklore about the literary figure, well done. I will admit that if the movie was made to be totally accurate, I probably would not have liked it as much as I did. <br /><br />To comment on the plot line, by making this movie action packed, romantic, and dramatic in illustrating the possible goodness within a man who has been known for terrible deeds, this satisfied many of the characteristics that I like to see in a movie. <br /><br />The casting was also excellent, especially for Vlad, the attractive Rudolf Martin whose looks scream Dracula in this movie as they did in "Buffy the Vampire Slayer"; and Lidia, the petite Jane March whose voice and looks expertly display the quiet yet strong religious character. The personalities of Vlad and Lidia perfectly compliment one another to create the drama the two share and show the power of love between them. *I loved the constant reference of walking with each other in the providing a good romantic connection as well.<br /><br />Another merit for the movie was the soundtrack: a well selected arrangement of background music that seemed to fit perfectly whenever it was played. <br /><br />Whether it is the acting, the plot line, or just the general topic of Dracula, I always come back to this movie as being one of my favorites. I would have loved to see it go on for more than 90 minutes, but at face value, a definite must see film for entertainment purposes, which is why it receives a 9 from me. However, do not let the "true" story fool you, for being a biography, this would get a 4 or 5.
