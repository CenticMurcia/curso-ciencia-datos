Ok maybe I overdid it in the opening line. My point is what a wonderful talent Gene Wilder is. He can take a relatively normal character and turn it into hilarious comedy, such as he did in the producers, silver streak, and this movie. His character was basically the whole movie. The wonderful thing about watching Wilder is you never get the feeling that he is desperately trying to be funny. It just comes natural to him. There are only two other comedians that add such spice to their parts, Woody Allen and Grouch Marx.<br /><br /> Aside from Wilder the movie was pretty funny though it was boring at times, such as the end, where it turned into an action film more than a comedy, much the same that silver streak did. I would rate this movie as funnier than silver streak but silver streak was a better movie.<br /><br />
