WARNING DISBELIEVERS Now i know the scary movie franchises aren't perfect but they are still the only thing i see in the cinema even close to being funny like this. Maybe scary movie 3 lacked the split you side in a roar of laughter factor but it was still decent enough for the franchise.I hope though that the franchise ends at 5 as i don't want it to go on and start to get boring.Whenever i watch these films i cant help but kill myself laughing and really i don't know how people can find these films even the slightest bit unfunny.<br /><br />As i said these films are not the perfection of its kind and they are not the most....Polite, of their genre but i still stand by that these are great films with the help of the one and only Leslie Nielson and Anna Farris with some extra help from Charlie Sheen and Bill Pullman you cant go wrong
