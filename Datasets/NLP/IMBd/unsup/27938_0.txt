RGV must be praised those days for trying something new<br /><br />One such adventure which was latter tried by others is DARNA MANA HAI(03) of having multiple stories in 1 film<br /><br />The film however falls short of expectations though it's novel<br /><br />The different stories are:<br /><br />Sohail- Antra Bad and boring Acting- Sohail has nothing to do, Antra is okay<br /><br />Sanjay- Shilpa This story lacks logic which can be ignored but the treatment could be better, especially the portions showing characters making weird faces while eating apples is too much Yet a decent story Shilpa acts very well while Sanjay is okay Rajpal leaves a mark<br /><br />Vivek- Nana this is the best story and handled very well though it doesn't make much sense and they are flaws but that is forgiven The story makes for an edge of a seat story Acting wise Nana is brilliant as usual while Vivek too does a great job<br /><br />Aftab- Isha This story which was latter made as GAYAB(03) has it's moments and the scenes involving Aftab and his power is well handled The culmination too is good but some people may not agree with the story Acting- Aftab is very good and Isha is okay<br /><br />Saif- Boman This story is implausible but entertaining and well handled though flimsy Acting Boman and Saif are superb <br /><br />Raghuvir Yadav This story is well handled too Acting- Raghuvir Yadav excels<br /><br />The worst part of the film is the main story which appears too bad and the scenes involving the college friends are badly handled and the culmination of the film too is horrible<br /><br />Amongst rest Sameera is okay, Gaurav leaves a mark Sushant is okay
