This movie claims to be "The Sequel To The Box Office Hit", so the tagline goes. That's complete nonsense. This movie just is a random offshoot of the original "American Psycho," which is an amazing movie. It tells the story of Rachel Newman, played by "That 70's Show'"s Mila Kunis. Rachel is apparently the one who caught Patrick Bateman and killed him when she was a young girl, something that was never mentioned anywhere in the first film. And also, weren't the murders in the first film just a crazy dream the Patrick Bateman made up? I guess that's just my interpretation, but if it is correct, than this whole movie is just a dream. William Shatner is poorly cast as Rachel's adulterous professor and he just simply looks like he doesn't want to be there. If you're looking for a good laugh, look no further. But if you're looking for the sequel to the original "American Psycho," than keep searching.
