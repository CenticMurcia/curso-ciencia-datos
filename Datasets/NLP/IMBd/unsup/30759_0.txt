The Last Seduction was one of those marvellous indie thrillers that pops up all too rarely, it had wonderful direction, a script as snappy as suspenders and a cast that chewed the scenery in all the right places.<br /><br />This lame sequel has none of that.<br /><br />Everything about this film reminded me of a cheap porno without the sex; the acting, the sets, the script, it's all just too wooden. You can see how hard they're trying, it's written all over the actors' faces, but there's just nothing I would recommend about this film. If you liked the original the temptation might be there to watch this as a curiosity, but trust me, it's just not worth it, there's nothing here. This isn't 'cult' bad it's just bad bad.
