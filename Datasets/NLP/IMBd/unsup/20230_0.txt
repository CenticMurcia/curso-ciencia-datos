This is a fabulous picture that redefines documentaries. This is the real SHE GOT SERVED. Yes, there are some missing explanations and to put the contest in the middle seems a little odd But OK. Contrast this to TV doc's that are talking heads. I see LGF did about 3.0 million with it-pretty good for a very limited subject. One could argue with the African cutting but th editing and cross cutting was brilliant-yes, the insight may be not the greatest but we've never seen it before I loved that the director was able to get away with putting the dancing to different kinds of music-even the hymn-and it still worked. Cpyright was 2002-does this style even exist anymore ? As the kid said- the style change every day. Go back and look at Charlie Ahern's WILD STYLE from about 1992
