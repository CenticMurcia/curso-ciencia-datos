Inuyasha is a very interesting and unique show. When I first began watching it I loved it and tried to watch every episode, but after a while my interest in Inuyasha began to fade and I found myself tuning out around the time the episode count rounded 80, the problem was that the show began to progress at a snail's pace and we were all left with these story plots repeated over and over again in a slightly altered fashion each turn: 1. Kagome gets kidnapped, Inuyasha saves her and there are several hints of a romantic relationship between the two of them shown. 2. A stupid misadventure with Shippo. 3. Naraku comes and does something evil, they nearly stop him but he escapes. 4. Kohaku comes back and we get another episode where Sango must face her conflicting emotions. (It was good the first three times, after that it got boring.) 5. Inuyasha and friends help out a person in need. (Nost likely some one with a demon problem, shikon shards are usually involved.)<br /><br />Mainly, Inuyasha is a very good series up until the midway point, don't get me wrong, there are still several episodes that are good after episode 100 but later on in the series most of the characters you have come to love begin to have nothing to do except for stand on the sidelines while Inuyasha fights and they occasionally interfere.<br /><br />I give it a 7/10.
