I have played many games in my life, but none of them ever made me feel the way Max Payne did. It had a life, an emotion that most games fail to show. This Game was mean't to be made into a movie, just not this movie.<br /><br />Hero fell short in almost every way. The shoot out was confusing, the audience never understood where people where so we never believe it. Cardboard doesn't block bullets. Why does Max dive into the open? Why does everyone stink at shooting? There are too many times that Max is in the open and being shot at. I could have hit him, I don't shoot Guns very often. Why is Max a kid? He looks to be like 18 or 19. For all directors out there, remember that slow motion is a trick to be use rarely. If you over do it, it loses it's cool factor. I am sad to see that someone had all the things you need to make a cool action scene and have him throw it away on something so amateur. I am happy in a way, there is still an opening for a good film maker to make a wonderful Max Payne film.
