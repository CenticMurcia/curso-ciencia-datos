*minor spoilers*<br /><br />This movie is heinous beyond words and expression. Sure, no one is expecting Citizen Kane, or maybe even another Conan, but this is supposed to be entertaining with swords and magic. We have plenty of cartoon characters running at each other with swords, but absolutely zero entertainment to speak of. The dialogue is atrocious and hilarious together. When it tries to be serious, forcing cartoons like Sorbo and Tia to act, it becomes comical and humorous. This is actually good fodder for MST3K. Too bad they don't exist anymore.<br /><br />The story was basically written by a group of kindergarten kids. Big evil person wants to takeover the world. Enter reluctant hero who happens to dig heavy metal and rock. That pretty much sums up Kull the Conqueror, heh.<br /><br />If you really want to laugh with your friends, by all means watch this.<br /><br />1/10
