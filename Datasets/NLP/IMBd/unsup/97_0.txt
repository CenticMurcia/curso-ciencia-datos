I rate it a 10 by how it affected me when I first saw it on television years ago, probably '78 or '79. I've only seen it once, yet I still remember it, and thanks to IMDb, I finally found the info on it. It might be horrible if I viewed it now, some things don't hold up well through the years. That being said, all I can remember is laying on the floor watching the television and beating the carpet I was laughing so hard, and my best friend called screaming through the phone, wheezing like he was going to die--he was watching it also. We didn't throw up, but we definitely couldn't breathe, it was that good at the time. I hope it comes out someday on DVD so I can give it the test. Until then, I still fondly give it a 10. (And Leonard Maltin is not right a lot of the time! Don't let him sway you.)
