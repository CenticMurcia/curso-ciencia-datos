Absolutely the worst piece of crap my brother and I have seen. The movie looked to be an interesting action movie early on, but became totally unbelievable and stupid as the movie progressed. It simply insults the intelligence of the viewer! People in the audience were laughing at how dumb, and I mean dumb, this movie was. The acting was horrible. The plot, what plot? The "marine" was indestructible. The bad guys fought among themselves and acted like a bunch of morons. After intense fighting scenes, the characters didn't have scratches or torn clothing. Everything was predictable. I honestly can not recall seeing a movie as bad as this one. The producer of this movie should be ashamed! Absolutely do not recommend wasting even a dollar at a dollar theater for this one!
