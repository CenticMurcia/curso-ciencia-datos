Peter Graves gives the most dramatic speech of the 50's at the very end of this flick. Fast forward to 60 minutes (of a 70 minute movie) to catch all the action and the harrowing conclusion of..."It Conquered the World"!<br /><br />"He learned almost too late...that man is a feeling creature. And because of it the greatest in the universe. He learned too late for himself that men have to find their own way to make their own mistakes. There can't be any gift of perfection from outside theirselves. And when men seek such perfection, they find only death...fire...loss...disillusionment; the end of everything thats gone forward. Men have always sought the end of toil and misery, but it can't be given. It has to be achieved! There is hope, but it has to come from inside...of the man himself."<br /><br />
