Twin Falls Idaho is kind of like the new "The Elephant Man." Except, Twin falls is superior to Elephant in almost every way. The Polish Bros. debut film is a film of great brilliance and triumph. The film is heartbreaking, but it never milks its tears unfairly. If there are any faults, it's the film's length. Worth seeing.
