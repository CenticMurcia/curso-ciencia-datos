The music score of Jerry Golsmith for PAPILLON is great. However, I didn't find a very important part : in the movie, during the 2nd escape of Papillon with Maturette and Clusiot, the prison's orchestra plays a music...<br /><br />I've always wanted to know what was this music, because I found it very appropriate with the action. I supposed it was "classical music" since it was not on the official score of Jerry Goldsmith. But I didn't find it in the credits either, so I made my own search and I found it ! <br /><br />It was "FAUST" composed by Charles GOUNOD in 1859.<br /><br />...
