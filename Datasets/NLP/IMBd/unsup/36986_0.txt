Awful! Just saw it and could not understand the concept of the movie. Reading the comments posted almost makes me feel as if I do not understand cinema.<br /><br />The storyline is implausible, the humor crass, satire entirely lost; I wonder what was Meyer thinking when he made the movie! And what was the ending all about!?? I fail to see any symbolism or any metaphor. It is plain lunacy in a movie on display. The hero keeps on running and running and running .......<br /><br />If the movie was only meant to show the assets of the female characters, a la porn flick, it would have passed muster.<br /><br />Only redeeming feature - Shari Eubanks has some memorable moments and she is beautiful! Please do not waste your time and money. Will never venture for another weird world of Russ Meyers!
