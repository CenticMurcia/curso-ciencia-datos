My God, what a rip-off! Dutch comedy at its lowest level, with your fair share of unfunny slapstick, simplistic misogynism and very stupid jokes. Even Luc Besson has not ever sunk to this level... <br /><br />Can you blame the actors? Well, no second-rate soap actor would of course refuse a part in such a blockbuster, but I must say that I was disappointed by the fact that Jack Wouterse (who was magnificent in Temmink) accepted his part. Is it so hard to get a decent role these days? Or did he just misread the script? <br /><br />The only reason why I give this movie 2/10 instead of 1/10 is the aircraft scene, which was quite spectacular. So just watch the aircraft scene and move on to some thing else.
