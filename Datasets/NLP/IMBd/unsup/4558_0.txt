Linkin Park has been my favorite band since I was about 10. From the moment I heard their music I knew, that I was going to stand by their side forever. I'm proud to be one of their biggest fans! <br /><br />When I saw the DVD in the store I just had to buy it! I mean, it was LP, and I had searched for something like that for years!!! So two minutes later it was mine. (My friend bought it too)I was expecting some live performances and videos, but when I first saw it I realized it was so much more! It was kinda like "behind the scenes" stuff and it just cracked me up!It's like, every time I see it I feel like I know these guys better and better. I didn't know those guys were that funny! I was exited to see how my heroes were like, and I didn't get disappointed! :D <br /><br />A must-have for all LP fans!
