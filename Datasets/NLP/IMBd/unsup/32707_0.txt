OK, I like serious drama films and I am a big horror fan. This one tried to mix them together and I was pretty bored. For a werewolf movie I was expecting somewhat brutal kill scenes and I was hoping to to see a man to werewolf transformation. No on both. This was trying to be a movie with a message about a mystical group of "Wolfen" who have been demolished due to western civilization. By the end of this, I could really care less about the wolfen's back story. The "wolfens" are really just wolves running around throughout the movie. They look cute just like a Siberian huskey. There is nothing really scary about them. If you have watched Snow Dogs, you have seen the wolves in this movie. Throughout the movie we are subjected to wolfen vision. I am not kidding. Its like predator vision but more student filmish. The wolfen vision comes at random and sometimes seems unnecessary like a lot of the scenes in this film. We do get to see a Wolfen vision sex scene that is pretty scary in itself. That was the only time I tensed up when watching this. The kill scenes try to be very stylish but we aren't allowed to see anything. You will see a big splash of blood squirt across the camera, a head or hand fly off to the side, or see a wound on someone suddenly appear. I don't know if it was just a budget restriction but u never see a wolfen actually attack someone until the end and its not worth the time. I have seen the lead actor in this act well in other films but here he just talks very monotone, has no personality, and put me to sleep. I would give this one star for a horror film and 5 stars for the effort to make a good drama. So we meet in the middle at 3/10
