when i saw it in a dark saloon. I was really scared.. Nice young actors and 5 great bad guys. They are all perfectly described.. Especially Nejat Isler.. He is really strong in this movie. The violence is used very good in the film. Based on a true story is the scariest part of the film. When you watch it you keep on thinking "Dude.. These are all real...Some people have really been beaten like this and some girls were raped in front of their boyfriends.." So if you are ready to see some real violence..I mean Real! ( because these kinds of things happen in world ) Watch "Barda"..Also if you like it you can watch " Gemide " and "Lalelide Bir Azize" too..
