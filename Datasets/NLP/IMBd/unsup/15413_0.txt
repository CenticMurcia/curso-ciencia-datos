This movie is what you come up with if you take Armaggedon and you mix it with Die Hard. You remove Bruce Willis and make the main character die even harder, but not save anyone. You add a little Lord of the Flies and make it Japanese. Voila!<br /><br />This is a movie that could have been a little shorter. It felt really long at its two hours, however it was surprisingly good. It's a disaster movie where people act disastrously, as the calamity that occurred is affecting the human brain as well.<br /><br />The effects were nice, the emotions in the movie were rather violent for my taste, and I blamed it on Japanese cinema, but it was the magnetic field's fault (or was it? :) ). The script was well done and I thought the actors played well.<br /><br />It's worth a watch, it may surprise you. It was very close to an 8, but the accent put too strongly on human insanity and the length dropped it to 7.
