Two Came Back is a nifty little movie about some young adults who find themselves at the mercy of the ocean and sun as they float on a life raft after their ship goes down. Two Came Back isn't really a movie to get worked up over, or dedicate an entire night too. It's really the kind of movie where you have some free time, you want to relax, you want to grab those potato chips and onion dip and relax on the sofa with a cold soda and find something decent on television. This movie is that decent thing you're looking for; though not amazing, not even great... Two Came Back isn't bad and is a substantial watch. The movie is unrealistic, and I'm not saying its impossible (I didn't read about the true story but I don't deny it), but if you've been sitting on a dinky rubber raft under constant sun for days and days, you're not going to just get a few new sun freckles, sexy tan, and chapped lips. You're gonna be red as a lobster, there's going to be white residue around your lips... the fact that the movie depicted the young adults as merely whimpering for water after days and days of no shade or drink is highly unrealistic, and even still they would've been in worse mental states and other bad physical conditions. Don't let this ruin it for you, though. Once it's done, you'll turn off the television, sit for a minute, maybe rub a few crumbs off your stomach, and feel at least a little content. I don't recommend spending your money on it though; usually a TV station will show it every once in a while.
