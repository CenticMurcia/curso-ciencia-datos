One of my favourite movies - and many people will probably fall asleep or think: "What's the point?". I can't really tell - except that I like that movie. Wonderful scenes, at times very funny (but mostly smiling-funny, no slapping-laughing-out-loud-funny). Give it a chance to find out for yourself.<br /><br />
