This is one of the most awful movies I have ever seen. The last time I saw a movie this bad was the 13th Warrior. This movie is like a XXX movie with all the nudity replaced by pointless fighting. The acting is bad, the fighting is unconvincing while the bad guys stand waiting to be kicked or blasted. The story is pointless and totally predictable. The first scene leads you into thinking that it may be a good movie, but after that it rolls out all the old clich√©s.<br /><br />You actually start feeling sorry for the bad guys after a while, which could have made for an interesting turn-around, but this movie unfortunately has nothing new to add.<br /><br />If you've enjoyed anything Steven Seagal has made since Under Seige, here's another no-brainer for you.<br /><br />Don't waste your time with this: your time would be better spent watching Lethal Weapon or Die Hard for the 20th time.
