A Luc Besson (Léon, The Fith Element, The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc. Angel-A) film with Anne Parillaud (Innocent Blood), Tchéky Karyo(The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc, The Patriot, Kiss of the Dragon) and Jean Reno (Léon , The Crimson Rivers, Godzilla). It doesn't get better than this.<br /><br />The photography by Thierry Arbogast was perfect, especially the blue lighting at the pharmacy scene. It is easy to see why Besson uses him for his films. He is a master.<br /><br />Parillaud was absolutely magnificent in a character that was a strong woman, and a little girl at the same time. She was a profession, but she was also human. To see this instead of the comic book characters we are so familiar with is refreshing.<br /><br />Reno was a perfect cleaner. Hard and professional. Get the mission done.<br /><br />Jean-Hugues Anglade added just the right touch of sensitivity. Outstanding! There are just not enough superlatives to use in describing the acting and action in the film.
