A slasher stalks kids at a....well, at a cheerleader camp, slaughtering them in the macabre ways introduced in the FRIDAY THE 13TH series.<br /><br />Some good gore scenes, some great gratuitous female nudity, some lame one-liners, adds up to a delight for slasher fans. Other need not bother.<br /><br />MPAA: Rated R for graphic violence and gore, nudity, sexuality, and some language.
