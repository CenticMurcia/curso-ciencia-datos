POSSIBLE SPOILERS!! The fear and utter dread continues with part 2 of the Ringu trilogy, set 1 week after the events of the first film. The girlfriend of Takayama tries to solve the mystery of his death by finding his ex-wife and son, and bringing herself deeper into Sadako's life than anyone previously had. The movie is at times frustrating and confusing, at others ingenious, and the scares remain. For the first time, we get the sense of Sadako as a tragic figure, rather than a relentless spirit with the sole purpose of seeking revenge on everyone. She had been alive down that well for a looong time. The tension is less, but the jumpy parts' are increased, terrifying moments including the well scene at the end, the mirror scene, and the treacherous recording scene. Again the acting is flawless, but the most interesting part for me was the fact that minor characters from the first film, get the top billing here. The film is let down by its confusing explanation of the curse, and how to stop it, or harness it, but this is a minor flaw. When you feel your stomach turning inside out, your breath catching in your throat as Sadako floats past barely open doors, you know you're watching an excellent horror movie. And when you turn off the lights, and imagine those nail less fingers stretching for your ankles, you know you won't be able to sleep easily for a while.
