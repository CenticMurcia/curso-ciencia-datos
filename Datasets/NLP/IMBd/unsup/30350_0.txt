"He Was a Quiet Man" is perhaps the most original and unpredictable movie I've ever seen. If you're looking for something "normal", you should probably look elsewhere. <br /><br />A story of an extremely lonely, put-upon, disturbed man who desperately wants to be Somebody. Christian Slater plays this man absolutely brilliantly. In watching his performance, I kept thinking "Where is Christian Slater?" ... Well, he's not even in the neighborhood. Well done, guy! <br /><br />The direction is absolutely amazing: colorful, imaginative, darkly funny, and surreal. Cubicles, and hummingbirds, and talking fish, oh my! <br /><br />While the film is not particularly emotionally satisfying (to say the least), on the cerebral and aesthetic level, it delivers big time. <br /><br />"He Was a Quiet Man" answers the musical question: "Now maniacs will think twice before going crazy." <br /><br />Yessiree.
