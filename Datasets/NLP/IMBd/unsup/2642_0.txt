Oh my god. This show is just hysterical...Those meerkats are just so animated! I love how they run, rub themselves against stuff to mark their territory...If you are looking for quality entertainment, screw E!'s Top 100 Juciest Breakups, watch Meerkat Manor. The narration is GREAT (Sean Astin! Yeah!) and the filming is fantastic. It, of course, incorporates even the meerkats with social problems (I was half expecting the next meerkat to be a drunk.) The greatest thing is how they all move together and how the "rivals" test each other. Ialmost want to insert trumpets when they stampede the offending group, back ends kicking up. And when they run...it is just HILARIOUS. Their tails straight up in the air, bobbing above everything else. And how they climb on everything is beyond amusing. The overall cuteness and intense hilarity of this show will definitely draw you I'm.
