Some kind of mysterious liquid is making animals grow to humongous size. They soon starting attacking humans. Eventually, rats become the dominant species. FOOD OF GODS is bad even by director Bert I. Gordon standards. The visual effects are unrelentingly awful but they take a backseat to the woeful acting of the undistinguished cast. You know you're in for it when the hero is played by none other than Marjoe Gortner, an actor who is creepy even when he's playing it straight. What's more depressing, the fact that this garbage was even made or the fact that screen legend Ida Lupino was reduced to appearing in stuff like this near the end of her career? Based on the novel by H.G. Wells, who must have rolled over in his grave. Like you, he too would surely be rooting for the animals in this mess.
