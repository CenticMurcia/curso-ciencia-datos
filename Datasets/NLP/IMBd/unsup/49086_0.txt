Well o.k.,o.k.,nobody in "Meteor" actually says that - after all,that would be downright plagiarism,but we do have a lot of "hommages",not to say rapine and pillage from thirty years of space movies,every one infinitely better than this travesty. The earth is threatened with destruction by a giant lump of rock,er,that's it really.The world doesn't end - obviously - so the element of suspense is totally absent,as is every other attribute required for an entertaining,involving movie. From the appalling gurning of Mr B.Keith to the hysteria of Mr M.Landau, the acting is embarrassing.Mr S.Connery treats his part with the contempt it deserves - which is considerable.Mr K.Malden is at his rabble - rousing worst and I will draw a veil over the performances of Miss N.Wood and Mr T.Howard,suffice it to say I doubt if they would want to be remembered for them. It is heavy on Cold War "Irony",i.e. the Russians and Americans having to pool their nuclear resources to ward off a threat from outside,a conceit that was hardly original twenty years earlier and which had become very threadbare by the end of the seventies. "Meteor"'s only virtue is in it's comparative brevity - hardly,you might think - sufficient to warrant a viewing.And you'd be right.
