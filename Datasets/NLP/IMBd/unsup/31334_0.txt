Where can I find this on TV again? We noticed they took channel 7 off in our line up of programs. We can't seem to find where they sent all our favorite programs to. I love the way they set up the plot and all the crime scene information. Smacking Tony on the head is kinda getting boring , but, it seems to be more of an affectionate smack now. My husband and I love this show. Abbey is our favorite. This girl seems to know everything about everything. She is so pretty too! We love the plots. Ducky rocks! McGee is sweet, and he is such a gentleman. Gibbs is so know it all and cool. Zeba is so wonderfully strong. Director is gorgeous. And, Tony, Macho Male to the T!
