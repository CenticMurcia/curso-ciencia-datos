i watched this film after Christmas and did'not expect it to be a masterpiece like Lord of the rings.<br /><br />John Wayne is about as threatening as a chicken nugget. He does'not really give the crooks a chance especially at the end of the film the shootout on the beach he just pumps them with bullets from his silenced mac 10.<br /><br />The acting is terrible especially the scene where he stays at Lois's house for the night. And in the morning when he wakes up his hair is the same, he just looks the same as he did the day before.<br /><br />John you should of retired long ago
