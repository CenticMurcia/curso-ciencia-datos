This movie was total nonsense, but still I kept watching. The action is quite good and plenty of explosions. Absolutely ludicrous plot. Theres a bit where the Spitfire pilot shoots down a jet with a grenade launcher while he hangs out of the cockpit. Nonsense but great stuff. Its got Horst Bucholtz in as well.
