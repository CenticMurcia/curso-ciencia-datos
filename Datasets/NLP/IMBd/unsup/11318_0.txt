let's get the good stuff out of the way first...<br /><br />the story line and the writing both are amazing... in the hands of a more capable director, this movie could've been an excellent movie.<br /><br />the story has all the elements that could attract a viewer, from the good building of the problem, the attraction, the deliberate misguiding to the twists at the end. (but no comedy whatsoever)..<br /><br />but it was really really really bad directed, and you can notice that from the very first shot of the film. a summer trained director trying his luck, and thinking that having a star like Hayden Panettiere can sell the movie - which i don't know why she agreed to do the movie in the first place?? being that she's totally in her prime...<br /><br />there are some characters in the movie that were in it only for the purpose of the felling of an empty 5 minutes or something, there are characters that appeared in the beginning of the movie, and it was set in my mind that this character will play an important rule in the story line, but suddenly i didn't see that character again!!!!<br /><br />overall, it was below medium, and really what a sham, it could've been something really good.<br /><br />my vote is 3 out of 10
