Wonderland is an excellent reality drama in the best British tradition. Just 4 days out of the lives of members of 1 London family. Their hopes and ambitions, doubts and inability to communicate a perfect illustration of modern day big city life.<br /><br />The actors, though most of them well known from other British films and TV series always believable through very natural and modest acting.<br /><br />Only bad thing I can say about this movie: Michael Nyman has gone way over the top on the soundtrack!
