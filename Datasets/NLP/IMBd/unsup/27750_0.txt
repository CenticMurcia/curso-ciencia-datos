I guess they couldn't get Julia Roberts. This script was way above Demi Moore's capabilities. She was overshadowed by the talent surrounding her. Mary Steenburgen stole the show with her singing (don't forget, Jessica Lange was nominated for an Oscar in Sweet Dreams for not singing). Well, some have it, and some don't. I can't wait to see Meryl Streep do her own thing in Prairie Home Companion. The last time we heard her vocals was Postcards From the Edge. Jeff Daniels, Frances McDormand, and George Dzundza were fine. It was a good script and an interesting storyline. Butcher's Wife was well directed. Too bad it was brought down by the lead character. A perfect example of how Hollywood has sacrificed art for celebrity. Kudos to the movie and everyone in the cast with the exception of Moore.
