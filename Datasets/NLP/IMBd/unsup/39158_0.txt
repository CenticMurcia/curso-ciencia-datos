Oh, it's not so terrible. It's got real actors, and if the shooting were so incompetent, how could it look like a TV show? About half the characters are also homeless, which is nice although it's not exactly a social-realist or intimate portrayal. Of course, when the man-eating CHUD toxies show up they are guys in stupid rubber costumes, and they remain guys in stupid rubber costumes no matter how tight you cut the shots. And none of the actors were written one single bit of character development. At the end when the bad guy drives his flaming truck into the manhole after his men have pumped the sewers full of deadly gas, you're like, great - New York is gonna blow up. But no, apparently nobody, er, thought of this, so Nothing Happens. And before you know it, we're at the stupid ending to end all stupid endings. OK it's terrible.
