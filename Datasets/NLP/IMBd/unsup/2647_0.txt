When I go to see the movie I was bored and have no expectation of this movie at all, the trailer didn’t even look that convincing. I needed to see some movie so I went to see it; also it was directed by Robert Zemickis, for me this name is good enough for me to buy the ticket.<br /><br />Synopsis: When a small town was terrorized by a monster, a king ordered his men to trace a warrior that could save his town a greatest reward. That is when our hero came in – Beowulf.<br /><br />I have never read the books before so I will go by the story of what I see in the movie. The whole movie was much more entertaining than I thought it would be, maybe because I have no expectation like the others who also went to see it. I must say that extra money that they charge me for the 3D thing was worth it, the outcome, the animation and everything was breathtaking. It was crystal clear. They even gave the preview the different between 3D and non 3D.<br /><br />I thought the whole story was pretty OK, nothing great or memorable, seem like they put more energy in the making of this movie into 3D than the great storyline. The story is not that well distributed and here and there can be a little bit boring. The character is quite shallow and the dialogue in this movie was way too little. And there is so much gore that seems quite unnecessary.<br /><br />The good outcome was I don’t really get border by the fact that this movie is CGI like I felt as I watch The Polar Express; this one felt more like a normal movie. As I said before this movie seem to only concentrated a lot on making it a lifelike as possible so tried to watch it in a highly enhance Digital Cinema like I did and you will felt quite impressive at the new technology that everything look so clear and real.<br /><br />Overall it was a fun flick, don’t expect that good of the story but tried to look at that awesomely done CGI.<br /><br />Recommendation: Should At least Watch It Once.<br /><br />Reason to Watch: The Future of Film Making!!!! Reason Not To: Story is very shallow, and if not for CGI this movie is just average Mythology movie.<br /><br />Rating: 6.5/10 (Grade: C+).<br /><br />Please Rate Y/N After Read.
