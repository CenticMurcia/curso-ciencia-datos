I am sick of everyone saying that rocky V sucked as well. the movie itself wasn't such a bad movie. it was ,however, extremely disappointing because after all those years of grueling training montages and hard work, Rocko loses all of his money because of Paulie's ridiculous gambling habits. its just sad to see the rock go out broke, he didn't deserve to leave cinema as a bum who let his family and friends take advantage of him. it was great tho because when he gets back from Russia later that ,probably year, his son is 5 years older. the poor kid gets picked on for being rich ,so, naturally Paulie teaches him how to fight? despite all the holes and questions seeing Rocko in street-fighter mode is just great, and seeing him kick the crap out of a well trained 25 year old is awesome.
