Bonnie Raitt is one of the greatest American musician. Her guitar and her voice are astonishing and unique. The concert 'Road Tested' is remarkable: I have the double CD, the VHS and now I have just bought the DVD. The selection of song is perfect and it is impossible to select the bests: 'Thing Called Love (with Bruce Hornsby)', 'Something to Talk About', 'Love Letter', 'Never Make Your Move Too Soon', 'Shale a Little', 'Matters of the Heart', 'Have a Heart', 'Love Me Like a Man', 'Louise', 'Dimming of the Days', 'My Opening Farewell (with Jackson Browne)', 'Longing in Their Hearts', 'Come to Me', 'Love Sneakin'Up On You' 'Burning Down the House', 'I Can't Make You Love Me', Feeling of Falling', 'I Believe, I'm In Love With You', 'Rock Steady' and 'Angel From Montgomery'. How to choose better songs among such a wonderful repertoire? However, my favorite one is the wonderful blues 'The Kokomo Medley', which I do not get tired of listening to it. I regret only that the DVD does not have the option of Lyrics On (or at least Closed Caption). Bonnie Raitt's fans did not deserve such a lack of care from the producers and distributors. But my vote is ten.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "Bonnie Raitt: Road Tested"
