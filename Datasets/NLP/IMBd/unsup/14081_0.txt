This movie has many flaws, but compared to ALIEN 3000 or UNSEEN EVIL 2 it's bloody Oscar material. The acting seemed force, despite the fact of Tim Thomerson of DOLLMAN fame. But there isn't all bad news, the creature design and the CGI effects are very well done for a low budget movie, if you ask me RICHARD HATCH is a major sell out, first this then the remake of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA which true fans will say is Galactica in name alone. But that's a different story. He just can't do the villain role. Richard's villain is forced and labored. There are a few things other the creature effects. An alien experiment dumped on the Earth in a cave makes sense and is pretty cool. But I give it...7 STARS.
