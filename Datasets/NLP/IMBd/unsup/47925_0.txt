This show was so short lived that I didn't even get to see every episode. It premiered during the summer of 2002. I saw a couple of episodes. They were funny. It was so coll how they poked fun of the sitcoms of the 70s like The Facts Of Life, The Partridge Family, Different Strokes, and What's Happenin!! There was an episode when they poked fun of the Facts of Life and had a man playing the role of Mrs. Garrett. But I went out of town for less than a week and came back home and the show went off the air for good. No warning. I didn't even get a chance to see every episode! The rerun show never lasted long enough to have reruns!
