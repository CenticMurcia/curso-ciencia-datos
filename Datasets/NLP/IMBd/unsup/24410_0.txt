Stalwart Captain Hickock (a solid and engaging performance by David Beecroft) is sent to investigate the mysterious death of a member of a dream research project that's conducting experiments in a vast and isolated subterranean lab. Head scientist Dr. Van Fleet (a brief, but cool appearance by the always terrific James Hong) accidentally brings into our world a powerful deadly being with the scary ability to fatally use our worst fears against us. Writer/director J.S. Cardone, who also gave us the terrifically trashy "The Forsaken" and the pleasingly eerie "Wicked Little Things," maintains a snappy pace throughout, stages the genuinely startling shock scenes with considerable harrowing aplomb, and does a deft job of effectively creating a clammy, creepy and downright unsettling nightmarish claustrophobic atmosphere. The strong cast qualifies as another major asset: Louise Fletcher as the mad Dr. Erhardt, Shawn Weatherly as the fetching Dr. Kidwell, Frederick Flynn as hearty computer technician Tommy Shivers, Lu Leonard as gruff cook Ms. Cutter, and Miguel A. Nunez Jr. as abjectly craven, spineless, sniveling janitor Wiley. Karen Grossman's dark, fluid, moody cinematography, Richard Band's supremely shuddery'n'spooky score, and Mark Shostrom's good'n'gruesome make-up f/x are all likewise on the money excellent and impressive. The gory murder set pieces hit the splattery spot with a perfectly grisly bull's eye. As a nice extra bonus, the lovely Maureen Flaherty as a sleeping psychic spends all of her screen time completely in the buff. A really nifty and unjustly neglected little low-budget sci-fi/horror winner.
