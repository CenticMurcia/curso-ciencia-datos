Seagal is back and bigger than ever. The larger than life actor is back to his best with Mercenary of Justice. The heart felt story begins with Seagal being described the as a wild card and the best at his job i.e blowing stuff up in slow-mo.<br /><br />A mercenary gets involved in a mission that threatens the lives of his kin. In order to succeed, he must break into one of the most wellguarded prisons in Eastern Europe and free the son of the most notorious drug lord in the world today<br /><br />In conclusion this is a great and refreshing change from the average action film with real heart felt drama its only rival release may be firewall, however Harrison Ford struggles to compete with Seagal in every aspect.<br /><br />"It's time to fight again".... Damn right
