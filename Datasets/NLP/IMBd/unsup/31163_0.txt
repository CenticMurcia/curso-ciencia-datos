The movie started off with some funny promos at the beginning introducing the characters and letting us know who will probably die first. Very original.<br /><br />I think of Clu Gulager, and I think of westerns, but in his more that 150 roles, he's done it all, including the bartender in this film and the two sequels. yes, there is more of this coming.<br /><br />The action starts hot and heavy when Eric Dane walks into the bar with one of the creatures. The blood is copious and decapitation is immediate. There is also a lot of disgusting slime. The patrons in the bar spend the next 90 minutes battling the monster family. Continuous action throughout. This was excitement to the nth degree! Those creatures sure were ugly! Can't wait to see Feast II, but, unfortunately, it won't have Navi Rawat, but Jenny Wade will be back.
