In order for a movie to be any worse, it would actually have to shoot out of the DVD player and decapitate you as you watched it. Here's what you do, if you're one of those gluttons for punishment who just have to see for yourself: Get your two or three wittiest friends together, with a safe supply of your liquor of choice, and have a ball playing "Mystery Science Theater 3000" with it. And prepare for dialogue spewed out by an Automatic Cliche Machine, delivered by actors on par with the cast of your average third-grade play, embarrassing themselves through a "plot" that only makes sense when it's silly. AND A POSSIBLE SPOILER, AS IF ANYTHING COULD "SPOIL" THIS MOVIE: The monster (one of them, anyway, the main one, I think, except the other was bigger and badder, except that *that* one was kind of good, *except* it killed random people...follow?)is a critter called the Devil-Dog (kudos to originality!). It's really quite charming. Mind you, it's a result of abysmal special effects, but the result is something that looks like a cute and cuddly cross between a badger and a land-sloth. Only those big horns prevent you from wanting to scratch its belly and feed it biscuits. One may think they should sell it in pet-stores -- maybe next to the DREADED CANNIBAL GERBIL-HAMSTER WHATEVERS! (And if you haven't seen the movie, don't even *ask* about those.)
