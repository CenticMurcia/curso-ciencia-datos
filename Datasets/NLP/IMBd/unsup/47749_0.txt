Up until now, I have never seen a horror movie that I didn't like. This movie was just awful, awful, awful! The filming is so blurry that you can hardly see what's going on! The sound is fuzzy. The gore is cheap and you can't feel any sympathy for the victims because how stupid they were scripted. I'm sure the director has potential! He must show it. This film does not capture the genius of Mr. Schnaas. This film is also extremely low budget. Although the actors were particularly talented especially the very handsome Mr. Schnaas as the killer Karl, They could not save this movie. Even the castration scene was boring. Mr. Schnaas, Make us a better film!
