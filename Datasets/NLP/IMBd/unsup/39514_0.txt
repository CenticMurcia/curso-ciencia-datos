Rock a Doodle is one of the worst cartoon films ever for many reasons.<br /><br />Firstly it has terrible animation, the animation looks as if it was made at the same time as say "The Aristocats" which was made in 1970 and the animation in that looks better than Rock a Doodle's.<br /><br />Then the characters were annoying with the exception of Chanticleer. The mouse looked so stupid and her lisp was so irritating and the bird had an equally annoying voice and was a pointless character.<br /><br />Patou the dog looked like one of the typical Don Bluth characters with over-exaggerated mouth movements so when they talk they look as if they're struggling to talk and their lips are stuck together. Phil Harris did his voice well but the narration was overused so much.<br /><br />Edmund is the most annoying character in the film because the scene where he gets turned from a real human into an animated cat was weird and stupid. Also he was made to try and look cute like Fievel from American Tail but it was so clich√©d even down to the over-sized jumper and the voice is even more annoying than Fievel's it makes you hate him.<br /><br />Then the story of the Grand Owl wanting to make it dark permanently so he could eat the farm animals was stupid. Some of these farm animals are pigs and cows so how can something as small as an owl even dream of eating some of them.<br /><br />To top it all off the film had really unbearable songs to add to it so overall it is a very bad cartoon. not recommended at all.
