Tootsie was very funny in it's time. But this that is sort of like Tootsie in reverse, was not as funny. And listening to some of the jokes make me wonder why was this movie not rated R, I mean some of the jokes make the American Pie movies seem Nc-17. It was not all that funny, through most of the movie, I laughed for putting in the effort for trying. The story begins with Terry(Joyce Hauser) is very upset when she does not win a Journalist contest. Feels she is not taking seriously because she is a pretty female. And is pretty annoyed that her brother Buddy(Billy Jacoby--William Jayne now) has pined up several naked women in his room. So she pretends to be a guy, and changes schools, in hopes to get some respect. During that time she befriends Rick Morehouse(Clayton Rohner, you remember him from G vs E), keeps getting crossing unpleasant paths with the School Bully(The Karate Kids, William Zabka), and his pursued by Sandy(Then unknown Sherilyn Finn). It was not totally bad, Billy Jacoby seems to steal most of the movie has Terrys sex crazed brother. It was an alright 80's flick, but not a classic.
