This is the worst movie we've ever rented for our kids. We kept watching to see if it would eventually get better, but were disappointed. We can put up with bad behavior by main characters in a kids' movie as long as at least some of them learn their lessons and make changes. However, this never happens, except in reverse - a mother who seems to have the right values loses them. Even the baseball scenes were sub-par, though our 5-year-old "heavy hitter" did enjoy them. Thankfully, neither of our kids ever wants to see the movie again. If you want a GREAT baseball film suitable for the family, check out "The Rookie," with Dennis Quaid. Not only is it a great movie, it is very faithful to the true story upon which it is based. Our whole family loved the movie and it may soon be found on our purchased video shelf. Avoid "Perfect Game" like the plague!
