If you are old enough to remember Ida Lupino and Dane Clark when they were both at the top of their careers in the 1940's, then this film will be a great Classic to view and enjoy. Ida Lupino, (Libby Saul),"The Big Knife",'55, plays a very innocent farm gal who has a big heart and falls madly in love with Dane Clark, (Barry Burnette),"God Is My Co-Pilot",'45. Barry is a guy who gets all the wrong breaks in life and has a very bad temper which he just simply cannot control. Barry finds himself wanting to start his life all over again, however, he has things in his past which make his hopes a big problem. This story is very sad and yet it has a great story about love between a man and a woman who know they will be Soul Mates forever no matter what happens to them in life. Ida Lupino looked real great in the close ups and Dane Clark gave a great performance as a very troubled man.
