As a big fan of wuthering heights, i was ready to give this film a chance. But i have to say, i hated it. Robert cavanah is not right for heathcliff. More importantly, this film does not follow the book. it kills the book in fact, and changes the plot. Cathy and hieroglyphs loveis more sexual in the film than in the book, and shows lust rather thanlove. i was very upset with this adaptation. as a stand alone film it would have been good, but as a novel adaptation - a very poor interpretation. The 1992 wuthering heights with Ralph fiennes however is an amazing film. it is very true to the book, very emotive. i cried 3 times throughout the film. Ralph fiennes plays heathcliff exactly as i imagined him. Juliette binoche pulls Cathy and Cathy's daughter off very well. Horton is portrayed perfectly too. i recommend anyone to watch the 1992 film, and not this television version.
