Yes, there was life before Darth Vader. Dave Prowse, these days relegated to autograph shows (his signature: "Dave Prowse IS Darth Vader"), plays the oddly sexual Frankenstein monster in this rather cheesy flick. His Frankie springs forth with a shapely (and clean- shaven), buff chest, defined abs, and tree-trunk thigh and biceps. From the neck up, he's pretty unappealing, but from chin down, he'd be a big hit at a gay disco, barely clad in what look like boxer briefs. <br /><br />Also of note and flashing some skin: Kate O'Mara plays a buxom housekeeper. Kate has played the devilish sister of two of the greatest characters ever to grace the small screen: Dynasty's Alexis Carrington and Absolutely Fabulous' Patsy Stone. Here she has a fairy substantial role (in a less-than-substantial film) as Victor Frankenstein's housekeeper and concubine. <br /><br />Victor inherits her, along with the house, and keeps her around even though she can't cook. He does explain why, indirectly: When seeing her for the first time in a while, he comments, appreciatively, that she's put on some weight "in a couple of places." If her costume in this scene had been cut any lower, we'd see her belly button.... <br /><br />This one certainly wasn't ever in the running for an Oscar, but for what it is, it's not exactly unwatchable. It's a modern retelling of a classic tale -- updated to of course include plenty of sex and gore. Like most Hammer films, it's beautifully produced and the sets are pretty convincing (mostly) -- though I found the castle (and the film in general) to be too well-lit to be very spooky. <br /><br />I was struck by one interesting little tidbit: This film was released by MGM about the same time the studio distributed Dan Curtis's House of Dark Shadows, which has a bit of a Hammer feel to it; and the lovely blonde actress featured in Horror of Frankenstein (Veronica Carlson as Elizabeth) bears a striking resemblance to Nancy Barrett, similarly featured in HODS as sexy vampire Carolyn Stoddard. I'm sure it's a coincidence, but their makeup and hairstyles are slightly similar, and they simply reminded me of each other.
