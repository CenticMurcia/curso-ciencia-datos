There's no question that this film is back in line with what Mike Leigh is known for, excellent portrayals of British working class life. There is no question that much of the two hours is very heavy and somewhat depressing but the character studies and the the focus on the details of the characters' everyday life is stunning. The housing estate in south-east London is not represented in anything other than a realistic way, as is the life of a minicab driver.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film as being worth the effort of watching it.
