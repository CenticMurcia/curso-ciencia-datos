BEWARE -- SPOILERS (sort of)<br /><br />The first thirty minutes of this psychadelic flower-child generation-gone wild paranoid fantasy percolates to its 60's beat. The set-up with Holbrook and Varsi as Jones' accomplices is close to ingenious. And Jones handles himself in a way that makes you believe his cohort accept him unflaggingly as their leader. But once he starts implementing his vision, things slide downhill all too fast. It is one-note, dumb, and predictable, as absolute power corrupts absolutely. But, it's a shame to tune out before the film's final scene, which is hysterical. The last line is just too good not to repeat as a classic, "We're going to put everybody over ten out of business!" And this was years before anybody could have predicted the Cambodian Khmer Rouge!<br /><br />Overall, fun for film students, and fans of theatre d'absurd. People who want traditionally entertaining movies with characters whose actions actually make sense should look elsewhere.
