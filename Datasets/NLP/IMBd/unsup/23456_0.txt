I had some trepidation watching HellBent, as I'd not seen a slasher film before. Fortunately, the film didn't prove realistic enough to provoke anything more than a startled gasp or two from me. But worst than that is the absolute unbelievability of the four leads in their roles. If writer-director Paul Etheredge-Ouzts had cast more talented actors willing to imbue their characters with the slightest bit of believability as WeHo gay guys, this movie might have had some credibility as the "first gay slasher" movie. I can't help wondering if any of these actors been around 20something West Hollywood gays in their lives? I defy anyone with an ounce of "gaydar" to detect anything queer about any of the lead characters (the drag queen least of all). Yes, there are "straight acting" gay guys, and there are straight guys. It seems that the four lead actors were doing their best to send out signals to the audience, "We're just pretending. We wouldn't want anyone to think we might possibly be gay." Try again, Mr. Etheredge-Ouzts, only this time respect your audience's intelligence and perceptiveness.
