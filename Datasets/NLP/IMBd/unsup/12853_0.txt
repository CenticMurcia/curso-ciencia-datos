I never was into the 'singles scene' nevertheless I was impressed with the realism depicted in this film.<br /><br />its strongest point is its unpredictability, just like real life.<br /><br />the lovemaking scenes are important but secondary, fully consistent with the realism in the rest of the film.<br /><br />romance for 20 and 30 something singles is a veritable minefield and not getting any better. if you want insight into the sacrifices and rewards necessary to survive, starting with genuine loyalty topped off with a huge dollop of FORGIVENESS then watch this film.<br /><br />and a happy ending to boot. likewise, very plausible.
