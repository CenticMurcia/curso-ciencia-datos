The Prince of Egypt is mightily impressive. Although an unexpected story for Dreamworks to embark on, they do a fine job of it. The animation is astonishing and the characterisations are great. I will not add further mention of how inappropriate 'You're Playing with the Big Boys' song is. Dreamworks must now set a different path from that of Disney. To avoid the inevitable comparisons, Dreamworks should continue with the idea to produce animated motion pictures equally for the adult because there IS an audience for such a genre. Additionally, I don't know why no one has picked up on this before, but songs in cartoons suck. With the exception of the River Lullaby and When You Believe (Pfeiffer/Dworsky), there is no need for the others. This is the same for all of Disney's animations. On each of Disney's films, who can really remember any of the songs besides the main piece? The lesser the amount of ridiculous songs the better the animation. All kids really want to see is the animation and action - not the silly songs. Disney discredits kids too much - kids are much smarter these days. The Prince of Egypt is wonderfully told and the actual line drawing is marvellous. It is great to know that Fiennes and Pfeiffer sang their parts. If movie studios are going to get celebrities to be the voices of characters and are still willing to persist with silly songs - the least they could do is make the actual actors sing the songs - or alternatively let the singers SPEAK the parts.
