Historical romantic fiction set during the American Revolution, filmed expensively to showcase mistress Marion Davies, by William Randolph Hearts, for Cosmopolitan Productions and Metro-Goldwyn Pictures. For 1924 audiences, this must have been like going to see D.W. Griffith's "America" again, with Ms. Davies (as Janice Meredith) inserted into the Revolution. The two films were in production simultaneously, they covered the same ground, and were written up in movie periodicals prior to release. It's odd that Mr. Hearst went up against Mr. Griffith, who got his "America" into theaters well ahead of "Janice Meredith"; blessedly, Griffith's Colonists win the War without Davies' help. However, neither film was the epic intended.<br /><br />Davies is awkward, forced, and pouting as a wealthy New Jersey belle; at first, her character is uninvolved in politics - but, she becomes instrumental in founding the triumphant new United States of America. Romantic interest Harrison Ford (as John Brereton) arrives on her estate as a handsome indentured servant ("Charles Fownes") with an intriguing background. Davies and Mr. Ford fall in love; but, Davies is expected to marry goofy, noble neighbor Olin Howlin (as Philemon "Phil" Hennion). Paul Revere (Ken Maynard)'s ride and Washington crossing the Delaware are highlights. After almost an hour, W.C. Fields appears as a British officer encountered by Davies; not even their comic antics can save this thoroughly non-engrossing film.<br /><br />*** Janice Meredith (12/8/24) E.
