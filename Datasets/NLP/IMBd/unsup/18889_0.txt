I've got good news, & I've got bad news.<br /><br />The good? Michelle is very fine - convincing sad mommy, Barbie cute, emoticon deluxe.<br /><br />E.McG - not around enough. There must have been an editing mess with this one. The first part of the film suggests he would have had a bigger role. Our loss.<br /><br />That's the good.<br /><br />The bad: THIS IS NOT AN ACTION MOVIE!!!! It's a ruminative, junky, maudlin, meandering mess masquerading as an action movie. No guts, no punch.<br /><br />It takes a long time to say - & you will be half asleep at this point - that, gee, Osama should just listen to the sad mommas out there & he wouldn't be such a bad dude.<br /><br />NO. This is idiotic. Terrorists are NOT good daddies. Not possible.<br /><br />The whole thing takes a long time to develop & then falls apart in semi-bathetic babbling. Like I said, wha' happened?
