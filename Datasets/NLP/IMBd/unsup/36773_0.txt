That about says it all. This is one LOOOOONNNNGGGGGG and indulgent western, proof yet again that actors or singer/songwriters need to go to film school before spending someone elses millions. I won't go into the plot, such as it is. The acting is all over the maps, the camera work is average, the music just okay. I guess I expected more from this film, at least a great score, but it wasn't there. Worst of all, it squanders a lot of talent in a big sleepy tale that should've been half as long as it was. This falls into the "what were they all thinking?" category. Skip it.
