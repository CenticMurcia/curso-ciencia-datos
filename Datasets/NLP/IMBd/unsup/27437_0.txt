I came across this one by accident at the drug store for $1, and what a bargain! 1940's style animation - (think Casper the Friendly Ghost), with a few entertaining musical numbers. I think it's Bing Crosby doing Gulliver's voice, but didn't see his name on the credits. Some funny Lilliputians, including the King, really make this one fun to watch for the whole family. There are sword fights, and I was really intrigued by the animation for sea washing up on the beach at night. Gulliver is very life-like, replete with the shadows on his features to capture the "lighting" of the scene, which I found very striking for the time. Also, I think it's actually released in 1940, according to the credits.
