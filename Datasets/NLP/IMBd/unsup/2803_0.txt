Deaden is not a movie for the faint-hearted, does not cater for the mainstream audience and is not in the slightest bit interested in any PG-13 rating, and thank God for that! Deaden is instead an intelligent, well-made love letter to the revenge flicks of decades gone by. Writer, Producer and Star John Fallon (aka the one and only Arrow In The Head of the eponymous highly respected horror movie site) had previously stated that his intention (along with co-writer and Director Christian Viel) was to, ahem, deaden his disappointment at the 2004 remake of The Punisher, which for all its' good intentions and impressive visuals still pulled its punches where it counted, and create his own vision.<br /><br />Thus Fallon and Viel created Rane, an ex-cop who has his future taken from him (in more ways than one) in a brutal opening sequence, and who then proceeds to make the perpetrators pay dearly for their actions after putting an arrow in his head (see what they did there?) and leaving him for dead.<br /><br />What follows is a lean, uncompromising revenge flick that showcases Fallon in his first leading role, and proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that not only can he write, but the boy can act too. Several times during the movie I was reminded of a young Stallone in the way that Rane comes across as a flawed everyman, forced into his actions but ultimately believing that he is doing the right thing.<br /><br />What could have been a ham role in lesser hands is turned into a sympathetic and even likable character by Fallon, who glides across the screen with an ease and confidence that many actors with more leading role experience would struggle to replicate. However, one man does not a great movie make (well not always).<br /><br />Fallon's co-stars also step up to the plate and manage to hit (mostly) home runs. Deke Richards as his buddy Kersey completely sells their camaraderie (helped no doubt by their real life friendship), and the lovely Claudia Jert as his ex-partner Park brings a sexy confidence to the screen which brings to mind a younger (and hotter) Rene Russo. Anna Jaeger, playing Rane's girl Jamie, makes us believe in the depth and warmth of their relationship, and completely validates his need to seek vengeance for her untimely demise.<br /><br />Rane's murderous crew are equally convincing, breathing life into what could so easily have been two-dimensional cardboard characters, but who instead come across as realistic - very little of the stereotypical movie bad guy scenery chewing that we've come to expect from the likes of a Michael Bay flick goes on in Deaden.<br /><br />The violence, too, is realistic, with the only credibility-stretching event being the afore-mentioned arrow in the head, but even that is nimbly explained. Heads are cracked, teeth are lost, limbs are broken, and there is the most inventive use of a pool cue that I've seen for a good while, and that will make your eyes water.<br /><br />Add a well thought out soundtrack to the whole heady mixture and Deaden delivers the goods, and then some. For my money Fallon and Viel have delivered exactly what they set out to, namely a punishing tale of revenge that will keep you nailed to the screen until the final, bleak denouement.
