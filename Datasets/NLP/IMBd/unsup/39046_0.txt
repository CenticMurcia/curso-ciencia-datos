Sitting at home on a Sunday night, expecting an average sort of telemovie to come on and occupy my otherwise boring night. Well I definitely was wrong. Au Pair was probably the worst film I have seen in my entire life. Your traditional cliched plot was something with which almost made me run away, and the fact that you know how everything will happen right from the word go is unbelievably annoying. The acting in this film represents that of the 'BAD telemovie' community very well. I normally have some understanding with telemovies, expecting them not to be brilliant but slightly entertaining, but this really is HORRIFIC for the telemovie image. The fact that this film is advertised as a family flick repulses me to the extent of running away to gasp for air, and wash my self because it is so dirty. Not dirty in your sexual or violent way but for the fact that a film could be this bad, and yet still make it on to TV screens. If this is what families of today are meant to sit down and watch together, then I am afraid we are looking at a very simple minded and uneducated future, with appauling senses of humour.<br /><br />If only there were a rating on IMDB lower than 1... Be Afraid of this film BE VERY AFRAID!
