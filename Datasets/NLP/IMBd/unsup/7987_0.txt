Excellent movie! Jersey rocks again! I can relate. This film says a lot about society. We can see a bit of ourselves in every story within the stories. Honestly when I first started the watching the movie, I thought it was a Showtime series and not a movie. I even forgot the name of it and had to hit info a second time. Not that it was bad but it was so good that I had to make sure of what I was watching. My high school's ten year reunion is coming up in a few weeks and upon serious introspection, I have to relate my own life this highly entertaining movie. We all have feelings about another's success and how we have our own shortcomings that amount to skipping the fact we have to earn things in life and being jealous is truly a sin. We as people dismiss our feelings of jealousy as being acceptable but when push comes to shove, you have to be a winner at heart and meticulously trained. This movie notates the reality of things; you ultimately have to live up to the role inside your collective head. This movie is a must see who has to fess up to their own shortcomings.
