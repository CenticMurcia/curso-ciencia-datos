Marc is sitting in his bath one morning (yes, a grown man taking a bath in a little tub) and asks his wife, "how would you feel if I shaved off my mustache?" She doesn't think it's a great idea, for the 15 years they've been married, she's never known him without his 'stache. He shaves it off anyway, but when he sees his wife, she doesn't notice, neither do their friends at dinner that night, neither do his co-workers. Marc finally flips out, shouts at everyone, tells them he's tired of their little joke, and what do they really think. His wife and co-workers are appalled, what is he talking about, he's never had a mustache. In fact, he's imagining other things as well, or is he? This off-beat drama/thriller about a man questioning his own sanity remains fascinating throughout. Is it an elaborate plot, has he gone insane, is it just a dream? Throughout, I was intently searching for clues and trying to help the hapless man make sense of his out-of-kilter world. Emmanuelle Devos as Agn√®s, Marc's wife continues to astound me with her expressiveness. (See La Femme de Gilles to see her at her emoting best.) This movie is like a hunk of baguette with creamy butter. The lightness and commonness of the bread are enlivened by the rich, smooth butter. The two sides play together well, creating food synergy. The crisp crust, the fluffy interior, and the almost sweet butter with a bit of salt to enhance the flavor is difficult to resist and can become the most enticing part of a meal. 7/10<br /><br />http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies
