Spoiler Ahead<br /><br />I can't stop beating myself up for having fallen for the snazzy cover and video summary on this one! I thought to myself, sounds like Heathers (and we all know, if it sounds like Heathers, there's very little that could make it bad). But I would like to take this moment to make it crystal clear that, despite what some misguided viewers might tell you, this film is not even in the galaxy of cult classics such as Heathers!!! This film is bad, as it is described in the GOOD movie with Ms. Birch, so bad that it's beyond good and back to bad again. I can't believe a woman created this. Their "liberation," realized by blindfolding a guy and making him wear a chicken hat (since nothing else really happened) is far overshadowed by the graphic scenes of not one, but two of the three heroines being raped. There couldn't have been more thrusting, sweating, crying, and runny make-up if they tried. Unnecessarily long, detailed, and of course totally eroticized, these scenes have no place in a film that purports to be about female liberation. The director/writer should be ashamed. When the girls say that they do what they do for all womankind, I beg that they speak for themselves, and refrain from embarrassing my sex.<br /><br />However, it has not been in vain. I have derived several chuckles and hearty guffaws from reading the numerous digs others have made on the film here at IMDB, and now share a special bond with them. As I said to my boyfriend after the credits rolled, I hear that sharing a traumatic experience with someone can make the relationship even stronger.<br /><br />Tip: For gleaning extra fun from this movie, cover up the clocks in the room. Periodically, guess how much time has elapsed, then glance at the clock and see how accurate your estimation was. You'll be amazed at the warp in the space-time continuum created by this film. 90 minutes really can feel like an eternity!
