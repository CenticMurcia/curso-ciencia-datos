This is one of the worst shows I've ever attempted to watch. I was recently traveling in Latin America and came across this English-language show on cable, so I decided to try to watch a few minutes.<br /><br />While laced with mature themes (masturbation jokes, sexual urination, etc.) it contains pitiful acting, an unbelievably lame story, and the kind of plot you'd expect in a Disney Family Channel movie.<br /><br />Chad "E" Donella (that E makes him so classy) and the rest of the crew/cast from this movie should step in front of a bus.<br /><br />Avoid watching this movie like the plague - it is far from being even remotely entertaining.
