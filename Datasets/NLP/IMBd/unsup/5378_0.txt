This debut film from Scottish film comedian Bill Forsyth is decent non-think entertainment. It has the low-budget charm of a student film, which can be its asset or liability, depending on how you look at it. Really, it's hard to envision this same low-key robbery story filmed in a bigger budget studio style. However, it's flaws are quite evident. It has a very choppy editing style, with each scene encompassing a different joke - similar to Monty Python short sketches. The storyline never really jells together, and unlike Forsyth's more polished later films, there's not much character development to speak of. The script has plenty of sharp one-liners, but few really great shakes.<br /><br />As a gestation of the kind of stellar comedic talent Forsyth was to become in a few years, this movie is worth taking a look at. I did find myself laughing quite a few times, and am sure you will find some reasons to enjoy this, also.
