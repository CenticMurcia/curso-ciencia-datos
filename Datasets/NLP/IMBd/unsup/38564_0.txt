This movie is so utterly terrible I can barely bring myself to comment on it.<br /><br />It is poorly written, ill conceived, badly acted! Agh. It is a poor imitation of silence of the lambs and even has the "beautiful" caring psychiatrist trying to understand the celebrity serial killer. Spare me such cinematic clich√©s! The killer is so utterly unconvincing. He looks like some cheesy 80s pop star and exudes nothing but blandness; where is the menace in this guy? And Dennis Hopper?! Wow! What were you thinking man?! Apocalypse Now! Easy Rider! Blue Velvet! Come on! I have seen many many films, but this must rate as the worst ever. If there had been a zero score possible on the voting scale, I would have awarded it. But I had to make do with a "1" - doesn't even come close to a "1"
