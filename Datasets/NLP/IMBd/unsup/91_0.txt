Michael Arlen's radio-serial detective returns for another movie mystery (actually, it's the Falcon's brother this time, with George Sanders having since exited from the role and his real-life sibling Tom Conway assuming his duties). For reasons unknown, the Falcon is down Mexico way, being conned by a Se√±orita who needs his help in retrieving one of her paintings from an art gallery. They break in after-hours (despite a sign near the door in English saying the premises are guarded by the police!), only to find a dead man on the premises. Globe-trotting yarn wants us to believe that New York City and Mexico are just a stone's throw from each other, or that the Falcon is really just a nice guy used to helping out desperate women. Neither washes, with the solving of the crime is rather rote and unexciting. *1/2 from ****
