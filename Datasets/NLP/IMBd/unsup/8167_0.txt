This movie is OK if you want to spend a couple of hours trying to outguess the writer or the director.<br /><br />As a thriller, well, it's sort of silly.<br /><br />What is incredibly absurd is that someone would actually go into the house of a man thought to be a serial killer. You really have to be extremely stupid or just a terrible character in a poorly written plot.<br /><br />------------------- Spoiler ahead? -------------- The other absurdity in this flick is that you have a fellow who is killing women right and left and yet...he allows the curtains in his house to be wide open so anyone from outside can look in! Doesn't make sense at all and for me, at least, it killed the film.
