I love watching Inuyasha, I've been watching for quite awhile now. My favorite characters are Inuyasha(he is so cute0, Kagome, Shippo, Sesshomaru, Miroku, Sango, Shippo and Kilala. I have three of the Inuyasha movies. Me and my best friend made up a game where we meet the Inuyasha characters and we end up falling in love with our favorite characters (Inuyasha and Sesshomaru), getting married and have kids. My younger sister also likes it. I like it when Kagome tells Inuyasha to sit when she gets mad at him. I hate Kikyo, Koga and Naraku. So if you haven't seen this show yet, watch it, I'm sure you'll like it because I do.
