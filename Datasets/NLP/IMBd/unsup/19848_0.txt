The 2 stars go to Eliza Dushku - without her I wouldn't have bothered to continue with this snooze-fest! <br /><br />Firstly this looked like a low/no budget movie and reduced it to looking like a student film. That, and also it felt like the concept may have been an idea for a short but was then stretched out into a "feature"... It really doesn't work because there is no real drama here - I didn't feel like I could know the 4 main characters - the only character who seemed to have an attempt at becoming multi-layered is Renee.. From the mention of wanting to be with a girl and then befriending the waitress, who seemed like she could be a lesbian, a new layer began to unravel for Renee. Ellis who felt threatened by this didn't react the way Renee (and possibly the people in the audience) expected. It was supposed to be a turn on but it back fired and their relationship inadvertently came under scrutiny.<br /><br />I liked the ending for Renee, in that she left the waitress' number behind and we don't know if it was by accident or if on purpose to commit to her relationship with Ellis. There was something endearing about that...<br /><br />But this in itself was not enough to make this movie worth a see - I think Dushku fans (including myself) will watch this just for her and will be glad to finally see her in something, anything... however it makes one wonder why on earth she did this! She is capable of so much more and it's sad to see her career not really going anywhere :( The rest of the cast were just okay - Macaulay Culkin is miscast, you can't help but see the home alone kid only he's gotten old and ugly! There is no attempt on his side to change his look and to be taken seriously as an adult actor either. The other two who I have never seen before are quite wooden and contrived.<br /><br />Final thought - don't bother! Sorry Dushku but what were you thinking?!
