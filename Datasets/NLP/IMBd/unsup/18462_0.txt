Mr. Darcy is that he is incredibly kind, handsome and caring person. He also had more guts than most men. He knew what Elizabeth thought of him(or if he didn't, he had a pretty good idea) and yet he still pursued her. I think that's why I like him so much. But this entire film was done so well, I can't think of why they're trying to remake it again with Keira Knightly(although I'll probably see that one too, just because I love the story so much). If you are having trouble reading the book, I would suggest seeing this version of the movie, as it is very close to the actual novel, and it might help to add more of a picture to your mind while reading it. I absolutely love this movie!!! You must see it.
