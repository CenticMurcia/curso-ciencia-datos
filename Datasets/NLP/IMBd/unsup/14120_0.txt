Clearly this is one of the classic examples of a 60's and 70's Movie adaptation of a book that is an unsung masterpiece of how you can as a producer, Director of Photography, Set Designer or Special Effects coordinator relay the textual concept, intention and feel of the original author in to a visual and intellectual Science Fiction thriller. One of my all time favorite Sci-Fi movies ever made. The Man vs. Machine battle in the book is sufficiently represented in this movie but it could easily have been two hours longer to get it all in. The movie as in the book starts slow with the tension building slowly until you along with the characters suddenly find yourselves trapped by the hope of leading edge technology with no escape. I saw the movie first before reading the book which encouraged me on to read the the original Jones book as well as the sequel, The Fall of Colossus which is just a little more out there. Without the degrading advantage of CGI or Computer Aided Special Effects the story rules here with some minor available technology of the day creating a story as much in your head as it is in your eyes. True fans of Sci-Fi will soak this movie in and watch it as many times as they can find it. Pure technological historians will see quaint real work references to 70's bleeding edge technology and can appreciate the advances over the last 40 years. A must see for pure Sci-Fi fans.
