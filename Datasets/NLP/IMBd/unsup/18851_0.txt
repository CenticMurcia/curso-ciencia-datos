Probably the most grotesque thing that happened during this bloodbath was the voice of Frank Ifield singing I remember you-a hit song from 1962 which topped the charts and went onto score in the States on the same label which issued the Beatles before Capitol Records came to their senses. It seems totally out of place here as this isn't your usual American Graffiti type of movie! It is in fact a movie which would have been called a Video Nasty at one time and caters to the demand for Extreme Horror.And since the 70s Horror is in demand more than ever especially the kind about mad doctors who get struck off the register for conducting live autopsies! The only thing missing was David Parker Ray-I mean this wasn't fiction it really happens every other month -try reading Sadistic Killers. It delivers just what it says on the box-but you need to have some experience before you delve into it. Wide open for a sequel but somehow I couldn't see 1000 corpses.The title would have been better to just Corpses its something of a mouthful and sounds like one of those 50s horror flicks of the Night of the Flesh Eating Zombies type. As for a storyline its not of prime importance.People kill people is all you need to know
