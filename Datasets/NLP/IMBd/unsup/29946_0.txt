'Osama'is a sad story about a 12 years old girl who lives in Afganistan, under the Taliban rules. One of those rules,is not allow any woman to work and even go out of the house without the presence of a man;since there aren't men in Osama's family, she needs to pretend that she is a boy,to bring some food to her family. Espandi, a boy who works at the streets, knows that Osama is a girl, and helps her as he can, teaching and explaining her how to do some male stuff, and he even fights with the other boys, who doubt that Osama is not a man.<br /><br />The worst thing about the violence and the other sad facts of this movie, is that they are the reality of the Afganistan. The repression of the women, the poverty, the young boys being trained for war, the younger girls forced to marry someone they don't want to...they still happens in XXI century.<br /><br />I think this movie is great and very worth seeing, specially to see how was the reality in the Taliban times.
