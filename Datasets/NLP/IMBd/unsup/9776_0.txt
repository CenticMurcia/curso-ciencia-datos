When saying that because FSL, GSL, and ASL appear the same so they must be similar, is like saying because you can speak French, German, or English it is all similar, as you know isn't the case. Believe it or not, they are very much different and there is no such thing as universal signs. Although there are a few signs that are similar, just like we say "NO" and in Spanish the word for our no is in fact, "NO". But really, a Deaf person who signs ASL would have a VERY hard time communicating with someone who signs GSL. Sorry to be giving you an educational piece, but you wrote it so I had to comment it and I didn't want you to look bad to the Deaf Community. Thanks, have a great day!!!
