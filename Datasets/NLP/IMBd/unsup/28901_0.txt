Cary Grant and Irene Dunne are ideally matched in a movie quite different from their screwball comedies. They have marvelous chemistry together. The dialogue is marvelous as the couple travels from young and carefree to bitter and cynical. Edgar Buchanan is marvelous as Applejack. If you want to see great acting and are in the mood for a good cry, watch Penny Serenade.
