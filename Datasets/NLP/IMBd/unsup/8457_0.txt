Peter Pan is all grown up and has kids and has forgotten his life as Peter Pan. Well Captain Hook comes along and kidnaps them. It's up to Peter to go back and retrieve his children. It isn't easy to learn how to fight, fly and crow all over again.<br /><br />I thought that this was a really magical movie. It's a nice family movie and I liked the part where the guy flew out the window in the end and was just so happy. He really did lose his marbles. Most of the movie was happy and magical. The voice of Captain Hook is awesome. It's deep and sinister. Dustin Hoffman did an excellent job as Captain Hook. I cannot think of anyone else who could play that part as well as he did.<br /><br />Think happy thoughts and see this movie.
