This film has only one thing going for it and that is Faith Clift. I have not seen any of her other movies but she has entered my Pantheon of all time deliriously awful actors on the strength of this 'performance' alone. I have never before seen an actor get EVERY line of a movie wrong before. OK the script she has to deliver is pretty dire but every single word she utters is so misread it is brilliant. Almost expressionless she just points her piggy little nose in the general direction of someone else in the scene and delivers her lines as if she were reading them off idiot boards two words at a time. She's so gloriously inept she's worth the price of the admission alone. Incidentally, the old lady who says something unintelligible in the bookshop is also called Clift. Faith's mother doing a cameo? I would love to know the story behind the making of this film. Any movie that can get through (at least) three Directors and two Directors of Photography has more potential interest going on behind the camera than in front of it.<br /><br />The editing was atrocious, some scenes were cut off mid word (the version I watched was called The Nightmare Never Ends in the Nightmare Worlds boxset - this movie has, apparently, been re-edited several times).<br /><br />Some of the Music was pretty good, but as it was library tracks of Gustaf Holst's Planet Suite that's hardly surprising.
