This could have been a great movie had the end been different. It is just too much America over it (the ending). I would have been more satisfied if the final had been another and in the same line as the rest of the movie, but maybe if it would, the spectators would have not been so many?<br /><br />Nevertheless, Samuel L. Jackson makes a good appearance in a film that was always going to be very good directed by Fran√ßois Girard with the sounds of Esa Pekka Salonen and Joshua Bell (solo violinist).<br /><br />I loved the costumes and makeup for the 18th century part which happened to be the best part, I reckon. Obviously from my comments above, I liked the last one the least. The ending is not poor, but I felt it could have been done better with a more satisfying outcome.<br /><br />You will be enlightened should you decide to watch this flick. It has an outstanding beautiful sound track. I recommend this to anyone.
