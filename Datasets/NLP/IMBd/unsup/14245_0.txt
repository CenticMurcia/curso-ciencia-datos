This movie is inspired from Italian movie Desica's Girasoli, I (1970),neverthless no complaints because i don't believe in originality.The movie is worth watching because of good story and flow of the story.A.R.Rehmans score and P.C.Sreeram's camera is beautiful.The movie has romance and patriotism.Good natural performance by the acting team also.Maniratnam was in great form during this period,he gave continuous hits of Mouna Ragam,Nayagan,Agni Natchathiram,Geethanjali,Anjali,Thalapathi.There were many cute scenes in the movie.It is also visually stunning.<br /><br />Even Vittoria Desica might have been happy watching this movie because such a solid,positive enhancement of his work.
