I have been an office temp, and this portrays the way I felt all too well. As others have pointed out, it is more than a Dilbert spinoff, however. Sprecher does an excellent job of capturing the sense of floating and disconnectedness, to use Margaret's words, in modern society. We have a bittersweet, ironic story of an individual 'coming of age' as her group of friends breaks apart. Parker Posey's sassy and cynical character pulled me into this movie. Toni Collette at times could be mistaken for a less annoyingly neurotic Ally McBeal. Lisa Kudrow's role is familiar, yet tragic instead of comic. Alanna Ubach's character is less developed, as she seems to present an alternative -- she trades her current unhappiness for the traditional misery of a poor marriage.<br /><br />At the end Iris manipulates the barren work environment to her advantage. Perhaps there is hope for us after all.
