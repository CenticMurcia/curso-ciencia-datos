I didn't like this movie because it was populated with a bunch of mindless losers. Bob and Carol represent everything wrong with Hollywood and America today, amoral "feeling" versus thinking rationally. My wife and I couldn't decide if this was a satire, a comedy, or a drama. Mostly it just seemed to be a lampoon of 60's Hollywood hedonistic, leftist, thinking, and represents today's moral relativism where everything is OK if it feels good. There ARE moral absolutes, regardless of what "modern" thinking proclaims. Sanctity of marriage is good and infidelity is bad, it's that simple. Bob and Carol are so lacking in any moral foundation, let alone common sense, that they are misled by the morons at the Institute (Esalen, for those of you who are unaware of it; it's a real place sad to say) into almost destroying their marriage and that of their friends. At least in the end reality hits them in the nose and after a stint in bed together they realize the moral bankruptcy of their "new thinking". I assume they went home and their marriages were better for the experience. But one should not need such an experience to remain faithful to one's spouse. Why do people marry anyway if not to remain faithful to each other? Single days are for catting around, not marriage.
