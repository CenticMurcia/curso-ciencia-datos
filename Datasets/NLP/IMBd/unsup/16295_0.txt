I had this movie in mind for a long, long time. I knew that it would make an impact, and for that reason I waited and waited, having seen so much footage from the era already. Now, I have seen it, and it once more fully confronts the viewer with the Holocaust.<br /><br />The scenes inside the crematoria's and gaschambers are...well...convincing. What can one say. Some scenes and sounds were plain nervewrecking and they should be. The hate one feels against those who murdered all those people and the sadness over all those dead cannot be escaped by the audience.<br /><br />This movie doesn't simply 'deliver', it smashes the Holocaust in the viewers face. It has it's small flaws, but it does the job very well. A good movie with an interesting standpoint from the Sonderkommando.<br /><br />Never forget. History tends to repeat itself.
