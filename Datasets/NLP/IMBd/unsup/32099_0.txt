Big surprise of a movie! Very well written, with excellent performances by Liam Neeson and Oliver Platt. Some very witty humor, combined with lots of suspense/tension made for a rivetting film. The downsides were a few holes in the plot, as well as a somewhat "Hollywood" type of ending; a little too-neatly wrapped up. But all in all, a pleasant surprise!
