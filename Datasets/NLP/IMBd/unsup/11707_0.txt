"The Awful Truth" is, in my opinion, the best screwball comedy from the golden age of Hollywood. Curiously, it's the one example of this comedy genre that doesn't get the attention it deserves. People are quick to mention "Bringing Up Baby" or "It Happened One Night", but both of these films run a distant second and third when compared to "The Awful Truth". The performances of Irene Dunne and Cary Grant are pure classic. They are Lucy and Jerry Wariner, a married couple who decide to divorce when they feel they can no longer trust each other. The judge grants a divorce with a waiting period of 90 days, during which they can't stay out of each other's lives, in part because of their shared custody of Mister Smith, their dog (who classic film fans will recognize as Asta from the Thin Man series). > There are numerous classic screwball moments in this film. Maybe one day this film will get the respect it deserves as the best screwball comedy of all time!
