When Disney decided to close Disney Australia, Cinderella III was in its pipeline. This fired up the production crew to put extra effort into this particular sequel, $6 million to make and Disney Australia's final film. The result's a worthy addition to the Disney Cinderella universe, giving the central characters more dimensions and interactions. The Prince, King, Stepmother and Stepsisters all expand their thoughts and feelings (we learn how the King felt for his departed Queen, etc.). The mice have fun moments including their whacky takeoff of "disfunctional theater" as they explain to the Prince key plot points, and once again prove heros as they scamper about the Nightmare Pumpkin taking Cinderella to her possible demise. Cinderella, often perceived as weak because of her 50's heritage, becomes more pro-active and almost an action-hero in the film's closing moments. Animation ranges from TV to feature quality, with faithful color timing, solid music and good voice talents topping things off.
