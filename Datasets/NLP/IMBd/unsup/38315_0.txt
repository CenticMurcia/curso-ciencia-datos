I only managed to watch the first 30mins of the first episode of this drivel, before I turned it off. Yes, I know I stand to be accused of not letting the characters & the plot-lines build, but come on people, I've seen Guthy-Renker infomericials with better narratives than this tosh.<br /><br />In the 30mins that I managed to watch, they managed to cram nearly every sappy cliché' ever written into the storyline. It almost seemed that the writers were having a cliché' competition, after spending a bonding weekend at a Hollywood cliché' convention!!! If you've seen any of the 5 seasons of 24, or the 3 seasons of Lost, the characters are all there, just rehashed & regurgitated back onto our screens as 'must see' TV.<br /><br />BLAH!!!! At least the wonderful Jacqueline McKenzie has been able to keep bread on her table by participating in this drivel & has been able to do some serious acting on the side (Opal Dream & Peaches) with the money she has made here. <br /><br />If you are craving for decent sci-fi TV, the current series of Dr Who is miles ahead to this rubbish!
