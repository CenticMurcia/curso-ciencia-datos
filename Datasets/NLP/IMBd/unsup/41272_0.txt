As I sat down to watch "Contagion", I hoped that the movie wasn't going to be a complete and utter waste of my time. My hopes were not only dashed, but they were also horrifically bludgeoned to death by a blunt club.<br /><br />I found the acting to be quite over-dramatic and at some points forced.<br /><br />Their performances were about as novice as a 13 year old boy trying to remove his girlfriend's bra. I am actually being very kind in my criticisms.<br /><br />I find that when a movie is poorly written no manner of great acting can save it, not that there was any great acting in "Contagion." The writing and dialogue were stilted and hackneyed. This movie explains why the writer hasn't done anything after writing it. There was no believability in the storyline at some points. There were more holes in the storyline than on a small town's main street. There was no connection or storyline between the climax of the movie and the denouement. It was like they had been running out of money around the end so they had to quickly end the movie. <br /><br />The science in the movie was deplorable. I believe that if your going to write a movie involving science that you should at least get information from a reliable source to back your writing. I know that not all movies are 100% scientifically correct, but at least make an actual attempt to be somewhat realistic. Like how the intelligent and ,of course, beautiful virus doctor took the dying nurse's locket to give to the nurse's daughter, and she didn't even disinfect it or keep it in the quaranteed area.<br /><br />I advise that no one should ever view this movie again, because it is an insult to cinema and all we hold dear about movies. I give this movie a F minus (which is saying a lot for the movie). Any movie that needs an overly precocious and mischievous child actor(how nauseatingly Hollywood) to make people warm up to the movie should never be seen. <br /><br />Alison H.
