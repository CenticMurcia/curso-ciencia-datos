I used to like to play role playing games when I was young so I thought I might enjoy this independent film about a group of role players, but I was very disappointed. Even though it is an indie film it is very below the standards of anything I've ever seen before. First off I thought the gamers would be a little younger, usually people that old don't game do they? So that made it very unbelievable, but I tried to get past it. Then we come to the very lame and cheesy writing and acting, both of which are so bad you keep stopping and asking yourself "are they really that bad or are they trying to be extra cheesy to make this whole movie a joke?" Either way, you will find nothing good about this stupid silly little movie, I would not waste my time with this one if I were you.
