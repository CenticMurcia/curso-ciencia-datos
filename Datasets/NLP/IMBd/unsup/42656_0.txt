Hype can sell anything. I tried to watch this boring, stereotype-pushing piece of poor cinema three times before I could make myself sit through an entire episode. The actresses in this show have proved that they are limited to TV celebrity status. None of them have ever been in a movie where their acting has shown (sometimes their bodies are shown in such movie classics as Heaven's Prisoners and the Cool Surface). Also, Tango and Cash, that was a great cinematic moment. But playing across from Stallone? That is better than playing across from Newman or Steiger when it comes to bringing out true acting talent.<br /><br />The obvious, over-the-top hyping of this show on Good Morning America is a true ipecac. Every Friday and every Monday Charlie, Diane, and Robin talk about the show as if it were the most important news item of the day.<br /><br />If DH were a magazine, you would find it in the grocery store checkout line over the tic tacs and next to People Magazine.<br /><br />Real art and talent deserves to be recognized. This show deserves to be canceled.<br /><br />However, given the garbage on TV, this show ranks about in the middle.<br /><br />Where are the Seinfeld's, the Bob Newhart's. the Cheers, the Taxi's? Will we ever have a really good TV show again or will we be force fed this soap opera debris and told that it is great and nod our heads like so many marionettes in agreement.<br /><br />The real allure of the show? Sexy middle aged chicks pretending to have sex.
