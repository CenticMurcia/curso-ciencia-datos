A great picture of the sleazy side of life in the thirties before the Hays commission took over. Barbara Stanwyck is fabulous as a tough streetwise girl turned nurse. Any rumors about her having some flaw in her figure should be finally put to rest by her slim form in camisole and pettipants. Joan Blondell makes an equal impact as her wise-cracking sidekick. And last but definitely not least, Clark Gable plays a tough but very very sexy chauffeur who menaces Stanwyck in a rather seductive way. Although he later went on to play this roguish character to perfection in films like Red Dust and Gone with the Wind, here it has a nasty quality that brings out a new side to his acting. Overall, a wonderful guilty pleasure!
