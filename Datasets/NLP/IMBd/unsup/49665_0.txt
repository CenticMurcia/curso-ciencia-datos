What? I watched this movie with my two young nephews (8 and 11 years old) and it very nearly put all of us to sleep on a Friday night before the sun went down (8pm). In fact, it put them to bed (they're asleep at 8:10 while I am babysitting with them at my place) - I guess that's "one" GOOD thing that came from this movie; it'll knock the kids out fast. This movie was a real bomb (by bomb I mean the original use of the word). We didn't get it at all. The two boys hung in there during the movie; patiently (although there was A LOT of sighing) and I kept thinking...something good Has GOT to happen because Dustin, Natalie & Jason would never haven taken a movie with such a dead beat theme and ending. None of the characters that were introduced were developed very far at all. I am still scratching my head...
