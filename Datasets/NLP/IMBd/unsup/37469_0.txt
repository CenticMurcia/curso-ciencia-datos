No substantial plot, gratuitous nudity and language (the f-word), no positive values.<br /><br />There are very few movies I want to walk out on, but this was one of them. 10 to 15 minutes into this . . . this . . . this thing, the movie had no direction or plot--except to prominently display a male in full frontal nudity and assault on my ears and sensibilities. (Any creative artist who has to resort to continued obscenities to carry his piece is neither creative nor an artist.) Frankly, I'm surprised that many "stars" appeared in the film. An embarrassment.<br /><br />It's as bad as the "movie" being made by one of the students at the art school----oh, maybe that's it: Confidential is actually an escapee from a first year student.
