Another sequel to the crow franchise. i absolutely adored the first film. its a stunning film which set the standard very high for anyone to do better. since that film there has been nothing better. Its original sequel (the Crow: city of angels) was an incredibly poor film. I have seen much worse films but that came close to being one of the worst. Its third outing however (the Crow: Salvation) i enjoyed. Along with having a relatively original story (but keeping it strongly to the original) it has a strong acting cast who portray each character well. IF your a fan of the crow series its worth seeing each film. If you watch the films in order you can truly see how much better the third installment is.i give it 7/10
