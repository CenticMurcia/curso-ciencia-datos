Sri Lankan cinema is largely known by the works of its grand old man Lester James Peries. This new film by Vimukti Jayasundara was made with the availability of foreign funds. This is the reason why there are many non sri lankan themes. There are certain films which are praised by critics for reasons unknown to the general public. This is precisely the case with this film. It has elements which one rarely sees in a Sri Lankan film. The depiction of war is so imaginary, completely different from the actual reality in contemporary Sri Lanka. This is something which has angered many natives of Sri Lanka. They accused the filmmaker of supporting the enemies of the nation. I had the misfortune of meeting this film's creator at a film festival. He had problems expressing his ideas. This can be the reason why he chose to have few sounds in his film. Watch it if you have nothing better to do in life.
