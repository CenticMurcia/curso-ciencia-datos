Take Malcolm McDowell who dies quickly, rather like the plot of this film. He is the only star in the film. I did recognise Chris Penn but I don't know what I've seen him in before, possibly Reservoir Dogs. Wrestling fans may recognise a brief appearance by Leon White also known as WCW and WWE Superstar Big Van Vader. His fight scene is most likely the best and well organised fight in the whole film.<br /><br />This is a manga comic or anime film that has been made into live action and it was obviously a really bad idea.<br /><br />No script, bad story, really bad acting and some really bad fighting scenes. I really wish I hadn't bothered watching it.
