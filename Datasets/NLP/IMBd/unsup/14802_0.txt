For all those who want to know whether Kal Ho Naa Ho is a remake of Hrishikesh Mukherjee's Anand, the answer is yes. And no. <br /><br />Shah Rukh Khan's character (Aman) is largely inspired by Rajesh Khanna's happy-go-lucky charmer in Anand. But on the whole, Kal Ho Naa Ho is as different as they come. <br /><br />The film kicks off with Manhattan resident Naina Catherine Kapur (Preity Zinta) narrating the story of her life over her daily morning jog. <br /><br />Don't Miss! <br /><br />The characters in Naina's life are introduced with the same energy that Naina puts into her jog. There is her mom Jennifer (Jaya Bachchan in jeans), who shares a love-hate relationship with her mother-in-law Sushma Seth (at her loudest Punjabi best). <br /><br />Mommy runs a flop restaurant. Grandmother is a flop singer. Together they are chaos. <br /><br />Enough reason for Naina to turn into a boring, bespectacled spinster type who takes life too seriously. <br /><br />The only interesting person in Naina's life is buddy Rohit Patel (Saif Ali Khan). He is uncool with women but thinks he is cool. He is also a typical Gujarati, whose father (Satish Shah) runs a business called Dial A Dhokla. <br /><br />Enter funny guy Aman, who turns out to be the proverbial angel in Naina's life. He is Dale Carnegie-Jim Carrey-Richard Gere-Deepak Chopra all rolled into one. He zooms into Naina's neighbourhood singing Pretty woman and woos everyone in sight, including uppity Naina. <br /><br />Naina hates him at first sight, but can't help being overwhelmed by Aman's charm. <br /><br />Even Rohit takes tips from Aman on how to be cool and influence people. Life is a song and dance till the interval. <br /><br />And After that everything is mystery, lol what?<br /><br />This is indeed a breathtaking movie! Go and watch instead of watching silly bollywood movies!
