I can see why people hate this, but really there's a lot of good lines in there. It's an absurd movie but maybe you have to have seen it 20 times when you were 19 (and entertainment choices were more limited than they are now) to really appreciate it. Anyway, I love it. Phil Hartman is great. I will admit to being a Grodin fan and maybe that is necessary too. I love the Club Sand Song. The catch phrases, "What!" "Brainwash" "Manwhaaaaay-lo" "we're gonna teach you" But it's full of SNL-style, catch-phrase heavy humor, sketch-oriented type stuff, and you shouldn't miss Megan Mulally as 17 yr old Jessica. It was all something back in '86.
