Basically, most of the actors rush their lines, and except for the two Antonios (Lochlyn Munro somewhat OK), the acting basically sucked, which means the directing also sucked. <br /><br />Weak story, weak writing. Worst of all was the music. <br /><br />It's also funny that the writer (Mike Mains, the worst actor in the film) wrote himself the part of having the first primary relationship in the film. The interaction between the two of them is about as exciting as that between a turtle and a rock.<br /><br />The positive reviews here are a joke. It is however, an adequate film for those who want to get high and laugh at how awful this film is.
