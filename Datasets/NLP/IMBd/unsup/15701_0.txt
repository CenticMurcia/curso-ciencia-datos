I am a fan of Dodie Smith's book and thought that this movie complemented the book very well.<br /><br />The style and look of the movie was brilliant. From the clothes to the scenery, it was a visual feast.<br /><br />The best part of this movie was the casting. The casting was perfect! Every actor fit their character beautifully. Romola Garai was great as the naive Cassandra. Henry Cavil is wonderful in his quiet, intense way (and of course he's gorgeous!), and Marcus Blucas and Henry Thomas were utterly charming as the Cotton brothers.<br /><br />The only thing I can say negative about this movie is that the conclusion was made very obvious. The relationships between characters was given away at the very beginning, lessening the impact of the ending. (It's more subtle in the book.) I highly request reading the book first, before seeing the movie! It will allow you to make your own assumptions about the characters before the movie reveals all! If you want to see a smart, romance I suggest this film!
