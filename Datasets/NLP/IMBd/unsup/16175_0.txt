I love low and no budget horror flicks. Ironbound Vampire was probably made for five bucks. It's got it's saving graces, but they may not appeal to everybody. The look of the main vampire is perfect. His vampire bride is excellent. The casting of Conrad Brooks and Delores Fuller is a treat. Conrad Brooks is really effective (maybe I've been drinking too much of the wine he was pushing in this movie). There's good music too. The story contains some decent creepy ideas that really appeal to me also. There's quite a few good artistic touches in this movie, but in the end it's still a very low low budget video. This is a good start even if the movie never manages to fully rise above it's severe budget restraints.
