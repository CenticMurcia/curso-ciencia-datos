It takes a long time for the film to get going. Not at all gripping, exciting or scary. I was very glad that there was nothing else on TV to watch. If you have seen The Breed then you have seen the better version of this film. If you have not seen it then watch it rather than this film. It is the type of movie that you watch to the end hoping that it will get better.<br /><br />The film actually gets going after about fifty mins, not that it's to going. The sound track is typical early nineties and the acting matches the soundtrack, Although this review is very negative, if you do watch this film for more than forty mins then keep going you may see a little blood...... Typical low budget cast and low budget effects.
