You'll find this video nasty on the shelves under the name Axe. Don't be tempted to spend your money even if it is at Wal-Mart, which I doubt.<br /><br />After being banned in Britain, it was released uncut in 2005. They didn't do anyone any favors as the production values are bottom of the barrel, the acting is little to none, and the horror is all off screen. I can't even guess why it was banned in the first place unless it had to do with the rumor that the girl in the film was allegedly 13. No, nothing happens to her, as she kills an attempted rapist with a straight razor, and chops another with an axe after he fights her for about five minutes. Some tough guy - he can't even subdue a little girl.<br /><br />Writer/director Frederick R. Friedel only made three films, turning to comedy after his failure at exploitation horror. Leslie Lee was only a voice in one other film. Ray Green was also in only one other film. Jack Canon didn't have much of a career - mostly voice work. And, this was granddad's (Douglas Powers) only film. In fact, the only person that had a long career in film was David Hayman, and he was only a voice on the TV in this film. He is probably happy about that.
