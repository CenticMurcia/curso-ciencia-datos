Nothing great in DNA except the fact that you will laugh during the whole movie. Bad scenario+ bad special effects+ bad actors(Mark Dacascos)+etc=DNA. Believe it or not, Mark Dacascos is playing a SCIENTIST!!!!!!Not a soldier!!! Well, what a scientist!! He shoots, he kills soldiers and he fights the monster. By the way, we don't know if the creature (I am not talking about Mark Dacascos) is a dinosaur or an alien...At the beginning of the movie, they are searching for dinosaur bones. At the middle, they say that it is an alien. Special effect are bad (the helicopter sequence is the worst)and the monster looks like to be a plastic action figure. Mark dacascos is (again) playing the tough guy. Barney was better, maybe. DNA is a Barney movie:bloody version. I give it 0 out of *****!!!
