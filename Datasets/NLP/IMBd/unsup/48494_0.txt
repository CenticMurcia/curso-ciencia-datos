This movie is definitely not a family film. It has several jokes which are uncomplimentary and sexually explicit. Many dialogs and scenes are not worth watching with your family especially with kids under 12! The dialogs are not only explicit, they are vulgar, of low standards and do not add to the story.<br /><br />The use of explicit material is becoming more common on the Indian cinema nowadays and so many people may not find this a big deal but I think this movie went a little past that too. I mean Akshay points at a mother's breasts. Moreover, the mother is half naked. Besides, there's a conversation about mother's nipples. I mean come one, this is gross, not funny. <br /><br />So, this movie is for those who like slapstick and don't care about acting or poor jokes. For those who do, I recommend you not watch this movie.
