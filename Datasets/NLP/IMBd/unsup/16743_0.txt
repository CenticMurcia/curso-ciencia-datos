SPOILERS<br /><br />Yes, yes, I know this is not a Holiday show, let alone movie, but I really wanted to comment on it. This show is created by who else than Matt Groening, who obviously created the Simpsons. Although it may not be as good as the Simpsons it is still a fantastic comedic cartoon. The characters in Futurama also have overbites like the characters in the Simpsons. The characters are not yellow, though. As you know by now, Futurama takes place in the future, so there are robots, aliens, one-eyed aliens that look like regular humans, people from Mars that look like regular people, one hundred sixty year old men, and much, much more. The future contains tubes that suck people to places, booths that can kill you, and hover cars. <br /><br />A pizza delivery boy named Fry who goes out to deliver pizza. It is almost the year 2000. At the place where he is supposed to deliver the pizza he falls into a freezer. He is frozen. One thousand years go by. It is the year 3000. When he thaws out he is flabbergasted at what he sees. He learns that his nephew Professor Farnsworth lives close by. He meets a robot named Bender. All he does is drink and smoke cigars. He meets Leela, a one-eyed alien that looks like a regular human. She chases him to make him get his delivery job. He finds Farnsworth. Bender, Leela, and Fry become delivery people, alien, and robot. Fry also meets Amy, Hermes, and Dr. Zoidberg. All of them go on zany adventures.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fantastic cartoon. Although it may not be as good, it's still great. I never found this show to be as funny as the Simpsons, though. I mean, there's laugh-out-loud moments, but just no as much as the Simpsons had. I also found some endings to Futurama are incredibly sad and depressing. Some of the endings include the ending to Jurassic Bark, when a flashback shows that Fry's dog in the past had waited next to the pizza parlour for Fry to return for the rest of his life. I mean, it's so sad, the dog had waited for him. The dog's eyes were so sad and hopeful. Also the end in Time Keeps on Slipping was really depressing. Anyway, this is a great show.<br /><br />9/10<br /><br />Recommended Titles: The Simpsons.
