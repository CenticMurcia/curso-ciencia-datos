Don Juan is sent back to Spain because of his numerous romantic escapades and becomes involved in training the royal army in sword fighting, while also catching the eye of Queen Margaret. Don Juan and the queen are unaware of Don Rodrigo, the minister of state, who is planning accumulate the power to seize the throne from King Philip. Queen Margaret upsets Don Rodrigo, by trying to maintain her power, who is also at odds with Don Juan. Don Juan and the queen are eventually captured by Don Rodrigo and his aides, but the great romantic escapes from the dungeon to stop Don Rodrigo from going ahead with his plans. The film is good, but plays more as a parody of Flynn's former films such as Robin Hood, Sea Hawk, etc., with little emphasis on action until the final reel, which gives us one of filmdom's best sword fights with Flynn vs. Douglas and his men on the staircase. Lindfors plays more for eye candy rather than give a good performance. Hale (in his last film w/ Flynn) plays the role adequately, and Douglas is superb as the villain. Nice script with many humorous touches. Rating, 8.
