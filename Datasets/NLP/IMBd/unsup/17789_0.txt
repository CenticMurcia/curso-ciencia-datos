This was done back in the early 1970s were Hollywood was desperate to try anything to drive audiences back to theatres (attendance was at an all time low in the early 70s). The only movies that made money were sex movies and violent movies. So, they combined them! This was considered pretty shocking in its day--today it's fairly tame (although it would still get an R rating) with gratitous blood, gore and female nudity.<br /><br />As one previous poster noted it plays like an unsold TV pilot. The acting is bad (especially by the men), the plots are predictable and, despite all the surgery views, it's all very dull. The only bright point is Dyan Cannon's brief, flashy appearance as a cheating wife. She's just great--but she's killed off after one scene! <br /><br />It's almost worth watching for laughs but I was kind of uncomfortable laughing at a movie were a bunch of very talented actresses are forced to take their clothes off just to turn on the audience. This was a big bomb in its day--that should tell you something.<br /><br />Only worth seeing if you're totally bored or want to see a bunch of very talented actors embarass themselves. Depressing.<br /><br />
