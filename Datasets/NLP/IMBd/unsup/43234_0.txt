This is one I'm certain those associated with the project will not want on their resumes. I sat there watching this Bomb and began to feel sorry for those attached to the project. The editing is lousy. But perhaps it wasn't the editors fault. Maybe the Director didn't give the Editor enough decent material to use. And, maybe it wasn't the Director's fault. Perhaps the Director didn't have enough time in his budget to get better takes on location. All in all I blame the producers and the network. A very sad effort and a waste of time for everyone involved, from the beginning Production Assistants on the set to the suits authorizing payments in the board rooms, the only positive use of this disaster would be to use it in a "Film Class" to show others how not to produce a movie.
