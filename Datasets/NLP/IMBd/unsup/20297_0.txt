The Big Store is a Marx brothers movie from 1941.The plot is irrelevant as it is in any other Marx movie.All that makes any difference is how funny these movies are and I can tell you about this one; IT IS.This time the brothers go crazy in a department store.Groucho plays Wolf J. Flywheel, the private eye, Harpo is Wacky, his silent partner and Chico is Ravelli, the bodyguard of the singer Tommy Rogers (Tony Martin).The amazing Margaret Dumont makes her last appearance with the Marx brothers playing Martha Phelps.It was most hilarious in all those movies to watch Groucho court Margaret and at the same time humiliate her the worst way.She didn't seem to mind.The Big Store is an underrated gem that shouldn't be thrown away.There are lots of scenes that raise this movie higher than many modern movies would deserve to be raised.It's incredible to watch the brothers roller skating in the store.There are also some musical numbers in the movie.It's great to watch and listen to Groucho singing "Sing While You Sell".There's the lady (Virginia O'Brien) singing "Rock-A-Bye Baby with a frozen face.I just loved her! Chico and Harpo playing piano together is just hilarious! Harpo playing his beloved harp with the mirror reflections is just magical! I'm just reading Harpo Marx' autobiography "Harpo Speaks!".It's fascinating to read how these brothers grew up in poverty under the wings of Minnie and Frenchie and became the comedy team everybody loves.These brothers worked great as a team.The viewer can sense that.That's probably why we still love them.It's timeless, their humor.You can live the 1940's or whatever decade or millennium, it always works.If somebody woke them up now and they'd be back in the moving pictures, the movie theaters would be packed with people.And the laughter would be heard miles away.
