I loved this movie. It shows what courageous women went through in order for all women to enjoy a right that was once thought to be only worthy of men. Discrimination and patronizing plagued their efforts, and all shows that not all women suffrage groups were on the same side when it came to voting. I think this movie is important because it shows the women of today how hard their ancestors fought to secure us a luxury that so few practice today and how important it is.
