This film is unfathomably bad. The script sounds like it was doctored purposefully to be the worse script ever. <br /><br />The 'story' jumped around and the pacing was awful. The film in general made no sense. <br /><br />In some scenes you could see the auto exposure kick in, and some shots had a rounded border. Everything seemed carefully made to be amazingly rubbish. <br /><br />The special features include a 'Main Menu', 'Chapter Selection' and 'Original Soundtrack'.<br /><br />I laughed so hard at everything after watching this my face hurt.
