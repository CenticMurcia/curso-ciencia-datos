One of the most stupid films I have ever seen. I tried to find an excuse for the director of the film, but there is no one except if he had maybe been abused as a child and for that reason wanted to imply a lot of violence with no film trace at all. If you can watch this film until the end, then you will never consider any film boring. It is a wasted time and money, wasted talent of actors and camera which is beautiful as the Grand Canyon. However, everything else is so stupid as most insulting offense. There is no plot in the film, just two people lost in the wildness - and that is exactly about all. I cannot remember the film I could not watch until the end, but this is the one. Pls, do not forget if you get into watching this movie you will be able to leave the projection, go to business lunch, come back after an hour and you will not need anyone to tell you what happened meanwhile.
