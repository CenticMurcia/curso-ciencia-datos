I sat down tonight and watched this film, after a full week of re-watching the Beatles Anthology, I was really excited to see this film because it's suppose to be so hard to find, well let me tell you I was so disappointed I can't even begin. The truth is this film is to the Beatles what "Eat the Document" is to Bob Dylan. It's interesting but it's also boring and pointless. They don't explain anything, if I hadn't watched the Anthology Doc I wouldn't even have a clue why the hell they're in this big film studio, plus, I don't think John Lennon says more then three words in the whole film (Paul never seem to shut up though). It's more footage of them singing and playing the songs then anything else. I'm sure for some people that's going to be really fascinating, but for me I can listen to the CD, I want to hear them talk, argue, get into it, tell a joke something, but no they just sort of sit around and don't do anything. The only part of this film that I really really liked was the footage of "I Me Mine" where John and Yoko waltz around the empty sound stage. More of that kind of stuff would have made for an interesting film, but instead it's all music and not much else. If someone that really, and I mean really loves the Beatles said hey should I watch that film, I'd say have you seen the Anthology, if they say yes I'd say don't bother, because most of the good stuff is on that anyway and it's properly formatted. If you really must go ahead and watch this film but be warned if you're looking for anything other then a series of them playing various songs, forget about this one.
