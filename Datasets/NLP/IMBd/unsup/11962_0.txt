It not very often that I go to the same movie twice while it's in the theaters, but this one was so good I almost stayed through another showing of it on the same night. The opening dance sequence is worth the price of admission alone.<br /><br />The funny CGI effects are pretty cartoon like, but there's also PLENTY of action scenes to keep you going. It's almost like Roger Rabbit sometimes with the over the top effects. You're just waiting for someone to hit on the head with a frying pan and then have their head look like a frying pan.<br /><br />Just about every face on the screen has at least one funny moment. There's the disgruntled tenant with perpetual Plumber's butt, the bucktooth and trampy local girl, the chain-smoking landlady and silent and ineffective sidekick who can only grr timidly when asked for backup.<br /><br />The action doesn't let up much, but you still you want more and more. I've got to get this as soon as it comes to DVD. It's something you can watch over and over again.
