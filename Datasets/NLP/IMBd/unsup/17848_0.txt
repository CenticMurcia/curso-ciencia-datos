I have been a Golgo-13 fan ever since I first played "Top Secret Episode: Golgo-13" for the 8-bit NES back in the fall of 1988. It was a game that involved side-scroll shooting, first-person perspective shooting, dialogue scenes, helicopter shootout, scuba-dive shootout, and a 3-D action maze scene. It was a game of intrigue, and international espionage, that dealt with the concept of how "One man can accomplish the impossible...One man can make a difference" in the chaos and confusion that surrounds our complex world...<br /><br />What I do remember most about the 8-bit NES game is that the gameplay was as in-depth and complex as your typical Sherlock Holmes mystery novel. As Duke Togo, you travel from Germany, Greece, Brazil, to Antarctica to gather clues and find information on the whereabouts of the evil mastermind responsible for stealing the Cassandra-G virus (If unleashed, could destroy all life on Earth..). Not to mention, 2 romantic hotel interludes that raises Duke Togo's life meter back to 200 (Now, that's what I call a good night's rest!!). It turnsout in the end, after all of Duke Togo's near misses and narrow escapes, "a brain" housed in a control center is responsible for stealing the Cassandra-G virus, and you must destroy the sensors guarding the brain, and destroy the brain itself, before it is too late...<br /><br />The game was so tough, it took me over 7 1/2-years just to finally beat it! (But, it was well worth it.) :)
