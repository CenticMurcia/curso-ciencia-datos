and just as interesting. A non-writer writes a "screenplay" starring herself, the non-actress, and gets a non-director to say action and cut. Did she really think people would be interested in watching her sleep, get dressed, smoke, drive around, and ride in an elevator? With a real writer, director and actors this might have had a chance, but this is nothing more than a home movie made by amateurs. The director even has the audacity to take the possessory "a film by" credit above the title, perhaps in recognition of his many years of inexperience. There's a reason he and the "star" and most of the others have no other credits--they have utterly no talent or even the slightest ability to make movies. Not only is this movie a crushing bore, but it's incompetent in every respect.
