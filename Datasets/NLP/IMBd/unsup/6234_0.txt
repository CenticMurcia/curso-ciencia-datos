A great movie about the prophetic conversion of the Archbishop of El Salvador. The movie details the life of Oscar Romero after being appointed Archbishop. Believed to be the quiet bookworm, a man that wouldn't stir up anything, Romero makes a conversion in order to save his people from the oppressive government. As a result, he is martyred for his beliefs. A great picture to watch and take in.
