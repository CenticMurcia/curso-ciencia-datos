Vincent Price was, as always, splendid in this movie. Unfortunately, he's only onscreen for about 5 - 10 minutes. Everything else about the movie is boring and hackneyed. Its one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Strike that, it _is_ the worst movie I've ever seen, and I've seen part of Battlefield Earth.<br /><br />It'd get a big fat 0 in my book, except that rating isn't a choice and any movie with Vincent Price should get at least a 1.
