I rented this movie a few weeks ago from a neighbourhood video store. I was interested in it because of Sean Astin. He was great in The Lord Of The Rings. Anyway, because I had never heard of it, I thought it would be one of those movies that had good actors but a bad storyline. But I was amazed when I watched it at how much fun I was having. The film starts out with Sean Astin talking about time and how great it would be to be able to travel in time. Right there I thought I knew that the movie would be bad. Then it goes to Sean in some kind of high-tech room downloading software on to a kind of palm pilot. After this it shows two people, male and female following Sean somewhere. They follow him to a bank, where he withdraws something like $2000, and then begins hitting of the teller. It then shows him turning on his "palm pilot" and follows by the teller throwing her drink at him. He touches the "palm pilot" and time stops. He is just able to touch her drink before time begins to reverse and it goes back to her giving him the money. After this, the movie becomes a fun-filled ride through time and, I personally really had fun with it.
