I found this at an "everything $1.00 store" and bought it just because Sinatra was in it. What a find!! The film is really slow and poorly acted until Sinatra shows up about 20 minutes in but then becomes MUCH better. This is written right after Brando died and all the obituaries said he changed acting with his facial expressions and emotions right out there for the world to see, but it seems to me Old Blue Eyes deserves some of the same credit. In 1954 when this was made, everybody was reading their lines and standing very straight but in this film Sinatra breaks those rules and shows us into the mind and heart of a man badly damaged by his war experiences. <br /><br />If you get a chance to see this by all means do it!
