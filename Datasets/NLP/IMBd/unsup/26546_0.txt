"The Thief of Bagdad" (1924) is an amazing adventure film and it is one of my favorite movies. Starring the athletic Douglas Fairbanks, Senior. Based on the "Arabian Nights" it tells you the story of a thief - Ahmed - in Bagdad that fell in love with a beautiful Princess and has now to gain her love, because "Happiness must be earned".
