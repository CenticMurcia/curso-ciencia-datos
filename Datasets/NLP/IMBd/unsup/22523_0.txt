Tammy (Denise Richards) is a young college student still living with her folks. She has the ex-boyfriend from hell, truly. He beats up all of her new love interests and tries to control her life. Although she has her eye on Michael, she plays it cool to protect him. But, hormones are hormones. She asks him to come over to her house one night and he does. Trouble is, her ex shows up, too. Michael gets the beating of a lifetime and ends up in a coma. Meanwhile, an unethical scientist needs a brain for his animatronic dinosaur. Michael's brain will do and he steals Michael from the hospital. So, that's how we arrive at a T-Rex called Michael. He is out for revenge and he is lethal. Can you spell trouble? This is an absolutely terrible movie. It has cult aspirations but they fall far short of true entertainment. Richards tries very hard and looks beautiful through one preposterous scene after another. The rest of the cast is pretty forgettable. Even the special effects are not that great. Okay. Someone out there will probably love this movie for its foibles, like an Ed Wood disaster. If you are that type, go find yourself a copy of this one. But, for everyone else, stay far, far away. You will end up blowing a couple of hours of your life, time you will never get back.
