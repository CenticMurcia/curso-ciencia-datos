I'm not one for loving cheesy films a whole lot. Sure I can dig Troll 2 for it's insane cheese, or even Blood Freak and it's Turkey Murderer. I guess I'm a fan of the genre, but I can tell you I won't be paying more than 5 bucks for any of them. So whenever I hear of a movie like Mulberry Street, I tend to just shrug and see what good can come out of it. Mulberry Street is a rare breed, it takes a corny premise...Rats infecting people to become killer Rat People, but the movie works, surprisingly well. I'm not gonna get into specifics, because this movie especially, is one you where you shouldn't pay attention to details. If you let it fly, Mulberry Street brings you on a consistently entertaining ride. And with this being a low-budget film, movies of this caliber should only be applauded. If you're looking for a apocalyptic/zombie/vampire/mutant flick, look no further, Mulberry Street is easily good enough to satisfy your Rat Bastard needs.
