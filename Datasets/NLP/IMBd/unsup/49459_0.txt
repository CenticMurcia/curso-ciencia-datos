I can understand why they chose a different style for this installment of Mimic. Too bad I can't understand anything else, such as:<br /><br />Why the honored characters (the bugs) have barely but a cameo appearance, and hardly contribute to the storyline other than they are the "mystery killers"? Well duh.<br /><br />Why the only relationship between the main character (the brother) and the bugs, is that he was one of the surviving children of the plague that the bugs were created for in the first place? Like if it were not for this fact, viewers wouldn't be able to link this installment with the first two.<br /><br />How is the sister's involvement with her drug dealer associate important to the story other than just about everyone in the neighborhood is purported to be a drug user?<br /><br />How is it important that the police officer investigating the killings become romantically involved with the mother? And not waste any time either...<br /><br />Why is the relationship between the brother and the across-the-road beautiful neighbor not carried forward? For that matter, was it important to the storyline in the first place?<br /><br />Sigh. I was left overly disappointed after watching this. I mean Mimic 2 was bad enough, but sheeze, this is so far worse it's not even worth watching to say you've seen it.
