One of the lesser Cassavetes, this one is kind of hard to figure out,<br /><br />but it's still worth seeing if only for Ben Gazarras performance.<br /><br />Playing one of those characters that you love to hate and don't<br /><br />understand, he excels even more than usual. The plot is fairly<br /><br />straight forward, and doesn't merit retelling here. I found it more of<br /><br />a character study, and what a character! Shot in the usual hap<br /><br />hazard Cassavetes style, this one packs a punch that is hard to<br /><br />take. In fact, it took me two days to get through it, but I'm glad I did.
