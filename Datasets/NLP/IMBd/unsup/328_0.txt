Yeah, it is sad when a show you watch ends.....but it is very different when something like this ends. Deadwood is not a TV show. Deadwood was an experience, my roommate watched an episode with me one night and he was INSTANTLY hooked.<br /><br />And he loves it just as much as I do.<br /><br />Every aspect of the series was perfect. From the setting, cast, acting, writing, and just the entire idea of what this show is. I think most people who have had the opportunity to enjoy this show would say this is maybe the most beautifully written drama since Shakespeare. The words used were just beautiful to listen to and their meaning was........full. I don't know how else to describe it. Every piece of dialogue meant something. There was no wasted chit chat, just to pass the time like other shows do (a lot). Character and plot were in constant development and ever-changing.<br /><br />Of course, the star of the show is Ian McShane. Maybe the best acting ever, easily for a Cable TV Show. OK, a brilliant lead actor, what else? Well, everyone else was superb also. I really cannot think of one bad performance. IMO the worst was Steve the Drunk, but I would still give his acting an "A".<br /><br />I love Timothy Olyphant and his character, Seth Bullock. It was not nearly as good as Ian McShane, but the character was not supposed to be that way. Olyphant did a good job because he was calm, yet you could feel the fury and rage burning inside him. It was given to the viewer, and every episode you waited for him to explode........that is drama.
