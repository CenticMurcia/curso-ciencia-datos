This is the episode that got me completely hooked. <br /><br />Jack story lines are always convincing and entertaining, and it seemed to me to be the episode in which the survivors really had to adjust to life on the island. Beautifully shot and acted, Matthew Fox gives an amazing performance. All the survivors seem to realize that their days may be numbered, adding an entire other element to their lives on the mysterious island. With cuts reminiscent of "Fight Club," "White Rabbit" is an eerie and beautiful episode which I believe shows all the amazing simplicity that season one was loaded with. Mystery shrouded by the truth of a human condition. <br /><br />Jack realizes he really is only human, which makes his character all the more convincing. Locke's speech about beauty is breathtaking, and is applicable to much more than this show.
