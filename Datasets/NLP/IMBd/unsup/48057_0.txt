The very dark plot could have worked, but its all too exploitative, sleazy and cheesy. As interesting as it is to see Mark Lester play a different character to that he plays in Oliver, it doesn't stop him being incredibly wooden. Also, every time something f&*ked up happens in the film, the characters show very little reaction to it, which is infuriating. Its a mess too, the end especially, which is very shocking, and was probably one of my favourite moments, but it seems almost tacked on as an afterthought it happens so randomly.<br /><br />Basically its just twisted soft porn (disturbingly almost verging towards child porn at times) masquerading as an intelligent thriller.<br /><br />Don't listen to the other reviewers, its not worth tracking down.
