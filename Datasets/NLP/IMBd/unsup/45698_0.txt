... that this piece of jiggle/ghost/biker/martial arts exploitation is primarily an uncredited remake of "Once Upon a Time in the West", with a little "High Plaions Drifter" thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />The soundtrack even quotes Morricine's "Once Upon.." soundtrack.<br /><br />Proving, once again, that it's not so much the material as the idiot (or genius) who films it.<br /><br />I caught the last fifteen minutes on satellite some time ago, thought it seemed familiar, and managed to catch the last complete run on that cycle, and sure enough, it was.<br /><br />If it wasn't so darned expensive -- it was intended for the rental market, not the consumer "seel through" market -- i'd buy a copy just to show to people who would be able to appreciate the sheer effrontery of the people who made this travesty.<br /><br />And the thought Caesar had gall.
