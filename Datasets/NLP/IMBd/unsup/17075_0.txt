Cary Grant stars in this film. Is there anything else that needs to be said? Grant plays the former husband of newspaper reporter Russell. It is of course a romantic comedy, but one that is hilarious even today. The chemistry and dialogue between Grant and Russell rings genuine. Besides the romance, and the comedy, is the commentary the film makes about newspaper reporting and reporters. The key to this film is listening. This is not a popcorn picture where you can make comments to your viewing companions. If you talk you'll miss half of the jokes. So keep quiet and enjoy. Also Grant makes references to himself in a typically funny scene.
