I bought this movie from a video store that was going out of business and the cover caught my eye, plus reading the very brief and cheesy back sold me into buying it. This is a good movie, it is a little cheesy but I must say, I think the Video Game company, Capcom, saw this movie and heavily used parts of this for the game Resident Evil. For example; replace Albert Wesker from R.E. with Barry Bostwick, the Tyrant with a metal werewolf and keep the main characters pretty much the same. The way Barry Bostwick dies is the same way Albert dies and the same for the werewolf dying just like the Tyrant. The story simply goes like this; in 1974, the US military goes into the Carpathian forest to find a werewolf to get it's blood and use it's DNA to create the ultimate biological weapon(like Resident Evil again)but one of the men gets too cocky and takes the blood himself and all hell breaks loose (close enough to RE to mention it again). Barry Bostwick manages to take down and put the cocky werewolf guy in deep freeze until 20 years later when technology has advanced enough to resume the project. Of course, the werewolf gets loose again and causes havoc again or else there wouldn't be a movie. It was entertaining and had some really good special effects. 7/10
