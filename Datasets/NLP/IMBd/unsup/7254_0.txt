A child's point of view is a nice way of seeing ugly and distant political and social facts. Julie Gravas updates the style of her father for a new age, treating austerely political repression and social innovation which served the interest of many at the cost of harming most. Those who lived in those modern dark ages, in countries like Brazil, Chile , Argentina, Uruguai, Greece, Spain, Portugal, and several others, which are now democracies, will have a new look through the eyes (with a biographical touch) a lovely young girl and her little brother. Sometimes funny, other times dramatic, even tragic, but throughout well-conducted and subtly inspired. Not to be missed.
