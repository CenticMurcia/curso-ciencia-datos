I will not forget this movie for the rest of my life! Although the direction is excellent with a very good script and good production values, the performances are the standout aspect of this remarkable film. Alan Arkin and Sondra Locke make the film work and were both nominated for Oscars for their work here. Their scenes are magic, but Arkin is easily the stronger performance of the two. The supporting cast is very good, but Chuck McCann deserves special mention here. A comedian who's work has mainly been very lighthearted, he plays a straight dramatic role here and does a excellent job. A very human, very touching, very emotional film, the last 15-20 minutes will stay with you a very long time. Turner Classic Movies runs this on occasion and it is currently in print. Most highly recommended.
