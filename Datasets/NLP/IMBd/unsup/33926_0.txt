The snoopy reporter Jackie (Kelly Sue Roth) proposes the television producer Gilbert (Nitin Adsul) to investigate the small town of Buckeystown, Maryland, where in the last twenty years dozen of disappearances have occurred. Gilbert accepts and Jackie together with a cameraman drive to the local inn. Meanwhile, a young couple arrives in the inn since the husband will have a job interview in a video company of the town. Jackie interviews the reluctant locals and realizes that the common sense is that travelers and non-residents are abducted by UFOs in the haunted highway Route 180. However, she unravels a dark hidden secret from the elders of Buckeystown.<br /><br />I am a fan of horror movies and also low-budget movies, but unfortunately "The Inn" is an awful mess. The concept of the dark story is not bad, with a small town that had serious difficulties in the past and the population to survive eats human flesh and becomes addicted insane cannibals, killing foreigners to satisfy their needs. However, the screenplay is completely dissociated between scenes and without a previous development (and even names) of the characters. The time-line is also confused, mixing day and night, i.e., in one scene it is day, and the next one it is night. The amateurish camera and lighting are terrible, using weird angles, and the edition is illogical. The unknown cast is reasonable, and the beautiful Kelly Sue Roth deserved a better make-up, since the DVD highlights the acne in her face. The movie seems to be dubbed in English, without the use of ambient sound. My vote is two.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): "The Inn - Mist√©rios na Pousada" ("The Inn - Mysteries in the Inn")
