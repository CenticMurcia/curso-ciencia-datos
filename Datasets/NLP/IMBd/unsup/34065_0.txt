It's sad to see what just one director is able to do to someone's memory. 'Modigliani' by Mick Davis is a poor melodrama in a "pop tribute" suit, with an awful soundtrack, made against a great genius memory. It should be forbidden to Art's students.<br /><br />The good work of some actors is not enough to save this 'pasticcio' from the clich√©s and absolute inelegance. Despite of the eventual interest in Modigliani's deranged private life, it couldn't have been used as an attraction to 'teen audiences' to do such an inconsistent movie that promotes a false romantic hero. There's total lack of respect and delicateness to treat psychological complex profiles that Modigliani and his contemporaries colleagues had. Mick Davis simply gave us total flat, stupid characters. A clamorous example is Modigliani's wife, Jeanne.
