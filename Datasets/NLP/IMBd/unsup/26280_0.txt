I think American Desi is simply a collection of outrageous stereotypes. Let's put aside the cue little acronyms ABCD (American Born Confused Desi - anyone of Indian descent) and NRI (Not Resident Indian) and look at in my opinion the fundamental flaw with this movie. With the exception of the two females characters- Nina and Priya, nobody is likable in this movie.<br /><br />Both Nina and Priya are charming, sweet and people you want to be around. Unfortunately, they are only supporting characters in this flop. Everybody else is either a total fool, idiot or dork. I don't know any person let alone an Indian, or Pakistani who behaves anything like the men (or should I say "immature boys") in this movie. It seems the creators of this movie want to copy the American screwball comedy formula but, that's not a good idea unless you have good writing, interesting characters, etc. This movie lacks in heart and doesn't deliver on a fascinating idea - a film exploring the lives of American born Indians.
