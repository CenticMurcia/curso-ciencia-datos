Personally, it is one of the best films I have seen over a long time. It is commercial, but has a lot of meaning... there is a message for many, right from lovers... to politicians.<br /><br />As you must be knowing, making a film, means spending money, and all they look for is to derive back that money. As the saying goes, if one does good, good follows. And so most of the bollywood flicks turn out to be glamour and mimicries.<br /><br />But here is a bunch of people who require a grand appluase for their hard work, time and money.<br /><br />I am sure there are more who wish to do good, am sure, watching this film will inspire them.<br /><br />In this case too, am sure the film is going to succeed well. And I really hope they get the money back, so that more "MEANING-FULL" films come up.<br /><br />I am not commenting on the story, because I guess its already available, am here trying to just share the treasure.<br /><br />films like this can definitely make the world a better place...<br /><br />Congrats!!!<br /><br />Thanks for reading this review and hope you do good.
