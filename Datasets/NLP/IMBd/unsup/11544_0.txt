A parody of surfing movies, is that right?<br /><br />Well, first off, the surf/beach movies were already a parody unto themselves. And the hardest thing to do is make fun of a genre that has already skewered itself pretty well right at the beginning. Any series of movies that boast the talents of Frankie Avalon, Annette Funicello, Harvey Lembeck and Buster Keaton is not exactly Oscar territory.<br /><br />In fact, "Surf II" goes the goofball route early on with its tale of zombified surfers eating garbage and making the beach a totally uncool experience for all, dude. And though there's no Frankie and Annette here, this one DOES have Ruth Buzzi, Lyle Waggoner (as "Chief Boyardie" - excuse me, just got up off the floor from laughing so hard), Terry Kiser (years before dying on the beach in "Weekend at Bernie's") and Carol Wayne, Johnny Carson's Tea Time Movie Lady (ROWWWRRR!).<br /><br />But all the kudos go to our main man, the tower of power, too sweet to be sour... Mr. Eddie Deezen, ladies and germs! Let's face it, HE IS THE MAN! And anyone who disagrees is obviously not familiar with his formidable body of work. He is a riot, and far and away the funniest thing in this whole mess. In fact, he is the only worthy part of "Surf II". <br /><br />He also has the best line - "How would YOU like to be the only guy at the beach with t*ts?!" <br /><br />Watch it in context and it's even funnier.<br /><br />Come to think of it, the funniest part yet about "Surf II" was... there was never a "Surf I". Of course, that's '80s humor for you.<br /><br />Two stars for "Surf II", mainly for the Deez Man. As for the rest... WIPEOUT!
