The premise for "La Moustache" should be enough to grab the attention of any film fanatic, especially one who gets thrills from the psychological twists perpetrated upon an audience by the likes of Hitchcock and those he inspired. The film begins simply enough with a man in the bath, inquiring of his wife whether or not he should shave off his mustache. Soon enough he's rid himself of that same lip hair, and no one seems to notice. In fact, maybe he never even had the thing in the first place. How genius a premise, right? The minutiae of daily life are oft overlooked subject matter, so it's refreshing to see something so basic given major importance. Things go along smoothly enough as the man starts to come unwound due to this, but then what? By the time the end credits roll, certain thoughts are running wildly through the mind of the audience. It goes back to wondering just how much can be perpetrated upon an audience before they are either too stumped to get it, or too mentally manipulated to care. This is an interesting film worth a peek, and possibly a discussion about its genius or likewise about where it goes sadly astray.
