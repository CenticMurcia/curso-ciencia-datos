I can't believe people like this show!!!! This worthless piece of crap should be off the air by now!!! It has weak, hammy acting, and the devil comes in these ridiculous guises, like a bubbly, sweet schoolgirl. Worst piece of crap I've ever seen!! And the protagonist can't act!! I've seen him act, and his facial expression never changes. There are stupid lines like "This has wrath of God written all over it!" If you're looking for something interesting to watch, don't watch this, you'll be bored in ten minutes. It's an interesting premise in the wrong hands. They need good actors and a good storyline. This is just evident of the crappiness of our movie and film industry. Couldn't they find any better actors to play the collector? Someone who could act?
