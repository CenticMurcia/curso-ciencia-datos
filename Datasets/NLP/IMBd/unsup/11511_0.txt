I'd never seen the short 'toon PAGE MISS GLORY until this week (or if I did, it was so long ago that all I retain is a subliminal memory of the denouement), but the cartoon people reminded me of the ubiquitous long-nosed "Kilroy was here" WWII graffiti drawing and also of the cartoon work of Robert Crumb, who emerged in director Terry Zwigoff's 1994 documentary CRUMB as perhaps the most extreme American misogynist NOT behind bars. It's been 15 years since I viewed CRUMB, so I cannot remember if Robert lists PAGE MISS GLORY as an influence. Given what happens to the hapless bellboy Abner in the 1936 'toon, culminating in a comeuppance from the least of females, perhaps it's not stretching a point to speculate this cartoon may have permanently messed up Robert Crumb's psyche.
