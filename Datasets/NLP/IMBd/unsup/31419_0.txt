I cannot believe the lines I heard in this movie. Where did they get these lines? From a kindergarten class? Anus face and eat my f**k were really stupid lines. I could add more lines for it such as poo poo head and stinky Mcstink face. Then the acting is just wonderful if you just crawled out from under a rock and have never seen a play or movie in your life. Then some guy pops up in your car and steals your wallet but you don't even notice if you're sitting in the front seat. I would suggest making up some immature lines instead of watching this movie. I am so tired of movies where the teenagers do drugs and try to act so cool.
