The prolific Italian helmer Enzo G. Castellari of "Any Gun Can Play" and "Payment in Blood" not only made terrific Spaghetti westerns, but he also made one of the best European B-movie World War II thrillers. This half-of-a-dozen "Dirty Dozen" actioneer has court-martialed American soldiers and a reckless Air Force pilot escape from an escort of MPs after they clash with the enemy. The Germans attack the convoy and the MP guards actually shoot at the prisoners as they bail out of the trucks for cover. Strapping tall blond Bo Svenson is the pilot who used his P-51 Mustang to visit his girlfriend. Fred Williamson endures racial slurs and prejudice. Once they are free of the MPs, our anti-heroes decide to head for Switerland. Along the way, they wipe out a bunch of commandos and find themselves replacing them to help a stubborn, hidebound colone (Ian Bannen) destroy a Nazi train with top secret weapons. The heroes are sympathetic and charismatic. The music is memorable and the Castellari orchestrates the action with elaborate style. There are couple of surprises and the guy who survives is not the one that you think will live. The train crash is pretty neat. Exciting and fun.
