Based on the trio of name actors present, I decided to give "And Now the Screaming Starts" a shot. I had also read that the movie had some gory scenes, which led me to believe that the print I saw had some footage removed (it's practically goreless). I've never had a fondness for Victorian-era horror films, but I do admire the talents of Peter Cushing, Herbert Lom, and Patrick Magee, and thought they'd make this worth my while. The latter two have extended cameos, while Cushing plays the lead (unfortunately, we have to wait 47 minutes until he makes his grand entrance) and, god bless him, shows not a single hint of the boredom I was feeling in his refined, ultra-classy performance. The plot revolves around a newlywed couple honeymooning at a castle inherited by the husband; soon enough, strange happenings start to plague the wife, and the story drags insufferably, as the central plot point hinges on a secret everyone wants to avoid. If you're a fan of any of the actors (particularly Cushing), give this a shot, but I found myself mostly bored by this effort.<br /><br />3/10
