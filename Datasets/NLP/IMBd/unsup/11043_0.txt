G2 has a pretty good idea (albeit though original one) with Daniel Bernhardt as a Macedonian warrior who is reincarnated 200 years later to do battle with a sinister Mongolian clan led by James Hong. The action sequences are fair at best and I found myself trying to decide if this movie was a "self-contained' film or the pilot for a possible series. Overall, it wasn't really that bad and who knows now that HIGHLANDER is off the air here......
