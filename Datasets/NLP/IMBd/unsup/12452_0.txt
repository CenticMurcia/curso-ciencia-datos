At first sight, "Lost Things" appears to be just another Hollywood-wannabe horror film with Australian accents, but there is more here than first meets the eye. This film is more "supernatural horror" than "teenage slasher". Although I pretty much guessed the general direction the plot was going halfway through, the ride to get there was still edge-of-your-seat stuff. Out of the four central characters, the two girls are unconventionally pretty and wonderfully full-figured, and the two boys are fairly likable (although, as someone else already mentioned, casting two young blond actors who look so much alike was perhaps a mistake). The guy who plays Zippo (no, not Zeppo Marx) is well-cast. On the whole, "Lost Things" is a film that makes you interested in seeing more work in this genre by the same people. (***)
