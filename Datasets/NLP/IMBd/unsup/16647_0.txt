FBI agent Barney Coopersmith (Rick Moranis) is assigned to protect former Mafia figure Vinnie Antonelli (Steve Martin) in the witness protection program, far away from his NYC neighborhood. Vinnie has to get used to his new neighborhood in the "burbs" and his new name "Todd". But the 'burbs" will have to get used to Vinnie. No matter how he tries Vinnie just can't keep a low profile. Coopersmith certainly has his hands full keeping Antonelli away from the Mafia hitmen who want to stop him testifying, and the local D.A. Hannah Stubbs played by Joan Cusack,not to mention the nightclubs... But who would have thought Vinnie could play cupid thru all of this. This hysterically funny screenplay written by Nora Ephron and played for every laugh by Steve Martin, Rick Moranis, Joan Cusack, Melanie Mayron, and Carol Kane will put a smile on your face. This film is great Laugh Therapy everytime. Add this to your film library.
