It's easy to see why this failed pilot didn't get a chance to become a series. Adam West's character Ty Lookwell seemed too one-not to me to every career a series (we get it he's an actor who played a detective in the past and now believes he can be a real detective, but is an idiot), and the writing by the usually capable and very funny Conan O'Brian and Robert Smigal falls flat here, I hardly cracked a smile. IMDb reviewers tend to look at any failed pilot like if it got the green-light for a series would be pure gold. Well guess what, not ALL failed pilots are gold, not even most. I'd wager a VERY few handful. THIS show is not one of those.<br /><br />My Grade: D-
