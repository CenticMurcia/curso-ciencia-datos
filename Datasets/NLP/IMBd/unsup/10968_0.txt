Edward Burns is kind of like a younger, cooler, clever Woody Allen. Not so much going on satire and art, Edward Burns films are modern art commenting on the condition of dating, especially in NYC. <br /><br />His films really are just best described as likeable films. I personally believe these films can be liked by everybody because their films that everybody, at some point, will relate to. <br /><br />Sidwalks of New York was a film I was urging myself to see for a while. After seeing No Looking Back, another great Burns flick, I rented this film and found it charming, true, and honest. I like Edward Burns and personally think if this coast was as stoned as California is we'd be voting him into office right alongside a rapstar.
