An entertaining story of a convict who goes straight, well almost. The opening scenes set the pace and style. And throughout the film it just gets better and better. Rated at PG this film gives me no doubts about my kids seeing it. They did, they laughed and they cried and then laughed some more. This has to one of the most under-rated films starring Paul Hogan. It is certainly one of the best he has written. The film is a good mixture of story and humour and any fan of Paul Hogan should enjoy this film. I had to get my copy from ebay because they have stopped producing it. As somebody else says 'come on do it on DVD'. And after you have seen it, I think you will agree it is worthy of a sequel.
