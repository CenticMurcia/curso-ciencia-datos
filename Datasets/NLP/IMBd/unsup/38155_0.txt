I'm not one to trash other people's movies, but I make an exception when they waste an hour and a quarter of my time and return NOTHING. I'll try to be nice and say that the actors are all good, because they are, but there's no story here! Angel's father kicked him out. That's it - no need to see the movie because not much else happens. The only thing that holds your attention through any given scene is trying to figure out what the hell is going on. I spent 5 to 8 minutes at the start of each too-long scene just trying to figure out who the characters were and why they were talking to each other. Right around the time I get a clue, the scene is over and we're on to some other bit of pointless confusion. With dozens of great independent films being made (and ignored) every year, how does garbage like THIS get on HBO?
