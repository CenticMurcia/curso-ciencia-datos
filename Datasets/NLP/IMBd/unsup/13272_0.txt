Red Chinese spy master Wo Fat is systematically eliminating American agents in the Far East, using a sensory deprivation tank hidden in an old freighter. As is often the case in this sort of show, Only One Man Can Stop Him Â– the head of the Hawaii state police, Steve McGarrett.<br /><br />This is really more of a spy drama than a cop show. And unlike the resulting series, Jack Lord's McGarrett handles the bulk of the action here, shooting bad guys, infiltrating Wo Fat's hideout and even engaging in vigorous fisticuffs after more than eight hours of torture.<br /><br />Lord, as was often the case, comes across a little stiff, but overall this is a solid TV-movie/pilot, with excellent production values and a good supporting cast including Nancy Kwan, Leslie Nielsen and the ubiquitous Andrew Duggan.
