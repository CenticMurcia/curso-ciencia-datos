I don't know where to start with this movie. My expectations were blown away. In fact, I wasn't sure what to expect. But let me tell you that the experience was worth more than my disgustingly overpriced admission. With the popcorn and drink on top of it.<br /><br />Perhaps i'll start with the least important element of the movie. Firstly, Kung Fu Hustle has officially replaced all other overblown martial arts films by a long shot. The fighting in this movie is spectacular. Half the fights are so loaded with creativity it makes fighting movies look like something you've seen for the first time. The CG is great. The other half are part parodies of other films, and they are hilarious as well as spectacular. In fact, I need to see this a second time because there are a ton of movie references in it I don't think I've caught yet. Depending on your library of watched films, you'll catch more of them. I got quite a few and they were well done.<br /><br />And here's the most important part about this movie. This is where Kung Fu Hustle succeeds where so many other martial arts movies fail. It has a believable, simple, touching, intertwined and well flowing story. I can't tell you how many times where I've walked out of a martial arts - or even action - movie, and been immensely disappointed because the fighting and explosions were great, but the rest of it simply fell short. These movies are typically way unbalanced.<br /><br />But Stephen Chow is talented enough to take both elements of the movie to their rightful place. I don't know how he did it, but it worked. The acting is incredibly enjoyable. The plot is likable. The fighting will make your jaw drop. And all the fighting actually has something to do with the story. It's absolutely amazing.<br /><br />If you're tired of action movies not making the mark, go see this one. Now. 10/10.
