Deciding not to read the other reviews, I may merely be regurgi--um... saying stuff all over again.<br /><br />But this was not a terribly great movie. Expecting a funny movie that really pokes fun at the horror genre, but instead getting a horrid movie that pokes more fun at the characters with bad jokes, etc.<br /><br />Generally, the performances were almost there, but not quite (although i still found Seth Green entertaining). Devon Sawa was damn good, considering this is the first thing I've seen him in.<br /><br />The initial idea was good: boy's hand becomes possessed, he kills people. But it went downhill from there. Really.<br /><br />The funniest points in this movie, albeit one of four funny points, was the manner in which the hand was finally destroyed, and the spectacle as it was destroyed.<br /><br />There are better things to spend your money on if you want an entertaining evening. Otherwise, this is a good movie to spend $8.00 on to just talk while it plays. Um... yeah...
