Ist this really it? The one we've been waiting for? The worst movie of all times?<br /><br />Well, let's say it could be very well it! To be honest, even if I am usually more toward "good" movies, I very much enjoy a good comedy once in a while. Like American Pie or most of the Farrelly Movies.<br /><br />Being a guy - what can I say - I even more enjoy a comedy with pretty girls and even some nice b**bs in it. I'm only human ...<br /><br />But not even the bared breasts which are shown throughout the movie, without any reason I might add, can be reason enough to live through the torture of this brainless, heartless, meaningless piece of youknowwhat.<br /><br />My advice? Don't, Don't! DON'T !!!!!
