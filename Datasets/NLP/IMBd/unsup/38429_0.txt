JAANEMANN.... 1 Leave your mind at home when you go to watch this film 2 direction is great in the beginning (as it apes musicals such as Chicago and moulin rouge) but fails miserably towards the end 3 Screenplay starts off well, then falls apart. 4 script is weak, dialogues are weaker. 5 acting is standard though nothing great - akshay has a gr8 character though salman's is the meatier role. priety could have done the role in her sleep, nothing new for her. aman vermas character and relation was left undefined for a long time- bad role, well acted. 6 the music is tuneful and enjoyable. but would have been better just as instrumental 7 Lyrics are PATHETIC (lyrics would have been better if they were written by a nursery school child) 8 editing was surprisingly patchy in parts. odd, as the film's director used to be an editor<br /><br />trivia: a character is named preity zintakova. aman verma's characters name is zubin HORNIBOI (hahahah)<br /><br />best: Akshay's Laughter. THE CUTE KID worst: SALMAN'S COSTUMES!! The annoying kids and family members towards the end!
