My expectations were pretty low (talking Death Valley low here) before I saw this movie and I'm thankful of it. Yes, it is a mindless copy of Predator / Alien series / <insert favorite B-sci-fi movie cliche here> all together and yes both the acting and script were pretty atrocious and comical. Code Red borrows way too many scenes (and characters) from the aforementioned titles for it to be distinguished as a movie. A scene or two is fine (sort of), but to recycle everything just makes it plain obvious you had no idea what the heck you were doing.<br /><br />2/10
