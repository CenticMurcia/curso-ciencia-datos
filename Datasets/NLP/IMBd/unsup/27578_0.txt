'Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles' is a nice family comedy, that won't get you embarrassed in front of your parents and it will still make you laugh.<br /><br />Paul Hogan plays Crocodile Dundee, exactly the way he played it fifteen years ago. And this is not bad too. His innocence is still adorable after all these years, as it is his way of applying the laws of the jungle to the big city life.<br /><br />The production is okay, the pace is good and the story is light and nice.<br /><br />A very refreshing moment nevertheless.<br /><br />9/10
