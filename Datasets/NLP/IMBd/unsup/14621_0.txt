Very good movie, with mixture of patriotism and romance. The acting of Kajol as a Kashmeri is really appreciable. Aamir is doing very good films, and by chance Rang De Basanti was also full of touch of patriotism. The songs especially "Chand Sifarish" is very sweet and the whistle in the song will surely become popular. Though other songs are good too, but it is matter of personal choice too. The expressions on Kajol face when she meets Rihan after having here eyes in her house not knowing him are also very good, the illusion she has is nicely filmed. The last fifteen minutes of movie are really heart touching. Recommended for everyone!!
