I seriously cannot think of why anyone would give this movie a 10/10. Sure we all have different taste in films, but to call this movie perfect is absurd in my opinion. I have nothing against the fact, that this indeed is a low-budget movie. I like plenty of low-budget movie. Its not the budget that makes the movie good, its the acting and the plot, but sadly this movie lacks in both areas.<br /><br />Okay, the acting wasn't completely bad - actually it was pretty average and what you would expect from a movie of this sort. This movie could however use an actor who really took the movie to that next level, but I'm sorry to say that no one even came close. The actors seemed to lack of strong reactions which I think the movie could use. Come on, your friends are dead and you are trapped in a storage facility - wouldn't you go nuts? I'm not saying they all should act like lunatics, but they could at least show some emotions.<br /><br />The story - well. I guess its okay. A bunch of friends playing a killing game and someone starts dying for real. Its acceptable for this kind of movie. Its not trying to win Oscars, its trying to entertain - and scare the crap out of people. The thing is, in this case they just didn't put in enough effort to make it work.<br /><br />And these twists people talk about - did we see the same movie? This was pretty much straight-forward. Just because you don't figure out the killer, doesn't make it a plot-twist when you find out who it is. If there even was a plot-twist it must have been a pretty dull one, because I missed it completely.<br /><br />But hey, it wasn't all bad. I did finish it, didn't I? No seriously, its passable. I don't regret spending around 80 minutes seeing it and I've seen worse movies - thats for sure. Having said that, its not a movie I'd catch again or buy on DVD.<br /><br />For the average movie fan I would not recommend this movie. Devoted fans of the teenage-horror film genre may like it however, I wouldn't know.
