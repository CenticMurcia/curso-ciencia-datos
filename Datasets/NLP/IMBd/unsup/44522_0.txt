well this is passably the worst film i have ever seen in my life except of course death Vally the revenge of bloody bill, but anyway the i dear of dancing and black gang warfare is hilarious but at the same time just plain crap! but there was 1 good gun scene but apart from that it was abdominal sorry but i speak the truth. i mean if people want to see a 'gangster' film they would see scarface or pulp fiction not this garbage and i cant believe that the person from liverpool above me called it 'fantastic' it is very far from it but maybe one would say it is not a high budget film but that is no excuse for it being so awful is it??
