I had the misfortune of watching this movie while I was serving a mission for the LDS Church. Contrary to the comment by Kolob, this movie was neither historically accurate, nor entertaining. The cinematography was crap, the editing was crap, the acting was crap. Please do not accept this trash as any accurate representation of the great men that Brigham Young and Joseph Smith were. It is certainly a discredit to their memories for something like this film to be made. Coincidentally, this same movie was edited a bit, then changed to "made for TV" under the title "Savage Journey." That movie (because it is the same movie) is also a blatant work of nonsense. Nice try though. The only semblance this movie has to actual historical fact is that, yes, Brigham Young did have a beard.
