While many of the porn films during this era still tried to have something resembling a plot, few were as out there as CURSE OF THE CATWOMAN. A riff on the old CAT PEOPLE flicks, this has a group of people who can apparently turn into big cats living it up at clubs. Selena Steele is at her best here, Rocco Sifredi (in an early role) doesn't say much (which is good. As long as he's only around to provide his extraordinary "talent" he's not irritating), and Patricia Kennedy is at her hottest. The scene of Rocco and Kennedy going at it in bed while Steele sleeps next to them is a scorcher, and the best of the film.
