Even though there are no vampires. It was based on the TRUE story of Vlad the Impailor. I really enjoyed this documentary. And it was pretty funny seeing Rudolf playing Dracula again after his famous apperence on "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" as Dracula as well. If you enjoy Dracula movies, I'm not sure if you would get into this. But if you are interested in learning about how Bram got his ideas, then watch it.<br /><br />7/10
