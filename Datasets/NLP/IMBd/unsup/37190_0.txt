In the Christmas holiday, the seventh son of a seventh son Will Stanton (Alexander Ludwig) finds on the day of his fourteenth birthday that he is a powerful warrior capable of traveling in time that must seek and find seven hidden signs to defeat the forces of the Dark and keep the balance with the Light. The Rider (Christopher Eccleston) tries to lure Will, who is guided by his protectors in his quest.<br /><br />"The Seeker: The Dark is Rising" is a boring adventure, with an awful screenplay supported by special effects only. The characters and situations are badly developed and I took a ten minutes nap along the story, but I did not rewind the DVD because I noted that the part I had missed was also boring. My family and I like fantasy movies, but this one is a complete waste of time. My vote is four.<br /><br />Title (Brazil): Not Available
