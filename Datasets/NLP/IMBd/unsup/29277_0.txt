By far the funniest and my most favorite episode. How often do you see a plot where a has-been boxer dies at a brothel. Doc Robbins calling every time to tell Brass and Grissom the person they thought was the killer wasn't it was the best. I hate Brass and seeing him get screwed over and over was great. The dealings with the employees of the brothel is what made it too funny. I won't go into details but I'll mention the major players. First is Binky and Doris, owners of the brothel called the Sugar Cane Ranch. Second is the escort Dreama Little, played by a shockingly grown up and amazingly hot Ashley Johnson, who was little brat on Growing Pains that looked like 'Annie'. Third is the bartender Connor Foster, previously seen in that role in the episode 'Homebodies'.<br /><br />Beyond that, the best part had to be all of the fine ladies wearing very little, especially the uber-delicious Marnette Patterson. FYI: She's Aimee, AKA the one who says the line "I popped his man-cherry".
