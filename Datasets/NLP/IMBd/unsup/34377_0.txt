Before I start my review, I must first of all mention that this is not a B.movie, this is Z-grade film-making at its most ridiculous. Anyway Rage To Kill stars James Ryan (Of Kill and Kill again fame)a tough marine (who doubles as a race-car driver) travels to a South African college (Because we all know that South Africa is known for their ivy league schools) to save his brother from a ruthless general who has just recently overthrown the government, however after an (inept) escape, the marine and the college students join the rebels and payback the ruthless dictator with wholesale slaughter. Rage To Kill is utterly ridiculous in its ineptitude. The action sequences are so poorly conducted that it makes the stuff pioneered on Kung Fu theater seem like Rambo. James Ryan also sports an English accent that indicates a sophisticated intelligence which makes it hard to buy that he could be a killing machine at the same time. Oliver Reed is also on hand and he is positively terrible giving a performance so cheesy that he could be smuggled into a Green Bay Packer football game. Overall Rage To Kill is as awful as what you would expect, I mean anyone looking at the names (James Ryan?) knows what they're in for and Rage To Kill is a thoroughly incompetent Rambo rip off. It's also hilarious to behold and makes one wonder how this got passed up by Mystery Science Theater 3000. I mean this movie is perfect for such a skewering. In fact this, ROTOR and Troll 2 are top three titles that must be seen by MST3K if they're ever back on the air. I give this a full star instead of a half star (My lowest rating) because i'm feeling generous.<br /><br />* out of 4-(Bad)
