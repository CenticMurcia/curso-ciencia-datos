Storytelling is a great movie, at times Solondz could have done better but everything was good. From the music, that was the main reason why i wanted to watch the trailer again; to the humor. This movie dares to go places that other movies don't and most of the time it works.<br /><br />Two stories, fiction and fact, make up this story. The first one, fiction, involves an interracial relationship between a student and her college professor. The second, Fact, revolves around a boy named Scooby and his "struggles". The second story is where all the meat is and the first was pretty good too.<br /><br />John Goodman gave a good performance and the lad that played Scooby was pretty good too. All in all this movie deserves a watching, but i warn you this movie is not for people that like "crossroads" or Hilary Duff movies. If you enjoy music and indie movies this is for you.
