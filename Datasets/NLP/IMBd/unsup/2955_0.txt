Saw this on Sci Fi and what can I say but it was possibly the most amateurish "movie" I have ever seen. And I could only bear to watch the first 10 - 15 minutes of it before I had to turn it off. I saw all I needed to see at that point. My god. Imagine if a group of High School students decided to shoot a zombie movie for fun and use it on halloween for laughs. Well this is what you would get, except maybe the high school kids might do a better job! The actors in this film all look like rejects from Hee-Haw and the direction and cinematography is abysmal. The make up on the zombies is not as good as a mask you can buy in a dollar store. This film gets the lowest grade possible. I can only marvel how this trash actually got released.
