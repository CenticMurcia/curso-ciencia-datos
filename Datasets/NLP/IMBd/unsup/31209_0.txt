I almost like this film, but for all the wrong reasons. It's about a family trapped in their home during an alien siege. I stumbled across it about ten minutes in, and found it so bad I had to keep watching. I love the fact that for a supposed 'documentary' I recognised two of the actors straight off. <br /><br />The overall acting is pretty dodgy, (I love the girl yelling for Kurt every five minutes, who wisely leaves very early in the film) apart from maybe the son, (who's recording the whole thing) he's not too bad.<br /><br />But special mention has to go to the mother, who at no point was seen without a glass of wine in her hand, even when the family try to escape! By the time I actually got a glimpse of the aliens, tears of laughter were streaming down my face. How anyone who isn't a kid thought this film was real, I honestly can't understand. But I'll still give it a 2 out of 10, one, for making me laugh, and one also for the mum, for dealing with an alien invasion by getting completely blotto.
