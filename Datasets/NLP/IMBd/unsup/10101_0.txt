As a big Candice Bergen fan i was looking forward to see this movie. And i wasn´t disappointed, this was a very interesting movie. It´s the kind of movie that you don´t know how it´s gonna end until the last minute, and you don´t trust anyone. Candice Bergen´s performance was amazing and so was Bug Hall´s and Bryan Brown´s. I hope this movie comes out on VHS or DVD but in the mean time I recommend anyone who likes suspense to catch this one on tv.
