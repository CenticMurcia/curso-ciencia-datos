The special effects suck, even Destroy all monsters which was made seven years before this had better action. The creators of this film have thought up the dumbest monster for the big guy to fight. I definitely hated how they made Godzilla's fire breath look like electricity, for a minute when Hedorah (Smog Monster) is marching towards the military base, I thought the military was using some kind of high tech weapon to destroy it.<br /><br />I gave this a three because the finale (once I got past the special effects) wasn't bad. When Godzilla flies after Hedorah then brings him down and begins ripping him apart was pretty cool. The dumbest thing in this film (which is not the plot or how slow the creatures walk) is when a little boy yells for Godzilla while he is walking away. I would never wave goodbye to a fifty foot lizard that had just ripped up a monster, I would instead wave goodbye to whatever it is marching towards. If you like giant monster in form of pollution fighting giant lizards and terrible special effects, this is the movie for you.
