If you're a guy you better wear a teflon jockstrap before going to this movie. It is a non stop male bashfest.<br /><br />Wear a fire proof suit to this drivel guys.<br /><br />The acting was bad.<br /><br />The story was ludicrous.<br /><br />Every scene was basically the same.<br /><br />A conversation among several women about how bad men suck.<br /><br />So, if you're feminist or a man hater you will love this gem.<br /><br />Whitney Houston was my favorite plastic statue in this one.<br /><br />I like Hale Berry but she never should have got roped into this.<br /><br />I'd love to have those 90 minutes back of my life.<br /><br />Please.
