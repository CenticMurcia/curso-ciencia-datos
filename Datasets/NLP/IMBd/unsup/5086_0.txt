"fechy from Switzerland" you are sick bastard who doesn't know a thing from the great Pino Solanas. This man has been producing documentaries with strong political content since the 60s and you dare to consider him a bad copy of Michael Moore? He was 12 years old when Pino had already released his masterpiece The Hour of the Furnaces.<br /><br />How come you demand a little bit of humor when we are talking about the lives of millions of people that were ruined? Over the past 32 years they resisted a genocide dictatorial regime and governments financed by narcs. This is the result of liberal economic programs implemented by corrupt politicians in a fake democracy.<br /><br />Pino was a congressman also, the only one who dared to report the abuses during the Menem era. He received 6 bullets in his legs for it.<br /><br />This is a saga followed by The Dignity of Nobodies, Argentina Latente and the unreleased La Tierra Sublevada. We may discuss his political ideas but never his work. Something a lot of nobodies were longing to let the world know. Someone to speak for us. The social awareness of Evita, the revolutionary ideas of Che Guevara, the democratic values of the great nations and a gifted artist. Ladies and gentlemen that's Pino Solanas. A unique person.<br /><br />Pino thanks for your dignity, your humility, your coherence, your honesty and your legacy.
