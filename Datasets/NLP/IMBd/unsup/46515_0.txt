The screenplay, if one can call this one note monstrosity that, was written by Shore and some guy named Kirk Fox, yet it all smacks of being a vanity project, laced with bad one liners where the B listers try to recall who Shore was, after his 'death', then rail against him when exposed. You know you're film is in trouble when a supposedly funny scripted line by Chris Rock, 'No Pauly. {blank} you. Stay dead,' turns out to be the most genuine reaction to this film. My only consolation is that the DVD was cheap and this review will hopefully deter any other potential viewers from lining Shore's pockets. You have to take small victories wherever you can get them, sometimes.
