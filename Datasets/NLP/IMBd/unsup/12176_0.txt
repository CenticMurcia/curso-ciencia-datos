One things that is drastically lacking in the more developed areas of our world today is a social conscience. Many people are simply not concerned with social equality if it is going to take any sort of effort on their part. This movie challenges our apathy and screams at us to get off of the couch (after the movie is done, of course) and raise a little hell! We are edukated to not be complacent in the face of the powers that threaten to segregate us even further. This film is not perfect, but the message is fresh and completely different from any other film I've seen. Some have called it too didactic, but I don't think that is a problem. Every film we watch is there to instruct us; how to look, how to act, how to feel, what to do, what to be etc. And a lot of this instruction is horribly detrimental to our revolutionary hearts. I'm not saying we all need to start marching and fighting, but it wouldn't hurt us to think a little more about the exploitation of millions/billions, and the rewards for the few elite. If this film is trying to be morally instructive, at least it is trying to fight for the little guy, and isn't pushing people to feel unhappy about the way they look, act, feel etc. Let's not let the powers of the world separate us any further. What can we accomplish if we understand that we are all one? So let's get up, stand up, and edukate!
