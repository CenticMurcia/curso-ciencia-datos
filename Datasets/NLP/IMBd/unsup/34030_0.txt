I'm so amazed that the actors that starred in this movie did not seem to have any comprehension of what a bad move they were making. I consider the top 5 billed actors to be good to very good, but not in this movie. There was no meaningful story so I guess I can blame the writers. The way the movie was pieced together makes me want to blame the editors. Considering how poor the actor's performances were (who I know are not bad actors), makes me want to blame the director.<br /><br />One of the other IMDb reviewer described it as a "Big steaming pile of crap". After watching the movie, I now realize that he might have been understating how bad it is.<br /><br />If you would like to see some very unappealing gratuitous nudity, and you have a brain the size of a pea, then you might like this movie.
