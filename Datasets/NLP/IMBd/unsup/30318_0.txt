little witches was a terrible movie that may have been successful if the acting wasn't so bad and the girls left their clothes on. The plot was ok and all that but the effects sucked and i couldn't help but think that this was just someones lame follow up to the popularity of the craft.<br /><br />i'd rather see dennis rodman in drag throwing magic around than these girls.
