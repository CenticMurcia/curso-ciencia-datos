All I can say is this was the worst remake of an original decent horror film I have ever witnessed. First of all, Cloris Leachman must have been desperate and in need of money to appear in this debacle. She must have been aware too because the Sci-Fi channel didn't even mention her name in the credits. Who wrote the scene (ought to be flogged) where she as 'Sadie Bickerman' was attempting to push the young girl off the dock to feed the gator? All I could think of was the fairy tale Hansel & Gretel where the wicked witch was trying to push Gretel into the oven.<br /><br />So many visual errors too. One in particular shows Deputy Davis blow up one of the gators with a 'super gun' after which he and his son return to the ranger station. Deputy Davis then (alone) leaves for the hunt again this time armed with a 'rifle', two bags of meat and some C-4 over his shoulder. Later in the woods when the chips are down and the gators attack, lo and behold out comes the 'super gun'....where'd that come from? He didn't have it when he returned to the hunt! <br /><br />The ending if you can call it that shows the victors (surviving cast members) riding off to 'Bangor' in a pickup truck to get something to eat. WHAT! Who could eat after watching this?<br /><br />Of course, unknown to Deputy Dawg, one of the 'gator' eggs was salvaged and in a case on the front seat for examination at the 'lab'. Thank my lucky stars it ended here. I fully expected to see the egg hatch while they were lunching on 'gator burgers' in Bangor and escape to bring on a sequel to this thing they called a movie. The director came to his senses and called it day and we all will live happily ever after.<br /><br />Jakeman97
