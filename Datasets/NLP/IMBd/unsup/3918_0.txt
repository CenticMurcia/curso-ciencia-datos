I can only imagine the plot from the director's point of view. It did not play out well on film. This movie is one of those which may only affect one of an altered mind, as those on-screen. I also managed to make it through the end. The characters had little or no depth whatsoever. The acting was less than acceptable. Even though there were plenty of big name actors in this pic, it seems they left their talent in their trailers. Surprisingly, the only impact this movie had on me was the televangelist and the subsequent actions to follow. John Ritter's was really the only believable character. Even Donnie Darko's own James Duval (Frank the bunny) was terrible. Makes me wonder...
