Daniel Bernhardt is totally wasted in this lame attempt to duplicate the success of the HIGHLANDER series. It has the feel of a made-for-TV pilot and with some of the loopholes in the script it may be better to be viewed as such. It even tends to draw on some elements from JCVD's LIONHEART. Bernhardt obviously has true ability, but he is better suited for other films like BLOODSPORT 2 & 3 and TRUE VENGEANCE
