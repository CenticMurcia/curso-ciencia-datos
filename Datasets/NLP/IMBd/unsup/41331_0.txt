Wow. The DV revolution has spawned this. Digital Film Tree's Founder Ramy Katrib stated the other night while presenting that the DV revolution has done nothing but put powerful creative tools in the hands of mediocre to horrible story tellers. I present to you Exhibit #1: Land of the College Prophets. I applaud the effort of the young digital movie makers as the effort to produce a feature length project is not an easy thing to do. Especially when there is little to no money. That being said, the focus of said projects should be on dynamic story telling and rich character driven dialog. Keep the scope of the project within reasonable limits. This would include not attempting a large scale sci-fi/horror movie without the means to get it to viewable standards. One scene that springs to mind is the "climactic battle" on the front lawn of Tunxis Community College. Here we have "scary monsters" in broad daylight, with college students milling to and from class unfazed by the oncoming holocaust. This scene sums up the trouble with handing newbies cameras and computers. Jeff Goldblum's line from Jurassic Park springs to mind, "Just because you could, doesn't mean you should". I could go on and on pulling each scene apart as common mistakes are made over & over such as 180 rule breaks for no reason, mismatched misenscene, mismatched eyelines, and no match action edits. My advice to the young "filmmakers" is to get into some kind of storytelling school, tighten your aesthetic approaches, and put Adobe Aftereffects away.
