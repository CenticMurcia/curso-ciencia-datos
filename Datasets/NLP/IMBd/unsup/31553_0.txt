I was present at the showing at the Dallas Film Festival, where the attendees were privileged to be one of the first audiences to view the movie. The director explained the logistical difficulties of making the movie - getting the actors together in one place; budgetary constraints, etc. - which makes his achievement even more remarkable.<br /><br />The whole cast was superb - apparently they all worked for free and were totally in sync with Sobel's intent to serve the "client of Truth" - and the final output was a refreshing, disturbing and no-holds barred reenactment of the work of the Warren Commission. It stands to be compared favorably with the "big budget" movies of the same or similar genre such as Farenheit 9/11 and the Fog of War. Many congratulations to the cast, crew and production teams - I hope that the movie obtains a wider commercial distribution platform.
