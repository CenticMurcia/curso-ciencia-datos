*The Evil SPOILERS 2* Ash (Bruce Campbell) and his girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler) go for a weekend in a dingy cabin in the Michigan woods, hoping for a good time, but it seems that Fate has other things in store for them, when they unwittingly awaken the Evil Forces luring nearby, that possess Linda and try to do the same with Ash...<br /><br />In the meanwhile, a young woman, her boyfriend and two hicks (one of which - a girl - is going to A) get raped by vines and B) choke to death on an eyeball, while her boyfriend is going to leak some massive blood) have arrived in the cabin too, and as it turns out the whole blame of the situation stands on the parents of the young woman, herself, and her boyfriend, because it's them who looked for, found and tried to translate the Necromicon (yes, THAT book) in the first place...<br /><br />Bloodier and also funnier than the first one, 'Evil Dead 2' manages to be as good as the original, but in a different way.<br /><br />Some scenes (like the eyeball choking and the blood fountain) are some gory slapstick! And Bruce Campbell makes his Ash into a horror icon.<br /><br />Evil Dead 2: 9/10.
