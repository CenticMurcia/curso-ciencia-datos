From the opening scene I was utterly gripped by this movie, and the sense of menace never let up. I damn well cared what happened to the 2 female leads, and I came within an inch of turning away from the screen through sheer tension. The (under)acting was first-rate in my opinion and utterly believable, the direction assured, and the editing perhaps the ultimate triumph, with expert use of flashbacks to slowly reveal the horror and sleaze. Made on a shoestring budget and within a tight time-frame, these factors only seem to add to the rough and ready quality of this film. I staggered out feeling relieved it was over, but also strangely uplifted, and greatly rewarded for my Â£6.50 investment. Only 2 scenes seemed a little contrived in order to keep the continuity going, but the twist near the end was clever and resonant. On a par with 'My Name is Joe' and 'Trainspotting'. Oh yes, and my flat in Brighton (from a distance) is in one of the scenes :)
