This film is historically significant, but come one, you guys. It's an embarrassingly racist drama that pretends to be racially progressive. Louise Beavers' character, Delilah, is one of the dumbest and most marginalized movie characters ever. Audiences in 1934 hailed this role as a breakthrough for black actresses, but a modern audience should see right through it. The really terrible thing about this movie is that it pretends to be solving the world's race problems, but it actually is making them much worse. (spoiler) Bea basically steals Delilah's pancake recipe, uses her image to sell pancakes, and makes a load of moolah, while Delilah, like a good slave, doesn't mind and turns down a cut when offered. A few scenes and shots are interesting, but unless you're a writing a dissertation on films of the early 30s (or you enjoy getting angry), don't bother.<br /><br />
