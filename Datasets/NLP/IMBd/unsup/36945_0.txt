<br /><br />Freddie Prinze Jr. serves up yet another 20-something romantic comedy. Is it just me or do you get the feeling we have been there and done that? Freddie Prinze Jr. stars as undergrad Ryan who seems to keep running into sexually confused Jennifer (Claire Forlani) every times he turns around. Ryan slowly starts to become Jennifer's friend and as in all romantic comedies it always leads to more. I had many problems with `Boys and Girls'. Why do friendships in movies always lead to sex and eventually a break-up? I didn't believe for a moment that Prinze and Forlani actually had more than friend feelings. Why couldn't they be the 20-something version of `When Harry Met Sally'. Is the lesson here if we can't be happy with someone lets be miserable together? Their dialogue was drab and bland. Where was the humor that usually happens when the sexes start talking? My savior in this film was the very dense character played by American Pie's Jason Biggs. This guy was hilarious in so many ways. And if you plan on seeing this film you have to watch the credits at the end because the biggest gut laugh is there. Isn't it strange they placed it in the credits? I would have found some place in the film to put this scene.<br /><br />I guess my belief in that we can find originality in the `romantic comedy' makes me want to see better films than `Boys and Girls'. Will we see originality in this genre soon? I have faith that this summer's `Loser' starring Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari will be a lot better than this. (2 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.
