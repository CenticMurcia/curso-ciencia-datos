Wow! If anyone is a fan of Erica Durance from any guest star appearances or from Smallville, you will definitely like this movie. I think she acted great and was amazing. You will love the end of the movie because she played some great lines and action scenes and it really seemed like a good role for her to fill. I would definitely have to give this movie a thumbs up!! I really enjoyed it, kept me entertained!!!!! Go Erica!<br /><br />There were other actors that played in the movie as well, and did a very good job. I think I recognized one of them, the cop, from 7th Heaven. He did very well.<br /><br />The acting was all done well and the story line was great. I have to say my favorite part was the ending. I love the twist that is made at the end. Take my word for it, watch the movie... it's pretty damn good!
