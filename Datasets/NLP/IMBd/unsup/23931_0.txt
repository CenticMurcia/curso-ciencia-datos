This is what nostalgia is all about! Woody Allen takes a look at the 1940s, when radio was still the dominant medium. Young Joe (Seth Green) is the window into this world. I'm assuming that Allen based that character on himself. Meanwhile, we get to see also the lives of various radio performers, among them Mia Farrow's and Wallace Shawn's characters. My favorite scene was the snowman scene, although I don't recommend it for squeamish and/or prudish people.<br /><br />Anyway, this is a nice, wacky look at the days before TV. I am particularly inclined to agree with his statement about boy crooners; I would have to say the same about boy bands. All in all, Woody Allen does best when he sticks to straight forward comedy and doesn't try to look at neurotic rich New Yorkers.
