My first impressions on seeing this series was: "Yes, Penelope Keith is still brilliant, but this series isn't really funny." I felt the children were too antagonistic - it felt real, but not funny. But, seeing that La Keith was on great form, I kept watching and grew to love the series. The children grew as actors, and you could, to purloin a phrase, "feel their pain". Pain is not something you normally associate with sitcoms, but here it was. Now I think the series should be considered a groundbreaking show: the way the pain, sorrow and frustration the children felt was dealt with intelligently and moving. And I reiterate what the others have stated: THIS SERIES SHOULD BE RELEASED ON DVD!
