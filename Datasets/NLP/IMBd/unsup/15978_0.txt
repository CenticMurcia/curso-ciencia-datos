This movie is often branded as a violent and fascist one... I think this is nonsense, since if this movie is violent, then what about others like "First Blood", "Commando" or "Rambo" just to name a few?...<br /><br />If one watches this movie carefully can see it´s a very likely story.<br /><br />Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) is not a violent man at all, it´s a liberal and broad-minded architect who leads an ordinary life until his wife is murdered by some punks... and that´s not precisely a funny thing to happen to anyone.<br /><br />This is not a specially violent movie as I´ve said before. It´s the story of a man who loses what he loves the most... and just decides to make justice... and becomes the "vigilante".<br /><br />This movie is a masterpiece. Probably the best movie starring Charles Bronson.
