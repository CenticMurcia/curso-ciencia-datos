i have just seen the film and it seems i cannot get a clear impression of it.it requires to be seen again because the action is well to take you by surprise in some points and then you discover that the previous lines had a different importance in the new light. it is no doubt not an American-type of a movie at all.the fantasy is at home and the action is not submitted to the commercial requirements the usual children films are using us with. it is not the classical English film either as the family is placed in an out of time and out of space atmosphere unlike the clear and cozy spaces of other English stories.i would rather say that the film is imprinted with Emma Thompson's personal touch which makes it a beautiful yet strange film in its own way. it is like a modern form of art addressed to children and surprising the adults altogether by the freedom given to imagination and the feeling it sends you that all is always gonna be just great. a beautiful movie to watch but pay attention-it requires a child's perspective to be fully understood...
