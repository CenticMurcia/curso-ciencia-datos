A problem that some people might have with this movie is that it isn't the pop biopic that Oliver Stone would have made of it. It isn't an amalgamation of ideological heroism, Guevara- pathos, biased historic analysis and explosions. It's more of a small very down-to-earth guerrilla movie, a small war movie if you like, and most of all very indie. The story telling isn't very linear, sometimes it seems like a bunch of scenes put together. but it manages very well to suck you into the Cuban civil war. It doesn't make you think a lot about politics. If it would have, Soderbergh would have became a persona non Grata back in the states by now for having made a Marxist propaganda flick. It shows you how the guerrilla war worked, how the rules of command were and how insistent they were on winning the battle. Really great movie experience.
