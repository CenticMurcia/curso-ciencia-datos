I was fortunate enough to see the film when it played at the Sunset 5 at midnight. It's played in my mind over the past couple of months. Very strong visual style and lots of amazing sequences. <br /><br />Overall I really enjoyed the movie although there were moments where it kind of slowed down towards the middle, but really picked up at the 3/4 mark. I was totally surprised and didn't see coming what was going to happen. For being a lower budgeted movie the filmmakers really did a lot! I can't wait to see it on DVD and pick up what I missed the first time.<br /><br />My favorite part was the segments of the Public Enemy TV show & all the dark humor towards reality television. I wouldn't be surprised that some day we see something like the Public Enemy thing on the boob tube.
