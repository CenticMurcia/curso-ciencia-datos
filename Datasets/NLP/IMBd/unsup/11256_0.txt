This is a very raw, rough first feature (BAFTRA nominated) by Paul Andrew Williams.He wrote & produced the film as well.<br /><br />The film runs a very fast 85 minutes including 4 minutes of credits. It is a low budget film about some very unlikeable people, the sort nearly all of us would not bother with or would want know. They all are brutal & foul mouthed.<br /><br />However we do care, to some degree for them.<br /><br />The cast are mostly newcomers or featured players from TV) I never heard of any of them). I definitely want to see them in other films. Lorraine Stanley plays a working street girl. Georgia Groome (all of 14 when film was made) is new to the streets.Johnny Downs is the evil pimp, & Sam Spruell as the sadistic son of a client. They & the others in cast do fine jobs as these unsavory person.<br /><br />Normally I stay far from this type of film,BUT this time I was mesmerized, The hand held camera work was not as annoying as it usually is & most of my readers know I eschew foul language. Here it comes across as natural. It is like a Tarantino movie without the humour. That part I liked.<br /><br />Being a minor,low budget,no name cast feature from the UK It only had a short few theatre run in the USA.in Feb 2008.<br /><br />Look for this on Cable or rent it,I am sure you will agree it is watchable.<br /><br />There are some plot holes, but film moves fast & they are easily ignored.<br /><br />Ratings: ***1/2 (out of 4) 91 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)
