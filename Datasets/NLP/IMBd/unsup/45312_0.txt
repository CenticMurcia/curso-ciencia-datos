Quite an unusual cast for a sci-fi action flick. It was amusing to witness 63-year-old Kirk Douglas kick butt and save the day. He simply fails to convince, and should have remained with the usual Westerns and such he's most famous for. A class actor like Harvey Keitel is wasted in this nonsense, and sure will try and forget his role in a movie which proved unsuccessful at the box office.<br /><br />Farrah Fawcett had abandoned Charlie's Angels after just one season to better herself as an actress and move into the world of movies. Ah yes, an interesting premise Ms. Fawcett, but Saturn 3 was not exactly the route I would have taken. Although stunningly beautiful, Fawcett doesn't take her role as Alex in any particular direction, and seems just like your typical scared easily blonde, but this time stranded in space! These three stars are the only characters in the film (unless you count the robot of course). It's just as well because the script is poor, the acting (Douglas and Fawcett particularly) is laughable in some places, and the special effects are on the point of being disastrous.<br /><br />Stanley Donen tries hard to prove himself a superior director in the sci-fi genre, but his time and effort was simply wasted; Saturn 3 is complete and utter drivel. Recorded the same year as the superior Alien, it's unsurprising it was largely ignored by film fans and critics alike. Ridley Scott's Alien has the premise to scare and shock, with powerful performances from those concerned, and has gone down as one of the best films of all time. Saturn 3 tries to mimic this movie in a sense, but completely fails in doing so.<br /><br />Saturn 3 has been 'awarded' (if that's the right word to use) 3/10 from myself. Farrah is the only reason to look at it!
