A friend and myself were watching the rented tape. <br /><br />After starting the tape and watching the trailers of several movies. <br /><br />We thought, "what a long and confusing trailer this is". <br /><br />It took us about 15 minutes before we realized we weren't watching the trailer. <br /><br />The movie already started!<br /><br />After that, it only got better. <br /><br />A very nice confusing and hilarious movie. Great characters. Great dialog. Great stupid story.<br /><br />See it.<br /><br />Summary We were smoking a lot of home grown herbs at the moment. <br /><br />But that didn't affect our judgment at all!
