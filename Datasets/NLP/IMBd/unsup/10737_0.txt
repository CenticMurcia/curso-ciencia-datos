In my job as history teacher I have seen many documentaries dealing with world war 2 and prelude to it but this has to be one of the best. Showing clearly Stalins ruthlessness but also giving so much well deserved credit to the ordinary Soviet peoples struggles and efforts to survive both their own and a foreign dictator.It gives a much more balanced look on how the war was fought and can give much understanding also to the development of the cold war and also understanding on what can be seen as a Russian obsession with the war.After have studied this documentary and read books in the subject one have no doubt anymore that the war affected the Russian people hardest of all nations.A brilliant historical documentary at its best!
