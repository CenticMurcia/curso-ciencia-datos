This film cannot be beaten in terms of action. Bruce Willis will always be remembered for starring in this. And rightly so, it is a non-stop thrill ride from about 20 min. in until the finish. Having said that, the first 20 min. are not boring, as time is needed to build up the characters. Which is where the other half of this film comes in. The brains.<br /><br />Sure you can have guys leaping from skyscrapers or blowing up buildings, but there has to be a reason for it to happen. Also, unlike most action films, the 'bad guy' is the protaginist, and McClane, the 'good guy' is the antaginist.<br /><br />Anyway, I could've written more, but that's the point I wanted to make, action films need more than just action.
