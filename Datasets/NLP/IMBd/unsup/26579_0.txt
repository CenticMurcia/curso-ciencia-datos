I`ve never seen an edition from TALES FROM THE CRYPT so I can only judge BORDELLO OF BLOOD by its own merits and I`m afraid I don`t have much opinion one way or the other . It`s a camp horror movie featuring a brothel that`s a front for vampires and instantly reminded me of FROM DUSK TILL DAWN but is slightly more enjoyable . It doesn`t take itself too seriously which works in its favour other wise I`d be pointing out plot holes like how come the cops haven`t noticed that many of the town`s male inhabitants have been going missing . I could have done without the sexual innuendo and wise cracks though <br /><br />" I think you`d better step outside "<br /><br />" No thanks I don`t have time for a < Sexual act > "<br /><br />Not sure if I`d be watching the TV series on a regular basis after watching this feature length spin off
