I remember seeing this movie in 1986 when WFLD TV-32 in Chicago was broadcasting the final episode of its old-school horror-movie program, THE SON OF SVENGOOLIE, hosted by Rich Koz. As I said, this was a show known for showing various older (by 80's standards) horror films, so the decision to air a campy foreign superhero movie was just so wacky! I guess the host/producer figured, "It's our last show, we might as well throw them a curveball!" I imagine I basically laughed at all of the things that were unintentionally funny about this film-- the funky costume, escape from the shark, the steamroller that suddenly turned to balsa wood, or the fact that the hero who is called "Super Sonic Man" ends up being vulnerable to a sonic-ray blast (whoops!).. In essence, everything that the first "Superman" film (1978) did right, these guys got wrong.<br /><br />If I could find this on DVD for cheap, I wouldn't mind buying it, but only for the comedy..
