This is a powerful story and a beautiful movie. Worth seeing if you can find it. The photography and the images are stunning. I saw the movie last on a Olympic cruise down the Amazon which made it even more magical.<br /><br />The movie tells the story of Lazaro, son of a priest and a beautiful woman who lived deep in the Amazon jungle. When Lazaro's mother is killed the dolphins raise him and the local Indians begin to call him Dolphin Boy believing he is part human, part dolphin. It is a powerful story of Lazaro's conflicts with society but it is also the conflict between nature and man or progress. As others have commented it is the kind of movie that only comes along once every ten years.<br /><br />If you enjoy the movie you should look for the original book Lazaro by David Kendall. The imagery in the book is so vivid in some ways it is better than the movie.
