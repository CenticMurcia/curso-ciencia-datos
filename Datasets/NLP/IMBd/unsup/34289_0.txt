A action-adventure,crime drama,pseudo-comedy,buddy picture that fails practically at all levels. Robert Hays,whose career had a handful of early successes--the short-lived success of TV's "Angie" and the two wildly funny "Airplane" movies--followed by a long string of films that would elicit blank stares of confusion if mentioned to the average film viewer--"Touched",anyone?--and numerous TV projects that would not last past a year(my fave was the TV treatment of "Starman"),ends up in this flick which really has little going for it except the film debut(?) of Playboy mega-babe and "Baywatch" fixture Pamela Anderson. Her nude/sex scenes along with a very lovingly filmed shower scene with starlet model April Bogenschutz really seem to be all that makes this flick seem watchable. David Keith(here a LONG ways from "An Officer and a Gentleman" and even "Firestarter") as the gruff,angry,hard-bitten cop seems to barely register here. Stacy Keach's usual oiliness is underused here, and the film is set squarely on the shoulders of Keith,Hays and Anderson. It seems as if the writer(s) of the movie,in desperate need of a catch-phrase for Keith' s character,is best able to come up with the "Don't EVER insult my mama!"when a thug or goon he runs into calls him an S.O.B. Not very inspired,need I say.<br /><br />Strictly late-night cable viewing. A cheap rental if you really must see this.
