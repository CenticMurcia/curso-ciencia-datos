I got a chance to see this at CineVegas this year and I have to say I was very impressed.<br /><br />The performances all around were well executed with a standout job by Josh Barclay Caras as Ben. He delivered a subtle performance that embodies the uncertainty of youth, coupled with the desire to fit in and find connection.<br /><br />Writer/Director Carter Smith creates such a wonderfully dark and heavy atmosphere throughout the film. He really does an excellent job of creating a sense of foreboding in unique and original ways.<br /><br />This is definitely a film worth seeing if you get a chance to do so.
