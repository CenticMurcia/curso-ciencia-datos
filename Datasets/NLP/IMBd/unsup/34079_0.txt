My first true experience with Gundam was through the Wing series when it was shown in the US via Cartoon Network. From then on I watched the 3rd movie of the original, Double Zeta, Char's Counterattack, Victory, and a few episodes of Turn-A. And I appreciated Yoshiyuki Tomino's ability to tell a good war-based story (despite the lighter mood in Double Zeta and Turn-A). And my opinion of him didn't change after I found out that Tomino had psychological problems.<br /><br />I started watching Gundam Seed Destiny with the hopes of seeing a "Gundam" title return to its roots. But after episode 21, I lost all hope for anything animated in Japan and having to do with war.<br /><br />Mitsuo Fukuda and Chiaki Morosawa are the two people to blame for this series. How many more "re-cap episodes," rewritten specials, and re-usage of base images must they require in order to be satisfied with their end product? Why make a lead character (who had an actually good story to tell) along with a set of new characters when their next step is to shine the spotlight on the old set of characters? I know the lead singer from TM Revolution had a busy schedule, but why does he have to play some "shining cannon-fodder" who lasts less than 5 episodes?<br /><br />I had my opinions of this series booted off of review sites because of my "bias." But isn't it our duty as viewers of media to commit to some "whistle-blowing" whenever we see something wrong? If a director, producer, and/or screenwriter rely too much on lazy re-caps, re-usage of images, and "specials" based on re-used and re-edited scenes; then one wonders why people like them have been hired or are still employed.
