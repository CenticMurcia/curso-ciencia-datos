Nerdy high school science whiz Barney Springboro (a likable performance by Scott Baio) acquires telekinetic powers after being exposed to an experimental batch of premium grade marijuana. Barney uses his newfound abilities to create all kinds of comically wild havoc which includes helping his hip, wealthy best friend Payton (a winningly breezy turn by Willie Aames) hook up with snarky, yet desirable cheerleader Jane Mitchell (a delightfully bitchy portrayal by Heather Thomas). Director/co-writer Robert J. Rosenthal relates the amusingly silly story at a constant snappy pace, does a solid job of maintaining a light and breezy tone throughout, and tosses in an entertainingly nonstop barrage of admittedly dumb, but still funny lowbrow humor. An inspired send-up of "Star Trek" rates as one definite gut-busting highlight. The prom dance climax which cheerfully parodies the conclusion of "Carrie" likewise hits the sidesplitting spot. The lively and engaging acting from a game cast qualifies as a major plus: the adorable Felice Schachter as sweet school newspaper reporter geek Bernadette, Robert Mandan as pompous principal Walter J. Coolidge, Scatman Crothers as cranky baseball coach Dexter Jones, Greg Bradford as jerky college preppie Robert Wolcott, Sue Ane Langdon as ditsy English teacher Rose Burnhart, and Hilary Beane as sexy secretary Corinne Updike. Roger Bowen and Mews Small are hilarious as Barney's uptight and overbearing ultra-conservative parents. Eddie Deezen has a small role in one of his standard dweeb parts. The gorgeous Jewel Shepard pops up (and out) for a brief, but nice topless scene. Daniel Pearl's slick cinematography gives the picture an attractive polished look. The bouncy soundtrack, the endearingly chintzy (less than) special effects, and several vintage cornball early 80's musical montage sequences all further add to the infectiously goofy merriment. An absolute hoot.
