What is terrific about this film is that it is not a basic blood & guts Lorenzo Llamas story. Llamas actually does a very effective job as an almost naive nightclub manager in Puerto Rico, who soon finds himself in over his head in a cleverly plotted story filled with unexpected twists and turns. I love the photography throughout the film, and particularly the wonderful scenes shot in Old San Juan and the terrific seascapes that the director used as a backdrop. Brenda Strong is an exciting femme fatale and counterpoint to Llamas. You may remember her as "The Braless Wonder" on Sienfeld in which she had a recurring role. She is certainly more than braless in this film! I thought that the supporting cast all fit their roles perfectly: particular kudos to Christianne Gout (what a body); Frank Vincent (everybody's favorite bad guy from Scorsese film fame, e.g. Casino, Goodfellas); and my personal favorite, Daniel Lugo who played a Latin Columbo-type. Overall, the film exceeded my expectations from both story, photography, directorial approach and acting. Afterall, Hollywood doesn't make B-film thrillers like this anymore.
