It is not fact that this movie is just bad that makes me angry and revolted. It is the fact that this movie openly promotes racism, bribery, dishonesty, meaningless relationships and other things that are unacceptable among normal people. But OK, you can't forbid one to state his opinion, it is shocking fact that this opinions target children, young girls who will take this opinions as they're own. It is not strange that US is leading so much wars, that it has so much drug addicts, teenage mothers and so on: when in movies like this you may see that it is normal to bribe people with magazines, video-games and jerseys to win a competition; black people with dreadlocks have never seen computer in their lives; nobles are evil; relationship between 15 year old girl and 22 yearn old boy( or should I say man) is normal and socially acceptable---it is just a step from pedophilia, people. However this movie has opened my eyes in one thing. I now see why Americans have death sentence, just that it is used on wrong people. I frankly don't see difference between "snuff" movies and this movies, for it can have same bad influence on minds of people.
