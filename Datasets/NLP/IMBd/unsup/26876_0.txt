I just bought this 2005 released film ACNE from Go Kart Films on a whim and it charmed the pants off of me! What fun! What creativity and wild energy! The movie is about so many things: Political Corruption, America's hypocritical puritanical stances on everything, anti-drugs legislation, sugar as the opium for the masses... you name it. <br /><br />More than anything... the movie is about old fashioned thrills, suspense, clever ideas and making the audience think while laughing. No doubt the film is truly silly and in no way believable - but once you suspend your disbelief and unbutton your shirt - ACNE really kicks in. I don't want to wreck too much of the plot - I hate when reviews do that. Let me just say - I've been waiting for a bizarre independent film with horror and science fiction elements to come my way for a good while... <br /><br />Note to the viewing public - this film has a very small budget - do not expect Hollywood style sets or slickness. From what I've read about ACNE - it cost $18,000 and was shot on film (amazing). So don't expect massive production values because you'll be cheating yourself and the film - buy ACNE wherever you get your hands on it. <br /><br />Jessica
