I made the mistake of buying the film off Amazon.com. Please do NOT do so. The film is not gated correctly and 1/3rd of the image is cut off, plus there is no soundtrack. This is probably the reason this film is rated so poorly by IMDb reviewers here. I rate it 10 because it deserves a 10 artistically and creatively as a film. <br /><br />The version to get of The Peach Girl is sold off the San Francisco Silent Film Festival website with the Donald Sosin soundtrack, a lovely one, though for some reason toward the end it sounds a bit warped in spots; I don't know why. This print is gated correctly, though still a bit rough going in terms of visuals; the print has a lot of wear. However if you are the kind of person who can see the diamond here hiding underneath the rough, and wish to see one of the most beautiful Chinese silent films ever made, then don't miss The Peach Girl.<br /><br />Lingyu Ruan was so beautiful and evocative as the peasant girl whose life is symbolic of the peach trees in the countryside where she lives. She falls in love with the son of the rich woman who owns the property she and her father and mother toil on, but is betrayed by him when she gets pregnant out of wedlock. Yan Jin gives an incredible performance as the son; his face was expressive and emotional and brings depth to his role. You feel his agony as his mother locks him in his room for months so that he cannot go find his lost love and make it right by her.<br /><br />The title cards are in Chinese and English, and many have decorative backgrounds, always a plus for me when I watch silent films. It adds visual interest to the story.<br /><br />The Peach Girl (1931) and The Goddess (1934) are the easiest available silent films showcasing the loveliness of "the Chinese Garbo", Lingyu Ruan, and both are worthy of your time and interest. It is so tragic that she committed suicide so young. What wonderful performances we were deprived of!
