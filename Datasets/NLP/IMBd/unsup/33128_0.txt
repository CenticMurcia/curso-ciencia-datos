A gay couple (Rex Harrison and Richard Burton) in 1960s England. Burton is a hairdresser (of course) and Harrison is an actor. They complain nonstop, tear each other apart verbally, dress horribly, hate their mothers and are depressed and full of self-loathing.<br /><br />I suppose this was revolutionary in 1969 but it's horribly offensive today. The movie was subtitled "A sad gay story". The script is dull, the film looks horrible and the actors...Harrison minces around and preens so much I got very angry--a sick, disgraceful performance. I heard he wasn't too proud of it either. Burton is actually OK--he brings some dignity to his role. But this film is a total waste of time. It just shows gay men as being pathetic lonely creatures and is very condescending. Offensiveness aside it's sleep-inducing--I kept dozing off! Sick, depressing, homophobic...there's no reason to see this. Makes "Boys in the Band" look like a comedy.<br /><br />Dudley Moore did the music!!!
