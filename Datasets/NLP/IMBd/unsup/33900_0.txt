This is no Spy Game. Picked this movie up by mistake. From the half of the movie I watched, Bill Pullman appeared to have done this film just to pick up a pay check. Maybe if you live in Finland and there is nothing else to watch but reindeer and snow this film will hold your interest. In my case watching a glacier is more interesting then this film. The film Spy Game (no "S") with Redford and Pitt is the favored film.
