This film started off well but went absolutely no where! At times it threatened to get interesting by dropping hints of a twist in the plot but it lacked the guts to follow it through. The film was linear and predictable, at no point did I feel my emotions change. The plot had more loops in it than a sieve and made no effort to explain anything in depth. The acting was also poor, but given the quality of material there was to work with I doubt anyone could have made it better. Time travel is an amazing ability, you would have thought the writers would have been more creative about the possibilities it could afford a character.<br /><br />Avoid this at all costs, there are better ways to spend 2 hours. If I could time travel I'd go back in time and make sure I'd never watched it!
