A surprisingly well written and creative script, which was no simple plot: there are twists and turns, not by pushing or attention hogging actions  the film just flows from scene to scene, be it recounting or fantasizing or in the present. It's really a gem  well-cut and put together with facets reflecting, refracting and juxtaposed -- rich in story tone and colorful emotions (at times sensuous suggestions), and the happenings were all set in and around a leisurely paced San Francisco (in a cafe or a studio, for instance).<br /><br />How attractive and alluring is this picture? Writer-director Alan Jacobs made spending time in a shoe store most interesting to follow, especially we are with Laura San Giacomo. Her pairing with Paul Rhys from Britain was more than suitably matched. In the end, it's absolutely fulfilling: the romance between the two key characters is imaginative and real. This film affirms that love can be wondrous and mysteriously romantic at the same time  you and your partner can be whoever, whenever, whatever you want to make it to be. Love and receive love. Be.<br /><br />Laura San Giacomo was in Steven Soderbergh's 1989 `sex, lies and videotape' with James Spader, Andie MacDowell and Peter Gallagher, and in writer-director Simon Moore's 1992 `Under Suspicion' with Liam Neeson (a very good who dunnit with twists after twists and. . .more). Paul Rhys was in Robert Altman's 1990 "Vincent and Theo" with Tim Roth and Johanna Ter Steege (she was the disappearing wife in George Sluizer's 1988 Dutch film "The Vanishing".)
