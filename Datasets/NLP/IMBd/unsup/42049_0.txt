There is nothing worse than a movie everybody in it knows will suck. No one acts, no one writes anything decent in the script, the sounds are bad, the editing is bad, the camera work is bad. This film is just bad. Forget about horror. There is nothing horrorful about it, only the horrible production that one can hardly name a movie.<br /><br />Let me emphasize this: this is so bad, you can't even laugh at it. There are no ridiculous scenes, because they are too bad to actually laugh at them. This will never be a cult movie, nor will it be something taken seriously by anyone. The budget is so low, that film students wouldn't touch it, so i guess a "film company" tried to sell this piece of crap as a video rental money maker.<br /><br />Horrible! Awful! And average in its awfulness.
