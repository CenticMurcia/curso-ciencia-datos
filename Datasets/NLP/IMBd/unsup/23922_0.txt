AS far as I'm concerned this is Woody Allen at his best story telling about a NYC that we think we recollect from all those old movies. Woody has taken those old movies and with the help of an excellent cast and a twist and dash of Woody Allen's writing we are back in Brooklyn circa 1940. Always a mood lifter. This is on the comedy shelf of my film library.
