Mississippi Burning is one of those titles that despite knowing that it is apparently a modern-classic, I have put off seeing because of the average video cover. Finally, I took the plunge and boy was it rewarding. An inspired story, cracking dialogue, witty humor, Oscar winning cinematography and brilliant acting, especially by Hackman, makes Mississippi Burning a must see. Go rent it now.<br /><br />The Good: The fight between Hackman and Dafoe (shown at 2003 Globes)<br /><br />The Bad: The KKK<br /><br />9/10
