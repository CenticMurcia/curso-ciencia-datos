I have not read the David Leavitt novel on which this film is based, and though I'm certainly keen to do so, I do not believe it would be a prerequisite for any sensible person to follow the storyline or to empathise with the struggles and joys of these characters.<br /><br />Nigel Finch has done a magnificent job in allowing us to study every nuance of interaction between the characters - spoken dialogue is certainly a minor aspect of their communications.<br /><br />This is the only film I know of which deals with angst over what must be a common enough fact of life among gay men and lesbians - that one of their parents is also gay. This angst has nothing to do with genetics, but as shown in the film, everything to do with a culture which stifled honest communication in favour of dutifully mimicking the apparent norm.<br /><br />Beautifully textured in sight and sound - and with superb acting from all players. This is an ideal conversation starter for any husband or wife with some (perhaps unsurprising) news that they need to share with their partner.<br /><br />An especially empowering film for any gay man who suspects their dad could have made some radically different life choices if born in the current age.
