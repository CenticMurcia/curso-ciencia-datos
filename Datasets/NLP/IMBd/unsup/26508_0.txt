A movie that really could have been a lot better. Not all that bad, but far from good. Some of the cast have acting ability, but not all of them are going at full power. Parts of the decor is convincing, but quite a lot of it looks like plasterboard painted flat gray with some extra symbols thrown on to make the whole look futuristic. Some effects are very nice (the holographic display for instance) but some are obviously made on a too-tight budget (the StriKlones) and a lot of them are not at all necessary. The story could stand on its own without most of the explosions.<br /><br />The overall feeling is that if the makers had opted for an existing location instead of constructing one, some more money could have gone toward retakes and actor coaching. A lot of the techno-junk at the end could have been replaced with a straightforward (fire)fight with todays weaponry without sacrificing any of the tension and with much better end results. SF generally works just fine without death rays.<br /><br />All in all, this film is OK if you are trapped in bed (the flu, hangover, terminal boredom) and need some entertainment that won't strain the brain too much. It never achieves "suspension of disbelief" which is crucial in a movie, so it mostly falls on its face when it comes to really grabbing you, and that's a shame since it easily could have been so much better. There is nothing really wrong with the scripted ideas, most of the crew is capable of much more than this and wiser spending would have resulted in a better film. I realize the backers want to see the money end up on the screen, but they should have focused on the acting instead of the "future" angle which really is incidental anyway.<br /><br />Hollywood is always recycling stuff. Lets hope this movie gets remade some day, with different priorities.
