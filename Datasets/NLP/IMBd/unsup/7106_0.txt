I have seen this movie and I found it pretty decent.<br /><br />My father is the forklift driver in the movie. It was filmed in Columbus Ohio and right where my father works. It may not be big budget but it does have a decent plot and storyline. It is full of betrayal and shows you can not trust anyone. At first I only wanted to see the movie because of my father but I enjoyed the film. If you like movies that are crime dramas basically then you will like Bullethead.The dialogue was great in the movie and I found it very refreshing seeing a movie that did not have to rely on a bunch of special effects to captivate the audience. It was a clean true film that reminded me of films from the 1940's and such that drew you into the story and held you there.
