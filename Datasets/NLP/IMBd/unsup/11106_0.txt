I thought this movie was absolutely brilliant. OK, so there are a minor few details that can be touched upon, but the plot is riveting and keeps you on your toes. I thought Brody's performance was extraordinary. I have never seen a murderer portrayed in such a manner, it was very unique. The connection that developed between Brody and Madeline( forgot her real name) was intense, and if you can't see how their deepest desires are somewhat the same then you won't understand the movie. Basically, a good film with good actors, maybe if it was produced by someone else it could have been made into an Oscar winning film.
