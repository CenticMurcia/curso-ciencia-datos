this low budget flick is 10 x better than 80% of Hollywood films out there in every way. the acting is what i love best about this film the lead actor has to be good in a film like this since it focuses on his life and he is almost perfect. the film keeps you on the edge and my only disappointment was the end as i was sad to see it i was expecting a little more. another thing i liked about this is i never got bored even though there isn't that much action it keeps at a good pace all the time.<br /><br />the script is good the directing is good i can find no other real faults with this film i recommend this film
