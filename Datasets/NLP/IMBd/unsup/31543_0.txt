I played a small part in 'Wally Norman" as the bookmaker.<br /><br />Had a blast doing the role and meeting the rest of the cast.<br /><br />As time goes by this comedy gets better.....each time i watch it i see something new.<br /><br />The cast and crew worked so hard on this flick and the movie deserved better at the box office.<br /><br />Seems like the average movie goer here is more interested in the Hollywood blockbuster than the subtle film.<br /><br />This comedy was very well written but not everyones cup of tea.<br /><br />The pub scene when Wally comes back after the goat race was a hoot to shoot with free beer flowing all day.<br /><br />The goat ate the wreath of flowers round it's neck but luckily the cameraman got a shot of it and it was used in the movie.<br /><br />Anyway have a great life everyone.<br /><br />Cheers Paul Makin.<br /><br />ps Singo for PM.
