Hi all, I started watching Kung-fu hustle out of sheer boredom on my flight to Japan. I expected it to be another boring martial arts movie with clich√©d story lines and bad acting. What I found was an amazingly entertaining, crazy, novel story with slap-stick comedy that had me laughing my *ss off loud. Stephen Chow is definitely putting China on the world cinema map with his genre of movies. The action is of course not real and has used computer effects - but I don't believe Chow is trying impress everyone just by having real martial arts a la Ongbak. He is an entertainer like Jackie Chan was in his prime. He even takes a cheeky punt at western movies like the Matrix and Spider-man which is pretty cool. The story of Kung-fu hustle itself is set in a sort of 70's China and people like me who love travelling and different cultures get a real feel of being in China. The story throws up a lot of crazy surprises like that of a children's fairy tale and is very funny and refreshing. I watched Kung-fu hustle a few times now and bought it on DVD and cant wait for his next movie. Kung-fu hustle gets a well deserved 9/10
