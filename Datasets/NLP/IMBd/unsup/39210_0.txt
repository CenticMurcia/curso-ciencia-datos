I was excited to finally see the Russian view on this historical event. But what did I get?<br /><br />The story is a shallow version of a well documented epoch. In this story, that takes place in the 18th century in a war weary Europe, the Polish and Russian countryside are overcrowded by busty beauties, brutal and horny soldier of Charles XII and two french noblemen caught in the middle of two armies. It's beautiful filmed but... thats it. Stereotyped and full of clich√©s. The swedes got their asses kicked, but not in this way.<br /><br />Now and then I thought I was watching a danish soft-core comedy from the 70s.
