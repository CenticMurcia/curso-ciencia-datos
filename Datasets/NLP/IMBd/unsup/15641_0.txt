This cheap poverty-row movie would be forgotten today if not for the pathetic performance of Rondo Hatton, suffering from the bone-deforming disease of acromegaly. The producers of this movie were basically too cheap to create a monster so they decided to use a real one, except that it could not act. It's amazing that not only this film but also HOUSE OF HORRORS tried to make a horror star out of this stiff. Strictly for freak-film aficionados only.
