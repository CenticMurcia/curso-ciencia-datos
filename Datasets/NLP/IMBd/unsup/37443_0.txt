Dark Ride is the story of a group of friends on a road trip who decide to take a detour to visit an amusement park called, fittingly enough, "Dark Ride". Of course, a murderous psychopath just happens to show up the same night (who would have guessed it?).<br /><br />Dark Ride is a film that is full of clich√©s, presumably in some kind of homage to the '80's slasher films, but it just doesn't work for me in this one. The dialog at times is ludicrous. I didn't like any of the characters and we've seen them all before in so many other films (by different names perhaps). There were a few jump scares, a creative killing or two, and some interesting props.<br /><br />Overall though, while it might be worth a watch once either on TV or at a friend's (when they've rented it), it's not one that I would generally recommend.
