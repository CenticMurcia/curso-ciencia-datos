"Candy" is more of an oddity than a movie. A truly dreadful piece of film. I was initially drawn to it because of the involvement of one of my heroes, Marlon Brando, and after seeing it the first time, I thought, "What were they thinking?". Having said that, I must admit that over the years, it has become for me what some critics call a guilty pleasure. Some of the performances are absolutely hilarious. John Astin, Richard Burton, Walter Matthau and James Coburn are all memorable. Even Mr. Brando (who in his memoirs said that he was never good at comedy) is funny as hell! I disagree with Mr. Brando. He's made me laugh in many movies. Watch "Bedtime Story" to see what I mean. I couldn't resist buying the collector's edition DVD of "Candy" but I still have to give it a 1 on the voting scale. The only reason I'm rating it so high is because IMDb doesn't give you a lower choice. It's so bad it's good. If they had just included some good nudity, the movie might have had some socially redeeming value.
