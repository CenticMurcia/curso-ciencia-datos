The problem with plot driven movies is that they are confined to the plot. Any and all plot driven movies (movies that rely on plot instead of character to tell the story) must stay within that plot. Jurassic Park must always involve dinosaurs. Bringing Out the Dead must involve ambulance drivers. Die-Hard must involve terrorists. This is not a bad thing. All of those movies I mentioned above are great movies, but they are plot driven. <br /><br />It is nice, however, from time to time to see a character driven movie. A movie with no gimmick, no real plot, only characters that tie it together. These movies usually have more than one main character, lots of dialog, and most importantly, they can go anywhere. The characters can jump in a plane and fly to Antarctica if the want to. It is this feeling of open-ness that makes such movies feel so good. As Good as it Gets is one of these movies. Because the movie is character driven, we feel anything can happen.<br /><br />As Good as it Gets has some of the best characters I have ever seen. There is no real plot. If I had to say what the plot was I would say it's about a crazy jerk who tries to change himself. But that doesn't even come close to describing this movie. <br /><br />One reason why I love this movie is that I can really identify with the main character, Melvin Udall, played with shear brilliance by Jack Nicholson. You see, I am a little obsessive-compulsive. Not enough to warrant medication, just enough to know I have it. As I have said before in other reviews, I love movies about crazy people. And Melvin is about as crazy as they come. I can really understand why he locks and unlocks his door ten times overtime he comes home. I can understand why he wants to have the same waitress serve him breakfast every day. Obsessive-compulsive people love routine and if anything gets in the way of their routine, they feel violated. They not only want everyday to be like the last, they need it that way.<br /><br />The acting in this movie is the best I have ever seen in one movie. The cast was perfect. No one plays a better lunatic than Jack Nicholson. The man is so good mer words can not express it. Helen Hunt is great as the cruel, stressful yet sensitive waitress. She deserves the Oscar for this and she has become one of my favorite actresses. Cuba Gooding Jr. has a small part, but he works it beautifully. Greg Kinnear is great as the sensitive and confused gay painter. Even Yeardly Smith (who some of you may know as Lisa from The Simpsons) is good. That just shows how good James L. Brooks is. He assembles on of the greatest casts ever and he directs them with grace and beauty.<br /><br />Speaking of James L. Brooks, he and Mark Andus have made on of the funniest scripts of all time. This movie has some of the best one-liners I have ever heard (most of which come from Melvin). The dialog is great. This is some of the funniest writing I have ever heard.<br /><br />Example: <br /><br />Melvin- Never, never, interrupt me, okay? Not if there's a fire, not even if you hear the sound of a thud from my home and one week later there's a smell coming from there that can only be a decaying human body and you have to hold a hanky to your face because the stench is so thick that you think you're going to faint. Even then, don't come knocking. Or, if it's election night, and you're excited and you wanna celebrate because some fudgepacker that you date has been elected the first queer president of the United States and he's going to have you down to Camp David, and you want someone to share the moment with. Even then, don't knock. Not on this door. Not for ANY reason. Do you get me, sweetheart?<br /><br />The movie even reminds me of The Simpsons. James L. Brooks is a producer for that show (which in my opinion is the greatest show of all time) and As Good as it Gets is filled with the same sudden, jab to the head type humor of The Simpsons. No, there is no other similarity, it's just that both seem to have the same comic timing.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is one of my favorite movies and is definitely a classic. I normally hate softy romantic movies. The only thing is As Good as it Gets is anything but a softy romantic movie. Sure the movie has romance. It is, mostly, a love story. But it is NOT soft. It is very hilarious. Melvin is a cranky, brutally honest, meticulous, eccentric man and it is hilarious to watch him. I recommend this to anyone. It's a sweet, intelligent, deep, fresh, funny, and original movie that will continue to entertain me for years to come. <br /><br />Normally, I believe that every one has an opinion. If I like a movie and you don't, so be it. But, if you don't like this movie, well, I can say with APSOLUTE accuracy that you have no taste. Sorry, you don't.<br /><br />9/10
