From my personal experience, most independent films these days tend to be overly preachy and showoff-ish. It's almost as though the new blood directors are shouting "look at me" rather than "look at my story." When I had an opportunity to watch "Praey" I was pleasantly surprised. Refreshing young director Tiffany Sinclair has laid out a fully developed story with mostly fully developed characters. I won't bore you by trying to tell the plot, quite simply the tale centers on a woman with a mission, seeking revenge on a sordid villain, while meeting all kinds of creepy and/or angelic characters along the way. Somewhat derivative but never rote, the story mixes unequal amounts of drama, terror, gore and the supernatural and winds up mostly satisfying to fans of each genre in the end. Sinclair adds just enough spooks and scares and unexpected twists to make the proceedings feel fresh and inventive. Sinclair herself and Prawin Adhikari are the actors to watch and both give excruciatingly believable performances that should have you cringing in pain right along with them. The rest of the cast is not as memorable but are about par for these shoestring productions but rarely, if ever, negatively impact upon the audience's enjoyment of the story.<br /><br />You may not recognize the name Tiffany Sinclair just yet but she has put plenty of potential on the screen with "Praey" and you should hear a lot from her in the near future. Her deft use of an intimate but non-intrusive camera and her ability to get compelling performances from her cast should make Sinclair a hot commodity.
