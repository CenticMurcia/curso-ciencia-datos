I saw this at a preview and it is complete and utter tripe. If I hear one more critic praise this 'film' for 'its depth of characterisation' I will eat my own head. Not good, not good at all. I can say however, that Edinburgh looks fabulous, but then it always does. The story lines are predictable, clich√©d, and very dull - throw in a priest/actor with serious misgivings about his vocation, a couple of likely lad Irish comedians, a bit of gratuitous homosexual sex, a ditsy blonde with useless jokes, and a weedy leading lady trying to 'act' and you have a recipe for an absolute turkey. This is one I won't be returning to for the leftovers... it should have left in a car park it certainly doesn't deserve your hard-earned cash. I'm just glad I didn't pay to see it.
