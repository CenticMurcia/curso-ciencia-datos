Sure, I sound like I don't know what I'm talking about, but I do trust me. The only real reason everybody is hating on this film is because it's a DTV movie. But you could watch it and not know that at all because it's just about as good as other Action movies currently out there. <br /><br />Now, I know Wesley Snipes has been losing most of his appeal due to questionable roles and the recent bombs "Blade: Trinity" and "Unstoppable ( A.K.A. 9 Lives )." But I saw him in this film and a film, that has yet to be released in the U.S. called "Chaos." <br /><br />Anyway, this film never lets up on the thrills and is probably worth seeing for anyone into Crime Thrillers as well because this film is all about heists, car chases and back-stabbings. If you're not into that sort of thing thats been done before in "Ronin" and "Ocean's Eleven" then you won't find anything different here. <br /><br />For fans of the last two films I mentioned, you might find your needs satisfied here. Director Simon Bellows uses slick video-editing and electronic music to accompanie the martial-arts and gun battles & he does a solid job w/ what he has to work with. <br /><br />Beware, even though I saw this on USA cable network edited, it is still a pretty violent flick w/ suggested sex & f-bombs ( I could tell what they just said even though it was bleeped out on regular T.V.) so I recommend this for more mature viewers. <br /><br />Rent it or watch it when it airs on T.V. because it's a decent hour-and-a-half of your time.
