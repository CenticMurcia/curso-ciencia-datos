John Carpenter did amazing things with little money and a lot of imagination. "Escape From New York" crosses almost as many genres as "Dawn of The Dead". It's an odyssey, a comic book, a western (in the East), a black comedy, an operatic nightmare, a sci-fi cautionary tale, an "audience movie"... It's a showcase for underutilized talent. Utterly creepy, funny, bleak and suspenseful with rich characters, memorable dialog and stimulating visuals. Oh, and that wonderful cast! That wonderful score! This gem will never truly get the praise that it deserves. Also, are there any doubts as to where James Cameron got the inspiration for his "tech-noir" look for "The Terminator"? Sure, we all know Jim worked on this movie, as we know from whence Carpenter drew many of HIS inspirations. But there's nothing wrong with giving credit where it's due. Notable standouts: Harry Dean Stanton's delivery of the greeting, "Gentlemen. Mr. President.", as he walks into a room of the Duke's filthy, thrift-store attired goons and the camera pans over to the president adorned with a blonde wig. Frank Doubleday as Romero. (What a classic entrance/introduction!) He looks like the Heat Miser from that Christmas TV special but solidly establishes the inmates as horrific androgynous, diseased cannibals. Ernest Borgnine, successfully topping his portrayal of Mr. Rogo from "The Poseidon Adventure" with his performance as Cabbie; simultaneously hilarious and tragic.
