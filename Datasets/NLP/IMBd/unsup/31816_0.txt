You can hate me or you can love me all you want for this review. At the end of the day, all that should matter is your opinion.<br /><br />Grease is not just a 70's fancy musical, it is a symbol to an era, an era when you could make a musical that had enough character to be great.<br /><br />Today there is High School Musical, Rock Camp etc. I have been fortunate enough (sarcasm) to watch all of these musicals, and I can't even begin to explain how much I hate them. They lack of two basic things, originality and being fun. And what a coincidence! because those are both of the mayor elements that makes Grease such a great movie. <br /><br />Released in 1978, Grease left a mayor print in the whole world. Well, there are many movies that have done that, so why does Grease stand out more? Honestly, because the film wasn't that good.<br /><br />I mean think about it. What is the plot in this movie? a guy that spends his whole high school year trying to get back together with his summer love while doing annoying things along the way. Not much of a plot is it? And the moral? being a jerk who gets into fights, ignores his friends and doesn't do anything at school will help you turn your summer crush into a smoking cool girl who ends up with you in the end despite all the times you tried to get into her panties? Not a very great moral, in fact, most of High School based movies usually have the cool guys being the bad guys and in the end they lose. <br /><br />So by now you might be saying, How can you say at that this movie is great and then trash its plot and moral? Well, if I may continue, I'd have to say that the greatest thing about this movie, is that you don't really care for the plot or the moral. You watch this movie, and you have FUN!<br /><br />The songs are great, the dancing is great, the humour is great and you'd think that without a plot the movie could be impossible to watch, but no; you are so entertained while watching Grease that you wouldn't care if someone's child dies in the middle of the film. By the way, for all of you who haven't seen the movie, that doesn't happen.<br /><br />Yes it's very corny, the actors that are suppose to be in their teen years look like they're thirty and the character development is not very deep. But I'll say it again, you WON'T CARE! and that is why this movie is considered to be one of the best musicals of all time. It manages to take the incredibly picky movie critics out of us and makes us sing and dance along with it, WITHOUT COMPLAINING!!<br /><br />Nowadays, directors have tried to create a musical which has the same power as Grease. Most of them have failed miserably to try and hide the lack of plot or horrible acting, leaving them as cinema failures who only the eight year old girls will like. HSM and many others may have a great commercial success for kids, but its Grease which truly makes a cheesy school musical enjoyable for the whole family.<br /><br />Grease was, is and shall always be the word<br /><br />10/10
