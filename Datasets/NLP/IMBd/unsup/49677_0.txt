I don't know why this film picks up 2 these 2 Asian actresses to play the most important roles? because they are Asian looking? Because of low budget? Or may be the producer doesn't care what a real Chinese looks like.<br /><br />Frankly, i don't finish this movie. but If there is something positive to say, it's the Veronica Sywak. She looks very pretty, and did a good job in the movie.<br /><br />Well, this film is made for people, who cannot distinguish Asian countries. I suggest the people who interest in the topic - human traffic, to see the film Trade.
