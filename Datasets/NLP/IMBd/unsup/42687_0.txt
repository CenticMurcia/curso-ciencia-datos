I loved the first movie. This sequel is a joke, and not at all frightening. In a couple of places, the audience burst out laughing that's how believable the plot was. How could the writer, director and production people think we could buy this supercilious, ridiculous screen play. Acutually, I take it back about not being scary. Sissy Spacek was a horror to behold and laughable at the same time. The whole new explanation for Samara's diabolical antics made the audience groan with remarks like -- ah comon now! And at the end, I heard a some of the audience say, That's what you said last time. I suppose The Ring Three will consist of Aidan's murder trial.<br /><br />Take my advise and wait until it comes to TV. I wouldn't even pay the money to rent the video. It's not worth it.
