This was just another horrible horror film that made no sense in the long run. After a half hour I wondered if it was gonna go anywhere. It had a couple of creepy looking scenes and that was it! Most of the computer generated characters looked so FAKE it was hilarious. Did anyone else think the deer scene was outdrawn just a bit, yeah we got the idea...END IT! They discarded the whole premise of the story after the first 15 minutes, the tape if you're wondering. I was bored of the story way before it got close to ending. Please if the sequel is not gonna connect with the first film, don't make it. This was just a complete upset and the acting was something to be desired. I was very disappointed and I can honestly say this is probably where the rest of these horror films are sadly headed towards...disaster!
