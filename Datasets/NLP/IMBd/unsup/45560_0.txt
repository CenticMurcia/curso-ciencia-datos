It could have been so much better, if this lame courtroom comedy had a decent script and at least some inspired jokes. But as it is, lawyer Jeff Daniels and actor Michael Richards accidently switch roles and have to handle a difficult case and two female interests. The latter are charmingly played by tough, but pretty Jessica Steen and gorgeous and likeable Charlize Theron. And even the judge is played by comedian Austin Pendleton. But Jonathan Lynn, who was responsible for the hilarious courtroom comedy that was MY COUSIN VINNY doesn't succeed here. Still, it's not a total BOMB, and Rip Torn is a funny bad guy.
