A harmless bit of fluff, best consumed with pizza and cheap beer. This low-budget movie is a carbon copy of 1,000 other unmemorable late-80's/early-90's flicks. It's a cute, naive little flick with no blood or violence, a little bit of simulated sex, and many a boob-shot. Vacuous, yes, but worth watching for those who enjoy the occasional Charles Band/Full Moon flick. The cinemotography and sound leave a lot to be desired, but the best cinemotography wouldn't exactly have made this a masterpiece. Don't take it seriously; the director certainly didn't.
