Before watching this movie/ or whatever u call it. My no 1 alien movie was in confusion between these few titles i will mention. War of the worlds(2005) , Altered(2006), Contact(1997) Close encounters of the third kind (1977). I love complicated/hanging (sort of unfinished business type) endings in a movie.<br /><br />But after watching this 1, i fear meteors and the possibility of an intergalactic war far more worse now. Giving me the creeps and chills every now and then when i go to bed (it just wont go off).<br /><br />This 1 is very well done.So bold, so direct, the fact that everything was happening so fast in the movie without breaks was So SCARY!. Forget about the acting.. this movie took me on a deep journey that i felt acting wasn't necessary anymore in alien movies. The story and the idea deserves an Oscar.<br /><br />Came across it a little bit late as it was released in 1994. But well worth it in the end. Therefore this is my no.1 alien encounter movie undoubtedly for now and for a long time to come. Didn't even need fancy CGIs or Alien costumes. Nowhere to be seen yet so disturbing.<br /><br />Wud recommend this to any sci-fi fan. 10/10
