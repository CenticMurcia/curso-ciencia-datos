Two words I would use to describe this film and one of the main characters , Bishop. Unless you know what is going to happen beforehand, you will not know what direction the film is headed in. It's starts out like a buddy movie, with four guys bunking off school hanging out together, then it becomes a film about whether one of them, Q, should concentrate on his DJ career, or allow himself to get drawn into petty crime by the group's charismatic leader, Bishop.<br /><br />*SPOILER* Here we get another shift in the story as Bishop for some unknown reason becomes bent on indulging in his violent tendencies at the expense of sanity and friendship. Personally I would have liked a bit more depth into Bishop's character as to why he behaves as he does. But from watching the film once, there are some clues in there, such as the speech he gives after watching the film White Heat. So I can only assume that the filmmakers wanted to keep this subtle and keep the viewer guessing.<br /><br />Juice is a very watchable film, with the type of meandering plot that would make Werner Herzog proud, and it rarely fails to maintain your interest.
