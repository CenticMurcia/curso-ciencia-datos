This is one of the most illogical TV movies ever made -- and that is saying a lot.<br /><br />(1) Some of the actors play their parts straight, and some play their parts like baffoonish clowns. (2) Pick-pocketing is ethical. (3) Our hero sees a bike stolen and sold for cash. The bike is gone, but he catches the thief with cash in hand, but he does not attempt to claim the money. (4) Closet light bulbs remain switched-on 24 hours a day. (5) City people leave their apartment without locking their apartment door which has many deadbolt locks begging to be used. (6) An income is needed to live in an apartment, but it is assumed that no income is needed to buy and run a house. (7) Decorations are purchased for a Christmas tree that does not exist. Later, at the drop of a hat, a police officer-wanna be steals a Christmas tree. No one in the world would know this would ever happen except for the writer of the movie. (8) Throughout the period the lead female characters desire to escape, they do not do so. For example, at one point the police guard wanna-be guy has both of his hands handcuffed to a handrail inside a bus. He is locked up and has no key, but no one escapes from him. (9) A violent child snatcher is released only because the movie needs him to snatch the child a second time later in the movie. (10) A silly man wearing a cast and a thick Santa's suit spends most of the movie outrunning assorted adults only two or three feet behind him.<br /><br />The only good part of "On the 2nd Day of Christmas" is the vigilant perfume sales lady on duty in the department store.
