This is the only DVD I have had so far that I have not managed to watch all of (and I've had Alone in the Dark!).<br /><br />After an hour of this American fool yacking on about how great he is and how well he can teach these children (apparently by shouting at them, humiliating them and being generally abusive)I couldn't take any more.<br /><br />It is simply one guy on an ego trip, he even states that he hates it if any of his pupils get better than him.<br /><br />A complete waste of time, would not have been made if it wasn't for the success of School of Rock, and shouldn't have been anyway.
