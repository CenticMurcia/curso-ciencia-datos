I have never been compelled to write a comment about a movie before this, and in fact, the very first comment I ever saw on IMDB for this movie (at the time, it was the only comment and is now the last comment) was pretty spot on (the one where the person saw it with Finnish subtitles). However, now that his comments have made it to the back of the queue, and since I just saw this movie AGAIN on TV (on the Action Channel) a few days ago, I thought I'd chime in. The comments about this movie having the feel of a bad porno are spot on.<br /><br />I have not seen Gigli, and probably never will, but I can't imagine it is NEARLY as bad as this movie. Like the subject says, I have seen A LOT of movies, and none have been even CLOSE to this bad.<br /><br />That said, this movie is like a trainwreck. It's so horribly bad, you can't turn away. I even encourage my friends to see it. It's horrific on every level, yet somehow compelling!
