I did not watch the 2002 MTV Movie Awards, but when I downloaded this 3-minute spoof from Kazaa, I found myself strangely entertained at this little piece. Yes, I agree, at times it can seem a little tasteless and lame but the quality of the editing and the snippets cut from the original movie was so clever and smartly put together that I couldn't help but laugh. The performances by Jack Black and Sarah Michelle Gellar were also funny in contrast to the seriousness of the other actors. I recommend this to all LOTR fans, as well as anybody else. This is a must watch!! However, if you don't like offensive material, then think twice.
