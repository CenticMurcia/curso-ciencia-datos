This is a film that has not much going for it. The main actors are to old to play students. That is why they are totally unbelievable.<br /><br />Antonie is a good actor, but here he is wasted. Chantal Janzen should give it up, just like that Beau van Erven Dorens guy. The film has similar story lines from other dutch films. Nothing is new, and the jokes are nothing special.<br /><br />Only Daphne Bunskoek is fresh in this stale film.<br /><br />This film was a disaster at the box office, cause it was produced for a rather large amount of money. On DVD it is worth a look , if you can watch it for free that is.
