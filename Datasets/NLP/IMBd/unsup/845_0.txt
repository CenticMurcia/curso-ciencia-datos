This is probably my favorite movies of all times and I would love to be able to buy it. If anyone know how to get this movie please let me know and if it is possible please put it where I can buy it as I would love to see it again and if not please let me know when they show it on T.V so that I can watch it again. When I first saw this movie I was 12 years old and I would come home from school and run to the T.V. and look for it again and find it and watch it again. I must have seen it every day for at least a month.If you have missed this movie please try to watch it. It has comedy and romance in it and it is really a cute movie.If I tell you any more it will ruin it for you but this is one of the best movies I have ever seen in my opinion.
