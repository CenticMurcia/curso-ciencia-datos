May contain spoilers- Starts out very similar to Friday the 13th (flash back to a year when something bad happened at a camp). Very bad acting, low budget (sometimes not a bad thing), horrible music, and even worse plot. <br /><br />I found myself asking if it was a Lion's Gate film because of the the horrible films they have been putting out but to my shock it wasn't. This movie was horrible. Blood color was very off, death scenes totally lame with nothing new to offer. <br /><br />This movie ripped off other films in attempt to appeal to people who like the horror genre of the 80's. Unfortunately it was a total waste of time, DVD's and money. I can't even believe this film was distributed! <br /><br />Really is a very bad, lame movie. No originality except possibly the end- which by the way STINKS! They say the good movies leave you wanting more and this one makes you wish there was never one to begin with.<br /><br />Save yourself and avoid this one.
