I'll make this as painless as possible. This is the worst Mel Brooks film I have seen in a long, long time. "ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS" is a masterpiece, compared to this forlorn mess. I laughed only once during this corny hodgepodge of backfires, flat gags, unfunny dialogue and terrible English accents. This is tragic, as we've seen so much better from both Mr. Brooks and Leslie Nielsen. This is so disappointing, considering the days when Brooks wowed us with "BLAZING SADDLES" and the horror genre send up of "YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN." <br /><br />I couldn't in good conscience recommend this. Should you stumble upon it on broadcast television, find the remote quick.
