Partly a promotion for the Muppets' MANHATTAN movie and partly an extended onstage-backstage Muppet Show, this TV production features a fair number of reasonably clever, unpredictable gag lines along with the usual stuff. Once or twice the program lags when a musical number has little special to offer aside from the merits of the music itself and the novelty of being performed by Muppets, for example "Act Naturally" by Floyd and Janis. I guess this is reasonable, as on the regular Muppet Show, because the songs may not be very familiar yet to the young audience. On the other hand, quite a bit of the GO TO THE MOVIES humor is pitched to an audience old enough to recognize references to Ingmar and Ingrid Bergman.
