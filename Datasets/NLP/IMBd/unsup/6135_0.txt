Dominick Dunne does UpperCrust Sleaze better than anyone...Next to Dunne, Dynasty looks tinny and Judith Krantz like a social climber. Dunne KNOWS. So you've got a witty script with some fine performances, gorgeous backdrops, and - did anyone notice? - the singer on the soundtrack is Marilyn Monroe. Peter Gallagher handsomely carries the lead, and Joseph Bologna gets another chance to show that he's one of our most underrated actors. Jill Eikenberry chills as the wife of tycoon Jason Robards, and her composure while some characters expire is right out of Stanwyck/Davis territory. But it's Rebecca De Mornay's show, and she's moving and poignant as well as sexy. Paxton Whitehead does his patented snob number, and Elaine Stritch gets a star turn that won her an Emmy. So why isn't this gem of a miniseries on DVD?
