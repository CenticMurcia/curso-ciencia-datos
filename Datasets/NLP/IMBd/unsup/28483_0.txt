This is a gritty, seedy, film noir that can be ranked with the best American Noirs from the 40s. It is interesting for many reasons:<br /><br />the post-war Japanese mind-set of the characters.<br /><br />A handsome young Mifune(but already very good at seething, glowering, and ranting:"WEAR THE DRESS!")<br /><br />The plot that parallels the cop with the killer, psychologically. It's very well done.<br /><br />Visually rich. Location shots, tracking shots, compositions, all very nice.<br /><br />I liked this one more than "Throne of Blood" but I'm a big Noir fan. There are some scenes that go on too long, and the first half is a bit slow. But the last 20 minutes are perfectly orchestrated, with beautiful tight editing and small visual touches. The final meeting between the cop & criminal at the train station is a classic sequence.
