Let me start by saying I love horror movies and independent films. I enjoy bad horror movies, because they are often funny. But this movie has no redeeming qualities, other than the fact that any other movie I ever see will be better than "In the Woods." This movie is more like a soap opera than a horror film, with characters that are even more one-dimensional than in day-time soaps. The whole idea of how the monster (which looks like someone spent about 5 minutes making) came to be is totally ridiculous. The acting is terrible (and I'm not talking B-movie bad, but more like cue-card reading bad). No one in the movie ever even seems scared. This movie is so boring, pooly made, and most of all, POORLY WRITTEN, that I wish I could get my rental fee and 90 minutes of my life back. This script should never have been written, no less developed into a feature-length movie. I can't believe that anyone could have accidentally made such a bad movie. More unbelievable is that someone actually released this on video and DVD. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE. This is not the good type of bad horror movie. This is just a very, very, very bad movie.
