(Just finished the series in S.F./Oakland bay area channel 32 - KMTP (KMTP). On the 4th of July.) WOW! I was always reminding myself that she'll be OK, so calm down. (I looked up two sites to help me):<br /><br />1. The Chicago Korean Drama Fan Club at:<br /><br />http://deiner.proboards48.com/index.cgi?board=daejanggeum - excellent site!! <br /><br />2. http://hkadb.net/info/Jewel_In_The_Palace - details of each hour.<br /><br />The subtitles are fantastic and clear. The details of all the characters is again fantastic. The cooking and medicine details are amazing. Her adopted parents and friends are priceless. THE WHOLE SHOW IS FANTASTIC!!! <br /><br />Being 2006, I'm sure, I'm the last to find this "jewel" (sorry - could not resist) it did first come out in 2003. Hope more are as lucky as I am, and find this great series.
