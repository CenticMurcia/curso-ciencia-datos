I really enjoyed this movie. It had all the aspects you could look for in a action epic movie. The CG was very well done and highlighted the intense scenes between the main character and the Morwen. I really recommend this for a night of popcorn and great excitement. Jim was believable as the hero, not to mention he's not that hard on the eyes :) Sophia Myles was fantastic as always. Somehow she is totally believable in every character she portrays. In conclusion this movie was like Alien/Brave heart/Predator/and Lord of the rings all in one. Some may find it hard to conceptualize but those with imagination will fall for this one. 9/10!
