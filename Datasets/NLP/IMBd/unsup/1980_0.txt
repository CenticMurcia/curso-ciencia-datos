i put his movie into the queue. i was really looking forward to it since it got votes. <br /><br />Sadly,like all Spanish, Hispanic, Latin stuff, this movie is overly dramatic and overblown.<br /><br />just look at aldomavar movies like "tak to her"<br /><br />every emotion is jetted like an a-bomb. it is similar to "I have a hangnail, so i will rip off my fingers".<br /><br />the love affairs cause grand Mal seizures in the lovers. type of reaction to situations. so if you go in for cornball over the top emotional hooey.<br /><br />this is your movie. interesting topic poorly written and acted.
