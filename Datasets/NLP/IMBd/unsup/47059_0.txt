one word describes this film "rubbish" if you've got a couple of hours to kill, please do something else rather than watch this sad excuse for a screwball comedy.<br /><br />There's no plot to the "film", Sanjay Dutt's character is extremely annoying far more than the Aussie chap in Salaam Namaste.<br /><br />I came away with a bitter taste after having watched this, surely the actors read the script before even agreeing to appear in this film? Forget get "straight from Cinema to DVD" It should be straight from cinema to the dump.<br /><br />Totally unforgettable rubbish.
