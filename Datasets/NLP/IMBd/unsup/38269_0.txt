Can you make a film as bad as this? This is a film made by vacuous brain for the mentally retarded with an open mind. A film without consistency, without history, in which characters are fake, some comic situations pretending to fear. A movie that replaces the dialogue non-existent by noises to which most unpleasant and not come to story. A film bad, bad, bad to save credits and little else. Please no more movies like this which is a catalog of what imperfect, a manual of what not to do in the movies.Could be a few teenagers in college so stupid, drug addicts, mentally retarded, with so many traumas fools? If this is so poor and poor college students. But is there anyone who will explore thinking about the future? It seems that the only thing important is the alcohol, marijuana and sex and little else. Poor teenagers who have to be better this movie whose name they can give you is that is bullshit about the size of a piano.
