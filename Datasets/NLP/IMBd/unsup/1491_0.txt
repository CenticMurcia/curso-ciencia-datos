The Glass House was recommended to me by a friend when I first saw it. I automatically mistook it as a cheesy mild thriller that probably not many people thought was a good movie. Since it was my friend, who has extremely good taste in movies, I decided to give it a try. When I read about who was in it, my excitement went up and I got higher expectations of what kind of movie it would be. I LOVED this movie! Everything about it was great. Leelee Sobieski plays an amazingly great part in this non-stop entertaining hit that made me proud. Everything was tastefully done and well though out that I am ashamed it didn't do as well as it did. Their house and how it's positioned is just beautiful while at the same time creepy, and how all the lines in the movie were so tastefully said made me give this movie the rating that I gave it. It was thrilling and effective, astonishing accomplishment in my book...
