Adam & Evil starts as a group of high school friends intend to celebrate graduation by driving to some old camp & spending the night there, while stopped off at a bar the local Sheriff Earl (Jodie Graham) & his wife Maureen (Alison Warnyca) warn them that the camp they are going to was once the site of grisly murders but they should be OK anyway. Not put off by the reputation of the camp the friends set their tents up & start partying, however someone intends to crash the party & kill all the guests as Seth (Kevin Robson) has his throat slit. When his body is found the friends panic & try to find help but are unsure of who to trust as the mysterious killer continues to bump them off one by one...<br /><br />Known under the title Halloween Camp 2: Scream If You Wanna Die Faster here in the UK this Canadian production was written, produced & directed by Andrew Van Slee & one has to say that as far as low budget teen slashers go Adam & Evil really isn't that bad, it sure ain't no masterpiece but but it was a lot better than I had expected. Adam & Evil most resembles a Friday the 13th (1980) or The Burning (1981) rip-off with teens being killed in & around a camp, the identity of the killer is kept a mystery until the end when there's a twist & the killer is revealed although one has to say the title sort of gives away who it is. The film doesn't feel too long, the character's are slightly better than usual for this type of film, there are a couple of OK kills & the basic who did it murder mystery while not groundbreaking will probably keep you watching & guessing until the end I suppose. Of course Adam & Evil is far from perfect, it's very unoriginal & the basic idea has been done to death & if the motive for the killer was revenge why did they kill the woman at the diner, the Sheriff & Maureen none of who had nothing to do with what happened previously? I expected a lot worse to be honest & maybe that's why I am being generous here but I think horror & slasher fans might find something to like here, don't expect a masterpiece & I am sure that Adam & Evil will pass 90 odd minutes for you harmlessly enough.<br /><br />The kills are alright & at least there's a bit of variety between them, in a moment that looks like it could have come straight from The Burning a guy has his throat slit with a pair of garden shears, a couple are impaled by the neck when they have an arrow shot through them, someone is stabbed in the stomach with an axe, there's another slit throat, another arrow death & some more blood splatter along the way. There's a little sex & nudity but not much. The film looks pretty good actually although there's not much tension or build up to the kills & they do tend to come & go a bit suddenly.<br /><br />Apparently filmed in Los Angeles & Vancouver in Canada according to the IMDb which I find hard to believe, why would the film need to be shot in those two locations? The acting isn't great as expected but the cat try & they are attractive enough to take your mind off their acting abilities.<br /><br />Adam & Evil is a moderately effective teen slasher, sure there are loads out there already & this is far from the best but likewise it's far from the worst. I thought it was alright, nothing more nothing & less really.
