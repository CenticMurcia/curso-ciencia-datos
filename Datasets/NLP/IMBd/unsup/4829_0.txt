I honestly don't know if this movie was intentionally this bad, but my gut tells me it wasn't. As an action flick it's really quite horrible but once you watch it you'll be rolling on the floor with your sides splitting from laughter! It's hilarious! Some of the worst stunts and effects EVER, not to mention a ridiculous plot. A must rent for anyone looking to poke fun at one of the few genuinely serious movies that can be so bad it's good.
