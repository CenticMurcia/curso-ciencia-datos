I just saw Richard Williams' Oscar-winning but made-for-TV version of A Christmas Carol on Google Video. Having seen and heard so many versions over the years, I find this the most beautifully animated version with its illustration-style renderings of London and its people in the 19th century. As compelling as the drawings are though, I find the story at 24 minutes a little too short for my tastes so the transformation of Scrooge at the end is not as complete as I would like it to be. That said, it was nice to hear Alastair Sim once again portray the lead character as he had done in the 1951 version. As the Cratchit family and Tiny Tim have said over and over again, "God bless us everyone."
