saw a sneak preview of this film yesterday in mumbai There are some "cheesy" moments but I'm happy to say that they are far and few between.<br /><br />The acting is not academy-award winning but you will be pleased with the performances.<br /><br />It is an engaging film that brings you into a dark and gritty underworld that actually can feel quite real at times. You feel for the lead character.<br /><br />One of the strengths of this film is character development.<br /><br />It also has some twists that may actually surprise you in a good way.<br /><br />I think the real downfall of this film is that it has a "Hollywood" ending. For me the film loses points for this.<br /><br />One final note: the climax, although still good, was pieced together in such a way that it did not hold the tension enough for the theater audience. There was laughter and some heckling in my theater.<br /><br />I wouldn't walk into this film expecting a ground-breaking film that will change the genre forever, but it is does have some good pacing and the story moved al
