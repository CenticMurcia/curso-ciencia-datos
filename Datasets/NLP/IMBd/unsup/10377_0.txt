ALthough I can't say that Heidi's story ever really interested me that much, this television movie killed whatever glimmer of interest I might have had.<br /><br />I could make all sorts of observations about how the writers, actors and director had no clue of how to make this story resemble... well, a story, however, suffice it to say that the care invested in the production of this film is evident in the total lack of any pretense to recreate the period of 1987 to 1993 when the film is supposed to take place. Apparently whoever did the costumes wasn't alive then, because there was no attempt to find any clothing for the actors that actually resembles the fashions of that era, and sorry, but Cyndi Lauper and Blondie were not hot singers in the late 1980s or early 1990s, in fact, their careers were dead. Well, so was this movie, dead boring.
