I remember how excited I was to see Ram Jaane, I was thinking to myself "This movie is definitely going to rock like all of Shahrukh and Juhi's other films; I can't wait to see it!" But I was WRONG... Ram Jaane ended up falling way below my expectations. The story itself isn't really that exciting or on the other hand that boring, you could say it's about average.<br /><br />Also, Shahrukh and Juhi weren't even together at all in this film! I know that SRK was in love with Juhi in Ram Jaane, but she was interested in some other guy which practically took out all the fun of the film itself! As for the acting, I'd have to say that Shahrukh had done a fabulous job playing his role and Juhi did a fairly good job at playing the role of Bela.<br /><br />I, myself as a fan of Shahrukh-Juhi was really disappointed after watching Ram Jaane and I know that many of the other SRK-Juhi fans were let down as well.<br /><br />All in all, Ram Jaane deserved a 4/10!
