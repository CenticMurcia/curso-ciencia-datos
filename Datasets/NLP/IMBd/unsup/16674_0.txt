I detest slapstick and even as a child I could never understand why an audience laughed when people got poked in the eye (the unspeakable Three Stooges), fell down (the mawkish, tiresome Charlie Chaplin), or ran into and destroyed things (the ineffable Ritz Brothers). This is the only movie I have ever seen in my life where I not only thought the slapstick was hilarious (trying to impress the blind date), but it made me laugh out loud---something I don't think I've done more than two or three times in watching a movie. This is comic perfection from beginning to end, and not even the dismal, dislikable, annoying Diane Keaton (what IS it that is so off-putting about her?) could hurt it. Allen, in addition to his many other talents, is a brilliant actor-comedian. His characterizations are so good as to transcend acting---it is as if one were watching him being secretly photographed from real life. I don't know another movie actor I can say that about.
