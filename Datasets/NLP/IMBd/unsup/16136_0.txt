The language and obscene gestures used through out the movie, do not make this one suitable for children under the age of 13.<br /><br />It starts when the main character meets Bingo with delightful screams of "HOLY SH__!" and screaming matches calling each other "Chicken SH__!" as well as the Parents bickering like 10 year-olds and giving each other the finger when they turn their backs.<br /><br />Some of the humor is suitable for young adults and adults but small children should not see this one.<br /><br />As an adult I found the language offensive and it did not add to the movie's value one bit.
