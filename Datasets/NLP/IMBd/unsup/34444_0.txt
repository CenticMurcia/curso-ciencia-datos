I don't know how this movie could have been worse. I gave it forty minutes, and then walked out. Perhaps the 2nd half of the movie got better, but it wasn't worth waiting to find out.<br /><br />I didn't think much of MI-1 (the stunts were just too much, way too much), but hoped they would have figured things out for II. It seems that this time around, they were shooting for an action movie (something for the boys) with an embedded love story (something for the girls). That few action-packed moments I did see had the main character taking unthinkable risks, and falling in love with the female lead within moments of first seeing her.<br /><br />I hope this movie isn't indicative of what's coming this summer!
