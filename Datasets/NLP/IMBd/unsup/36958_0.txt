I didn't have high expectations of this "straight to DVD" release, filmed in Vancouver and featuring the Hansons, but no other talent from the original, impeccable "Slap Shot". I rented it, made my way through it and shook my head at the lack of wit, the lack of atmosphere (the original made you feel you were living in a down-at-heel steeltown) and the homophobia/sexism. The "F" word is bandied about liberally, but it wasn't an organic part of the script, just an add-on to gain an R rating. The Hansons are clearly trying to keep their careers going, despite being rather long in the tooth. Don't talk to me about Baldwin's performance, either. This feels like a TV movie with some swearing and T&A glued on.
