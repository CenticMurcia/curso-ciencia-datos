William Powell and Myrna Loy, a great movie team starred in this 1940 farce about a man who gets clobbered by accident at sea and reverts back to a former life.<br /><br />William Powell gets clunked and so do we as we have to watch this nonsense.<br /><br />Frank McHugh is in this too and he is great in his drunkard scene, but once Powell tries to save him and gets hit, McHugh becomes his partner in crime as they together with another person shall try to bilk the town of a lot of money.<br /><br />There is also Powell marching with a group of boy scouts in the woods. I thought he'd get clunked again there and go back to his previous ways. This didn't happen there but he gets hit by the partner when love conquers all and he decides to quit the scheme when he falls back in love with Loy.<br /><br />Bring back those Thin Man mysteries. Asta, too.
