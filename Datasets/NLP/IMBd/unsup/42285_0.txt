On the face of it,a team of police officers going undercover in a local firm together evidence and one of them getting the buzz for the violence is a good idea.<br /><br />Put into practice by this film, the idea is completely wasted.<br /><br />Having read some of the comments about this film ie how it shows what goes on at an unfashionable London club proves how such a badly researched film can be dangerous in giving a false idea of football and it's followers, well or badly behaved.<br /><br />I support an unfashionable London club and can say that even in the really bad old days it was nothing like this. I thought Green Street was a bad enough inaccurate portrayal but this pushed the limits of belief just too far.<br /><br />The "firm" just didn't look the part, and the scenes in the pub were just surreal to be polite. What on earth was going on with the fire eater? And who wrote the chants? Why not just use real chants? We are expected to believe that one of the under covers lives on the manor with a wife in the police who goes to work from home in uniform? Is he going to make such a mistake that his thug mates are not going to see this or pop round unexpectedly? The film is so full of holes it is incredible. I can't believe some think this is so true to life! Whoever researched this appears to have just read Daily Mail type exaggerated reports to scare middle England and used that as their ideas of how it is or was. Well it is and never was anything like this.<br /><br />The film is absolute junk and not worth the talents of some of the people in it.
