Even by the lowest indie movie standards, this is a piece of total excrement, made occasionally bearable only - and ONLY - for the occasional flash of flesh of Matt Austin. This is the kind of stereotypical film which gay media should denounce for what it is: a bit of eye candy in the midst of an implausibly tragic and ridiculously predictable story, with bad actors (excruciatingly bad in most cases) in a screenplay that almost seams dreamed up by the Christian Right rather than the egregiously untalented (not to mention unattractive as a "leading man") Gregory Christian (producer, director, writer, and star). Did it wreck Austin's legit career, or is he doing porn someplace? Now THAT I'd pay to see!
