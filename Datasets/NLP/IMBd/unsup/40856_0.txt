Please make Jason Friedberg & Aaron Seltzer stop doing movies. Forever.<br /><br />I've had it with them trying to ride on the "Scary Movie"'s success wave.<br /><br />According to how awful their last 3 movies are, its pretty obvious that the "Scary Movie"'s films were a success thanks to the Wayans brothers, and not this pathetic duo...<br /><br />Watching their movies is worst than torture.<br /><br />When I've watched this movie, I had no idea how bad its going to be, right into the first 5 minutes. When it reached the 15th minute mark, its gotten so unbearable that me and my friend, who was watching it with me, just decide to stop it right there and play another one instead.
