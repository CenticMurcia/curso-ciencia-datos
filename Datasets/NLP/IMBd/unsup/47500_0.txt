***Tip: Have It Read To You, Heres How***<br /><br />1) Copy And Paste This To Notepad (NOT WORD) 2) Go To.

This was what Manhunt was like for me. I seen it in the shop and thought "Wow, that looks like a game aimed a cult movie fans, with a feel of films like 'Man Hunter' or 'The Warriors'" and to be fair I don't think I was TO stupid for thinking this, mainly down to the fact Man Hunter star Brian Cox was providing the voice of a sadistic director.<br /><br />I didn't buy the game from day one for some reason, but I did intend to play it at some point. It was actually when I watch The Warriors on DVD with some mates that I decided to exchange an old game for this which was about £15 at the time, and in true cult style surrounded in controversy. Everything about this game looked so cool, from when it told me to set the screen to get the "BEST EXPERIENCE" and that it was set in a city at night. However once I got into the game I had in theory finish unwrapping the paper only to find that I had got some socks and underwear, and seeing as I exchanged for it I couldn't take it back. So it was a case of *Fake Smile* and "Thanks For This Wonderful Present, Its What I Always Wanted".<br /><br />To me it feels like Rockstar realized that the game play was sluggish and rather than scrap the whole thing decided to do was singers do when they have a terrible song, make it so it gets band (Well Almost).<br /><br />I could just see them in the offices now...<br /><br />"Sir its about the game Manhunt" "Whats wrong with it" "Well, theenemies AI..." "Is that all" "No there's also the sluggish combat, poor graphics, repetitive game play, its boring and when you get into a fight you just end up taking turns hitting one another till someone drops, should we scrap it?" "No, I've got a better idea..."<br /><br />Then after adding about 100 swear words and tons of gore we got Rockstars Manhunt.<br /><br />To be honest I thought that the story was ace, the idea that you are being hunted by an entire city was awesome, it felt like I was going to play a video game based on 'The Running Man' but the game play just plain sucks. For one each level is just the same in that you kill everyone in an area and then move on to another, like all video games the enemies start of weak and then end up being Hard Ass's. This gets very boring when you realize there its a trick to killing everyone which is, hide in the shade, tap the wall and make the enemy come to you and then wait for him to turn away so you can make your move. Another thing that ticks me off about the game is how little verity there is, its feel like it is one plate of peas trying to feed 100 people. <br /><br />The enemies AI is like that of a SNES game, but maybe even a little worse. For example if you get seen and then subsequently chased all you need to do is hide in the shade, you don't even need to worry about them if they see you go in there as they will just wait for a few seconds and then say "Well, I guess that it was nothing" HOW CAN IT BE NOTHING, I WAS JUST 5 SECONDS BEFORE PUNCHING YOU IN THE FACE!!! At least in Super Mario the enemy knew to walk back and forward, they even frightened me more.<br /><br />I did like that the game have great voice acting from Brian Cox, who was not only menacing but also side-splitting funny in parts. Like when a member of Cash's (the guy you play as) family gets shot in the head, you hear<br /><br />"Ow no, thats just to bad"<br /><br />OK when read it might seem lame, but its not so much what he says its how he says it.<br /><br />In conclusion I can't think why any cult fan would what to buy this when the awesome Warriors video game is out there, maybe for about £5 its worth it to hear the genius of Mr. Cox, the saving grace in this pair of socks.
