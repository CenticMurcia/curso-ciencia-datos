It could have been a great movie, all the elements were there: an interesting story, intriguing characters, beautiful landscapes. Yet something was missing. Inspiration and talent, maybe? For two hours I was waiting for this movie to surprise me (you can guess what the mystery is rather quickly) and move me, and was disappointed. I wonder if anyone is thinking of remaking it...
