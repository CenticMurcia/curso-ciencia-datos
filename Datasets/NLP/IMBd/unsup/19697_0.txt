PEYTON PLACE has had quite a reputation as a book and a movie. The movie is BASED on the book, and is NOT the book. In my opinion, the film is much better. Attitudes have changed and I can imagine what the film would be like if it were re-made. What was implied in the book would be glorified on the screen. Besides, the film makers of today can't hold a candle to the film makers of yore. Small town scandal has been a topic for movies forever and a day, but none better than PEYTON PLACE. The acting is first rate, especially by DIANE VARSI; HOPE LANGE and LANA TURNER in the lead female roles. The male roles are a bit underdeveloped and LEE PHILLIPS seems a bit off as Michael Rossi. However, the more I see the film the more he grows on me, as does the entire film. The location sites are great as is the cinematography. The lush score by Franz Waxman really seals the films brilliance. This movie must be seen on the wide-screen with stereo sound for the full impact and appreciation. PEYTON PLACE clocks in at 2 hours and 37 mins., but could have been longer. The only distraction is the rear projection for Lana Turners exterior scenes. It's quite obvious she did not go on location. There are even doubles for her in the long shots. Besides these minor distractions, PEYTON PLACE is a must repeat viewing again and again. A shame the career of Diane Varsi stalled so quickly after three more films. I went to school with her sister, Gail, and I'm know she would have gone on to stardom if she had the chance. She was equally talented.
