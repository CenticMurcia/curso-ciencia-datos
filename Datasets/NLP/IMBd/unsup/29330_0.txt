This is what I call a move made for fun. There's nothing serious about it. But there's some very good reasons why anyone should see it:<br /><br />1. The plot is crazy and very good (though not really original) 2. The movie is beautifully directed by Sam Irvin. 3. The characters are funny as hell. 4. And last, but NOT least, there is an incredibly beautiful blonde in this movie, Alexandra Mutu. She is awesome, really.<br /><br />I think these reasons are enough for anyone to watch this movie. For it is just better than so many comedies out there.
