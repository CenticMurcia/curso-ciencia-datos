This movie is the "Showgirls" of science fiction. It's so bad, it's like a universal constant. Like mathematics or physics or something. There's not even any nudity to balance things out. No good acting, no good story, no boobies. <br /><br />Suffice it to say, the writer/director ripped off all the bad parts of both "The Terminator" and "Robocop". This thing makes those godawful films from India look like high art. At least Bollywood flicks have good dancing. If you MUST see this movie, see it with a bunch of your friends. You might want to consider voluminous amounts of alcohol or possibly a few bong hits to stay interested. There's no reason to torment yourself alone with this thing unless you're a complete masochist. <br /><br />After you watch it, sit and think about the fact that someone actually put up MONEY to shoot, edit and release this thing. On top of that, some poor slob had to sit and watch all the footage and edit something interesting together. Imagine the crap that wound up on the cutting room floor. The mind boggles.
