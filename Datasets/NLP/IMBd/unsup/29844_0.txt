I could not understand what this picture was about. It has something to do with the relationship between 2 brothers and their deceased mother. One brother is interested in outer space and the other is a weatherman on TV. If there is a plot to this picture it went over my head and apparently others as well because some of the audience walked out during the picture.<br /><br />This comment requires 10 lines of text but there is so little to say about this picture that I can't think of that much text. Certainly this is one of the most boring films I have seen in years. It is hard to understand how this film made it into any movie theater.
