What's this? Ann Miller playing a singer (with vocals obviously dubbed, I've heard her singing voice in MGM musicals, and this ain't it) instead of a dancer? Seems like an odd casting choice. She plays a runaway singing star on a wacky road trip with a reporter who's initially only interested in her for the story/reward money, but (I trust I'm not spoiling anything here, as the outcome is very predictable) ultimately falls in love. <br /><br />Sound familiar? Substitute "singing star" with "heiress" and you've got the basic premise of "It Happened One Night"... minus Frank Capra's directorial magic, Robert Riskin's witty script, and charismatic stars like Gable & Colbert.<br /><br />If you've never seen "It Happened One Night"... go see it first! But if you happen to see "Eve Knew Her Apples" first... just don't, okay!? But if you *do*, you might find it a pleasant diversion. Fans of the far superior film will probably feel nothing but dismay and disgust.<br /><br />How blatant are the thefts? In the end, Ann Miller's character dumps her wealthy fianc√©, and William Wright, when questioned as to whether he loves her, steals Clark Gable's line, "YES! But don't hold that against me, I'm a little screwy myself!" <br /><br />Oh my. Such direct theft only invites unfavorable comparisons. And Wright is NO Gable. I'm amazed the writers of "It Happened One Night" weren't given any credit here. Perhaps they were indignant and didn't want to be associated with a tacky rip-off of their classic? Perhaps Columbia simply felt entitled, since this studio released both films. But there's a reason nobody's heard of "Eve Knew Her Apples".<br /><br />I could make some cracks about studio heads being such SNAKES, and how SINful it is to produce a cheap imitation that taints a beloved classic - but you get the idea.
