OK. i watched this movie just today with my friend Irene and my sister Jessica. when the movie started it was obvious it was a low budget movie. we rented it and thought that it would be a scary movie because the back said something totally different from the movie and looked scary. the tacky music and the Chinese writing was.. totally wrong. it didn't even go good with the movie. I Don't think anything will go good with this movie. i honestly hated it. i laughed throughout the whole movie! and the part where Dave falls out of the window with the doll... wow. can you say bad graphics!? it showed a BARBIE DOLL flying through the air. i mean. dude. I Couldn't stop laughing. this movie was weird. and every time it said somebodies name... that person has sex with the doll. i mean. man o man this movie is not scary at all. it is a horrible comedy. and man o man. ha-ha wow i still cant stop laughing.
