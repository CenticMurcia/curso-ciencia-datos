Well, what a waste of 90 minutes. Some of the worst acting you would ever want to see (particularly the waitress who was Peralta's girlfriend - this would be an example of overacting at its absolute worst) allied to inept, wooden screenwriting. Its sole redeeming feature is a nice twist in the story but the ending is lame. If you have anything better to do dont bother watching this movie.
