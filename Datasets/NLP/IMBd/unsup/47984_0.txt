There was a time, I am ashamed to say when I was into low budget cult horror movies. Ah, you might say that is not too bad. Halloween, The Fog. Plenty to choose from. However I did Not Watch these. I saw Critters, and these. Dam.<br /><br />It basically stars Jenifer Aniston as an American City Girl who has gone to the country of Ireland (Original for a Leprechaun movie). there two boys find a pot of gold and keep it from the others. Low Budget, badly acted and directed and scripted mayhem ensues. Ther is actually more mayhem going on of screen than on. It would be fine if it was actually funny, and had been aimed at younger kids, they would have lapped up the weird green man causing havoc. But when it is rated 15/R for good reason (it is bloody in parts), which 15 year old is going to go for this when they could go for all those better films out there? It is not all bad though. Some of the gore is suitable stomach churning, and Warick Davis is not that bad. Leprechaun 2 is worse,and that is rated 18. Don't go see.
