Banderas in the end is CIA and he was working undercover trying to prosecute the other thieves and it was all a misunderstanding and thats also how he got out of the jail in Paris. the movie lacked a sense of excitement and it seemed too predictable and the only unpredictable thing was the fact that Banderas was a secret agent the movie did not deliver as a funny movie but some times it was humorous but nothing too hilarious. So i would call it a average comedy.<br /><br />This is one of the weakest comedies it has ever been my immense discomfort to see - nothing shines - and the target audience is what? Women in their 40s? - I suggest anyone would be just plain insulted by the lack of anything construing the most basic brain food here - there ain't one smart line or original scene - it truly is neither comedy or romance.<br /><br />The only positive is that this is totally harmless and won't offend,but it won't entertain either, it really is lobotomy food...
