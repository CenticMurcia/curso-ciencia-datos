How marvelous to see an entertaining and thoughtful horror film come from Australia! As a regular moviegoer, and an Australian, I love watching all sorts of Australian films. I was lucky enough to see a special screening of lost things last year, which included a discussion with the director and various crew members. I must admit that, at first, I found lost things to be quite ridiculous. Some dialog seemed strange and there were some wobbly acting moments. But quite soon after-wards, I was really drawn in by the stunning landscape, and as the plot began to thicken, I was truly captivated. "Lost Things" was an enchanting experience, and most importantly, it was a horror film which managed to, in some respect, defy the genre, by placing itself in the beautiful Australian beach landscape by day. Also amazing was the twist. A horror film that made me think! Definitely not your usual "slasher flick," Lost things wasn't a "Look Both Ways" or "Little Fish," but was most definitely a considerable achievement.
