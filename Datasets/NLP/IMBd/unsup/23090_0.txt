STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br /><br />I'm rather glad I'm now a member of the internet based LoveFilm rather than still renting films from a video shop, because I'd hate to have to phone up and reserve this film. The day when someone decided to make a documentary about the word fu*k was inevitable one day if you really think about it, and here it is. If only the main contributions weren't from dumb Americans who haven't a clue the word is Anglo Saxon in origin and not an abbreviation (Fornicate Under Command of the King?!?) Although some interesting points are put across, such as the release one feels from using the word and it's traditional use with negativity and sexual encounters. Although most of the talking heads are speaking in defence of the word, a few conservatives put their point across and speak of defence of a society with standards and decency. It's short and is more than satisfactory as a documentary, but as it is even pointed out, c*nt is the word really likely to send shudders down the spine. Why wasn't a documentary made of that? Probably not commercial enough. ***
