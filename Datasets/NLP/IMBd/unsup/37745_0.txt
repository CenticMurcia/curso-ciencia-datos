This movie is just a waste. One of the worst John Candy movies ever made. I don't think I laughed at anything in it. Not the stiff acting, the moronic plot and certainly not any of the so-called "jokes." If this was the first movie for any of these actors, none of them would ever work again. It was so bad that it made me feel sorry for Alan Alda, who I don't think rises to the acting ability of a second grader in a Christmas pagent.
