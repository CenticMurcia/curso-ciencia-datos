Cooper and Widmark come together to share the screen on this fine 1954 western drama. Along with Susan Hayward, Cameron Mitchell and Hugh Marlowe. Three strangers are hired by a woman by the name of Leah Fuller (Hayward) to rescue her husband (Marlowe) following a mining accident. And now Hooker (Cooper), Fiske (Widmark) and Daly (Mitchell) will all slowly learn about each other and are about to get their loyalty tested. The technical side of this film is about as good as one could hope for. Great color, excellent scenery. A very worth-while watch for fans of classic westerns. Fans of Cooper and/or Widmark also would not be disappointed. If given the chance I would rate it a solid 8.5/10, but an 8/10 on here.
