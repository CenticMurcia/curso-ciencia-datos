I've read other viewers' comments and have seen that most have felt the way I have about this amazing cartoon. I know I can relate to others when I state that I thought this show was absolutely terrible when it first came out. I honestly didn't care about this show at all. I thought it was just a waste of air-time. After this show got canned from Fox, it went on to Adult Swim and couple years later I just happened to be watching this show that I used to despise and soon fell in love with it. This show had hit me with its funny scenes and punch lines, the great variety of different characters all with different characteristics, and even some of their serious dialogue. Futurama has such great comedy and it DOES get better and better as the series moves up, as most people say. The Simpsons looks like it's going down-hill as of right now. The writers, in my perspective, are getting pretty desperate.. Too bad The Simpsons are still on instead of Futurama. (don't get me wrong, I still like The Simpsons but.. Futurama > The Simpsons.. am I right or am I right :])<br /><br />Anyway, I regret ignoring this awesome cartoon, only soon to realize this might as well be the best cartoon airing on T.V. The sad part is that I fell in love with this show AFTER it got canceled because I was too stupid to actually give this show a chance... I don't see how my comment really helped anyone out, but I could care less.<br /><br />Hell, I made this account just to comment on Futurama :P
