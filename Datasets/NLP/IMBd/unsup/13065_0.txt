My wife and I were bored. Maybe we were expecting too much: our best married-couple friends had seen the play here in NYC and raved about it. They had also just raved about "Wit", and we loved it. But "Dinner with Friends" had neither the fun nor the insights to do it for us. Certainly, if you're already an HBO subscriber, you ought to give this a shot. But do NOT subscribe because of DWT, and don't rent a tape if it's offered. You've been warned. -SB
