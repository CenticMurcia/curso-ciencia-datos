I did not even know there was a third installment to the Urban Legends series, but after loving the first two, for what they were, and this one being directed by Mary Lambert (who I adored for her work with Madonna and "Pet Sememtary"), I expected a descent movie.<br /><br />Not even close.<br /><br />There was no logical reason behind anything in this film, nothing is explained, and by the end, you just couldn't care less any more. The film wasn't scary, and the number of plot holes and mistakes could fill up the ozone layer.<br /><br />Ms. Lambert should be ashamed of releasing such a piece of garbage...and should learn that if you're going to direct a high-school film about jocks, the guys should be a little more pumps and slightly better looking. When all else fails, eye candy makes even the worse movie bearable.
