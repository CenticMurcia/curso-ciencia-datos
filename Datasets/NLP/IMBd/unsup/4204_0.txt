In Dodge City the legendary duet of Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland is reunited once again under direction of Michael Curtiz after Captain Blood, The Charge of the Light Brigade and legendary Adventures of Robin Hood. The success of the last one was repeated by this remarkable western.<br /><br /> Dodge City is one of many westerns inspired by life and deeds of legendary Wyatt Earp, who appears here under the name of Wade Hutton and is played by Errol Flynn. He comes to a cattle town run by Jeff Surrett (Bruce Cabbot) and finds its population suffering from lawlessness of bands of wild cowboys who simply do whatever they like knowing there is nobody who's got guts to stop them. But it's only until Wade is elected a town's Marshal and takes matter in his fast and skillful hands. Very soon the town becomes one of the safest places in the west. <br /><br /> Dodge City is a genuine classic featuring some of the most memorable sequences in the history of westerns, such as a spectacular saloon fight, many times imitated in later films but never surpassed. It also enjoys a good witty script and wonderful performances from Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland as well as from the rest of the cast. A pure joy to watch. 9/10<br /><br />
