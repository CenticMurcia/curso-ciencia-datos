Most XXX rated movies bore me or disgust me. Which is a shame, because one of the first ones I ever witnessed was Pretty Peaches I... this movie has it all. Granted, it's been over 10 years since I've seen it (though I'm downloading it right now... found it on Sharaza, hence my urge to look it up here), but it quickly became the standard all other XXX movies had to live up to, since (most don't hold my interest for more than ten minutes. Some would say that's long enough ;)). <br /><br />The beginning was enough to hook me; I knew this wasn't going to be your typical hard-core movie (though the uncut version is very hard-core).<br /><br />I remember the accident scene clearly... I watched it with my new wife (our first 'dirty movie' together) and we were both laughing our asses off at the absurdity of it all, but it was good laughter... suffice to say I believe our son was conceived that night.<br /><br />Desiree Cousteau, wherever you are, I'm available now... MARRY ME!!!
