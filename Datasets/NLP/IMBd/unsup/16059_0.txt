I just blew 2 hours of my life watching this wannabe-American Pie. It's hard to even begin to describe the horror of this shallow piece of teenage melodrama. Some movies just should not even be available for the safety of the public's sanity.<br /><br />1) Is there anything redeeming about any character? Main guy, dorky and hormonal with a serious klutziness. Main girl, shallow and cheats on tests. Supporting guy, fat with no hope of ever getting laid and an even worse way with comedy. Supporting girl, even more shallow than main girl who goes after said girl's guy because girls like that just love to be treated like sh*t (DANICA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THIS MOVIE??? FIRE YOUR AGENT!!!!!) <br /><br />2) Ending makes you sigh in relief, it's like the writer realized the last two hours of crap are enough for the poor audience and decided to *boop* end it. Not that I expected something more than that, but why have a sense of reality then? Why not in the first three minutes?<br /><br />3) Moral: eh....uh....mhhhh....<br /><br />4) American Pie began the raunchy teen movie conquest. BTW, why make movies that are so raunchy that only the 17older crowd can see them? These movies don't even appeal to a crowd that has actually had sex without pies, bananas, or wannabe barbie dolls with no acting skill (beg pardon to those of you whose first times really were like this, you have my sympathy). This movie has no scrap of comedy to it and should be burned.<br /><br />5) Sorry, I just like the number 5.<br /><br />In short, I'm sure more people have chuckled or even smiled at this entry than they will at this movie.
