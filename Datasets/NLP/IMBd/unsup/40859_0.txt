Wow. I only have one question...should I call 'this' a movie?? No, I'm being serious. In fact, this totally counts as a pathetic attempt to a funny Scary Movie re-run which was homemade by a bunch of mindless wanna-be-director nerds. I totally agree with it's abysmal 2-star IMDb rating but I fail to understand why it's not in the Bottom 100. Everything about this movie is stupid. The gags were hideous. Not a single point in the movie that I actually found them funn...er..'funny'. But (suprisingly) I actually found one thing funny about this movie. It's the attempts for laughter. The film makers spent like a year pointlessly trying to whip up laughable script jokes to entertain the audience, when in the actual film, they ended up not delivering. How dumb?! And the film characters that they were 'trying' to mock! Narnia, Harry Potter, Pirates of the Caribbean?! I mean come on!! You're just mocking yourselves! Overall, I'll sum it up by saying the film makers wasted a year of their life trying to make this junk and every bad word in this word describes how lame this movie is. One of the worst films I've ever seen. Epic Movie? Should be called Epic Failure!
