I saw "Gefangen" yesterday. I generally don't give much regard to what others may say about a film before I've seen it. Yes, it's true, some of the acting may not be 'world class,' but the film still has a story to tell and, even without the sex scenes, I believe they did just fine. I did enjoy the sex scenes.....and, with all the heterosexual sex scenes in todays films, I would hardly consider this movie "porn." Erotic sexual scenes do not a porn film make. So, if you see this flick without any preconceived expectations and just follow the story, enjoy what you will...I think you will come to the same conclusion as I: It was fine; I enjoyed it. And then move on.
