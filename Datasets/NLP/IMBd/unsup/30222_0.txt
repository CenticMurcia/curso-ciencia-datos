i just saw this movie this Saturday. there was a Spanish film festival in one of the theaters here and i brought my friend along to watch.. the theater was packed, i'm telling you, even if i found that hard to believe, hahaha. the movie was funny, and yeah, charming too. i'm glad i got to watch it, and i hope to watch more in the future. i won't be telling anything more about torremolinos. the user comment was quite useful.. oh yeah, i liked the B&W shots in the carnival that alfredo shot for his movie "torremolinos 73." and one song there, i just can't get it off my mind... the one that goes "carmen, carmen, carmen.. te quiero y lo sabes." it's such a happy song, hahah.
