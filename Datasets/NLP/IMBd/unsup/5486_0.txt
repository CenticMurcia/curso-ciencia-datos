A complete cult film in Spain.<br /><br />I think Alex is one of the most original talents in nowadays cinema. And not only in Spain, all over the world.<br /><br />You have to realize what it means to issue such a film, and what a danger you take. How he uses black humour and keeps tension on every scene is incredible. And he has shown that in every one of his films, specially in The perfect crime (a pearl of how to use black humour), 800 bullets and Common Wealth. These are films to take with an open mind, no previous thoughts of what are you going to find. I'm still surprised at each one of his new films.<br /><br />A masterpiece, but not a film for everybody.
