Going from being Clueless to Illegal, Damon Dash's cousin sure did get a bit nasty in this one. I'll tell you one thing... The VHS is far more different than the DVD... the sex scenes between the cop and the devil in the blue dress are a lot longer. This movie is pretty enjoyable for a cheesy late night masturbation session, but let the truth speak... it's far from deserving an Oscar. You probably won't have to rent this flick... it plays on STARZ all the time, if you have it, and it's the extended version of the movie every time it plays. I actually like this flick, honestly. But it's understandable if many people find this movie hard to stomach.
