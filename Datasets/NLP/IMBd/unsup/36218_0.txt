Normally, I find Vincent Price comforting. He's an old friend that never lets me down. Sure some of the movies he's been in were stinkers but they were always watchable. This film is the exception to the rule and along with Shock, is a film so bad that even Vincent Price can't save it<br /><br />In theory this film is based on the old play of the same name that was a tent pole of the "old Dark House" genre of plays popular in the 20's and 30's. The original play was also the source of two earlier and better screen versions. Having recently watched both earlier versions prior to watching this film I'm left wondering if it wouldn't have been easier to just make something up rather than pay royalties for a source that the filmmakers were going to ignore anyway.<br /><br />This film looks like it was made for TV. Worse, it looks like it was made for the bad TV channel, which people are forced to watch for some terrible crime. There is nothing resembling direction so even the normally good actors like Price and Agnes Moorehead seem to have decided not to show up and phoned in their performances. The script is terrible and takes a perfectly good story and adds all sorts of unremarkable twists.<br /><br />Not worth your time, even to review or talk bad about. Forget it and move on to something else.
