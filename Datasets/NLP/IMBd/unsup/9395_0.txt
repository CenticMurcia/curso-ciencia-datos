I saw this film a couple of years ago as a young teenager. I enjoyed it, and remembered it, but never really realized the full effect of the delightful terror in it. I saw it again today (shocked that I was able to find it at a local library), and I have been totally and completely blown away. This film boasts one of the most imaginative and solid plotlines I've ever seen in a shock flick. In the first twenty minutes, there is really nothing to distinguish it as a "horror" movie, more as a kind of suspense thriller. But the writers take the story into a whole other realm of reality, and this results in the most satisfying and eerily spooky thriller that you can imagine. A rare gem also, in that the film is practically unmentioned now. But despite its age, it surprisingly isn't in the least bit dated or campy, which many Karloff pictures have become, at least in the minds of the more close-minded horror buffs who wouldn't touch a vintage piece like this one with a ten-foot pole. Sad, really. If Hollywood still had the capacity to produce quality films like this, motion pictures would see another Golden Age. At any rate, do yourself a favor and sample this macabre bill of fare! It's almost certainly to be worth your while.
