The humor in this film is much more irony based... the original Lake Placid was intended to be much more genuinely scary, this one will actually provide some good laughs if you go into it looking for the irony not the scare factor.<br /><br />The CGI in this movie is sub-par, but I think that this was somewhat intentional, it adds to the b-movie feel. The movie is not realistic, if it was it would be perceived as taking itself to seriously and would be stupid.<br /><br />Go into this movie looking for laughs and you will get them. Go into this movie looking for scares and you will come up disappointed.
