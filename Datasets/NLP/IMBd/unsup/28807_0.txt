Poor Cary Grant has he got a problem here. An adolescent girl played by Shirley Temple has developed a king size crush on him. And she's the sister of Judge Myrna Loy who Grant had just appeared before. Judge Myrna already has a low opinion of fast living artist Cary who's got a line for every woman and every situation.<br /><br />But when Shirley goes to his apartment because Grant fed her a line about modeling for him and Myrna catches them there however innocent, it's big troubles ahead.<br /><br />However Grant gets a chance to get out of trouble if he can disillusion Shirley about himself. And that's what he has to do in the rest of the Bachelor and the Bobby Soxer.<br /><br />This film comes from the fertile mind of Sidney Sheldon who also had another bachelor/bobby soxer film in Susan Slept Here. But this one is far superior to Susan Slept Here. Let's just say Grant ends up with the right girl in this one.<br /><br />Cary Grant does a lot of physical comedy here, almost as much as he does in Arsenic and Old Lace. In some of his films the secret of the comedy is that the sophisticated Cary does a lot of out of character physical comedy that's a couple steps up from the Keystone Kops. The whole scene involving the town picnic with Grant in a three legged race, a potato spoon race, a potato sack race, and finally an obstacle course is funny in and of itself because it's Cary Grant doing it.<br /><br />Myrna Loy in this film is Nora Charles with a career. And that's a good change for her. She's always a woman with a head on her shoulders and a good brain. But it always seems to be second fiddle to her leading man's intelligence whoever it was. I liked seeing her as a professional career woman here.<br /><br />Rudy Vallee also carries on in the tradition established for him by Preston Sturges's comedies. He's the District Attorney here, a snooty District Attorney as only Rudy Vallee can be snooty.<br /><br />Also giving good performances are Ray Collins and Harry Davenport as Loy and Temple's uncles, Johnny Sands as Temple's would be boy friend and the one and only Veda Ann Borg as a brassy dame as only she can be brassy.<br /><br />One of Cary Grant's best comedies from the Forties.
