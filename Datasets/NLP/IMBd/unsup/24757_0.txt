Interesting to look at. Acting is acceptable. The little friendship that develops between the 2 young people is watchable. The title is a mystery that is referred to a couple of times during the film but its meaning is never made clear.<br /><br />I found myself thinking at the end of the film, "So what was that all about? Did I just waste nearly 2 hours of my life?" I would say that if you are feverish to experience the ruins of Afghanistan and the misery people endure since the war, then you would probably enjoy it. If, on the other hand, you would like some kind of story, I would not recommend it.
