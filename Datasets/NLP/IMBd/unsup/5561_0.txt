I, like this movie, have very little to say about it. It has been done before. In various locations, with a variety of protagonist and with very similar ending. The writing on this one was not very memorable with the one exception of the alcoholic guide played by Eion Bailey. The cinematography was outstanding, great images of one of the United States great remaining natural wonders. <br /><br />That being said, I do wish that the filmmakers had given a little more time to the script and less to the backdrop. While I was watching this movie the one thought that did come across over and over was that of Darwin theory of survival of the fittest.<br /><br />I don't think this movie deserves it's low rating. I enjoyed watching it even if I found it somewhat predictable it did have an interesting ending.
