Altough it may star some hot TV stars, this is a bad direct-to-video sequel (Arriving to video on September 7th). An Army base in the ice gets attacked by demons that torment the cast. Average horror adventure which won't even entertain.<br /><br />Rated R for horror violence, some notable gore, brief profanity and sexual situations/nudity.
