Simon is a computer programmer who is being pressured to complete a code. He begins to receive unmarked, seemingly empty packages from an unknown source. These packages add to his already paranoid state, making him install a high tech alarm system and put pad locks on everything. His only real communication with the outside world is the currier that brings him the items he requests, including milk, which he begins to buy and drink in large quantities. As he looks into who is sending him the packages, he discovers one neighbor is stockpiling cola and making internet "cybersmut" films through virtual reality programming, another neighbor has been using the smut program on a regular basis and is stockpiling juice, and yet another neighbor is stockpiling meat. The movie goes on to make you believe SImon is really going crazy, until near the end they reveal that he is just a very advanced computer, infected with an invisible program delivered through the empty boxes. Simon's creator was also a neighbor who admits to him the glitches in the program have cause him to become sick and the best thing is to end it all. This movie was basically a waste of time, but if you have 2 hours to kill and want something hard to follow to watch, then this is the movie for you.
