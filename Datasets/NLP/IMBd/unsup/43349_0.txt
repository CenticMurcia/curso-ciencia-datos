I hated "Finian's Rainbow." All the songs are forgettable and most of the cast is so-so. Coppola's unimaginative handling of the dance numbers is also a big problem. The material has dated badly too, so the director should not be blamed for everything that is wrong with this production. The awkward combination of preachy social commentary and Irish stereotypes did not work for me. It is Fred Astaire's last musical, and he is good in the starring role, but Petulia Clark has zero star quality (I can see why she never became a major movie star), and Don Francks is an odd choice for a leading man. Tommy Steele is charming, if a bit too broad. Coppola did not learn his lesson (the way he edited this movie is particularly embarrassing), and he returned to the genre in the '80s with two mega bombs, "One From the Heart (1982)" and "The Cotton Club (1984)."
