First I have to ask. Why Studio Tritey loves to hate Russians? I know it is in Russia, but each movie is about horrifying deaths of Russians. This self-hate is not healthy.<br /><br />Russians have to be the biggest idiots in the whole movie, except for Fandorin and Suvorova every other Russian character is either a traitor or an idiot. In reality Russian Forces were far more intelligent and imaginative during the Russo-Turkish War then the movie suggests. The Russian Army outsmarted the Turkish Army when it crossed the Danube at night catching the enemy with their guard down and seizing Russia's 1st victory of the war.<br /><br />Do the writers wish the Turks won the war? Do they sympathize with the Ottoman Empire? If not, then why do the Turks seem like Military geniuses while the Russians look like morons? Osman Pasha's Envoy carries out deadly raids into Russian camps without much opposition. I was very disappointed. I hope 1st Channel never puts its name next to Studio Tritey again.
