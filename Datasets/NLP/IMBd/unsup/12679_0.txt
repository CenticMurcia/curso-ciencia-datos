I don't know where to begin with this awful mess of a movie. I know it's supposed to be "kids and family" oriented, but that shouldn't be an excuse for horrific, irresponsible film making! How do movies like this get distribution?? I have seen first time student films of better quality and production value than this.<br /><br />The story and dialogue is an incoherent mess. The sound editing sounds like a mix wasn't even attempted. The cinematography is less than amateurish, I have never seen so many washed out, overexposed shots in one movie in my entire life. I've seen better acting in soft-core porns.<br /><br />The most disturbing thing to me is that this movie had a 9.4 rating on IMDb, which is the only reason I even attempted to view this disgrace of a film. Granted, it was only out of 33 votes, but I figured if 30+ people had seen this movie and taken the time to go on this site and give it a "10" rating, that it had to at least be worth checking out, even if it turned out to not be that amazing.<br /><br />This is a clear example of friends, cast, and crew of this film just logging on and giving it a "10". Hopefully my vote of "1", and all the other inevitable "1's" to follow from people who unfortunately see this film, bring the average down to a number that accurately represents the hideousness of this disgusting spectacle.
