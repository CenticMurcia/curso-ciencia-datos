Come on, give me a break. You see Route 666 on the sign and you turn down that road? Nobody, even if they are trying to save time, would get on a road with that name. You are just asking for trouble, and the folks in this ghost story got what they asked for.<br /><br />I like Lou Diamond Phillips, even if he'll always be Ritchie Valens to me. I also like Lori Petty and L.Q. Jones. They both keep popping up in movies and TV shows. In fact, the cast in this film has done a lot of work, so maybe you'll find someone you like.<br /><br />I certainly don't have high expectations when I watch a "B" movie, but I hoped to be entertained. This film did that. Sure, you get the same tired clich√©s and some people tend to act like jerks (Dale Midkiff), but the ghost aspect was pretty cool, and added to the horrible deaths.<br /><br />Give it a whirl if you have nothing else to watch.
