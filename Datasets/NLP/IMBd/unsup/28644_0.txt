Hinterholz 8 is one of the best austrian movies I've ever seen, even better than "Indien" or "Freispiel". Roland DÃ¼ringer and all other actors, mostly comedists, acted at their best. A great screenplay and some really funny scenes ("Made in Japan, destroyed in Sulz im Wienerwald") made this movie adorable.
