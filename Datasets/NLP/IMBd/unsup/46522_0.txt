Sorry Pauly, but as much as I would like to see you succeed, your movie was weak, I give this movie a 4/10.<br /><br />The concept of the story - the harsh reality of life after 15 minutes in stardom - is not bad, but the angle the movie went to portray it was terrible. Is the movie a comedy, a drama or what? The funny parts were sad, and the sad parts weren't funny either, but definitely didn't arouse my sympathy. Apart for some mildly funny jokes (the "at least I'm not old Â… touch me my skin is soft" prostitute scene) I waiting for the movie to end.<br /><br />Cinematography, if the movie has any, made my fringe, the screen shots the movie had had no purpose, they seemed like they were planned on the spot. Just like the acting of the movie. I ask myself if any of the actors rehearsed their parts before playing them, even the prestigious actors were easily forgotten, and had little effect on the movie. Good performances need actors who get understand the essence of the movie and probably what happened, along with the fact that the purpose of the movie is vague, was that most of the actors were given their lines immediately before playing them.<br /><br />I rented this movie not knowing that Pauly Shore directed it, if I knew he did I might have not seen it, then again I think he deserves a second chance. However, the only way, the ending of the movie will come true is if Pualy goes to film/acting school and starts from the beginning.
