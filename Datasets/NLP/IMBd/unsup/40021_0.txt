This movie, in my honest opinion, looks like a college film student's project. A majority of scenes are shot on a campus, and the actors are all professors or students. I wonder what kind of grade she was aiming for with those sex scenes? It did not make up for a bad movie concept and horribly cheesy effects. Was anyone scared by the demon? I cannot recommend this movie, it had zero entertainment value, and I was left bored and frustrated at the end of it.<br /><br />*** SPOILER ***<br /><br />Okay, I'm giving away the ending here, but it was a disappointment anyway. Anyone hwo has seen it will likely agree that the ending is probably the least important part. The main character has to defeat the demon, and does so by breaking a mirror? No climax, no logical reason why that made the demon disappear. I was left wondering how that resolved anything, and it doesn't. The movie simply ends with that.<br /><br />I have seen other college student movies that were done better than this.
